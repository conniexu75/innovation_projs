Previously, in appraising the effects of different neurochemical factors that impact upon the solubility of Aβ, we observed that Zn2+ was the predominant bioessential metal to induce the aggregation of soluble Aβ at pH 7.4 in vitro and that this reaction is totally reversible with chelation. We now report that unlike other biometals tested at maximal biological concentrations, marked Cu2+-induced aggregation of Aβ1–40 emerged as the solution pH was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8 and that the reaction was completely reversible with either chelation or alkalinization. This interaction was comparable to the pH-dependent effect of Cu2+ on insulin aggregation but was not seen for aprotinin or albumin. Aβ1–40 bound three to four Cu2+ ions when precipitated at pH 7.0. Rapid, pH-sensitive aggregation occurred at low nanomolar concentrations of both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 with submicromolar concentrations of Cu2+. Unlike Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42was precipitated by submicromolar Cu2+ concentrations at pH 7.4. Rat Aβ1–40 and histidine-modified human Aβ1–40 were not aggregated by Zn2+, Cu2+, or Fe3+, indicating that histidine residues are essential for metal-mediated Aβ assembly. These results indicate that H+-induced conformational changes unmask a metal-binding site on Aβ that mediates reversible assembly of the peptide. Since a mildly acidic environment together with increased Zn2+ and Cu2+ are common features of inflammation, we propose that Aβ aggregation by these factors may be a response to local injury. Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ association with Aβ explains the recently reported enrichment of these metal ions in amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

To this end, we had previously found that Aβ is strikingly precipitated by certain metals in vitro, in particular Zn2+ (42Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H. Paradis M.D. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12152-12158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M.D. Vonsattel J.-P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E.

This is important since zinc and other biometals are concentrated in the brain neocortical parenchyma. A recent study, using micro particle-induced x-ray emission analyses of the cortical and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala, demonstrated that levels of Zn2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ are significantly elevated within AD neuropil compared with control neuropil and that these metal ions are significantly further concentrated within the core and periphery of plaque deposits (46Lovell, M. A., Robertson, J. D., Teesdale, W. J., Campbell, J. L., and Markesbery, W. R. (1998)J. Neurol. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). We have also found that the extraction of Aβ deposits from brain tissue into aqueous buffers is increased in the presence of chelators of Zn2+ and Cu2+ (47Cherny R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Fairlie D. Bush A.I. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 534Google Scholar), providing further evidence that these metal ions participate in the deposition of Aβ within amyloid plaques.In common with the appearance of amorphous and amyloid deposits is the observation that altered neuronal H+ homeostasis may accompany Alzheimer's disease and head injury. AD is complicated by cerebral acidosis (pH 6.6; see Ref. 48Yates C.M. Butterworth J. Tennant M.C. Gordon A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1624-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which may be related to impaired glucose metabolism (49Messier C. Gagnon M. Behav. Brain Res. 1996; 75: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or to the inflammatory response seen in AD-affected brain tissue (reviewed in Refs. 50Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of several bioessential metal ions on their ability to bind and alter the solubility of Aβ1–40/42 under mildly acidic conditions (pH ≥ 6.6) to determine whether there are any unforeseen interactions that may help explain the propensity for Aβ to precipitate under the mildly acidotic conditions anticipated within the metabolically diseased brain parenchyma. A striking and unexpected interaction between pH and Cu2+ was observed for human Aβ.RESULTSTo determine the effect of mild acidity on the behavior of Aβ in the presence of different metals, Aβ1–40 was incubated with different bioessential metal ions at pH 6.6, 6.8, and 7.4 at total metal ion concentrations observed in serum (Fig.1, A and B). Peptide aggregation was measured by sedimentation (Fig. 1 A) and turbidometry (Fig. 1 B), which generally gave confirmatory results. Incubation of Aβ in the absence of metal ions induced no detectable aggregation over the pH range tested. Only incubation with Zn2+ or Cu2+ induced >30% aggregation under these conditions (Fig. 1 A). As the [H+] was increased, all other metal ions induced an observable increase in sedimented Aβ (Fig. 1 A), but Cu2+ induced the most striking increase in Aβ aggregation as measured by both sedimentation and turbidometry. Fe3+induced a marked increase in turbidity (Fig. 1 B), but this aggregate was not as readily sedimented as the Cu2+- or Zn2+-induced Aβ aggregates (Fig. 1 A), probably due to decreased density of the assembly. As expected, Zn2+induced ~50% of the soluble peptide to sediment over the pH range tested, but increasing the [H+] caused a decrease in Zn2+-induced turbidity (Fig. 1 B) which may be due to an alteration in the size or light scattering properties of the Zn2+-induced aggregates. Incubation of the mixtures for 16 h did not induce any appreciable change in the turbidometry readings compared with the original readings (data not shown), suggesting that the aggregation reactions had reached equilibrium within 30 min.The effects of higher metal ion concentrations were also compared at equimolar (30 μm) concentrations (Fig. 1 C). Under these conditions, as the [H+] increased, Ni2+ induced Aβ aggregation (~85%) which was comparable to the effect of incubation with the same concentration of Cu2+. Co2+ induced a comparable level of Aβ aggregation to Zn2+ (~70%) and, like Zn2+, Co2+-induced aggregation was independent of [H+]. At 30 μm, Fe3+, Al3+, and Pb2+ were observed to induce partial (~30%) Aβ aggregation at pH 6.6 but no significant aggregation at pH 7.4.To quantify the binding affinity of Cu2+ for Aβ, spectral analysis was performed. The half-maximal binding of Cu2+for Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 based upon shift in absorbance was estimated as 4.0 and 0.3 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). The stoichiometry of Cu2+ binding to Aβ1–40in the Cu2+-induced Aβ aggregate was 3.4 and 3.0 at pH 7.0 and 6.6, respectively. The stoichiometry of Cu2+binding to Aβ1–40 required for precipitation is in agreement with that required for the saturation of the spectral shift (Fig. 2 A). Cu2+ supplied as a Cu2+-(glycine)2 complex did not alter the amount of Aβ aggregation or binding stoichiometry compared with that induced by non-complexed Cu2+ in the same buffer (data not shown).Figure 2Cu2+-induced spectral changes in Aβ. Data points are means ± S.D., n = 3. The figures are each representative of two experiments.

In the absence of metal ions, BSA aggregation was low (<15%) at both pH 7.4 and 6.6. However, in contrast to Aβ1–40, the amount of BSA aggregation increased only marginally in the presence of Cu2+ at both pH 7.4 and 6.6. Aprotinin was significantly aggregated (~30%) by mildly acidic conditions, but unlike Aβ its aggregation at pH 6.6 was not potentiated by the presence of Cu2+. In contrast, insulin was not aggregated by pH 6.6 or by Cu2+ at pH 7.4. However, there was a marked increase in insulin aggregation at pH 6.6 in the presence of Cu2+, resembling that seen with Aβ1–40.Figure 3Cu2+-induced aggregation of Aβ variants and other proteins. Data points are means ± S.D.,n = 3. The figures are each representative of three experiments.

B, proportion of aggregated human Aβ1–40 and rat Aβ1–40 following incubation (30 min, 37 °C) at pH 6.6 or 7.4 in buffered saline with increasing [Cu2+] (0–30 μm) after centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min), expressed as a percentage of starting peptide (2.5 μm). ○, human Aβ1–40, pH 7.4; •, human Aβ1–40, pH 6.6; □, rat Aβ1–40, pH 7.4; ▪, rat Aβ1–40, pH 6.6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since higher concentrations of Zn2+ are required to induce the aggregation of rat Aβ1–40 compared with human Aβ1–40, we examined whether rat Aβ1–40also was resistant to Cu2+-induced aggregation (Fig.3 B). At pH 7.4, there was a similar slight increase in the aggregation of both human Aβ1–40 and rat Aβ1–40 as the [Cu2+] increased. However, the amount of aggregation of rat Aβ1–40 as [Cu2+] increased at pH 6.6 was less than half that of human Aβ1–40 under the same conditions.We next proceeded to elaborate the effects of [H+] upon Cu2+-mediated precipitation of Aβ over a broader pH range (Fig. 4 A). [H+] alone was sufficient to precipitate Aβ1–40 (2.5 μm) dramatically once the pH was brought below 6.3 (Fig.4 A). At pH 5.0, 80% of the peptide was precipitated, but the peptide was less aggregated by acidic environments below pH 5.0, in agreement with previous reports on the effect of pH on Aβ solubility (reviewed in Ref. 63Soto C.

Zn2+ (30 μm) induced a constant level (~50%) of aggregation between pH 6.2 and 8.5, whereas below pH 6.0, aggregation could be explained predominantly by the effect of [H+].Figure 4Effect of pH on Zn2+- and Cu2+-induced Aβ1–40 aggregation.

Surprisingly, Cu2+ caused >85% of the available peptide to aggregate by pH 6.8, a pH which plausibly represents a mildly acidotic environment. We hypothesize that conformational changes in Aβ brought about by small increases in [H+] result in the unmasking of a second metal interaction site that leads to its rapid Cu2+-dependent aggregation. Below pH 5.0, the ability of both Zn2+ and Cu2+ to aggregate Aβ was diminished, consistent with the observation that Zn2+binding to Aβ is abolished below pH 6.0 (42Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H. Paradis M.D. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12152-12158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably due to protonation of histidine residues.Further elaboration of the relationship between pH and Cu2+on Aβ1–40 solubility (Fig. 4 B) confirmed that there was potentiation between [H+] and [Cu2+] in producing Aβ aggregation; as the pH fell, less Cu2+ was required to induce the same level of aggregation, suggesting that [H+] controls Cu2+-induced Aβ1–40 aggregation. At pH 7.4, Cu2+-induced Aβ aggregation was far less than that induced by Zn2+ at similar concentrations, consistent with our earlier report (43Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H. Multhaup G.

Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar).To determine if this reaction occurred at lower concentrations of Aβ and to compare the effects of Cu2+-induced aggregation of Aβ1–40 with Aβ1–42 (which is not stable in solution at micromolar concentrations in aqueous buffers), we incubated both peptides (50 nm) with various Cu2+ concentrations (0–5 μm), sedimented the aggregated peptide, resolubilized the Aβ pellets with SDS, and visualized the Aβ on Western blots. Increased aggregation of Aβ1–40 was apparent at Cu2+ concentrations as low as 500 nm (Fig.5 A). As previously observed at higher Aβ1–40 concentrations, a decrease in pH from 7.4 to 6.6 potentiated the effect of Cu2+ on the aggregation of Aβ1–40 in this system. Aβ1–42 aggregation followed a similar pattern to that of Aβ1–40, but 500 nm Cu2+ appeared to induce more aggregation of Aβ1–42 than Aβ1–40 at pH 7.4 (Fig.5 B).Figure 5Western analysis of Aβ aggregation at submicromolar concentrations of Aβ and Cu2+.Aβ1–40(A) or Aβ1–42(B) (50 nm) were incubated (37 °C, 30 min) in buffered saline (pH 7.4 or 6.6) containing BSA (0.1 μm) and CuCl2 (concentrations indicated). The reaction mixtures (200 μl) were then centrifuged, and the pelleted Aβ aggregates were extracted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (5 min) and analyzed by Western blot using the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10. A standard consisting of a known amount of synthetic Aβ was also extracted into SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot.

This sensitive technique confirmed that a decrease in pH from 7.4 to 6.6 potentiated the effect of Cu2+ (≥200 nm) on the aggregation of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 6 A). An increase in Aβ1–42 aggregation also was observed with increasing [Cu2+] which also was potentiated by pH 6.6 (Fig.6 B). At pH 7.4, Aβ1–42 was more sensitive than Aβ1–40 to aggregation induced by increasing Cu2+ concentrations in this range.Figure 6Immunofiltration detection of Aβ aggregation at submicromolar concentratio"

The mechanism by which connexin-43 is localized within cardiac myocytes is unknown. However, localization of connexin-43 likely involves an interaction with the cytoskeleton; immunofluorescence microscopy showed that in cardiac myocytes, connexin-43 specifically colocalizes with the cytoskeletal proteins ZO-1 and α-spectrin. In transfected HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitation experiments using coexpressed epitope-tagged connexin-43 and ZO-1 indicated that ZO-1 links connexin-43 with α-spectrin. The domains responsible for the protein-protein interaction between connexin-43 and ZO-1 were identified using affinity binding assays with deleted ZO-1 and connexin-43 fusion proteins. Immunoblot analysis of associated proteins showed that the C-terminal domain of connexin-43 binds to the N-terminal domain of ZO-1. The role of this linkage in gap junction formation was examined by a dominant-negative assay using the N-terminal domain of ZO-1. Overexpression of the N-terminal domain of ZO-1 in connexin-43-expressing cells resulted in redistribution of connexin-43 from cell-cell interfaces to cytoplasmic structures; this intracellular redistribution of connexin-43 coincided with a loss of electrical coupling. We therefore conclude that the linkage between connexin-43 and α-spectrin, via ZO-1, may serve to localize connexin-43 at the intercalated discs, thereby generating functional gap junctions in cardiac myocytes.

We therefore conclude that the linkage between connexin-43 and α-spectrin, via ZO-1, may serve to localize connexin-43 at the intercalated discs, thereby generating functional gap junctions in cardiac myocytes. Gap junctions are aggregates of channels at cell-cell interfaces (1Loewenstein W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 829-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 2Bennett M.V.L. Barrio L.C.

Each channel is formed through the docking of two hemichannels located in opposing cell membranes, and each hemichannel is composed of a connexin homohexamer. By permitting the direct exchange of ions and small molecules between cells, these channels play a major role in a wide variety of cellular processes, including embryogenesis, cellular differentiation and development, and electrical coupling. In heart, gap junctions are a prominent feature of intercalated discs, which connect myocytes in an end-to-end orientation; the coupling provided by gap junctions serves to synchronize the activity of cells, thus providing an isochronous front for the wave of excitation that sweeps through ventricular muscle (4Cole W.C.

Res. 1988; 63: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). How gap junctions are localized at the intercalated discs in cardiac myocytes is unknown, but a component of gap junctions, connexin-43, may interact with specific elements of the cytoskeleton that restrict its diffusion in the plane of the membrane. Recent studies indicate that a number of membrane proteins are anchored by cytoskeletal elements such as PSD-95/SAP90 (6Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), ankyrin (7Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and α-spectrin (8Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). ZO-1, which has been identified at vertebrate tight junctions (9Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), is thought to play a role in tissue compartmentalization and in maintaining the apical-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells. In cardiac myocytes, ZO-1 appears at the intercalated discs in the immediate vicinity of the plasma membrane (11Itoh M. Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1449-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), it is possible that ZO-1 acts as an adapter mediating the anchoring of membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. We recently demonstrated that when connexin-43 proteins are expressed in HEK293 cells, which otherwise lack gap junctional communication, the cells are able to form gap junctions at cell-cell interfaces (15Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This finding serves as the basis for our continued investigation of the functional role of selected protein domains in gap junctional communication as well as the mechanism of gap junction formation. In this study, we examined how the gap junction protein connexin-43 localizes to the intercalated discs in cardiac myocytes. Two assay systems were used to determine the linkage between connexin-43 and cytoskeletal proteins: a biochemical approach involving coprecipitation and binding of tagged proteins and a functional approach involving a dominant-negative assay using a deletion construct of ZO-1. Full-length rat connexin-43 cDNA (16Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) and mouse ZO-1 cDNA (12Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. using mRNA isolated from rat or mouse heart (see Fig. 1). For immunoprecipitation, cDNAs were modified to encode the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies at the C-terminal ends of the proteins. For the construction of rat connexin-43 cDNA, the sense PCR primer was designed to contain the known sense sequences of connexin-43 and anEcoRI site at the 5′-end. The antisense PCR primer was designed to delete the endogenous stop codon in the cDNA encoding connexin-43 and replace it with a FLAG tag encoding nucleotides with anEcoRI site at the 5′-end. Thus, the sequence at the C terminus of connexin-43 that normally ends as DLEI now became DLEI-GSDYKDDDDKN, which binds to a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG antibody. The PCR product called connexin-43-FLAG was excised by EcoRI and ligated into Bluescript KS(+); its sequence was then verified by nucleotide sequencing. For the construction of mouse ZO-1 cDNA, four domains of ZO-1 (d1, amino acids 1–362; d2, amino acids 358–839; d3, amino acids 836–1257; and d4, amino acids 1254–1745) were first amplified by PCR. The sense PCR primers were designed to contain an EcoRI site at the 5′-end. The antisense PCR primers were, in turn, designed to contain the c-Myc tag encoding nucleotides with an EcoRI site at the 5′-end. The sequence at the C terminus of ZO-1 wasGSEQKLISEEDL, which binds to a mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc IgG antibody. The PCR products were excised with EcoRI and then ligated into Bluescript KS(+). After verification of the nucleotide sequences, the four domains were excised and ligated to produce the full-length ZO-1-Myc cDNA using the following endogenous restriction endonuclease sites: AccI (nucleotide 1075) in d1 and d2, AccI (nucleotide 2510) in d2 and d3, andBamHI (nucleotide 3762) in d3 and d4. For the transfection experiment, the full-length cDNA encoding modified connexin-43-FLAG was ligated into the EcoRI site of a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector containing a neomycin (G418)-resistant gene as a dominant selectable marker (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNAs encoding modified ZO-1-Myc and d1 of ZO-1, called ZO-1-d1-Myc, were ligated into the EcoRI site of a pZeoSV expression vector (Invitrogen) containing a Zeocin-resistant gene as a dominant selectable marker. To facilitate cloning, cDNAs encoding cytoplasmic domains of connexin-43 (N, amino acids 1–23; II–III, amino acids 95–150; C1, amino acids 227–382; C2, amino acids 227–302; and C3, amino acids 303–382) were amplified by PCR using sense primers with anEcoRI site at 5′-end and antisense primers with anXhoI site at the 5′-end (Fig.1). Each fragment was excised withEcoRI and XhoI and then ligated in frame into a pET28a vector (Novagen). Clones were transfected into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS; overnight cultures were diluted 1:10, incubated for 2 h, and induced for 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Expressed proteins carrying T7 and His epitope tags encoded in the N-terminal site of the vector were affinity-purified on His-Bind columns (Novagen) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Four domains of ZO-1-Myc (d1, d2, d3, and d4) in Bluescript KS(+) were excised using EcoRI and then ligated in frame into pGEX-3X vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After expression in E. coli DH5α, GST-ZO-1 domain fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (17Meidell R.S. Sen A. Henderson S.A. Slahetka M.F. Chien K.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: H1076-H1084PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts were isolated from 1-day-old HLA-Wistar rats. The ventricular portions were minced, and the cells were dispersed by digestion with 0.1% collagenase at 37 °C. The dispersed cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine and preplated onto culture dishes for 30 min to remove fibroblasts. Cells were then plated on glass coverslips to an initial density of 1 × 105/ml and maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Gap junction-incompetent HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. HEK293 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 vector containing connexin-43-FLAG cDNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. For purposes of selection, the transfected cells were grown in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. Each of the clones selected with G418 was further analyzed by Northern blot and immunoblot analyses. Clones expressing connexin-43-FLAG were then transfected with pZeoSV vectors containing ZO-1-Myc or ZO-1-d1-Myc cDNAs, and the transfected cells were grown for selection in medium containing 250 μg/ml Zeocin and 400 μg/ml G418. Each clone selected with Zeocin and G418 was analyzed by Northern blot and immunoblot analyses. Cardiac myocytes plated on coverslips were cotransfected with plasmid pGreen Lantern-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and pZeoSV vectors containing either ZO-1-Myc or ZO-1-d1-Myc cDNAs at a ratio of 1:5. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the myocytes were examined under a fluorescence microscope to identify GFP-positive cells, which presumably coexpressed ZO-1-Myc or ZO-1-d1-Myc proteins. Transfected GFP-positive cell pairs were then subjected to electrophysiological analysis. Rat cardiac myocytes were grown on glass coverslips for 3 days, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, cells were incubated for 2 h with mouse monoclonal anti-connexin-43 IgG antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Inc.), rabbit monoclonal anti-ZO-1 IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or rabbit monoclonal anti-α-spectrin IgG antibodies (Transformation Research, Inc.). Primary antibody-bound connexin-43 complexes were visualized by incubation with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Vector Labs, Inc.) for 1 h, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Labs, Inc.) for an additional 1 h. Primary antibody-bound ZO-1 complexes were visualized using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Cappel Inc.), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin. Primary antibody-bound α-spectrin complexes were visualized using rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Cappel Inc.). Coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Vector Labs, Inc.). The cells were photographed on an Olympus Provis AX80 microscope fitted with the appropriate filters. HEK293 cells, overexpressing connexin-43-FLAG or connexin-43-FLAG plus ZO-1-d1-Myc, were immunostained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc IgG antibodies (Calbiochem), or mouse monoclonal anti-N-cadherin IgG antibodies (Sigma). Anti-FLAG antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibodies, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin. Anti-c-Myc and anti-N-cadherin antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Affinity-purified, T7-tagged connexin-43 domain fusion proteins and GST-ZO-1 domain fusion proteins were solubilized in SDS loading buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose by electrophoresis. Transfected HEK293 cells were harvested, pelleted with a microcentrifuge, and then incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were then solubilized in SDS loading buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blots were incubated with primary antibodies against target proteins. They were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20; incubated with peroxidase-labeled, affinity-purified antibodies against primary antibodies; washed again; and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells overexpressing connexin-43-FLAG and ZO-1-Myc were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were incubated with 0.1% albumin-coated protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated in a rotating vessel with monoclonal anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with lysis buffer. Samples were divided into three equal aliquots and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG, anti-c-Myc, or anti-α-spectrin IgG antibodies. ECL and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse IgG antibodies were used to visualize primary antibody-antigen complexes. GST or GST-ZO-1 domain fusion proteins (d1, d2, d3, and d4), bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then with binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 5% bovine serum, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). T7-tagged connexin-43 domain fusion proteins (N, II–III, C1, C2, and C3) were purified on His-Bind columns, concentrated using an Amicon concentrator 10, and re-equilibrated to a concentration of ~1 μg/μl in binding buffer. Approximately 100 μl of GST-ZO-1 domain fusion proteins, bound to glutathione beads, were incubated in a rotating vessel with 100 μl of purified T7-tagged connexin-43 domain fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then extensively washed with binding buffer. Finally, associated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblot analysis was performed either with anti-T7 tag IgG antibodies against connexin-43 domain fusion proteins or with anti-c-Myc IgG antibodies against GST-ZO-1 domain fusion proteins. Primary antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using ECL and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse IgG antibodies. Gap junctional current (I j) was measured using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and a double whole-cell patch-clamp procedure (15Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M.

Pairs of stable HEK293 cells, overexpressing connexin-43-FLAG or connexin-43-FLAG plus ZO-1-d1-Myc, were obtained by freshly dissociating pure populations from confluent cultures and aliquoting them onto 1-cm-diameter glass coverslips. Pairs of cardiac myocytes, overexpressing ZO-1-Myc or ZO-1-d1-Myc (GFP-positive), were selected by fluorescence microscopy. The coverslip was transferred to the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope, where experiments was performed at room temperature while exchanging the bath solution (133 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 16 mm glucose, and 3.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). Patch pipettes were made on a Narishige NA-9 vertical puller and filled with solution containing 10 nm free Ca2+ (135 mm CsCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm EGTA, and 5.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). High resistance seals (>109 ohms) were formed on each cell with the aid of gentle suction, and access to the cell interior was subsequently obtained by briefly applying strong suction to the patch pipette. Cells were voltage-clamped at holding potentials of −40 mV, and 10-mV voltage pulses were applied to each cell of the pair. Within each pair of cells, I j values were measured as the currents recorded from one cell when voltage steps (V j) were applied to the other cell. Junctional conductance (G j) was calculated from the following equation: G j =I j/V j. Immunofluorescent localization of connexin-43, ZO-1, and α-spectrin was examined in cultured cardiac myocytes. Immunolabeling of the intercalated disks indicated that all three proteins colocalized in this region (Fig. 2). α-Spectrin immunolabeling also appeared as a striation pattern throughout the cytoplasm. To examine whether connexin-43 forms a complex with ZO-1 and α-spectrin, a biochemical assay involving the expression of tagged proteins in HEK293 cells and the subsequent coprecipitation of these proteins was used. We cotransfected HEK293 cells with pcDNA3 vectors containing connexin-43-FLAG cDNAs and with pZeoSV vectors containing ZO-1-Myc cDNAs. The resultant cell line overexpressed connexin-43-FLAG and ZO-1-Myc proteins, which were detected at cell-cell interfaces by immunofluorescent assay (Fig.3 A). These transfected cells were then solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and the soluble cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc IgG antibodies. The precipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc, anti-FLAG, or anti-α-spectrin IgG antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 B, ZO-1-Myc and α-spectrin could be immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG IgG antibodies, which indicates that ZO-1-Myc and α-spectrin associate with connexin-43-FLAG. Similarly, connexin-43-FLAG and α-spectrin could be immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Myc IgG antibodies. Taken together, these results indicate that connexin-43 forms a complex with ZO-1 and α-spectrin in the transfected cells. To define the regions mediating the association between connexin-43 and ZO-1, binding assays were performed using the batch method and bacterially expressed fusion proteins. Purified GST-ZO-1 fusion proteins, encoding distinct domains of ZO-1-Myc (d1, d2, d3, and d4) and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, served as the substrate for binding purified T7-tagged connexin-43 fusion proteins (N, II-III, C1, C2, and C3). After incubation and washing, the proteins associated with ZO-1 fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblots of proteins eluted with anti-T7 tag IgG antibodies revealed that the C1 and C3 domains of connexin-43 bind to d1 of ZO-1 (Fig.4 A). To determine whether the C3 domain is, by itself, sufficient to mediate binding to intact ZO-1, primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were lysed and incubated with either the C3 domain coupled to His-Bind resin or with His-Bind resin alone. After washing, the proteins associated with connexin-43 fusion protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-ZO-1 or anti-α-spectrin IgG antibodies. The results showed that a 220-kDa protein, which was recognized by anti-ZO-1 IgG antibodies, and a 240-kDa protein, which was recognized by anti-α-spectrin IgG antibodies, were each bound to the C3 domain of connexin-43 (Fig.4 B). Conversely, when lysed cells were incubated either with d1 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads or with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads alone, only a 43-kDa protein, which was recognized by anti-connexin-43 IgG antibodies, bound to d1 (Fig.4 C). These findings indicate that the C3 and d1 domains of connexin-43 and ZO-1, respectively, are sufficient to mediate binding between the two proteins. Moreover, d1 does not appear to bind to α-spectrin. The biochemical approach revealed a direct protein-protein linkage among connexin-43, ZO-1, and α-spectrin, but it left open the question of the functional significance of this interaction. We previously demonstrated that when connexin-43 is expressed in HEK293 cells, gap junctions between transfected cell pairs are reconstituted (15Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using immunoblotting and anti-ZO-1 IgG antibodies, we have now identified endogenous ZO-1 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5). Therefore, we hypothesized that endogenous ZO-1 may play a role in the clustering of expressed connexin-43 at cell-cell interfaces and in the construction of the functional gap junctions in vivo. To test this idea, we used a dominant-negative approach (20Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Biochemical assays had already revealed that the N-terminal region of ZO-1 (d1) binds to connexin-43, but not to α-spectrin (Fig. 4). In an attempt to disrupt the interaction between endogenous ZO-1 and expressed connexin-43, we generated stable HEK293 cells that overexpressed connexin-43-FLAG alone or in combination with ZO-1-d1-Myc (Fig. 5). The effect of ZO-1-d1-Myc on gap junctions reconstituted from expressed connexin-43-FLAG was then analyzed. Immunoblots showed that connexin-43-FLAG proteins were expressed to almost the same degree in both cell lines and that ZO-1-d1-Myc proteins were expressed in larger amounts than endogenous ZO-1 (Fig. 5 A). The distributions of connexin-43-FLAG and ZO-1-d1-Myc were then localized by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myc IgG antibodies, respectively. In cells not expressing ZO-1-d1-Myc, the connexin-43-FLAG proteins were distributed at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, connexin-43-FLAG exhibited a markedly different pattern of localization in cells coexpressing ZO-1-d1-Myc; aggregates were observed in the perinuclear region, which is consistent with the distribution of coexpressed ZO-1-d1-Myc in cytoplasmic structures. Localization of endogenous N-cadherin at the cell-cell interfaces was not affected by ZO-1-d1-Myc. These results indicate that ZO-1-d1-Myc lacks the ability to localize at the cell-cell interfaces, and moreover, it inhibits the transport of connexin-43-FLAG to the cell membrane. To assess the effect of ZO-1-d1-Myc on the conductance properties of connexin-43-mediated gap junctions, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from pairs of transfected HEK293 cells (Fig.6 A). Repetitive 10-mV pulses were applied to pairs of voltage-clamped cells, andG j was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (19Spray D.C. Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control HEK293 cells,G j was typically below the level of detectability (<20 picosiemens). However, expression of connexin-43-FLAG markedly increased G j to 45.9 ± 18.6 nanosiemens (n = 16), which is compatible with the reported conductance of connexin-43-expressing SKHep1 cell pairs (21Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 22Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Leinwand L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Exposing voltage-clamped cell pairs to solution containing octanol, an inhibitor of gap junctional communication (19Spray D.C. Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reduced the junctional conductance. Thus, the gap junctions reconstituted from expressed connexin-43-FLAG proteins appear to be functional. In contrast, when ZO-1-d1-Myc was coexpressed with connexin-43-FLAG, G j was decreased to control levels (Fig. 6 A). We next examined the role of ZO-1 in gap junction formation in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6 B). Because we were unable to generate stable cultures of cardiac myocytes overexpressing dominant-negative ZO-1-d1-Myc, a transient expression strategy was used. Cardiac myocytes were cotransfected with plasmid pGreen Lantern-1 and ZO-1-d1-Myc cDNA at a ratio of 1:5. This meant that cells transfected with ZO-1-d1-Myc could be easily identified using fluorescence microscopy. Subsequently, pairs of the GFP-positive cells were subjected to electrophysiological analysis. In control cells and in cells transfected with ZO-1-Myc, G j was measured to be 126.6 ± 67.3 nanosiemens (n = 9) and 118.4 ± 92.4 nanosiemens (n = 13), respectively. These values are similar to the conductance previously reported for rat cardiac myocyte pairs (23Verheule S. van Kempen M.J. te Welscher P.H. Kwak B.R. Jongsma H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, G jmeasured in cardiac myocytes transfected with ZO-1-d1-Myc was only 34.2 ± 20.3 nanosiemens (n = 16). Thus, dominant-negative ZO-1-d1-Myc markedly decreasedG j in cardiac myocytes. Taken together with the immunocytochemical results from transfected HEK293 cells, these electrophysiological findings confirm the notion that overexpression of ZO-1-d1-Myc inhibits gap junction formation by connexin-43-FLAG. In this study, biochemical analysis demonstrated that connexin-43 is directly linked to ZO-1 in cardiac myocytes and that the linkage involves an interaction between the C-terminal domain of connexin-43 and the N-terminal domain of ZO-1. Furthermore, dominant-negative assays using a deletion construct of ZO-1 showed that overexpression of the N-terminal domain of ZO-1 inhibits localization of connexin-43 at cell-cell interfaces and that there is a loss of electrical coupling between transfected cell pairs. We therefore propose that the linkage between ZO-1 and connexin-43 may serve to localize connexin-43 at the intercalated discs, thereby generating functional gap junctions in cardiac myocytes. Cytoskeletal proteins play a major role in the regional localization of membrane proteins (6Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of ZO-1, which participates in the protein-protein interaction with connexin-43, contains repeats of the 90-amino acid PDZ motif (24Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). PDZ domains have been detected in enzymes and structural proteins concentrated at specialized cell-cell junctions, such as neural synapses and epithelial tight junctions; they were found to bind to a variety of receptors, ion channels, and signaling proteins, anchoring them at their target sites (26Kornau H.C.

A C-terminal (T/S)XV consensus motif in the target protein has been identified as one of the interacting sites for the PDZ domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (26Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 27Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

However, several studies, including this one, have shown that the interacting sites of the PDZ domain proteins are not restricted to the (T/S)XV consensus motif (29Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 30Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R.J. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F.

Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography analysis indicated that all PDZ domains may share certain structural elements (25Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, binding studies with oriented peptide libraries revealed that different PDZ domains display preferences for distinct targets (34Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is noteworthy that the various PDZ domains of multivalent proteins are specialized for distinct functions by associating with different target proteins (32Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 33Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner A. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In this way, the various components of signaling cascades are organized into distinct physical and functional units by multivalent PDZ domain proteins, such as ZO-1, which assemble their target proteins at specialized sites and in close proximity. The dominant-negative assay using the deletion construct of ZO-1 provides an insight into the functional role of ZO-1 in gap junction formation. Assembly of gap junctions is a multistage process (35Sosinsky G.E. Jesior J.C. Caspar D.L. Goodenough D.A. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 709-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The first step is the synthesis of connexin. Next, connexons are formed by the oligomerization of six connexin monomers during their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus; this step is thought to be critical for gap junction formation. Finally, a connexon in the plasma membrane of one cell docks with a connexon in an opposing plasma membrane to produce intercellular channels. In this study, overexpression of the N-terminal domain of ZO-1, which lacked the ability to localize at cell-cell interfaces, disrupted the transport of connexin-43-FLAG to the target site. The precise reason why the N-terminal domain of ZO-1 is not localized at cell-cell interfaces remains unknown; perhaps it lacks the ability to interact with cytoskeletal proteins such as α-spectrin. Whatever the reason, overexpression of the N-terminal domain of ZO-1 inhibits the linkage between endogenous ZO-1 and connexin-43 apparently by dominantly forming complexes with connexin-43 in cytoplasmic structures. We therefore conclude that the transport of connexin-43 to regions of cell-cell interface is achieved by translocation of associated ZO-1 into close proximity with the cell surface. Furthermore, the cell adhesion molecule cadherin has also been shown to participate in gap junction formation (37Meyer R.A. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 38Jongen W.M. Fitzgerald D.J. Asamoto M. Piccoli C. Slaga T.J. Gros D. Takeichi M. Yamasaki H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Taken together with the findings of a recent study showing that translocation of ZO-1 to the cell surface is regulated by cadherins (39Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriguez Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the subcellular targeting of connexin-43 may be regulated by a cadherin-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, we showed that ZO-1 functions as an adapter for the transport of connexin-43 in cardiac myocytes. Although occludin has been demonstrated to be another target protein of ZO-1 at the tight junction of epithelial cells (13Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), it is not yet known how the specificity of ZO-1 for different target proteins is determined in different cell types. The identification of all ZO-1 target proteins as well as the corresponding PDZ domains should provide an experimentally tractable system with which to define the structural basis for the interactions between ZO-1 and its target proteins in vivo. We are indebted to Dr. Noriyuki Yamada for help in the electrophysiological analysis."

Many groups are currently studying the roles and uses of galectin-3 in cancer, inflammation, host-pathogen interaction, and nerve injury, among others (17Akahani S. Inohara H. Nangia-Makker P. Raz A. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 69-75Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Leffler H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 9-19Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 is unique among the known galectins in that, in addition to the canonical CRD (located at the C terminus), it contains an unrelated, non-carbohydrate-binding N-terminal domain of between 120 (in human) and 166 (in dog) amino acids (3Hughes R.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Herrmann J. Turck C.W. Atchison R.E. Huflejt M.E. Poulter L. Gitt M.A. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26704-26711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, galectins-1 and -2 are homodimers composed of the CRD alone, while galectins-4, -6, -8, and -9 possess an N- and C-terminal CRD linked in tandem by a short polypeptide segment (18Leffler H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 9-19Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The galectin-3 CRD shows sequence identity ranging from 30–40% with galectins-4 through -10, to 20–25% with galectins-1 and -2. It has an affinity for lactose (Lac, K d = 1 mm), andN-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc, K d = 0.2 mm) similar to that of other galectins, but has a distinct profile for larger oligosaccharides (20Sparrow C.P.

Intact galectin-3, but not its CRD alone, shows avidity for multivalent glycoconjugates (10Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14167-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), modulates cell adhesion (14Kuwabara I. Liu F.T. J.

Thus it is thought that the N-terminal domain of galectin-3 promotes the formation of dimers or higher order oligomers, thereby permitting multivalent interactions essential for its biological activities. We report here the x-ray crystal structure of the CRD of human galectin-3 in complex with Lac and LacNAc at 2.1-Å resolution. Previously we and others showed that galectin-1 (22Liao D.I. Kapadia G.

We now show that, although the galectin-3 CRD is similar to that found in galectin-1 and galectin-2, it displays structural features which provide an explanation for the known differences in galectin-3 carbohydrate-binding specificity and mode of self-association. Intact human galectin-3 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), followed by purification on a lactosyl-Sepharose column essentially as described previously (11Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A C-terminal fragment of human galectin-3 (galectin-3-C; residues 107–250) containing the CRD was then produced by collagenase (type VII, Sigma) digestion of the intact molecule followed by repurification on lactosyl-Sepharose (11Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Galectin-3-C was dialyzed against crystallization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% NaN3 to remove lactose, and concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml using a Centricon-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) ultrafiltration unit. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing equal volumes of the protein (10–15 mg/ml) in crystallization buffer containing 1 mm lactose or 30 mm N-acetyllactosamine, and solution from the well composed of 27–35% PEG 4000–6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The crystals attain dimensions of 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm3 within 1 to 2 weeks and diffract to approximately 1.9-Å resolution. They grow in space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 37.6 Å, b = 58.4 Å, andc = 64.0 Å. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit resulting in a solvent content of 48%. Five heavy atom derivatives were used to calculate the initial phases (see Table I). With the exception of dimethylmercury, the heavy atom compounds were dissolved in artificial mother liquor containing 32–35% PEG 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 100–150 mm MgCl2, at concentrations of 1–3 mm, and soaked into crystals for 2–3 days. The dimethylmercury derivative was obtained through vapor diffusion. After mounting a crystal in a standard glass x-ray capillary, a small volume (~2 μl) of dimethylmercury was pipetted into the end of the capillary before sealing it with wax and epoxy. The crystal was then allowed to equilibrate for 48 h before data collection. Native and derivative data sets were collected at room temperature on a Siemens multiwire area detector with a conventional rotating anode x-ray source, and reduced using XDS (25Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Heavy atom parameter refinement, phase calculations, and solvent flattening were performed using PHASES (26Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). An initial phase set was calculated using the isomorphous and anomalous components of the derivative data sets (Table I) in conjunction with solvent flattening. The resulting electron density map at 2.5-Å resolution was of very high quality permitting an unambiguous chain tracing. The initial model was built using O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Model refinement was performed with X-PLOR (28Brünger A. X-PLOR, v3.1 A system for x-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the simulated annealing and conventional energy minimization protocols withF obs > 1ς(F obs) between 8.0- and 2.1-Å resolution. Restrained atomic temperature factors were refined using F obs > 2ς(F obs) between 5.0- and 2.1-Å resolution. Water molecules were selected based on difference electron density and hydrogen bond geometry and assigned an occupancy of 0.6 (29Kundrot C.E. Richards F.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Open table in a new tab The structure of galectin-3-C has been determined in the presence of both Lac and LacNAc, and in both cases refined at 2.1-Å resolution with good geometry (TableI). Analysis using PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows that all non-proline and non-glycine residues are found in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. In both complexes, Leu-114 is the first residue for which electron density is observed, and hence, the first 6 residues are presumed to be disordered. Well defined electron density is observed for all other residues, including the C-terminal residue Ile-250. Both complexes are very similar to each other, and all further reference to the structure will pertain to the LacNAc complex unless otherwise indicated. The CRD (117–250) of galectin-3-C displays an identical topology and very similar three-dimensional structure to that reported for the CRDs of the homodimeric galectins-1 and -2 (22Liao D.I.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27034-27038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with which it shares 20–25% sequence identity. Like galectins-1 and -2, it is composed of 5-stranded (F1–F5) and 6-stranded (S1–S6a/6b) β-sheets which associate in a β-sandwich arrangement (Fig.1). The Cα atoms of 43 homologous residues in the β-sheet core of galectin-3-C align with root mean square deviations of 0.52 and 0.61 Å with those of human galectin-2 (24Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27034-27038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine galectin-1 (22Liao D.I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1428-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 1). In the canonical dimeric galectins-1 and -2, β-strands F1 and S1 from each monomer extend the antiparallel β-strand interactions across the 2-fold symmetric dimer interface (S1–S1′ andF1–F1′ in Fig. 1), whereas the S1 and F1 β-strands of galectin-3-C form a solvent-exposed surface as discussed below in detail. As shown in Fig. 1 the Lac/LacNAc binding site is formed by β-strands S4–S6a/S6b. With S3 these β-strands define a carbohydrate-binding cassette, encoded for by a single DNA exon (2Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27034-27038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is evolutionarily conserved among members of the galectin family. The amino acids making direct interaction with the bound carbohydrate are highly conserved among all galectins sequenced to date and are contained on these β-strands. The galactose moiety of Lac/LacNAc is most deeply buried in the binding site (Fig. 2); 166 Å2 of its total 230-Å2 surface area is buried by the protein. Its C-4 hydroxyl group plays a central role in binding, likely accepting hydrogen bonds from the highly conserved residues His-158 and Arg-162, while donating hydrogen bonds to Asn-160 and W1 (TableII). The galactose C-6 hydroxyl group also displays this cooperative hydrogen bonding pattern (33Quiocho F.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 139: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar), interacting with Glu-184, Asn-174, and W3. The planar C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 carbon atoms of the galactose moiety are in van der Waals contact with the aromatic side chain of Trp-181 in a fashion similar to that seen in a number of other galactose and lactose binding lectins (34Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).Table IIHydrogen bond interactions in the carbohydrate binding site of human galectin-3 in complex with LacNAc and LacAtom 1Atom 2DistanceLacNAcLac(Å)Gal O-3W12-aW, water molecule.2.72.7W1Gal O-43.03.0W1Arg144 NH-12.52.6W1Asn160 OD-13.03.2Gal O-4His158 NE-22.62.6Gal O-4Arg162 NH-23.13.1Gal O-4Asn160 OD-13.23.3Gal O-5Arg162 NH-23.03.0Gal O-6Glu184 OE-22.82.8Gal O-6Asn174 ND-22.92.9Gal O-6W33.22.9W3Glu184 OE-23.13.1Nag/Glc O-6W32.92.9Nag/Glc O-3Arg162 NH-12.72.8Nag/Glc O-3Arg162 NH-23.03.0Nag/Glc O-3Glu184 OE-22.62.6Nag N-2W22.8—Glc O-2W2—3.3W2Glu165 OE-22.83.12-a W, water molecule. Open table in a new tab The N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety is more solvent-exposed, with only 91 Å2 buried by the protein. Only its C-3 hydroxyl group, which hydrogen bonds to Glu-184 and Arg-162, makes direct hydrogen bonds with the protein (Fig. 2 and TableII). The only other contacts involving the GlcNAc moiety are mediated through its N-acetyl group; the amide proton is hydrogen bonded through water (W2) to Glu-165, and the methyl group makes a van der Waals contact with the guanidino head group of Arg-186 (~20-Å2 buried surface). Although there is a water molecule in an analogous position in the lactose complex, which hydrogen bonds to the lactose O-2 hydroxyl group, the hydrogen bond distance is much greater than that found in the LacNAc complex (TableII). The van der Waals interaction and the strength of the hydrogen bond involving the 2 position of the glucose/N-acetylglucosamine moiety represent the only significant differences between the Lac and LacNAc complexes, and presumably account for the approximately 5-fold higher binding affinity, shown by human galectin-3, for N-acetyllactosamine over lactose (20Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, galectin-1 also shows a water-mediated hydrogen bond involving the NH of the GlcNAc moiety (22Liao D.I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1428-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), even though there is a difference in the way in which the water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the protein. van der Waals interactions with the N-acetyl group are also important, and like galectin-3 it shows higher affinity for LacNAc over lactose (20Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol.

The bound galactose and N-acetylglucosamine moieties are very well defined, with average temperature factors of 21 and 32 Å2, respectively. The φ/ψ values for the β(1,4)-glycosidic linkage of Lac and LacNAc, respectively, are −70°/−103° and −68°/−103°, close to the calculated minima for the saccharides in solution (36Imberty A. Delage M.M. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. Perez S. Glycoconj. J. 1991; 8: 456-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Examination of the solvent-exposed surfaces of galectin-3-C, shows that the Lac/LacNAc binding site, formed by β-strands S4–S6, is a cleft, open at both ends (see Fig. 3). At the nonreducing end (galactose) of the bound carbohydrate the cleft is extended by residues on β-strands S1–S3, whereas at the reducing (GlcNAc) end it is open to the surrounding solution. The carbohydrate binding site is similar in galectin-1 and galectin-2, consistent with the demonstrated ability of galectins-1 and -3 to bind longer oligosaccharides such as polylactosaminoglycans (21Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zhou Q. Cummings R.D. Arch. Biochem.

These lectins, however, do show differences in affinity for longer oligosaccharides, particularly those substituted on the O-3 of the nonreducing galactose moiety (21Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Knibbs R.N. Agrwal N. Wang J.L. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14940-14947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Galectin-3, for example, binds GalNAcα1–3(Fucα1–2)Galβ1–4Glc with almost 100-fold higher affinity than does galectin-1 (20Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-linked GalNAc moiety would be expected to interact with residues in the extended cleft formed by β-strands S1–S3. As shown in Fig.4, although the identity and conformation of residues involved in binding the Lac/LacNAc moiety in the primary binding site of galectin-1 and galectin-3 are very similar, they differ in the vicinity of the galactose O-3. Galectin-3 has an arginine residue at position 144 which is well positioned to interact with the GalNAc moiety or other saccharide residues linked to the galactose O-3 (Fig. 4). The serine found in galectin-1 is presumably unable to make similar interactions. In addition, the bulky leucine residue at position 31 in galectin-1 is reduced to an alanine (Ala-146) in galectin-3, creating more space for O-3 substituents (Fig. 4). Mouse galectin-3 (formerly known as CBP35) has been shown to be part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (40Wang J.L. Werner E.A. Laing J.G. Patterson R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Laing J.G. Wang J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and may be involved in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro (5Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In addition, human galectin-3 has recently been shown to directly bind RNA fragments in a gel-shift assay (42Wang L. Inohara H. Pienta K.J. Raz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential calculations (see Fig. 3.) show that the carbohydrate binding cleft of galectin-3 is flanked by a linear array of three positively charged arginine residues (Arg-186, Arg-162, and Arg-144). These residues are spaced approximately 5.3 and 7.9 Å apart, close to the phosphate repeat distance in RNA, leading to the possibility that the carbohydrate binding cleft may also be the RNA binding site. Consistent with this suggestion is the fact that the RNA splicing assay is inhibited by soluble oligosaccharides in a rank order reflecting their affinity for galectin-3 (5Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), even though the interaction of galectin-3 with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (41Laing J.G. Wang J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and RNA fragments (42Wang L. Inohara H. Pienta K.J. Raz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) appears not to be inhibited by lactose. A striking feature of galectin-3-C is that, in contrast with galectins-1 or -2, it is found to be monomeric in solution at protein concentrations of up to approximately 0.1 mm (11Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For this reason it was of particular interest to examine the region in the galectin-3 CRD corresponding to the canonical galectin-1 and -2 dimer interface. As shown in Figs. 5 and6 the galectin-1 dimer interface is a very apolar surface composed of residues Leu-4, Ala-6, Leu-9, Phe-133, Val-131, and Ile-128. In the galectin-3 CRD, the apolar nature of this interface has largely been eliminated by a reduction of the F1-S1 β-strand separation and the introduction of Tyr-118 and Tyr-247. In both cases the ring hydroxyl group of the Tyr residues point into solution creating a much more polar exposed surface (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the canonical dimer interface is partially obstructed by residues Leu-114, Ile-115, and Val-116, the end of the galectin-3 N-terminal domain (see Fig. 5). In fact, Val-116 is the start of a conserved tripeptide sequence (V(L)PY) found in galectin-3, galectin-4, and many other galectins, but not found in galectins-1 and -2. It makes a cis-peptide linkage with the highly conserved Pro-117 which is in turn followed typically by a tyrosine residue, in this case Tyr-118, one of the two tyrosine residues responsible for the increased polarity of the canonical dimer interface. Taken together it would appear that the region corresponding to the dimer interface in galectin-1 and galectin-2 does not serve a similar role in galectin-3.Figure 6Galectin surface representation showing nonpolar regions.

Both molecules are in the same orientation viewed into the galectin-1 dimer interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although intact galectin-3 also migrates as a monomeric (30 kDa) protein by gel filtration at concentrations of up to approximately 0.1 mm, several lines of evidence suggest that it can form dimers or oligomers at higher concentrations, where it binds multivalent ligands better than monovalent ones. The latter properties appear to be largely dependent on the proline/glycine rich N-terminal domain, although interactions with the CRD may also be important (10Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14167-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18250-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, analysis of the galectin-3 CRD (not shown) reveals an apolar patch in the face of the 5-stranded β-sheet which may provide a site for monomer-monomer interactions. Associations involving both the N- and C-terminal domains could easily be achieved by a parallel orientation of monomers, an arrangement seen in the collectins, soluble C-type lectins with an N-terminal collagenous triple helical oligomerization domain (44Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The CRDs of many lectin types have been found in different structural arrangements among members of their respective families. In fact, the precise structural arrangement of CRDs in multimeric lectins appears to be an important means of conferring both specificity and affinity on their interactions with multivalent carbohydrates (34Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The fact that galectin-3 does not possess the canonical 2-fold symmetric dimer interface characteristic of galectins-1 and -2 suggests that the galectins are no exception. Moreover, the fact that monomeric galectin-3 is in equilibrium with higher order oligomers under appropriate conditions, further suggests that in this case the valency is dynamic. We thank Robert Atchison for technical assistance in producing galectin-3."

However, the extent to which these decreases cause a disturbance in oxidative phosphorylation and energy homeostasis in the brain is not known. We therefore examined the relative contribution of individual mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes to the control of NAD-linked substrate oxidative phosphorylation in synaptic mitochondria. Titration of complex I, III, and IV activities with specific inhibitors generated threshold curves that showed the extent to which a complex activity could be inhibited before causing impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Complex I, III, and IV activities were decreased by approximately 25, 80, and 70%, respectively, before major changes in rates of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were observed. These results suggest that, in mitochondria of synaptic origin, complex I activity has a major control of oxidative phosphorylation, such that when a threshold of 25% inhibition is exceeded, energy metabolism is severely impaired, resulting in a reduced synthesis of ATP. Additionally, depletion of glutathione, which has been reported to be a primary event in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, eliminated the complex I threshold in PC12 cells, suggesting that antioxidant status is important in maintaining energy thresholds in mitochondria. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to neurodegenerative disorders and energy metabolism in the synapse.

Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction is characteristic of several neurodegenerative disorders (10Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) and also the aging process (11Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Evidence for mitochondria being a site of damage in neurodegenerative disorders is partially based on reductions in respiratory chain complex activities in Parkinson's disease (12Schapira A.H.V. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Jenner P. Clark J.B. Marsden C.D. Lancet. 1989; 8649: 1269Abstract Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 13Schapira A.H.V. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Clark J.B Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J.

Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1948-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Such defects in respiratory chain complex activities in mitochondria are thought to underlie defects in energy metabolism and cellular degeneration (17Bowling A.C. Mutisya E.M. Walker L.C. Price D.L. Cork L.C. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1964-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 18Bowling A.C. Beal M.F. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1151-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Parkinson's disease is characterized by a selective decrease in dopamine in the striatum caused by a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra (19Hornykiewicz O. Fed. Proc. 1973; 32: 183-190PubMed Google Scholar, 20Calne D.B. Langston J.W. Lancet. 1983; 8365: 1457-1459Abstract Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition to a reduction in complex I activity in Parkinson's disease, decreased levels of glutathione have also been found in postmortem examination of the substantia nigra (21Perry T.L. Godin D.V. Hansen S. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 33: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 22Perry T.L. Yong V.W. Neurosci.

Neurochem. 1989; 52: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). This suggests an increased oxidative stress involvement in Parkinson's disease, as GSH is present in millimolar concentrations in mammalian cells and is considered to be a major antioxidant in the brain, capable of protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals (24Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5975) Google Scholar). The reduction in GSH levels is believed to be a primary event in Parkinson's disease because in incidental Lewy body disease (thought to be presymptomatic Parkinson's disease) GSH is depleted in the absence of a deficiency in complex I activity (25Jenner, P., Dexter, D. T., Sian, J., Schapira, A. H. V., and Marsden, C. D. (1992) Ann. Neurol.32,(suppl.) S82–S87Google Scholar). In an experimental model of rat brain mitochondria of nonsynaptic origin it was found that thresholds exist (26Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) whereby complex activities need to be reduced by at least 60% before major changes in ATP synthesis and oxygen consumption occur. In this study we examine the relationship between individual respiratory chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation (rates of respiration and ATP synthesis) in synaptic mitochondria energized with NAD-linked substrates and discuss the consequences for maintenance of energy metabolism in the synapse. In order to observe the consequences of GSH depletion on mitochondrial function, the catecholaminergic PC12 cell line is depleted of GSH, partly imitating that which is thought to occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and the effect on the complex I threshold is measured. Chemicals were supplied by either BDH, Dagenham, Essex, UK, or Sigma Chemical Company, Poole, United Kingdom. The Eisai Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan, supplied ubiquinone-1. The animals used were adult (250 g) male Wistar rats, supplied by B and K Universal, Aldbrough, Hull, UK. Rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells (27Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, which was changed every 2–3 days. The cells were incubated in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Glutathione levels were depleted in PC12 cells by the addition of the α-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor,l-buthionine(S,R)-sulfoximine (l-BSO) 1The abbreviations used are: l-BSO,l-buthionine(S,R)-sulfoximine; JO2, oxygen respiration. (10 μm) for 18 h. Synaptic mitochondria were prepared by the method of Lai and Clark (28Lai C.K. Clark J.B. Neuromethods. 1989; 11: 43-97Google Scholar) and were resuspended in isolation medium (320 mm sucrose, 1 mmK+-EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Mitochondria routinely had a respiratory control ratio of approximately 5 with glutamate and malate as substrates. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Oxygen consumption or respiration (JO2) rates in mitochondria were measured using a Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co., Yellow Springs, OH) fitted into the top of a 250-μl capacity water-jacketed Perspex incubation chamber. An electromagnetic stirrer and bar flea were used to mix the incubation medium. In a typical experiment, mitochondria (0.125 mg) were pre-incubated (2 min, 30 °C) in respiration medium (final volume, 250 μl; 100 mm KCl, 75 mmmannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 10 mm phosphate-Tris, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 50 μm EDTA, pH 7.4.) containing bovine serum albumin (0.125 mg). Depending on the complex under study, rotenone (0–150 pmol) was used to inhibit complex I, myxothiazol (0–60 pmol) to inhibit complex III, and KCN (0–75 nmol) to inhibit complex IV. After 5 min of incubation with the inhibitor, state 4 respiration was generated with glutamate (10 mm) and malate (5 mm) for 2 min; then state 3 respiration was induced by the addition of ADP (500 μm) and allowed to continue for 3 min before samples were taken for ATP production measurement and for complex activity measurement. Mitochondrial samples were perchloric acid (60% v/v)-extracted and the pH adjusted to 6 with 1m K2HPO4 for ATP analysis. PC12 cell samples were perchloric acid (60% v/v)-extracted, and the pH was adjusted to 2.5 with 5 m NaOH for GSH analysis. ATP and GSH were separated from other nucleotides using isocratic ion-paired reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. A Beckman System Gold was used, and the separation performed at 30 °C with a Hichrom S50D2 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm) (Hichrom, Reading, Berkshire, UK). For ATP, the method was based on that of Ingebretsen et al.(30Ingebretsen O.C. Bakken A.M. Segadal L. Farstad M. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 242: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with UV detection at 254 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 60 mm orthophosphic acid, 2% methanol, and 80 mmtriethylamine (pH 6.0); the flow rate was 1 ml/min. For GSH, the method was based on that of Harvey et al. (31Harvey P.R.C. Ilson R.G. Strasberg S.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 180: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with electrochemical detection (ESA Coulochem electrochemical detector; E1 = 250 mV, E2 = 800 mV). The mobile phase consisted of 10 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm sodium octyl sulfate, 1% acetonitrile, pH 2.7; the flow rate was 1 ml/min. All assays were performed at 30 °C. Prior to analysis, samples were freeze-thawed and gently shaken three times to ensure mitochondrial lysis was complete. Complex I activity was determined using a modification of the method of Raganet al. (32Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Mitochondria, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, London1987: 79-112Google Scholar), and followed the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm using ubiquinone-1 as the electron acceptor. Complex III activity was determined using a modification of the method of Ragan et al. (32Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Mitochondria, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, London1987: 79-112Google Scholar), and followed the oxidation of decylubiquinol with cytochrome c (II) as the electron acceptor, at 550 nm. Complex IV activity was determined by following the oxidation of cytochrome c (III) at 550 nm (33Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) and was expressed as a first order decay rate constant (K). Flux control coefficients were calculated according to the metabolic control theory (34Kacser H. Burns J.A. Rate Control of Biological Processes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1973: 65-104Google Scholar, 35Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). This theory determines the control that various steps in a pathway have over the global flux of that pathway. The flux control coefficient can be defined as the fractional change in pathway flux of a metabolic network under steady-state conditions, induced by a fractional change in the individual step under consideration. For oxidative flux (respiration) in mitochondriaC=(dJO2/d(Inhibitor))/(dVc/d(Inhibitor))Equation 1 where C is the flux control coefficient of the mitochondrial complex under investigation, dVc/d(inhibitor) is the rate of change of complex activity (individual step) anddJO2 /d(inhibitor) is the rate of change of respiration (global flux), at low concentrations of the complex inhibitor. The common pattern present in the experiments with synaptic mitochondria was the abrupt decrease in complex activity as the respective inhibitor concentration was increased, while rates of respiration and ATP synthesis stayed within 85–100% of their control rates. The difference in the shapes of the curves generates the threshold effect which demonstrates how far the enzymatic activity of these complexes can be reduced before oxidative phosphorylation is compromised and significant decreases in ATP production and oxygen respiration occur. In the case of complex I, titration with rotenone initially resulted in a linear relationship between inhibitor concentration and the activity of that complex (Fig.1). Rates of respiration and ATP synthesis in mitochondria energized with NAD-linked substrates stayed within 90 and 100% of the control rates and decreased appreciably at amounts of rotenone greater than 5 pmol. The rates of overall oxidative flux and ATP synthesis were expressed as a function of the amount of inhibition of complex I activity and a threshold curve was generated (Fig. 2). When complex I activity was decreased further than 25% of the control activity both parameters of oxidative phosphorylation decreased at a rate linearly proportional to the rate of complex I inhibition.Figure 2Complex I threshold in synaptic mitochondria. The data points from Fig. 1 were used to plot rates of respiration (○) and ATP synthesis (•) against the percent inhibition of complex I activity. Data are mean ± S.E.

As myxothiazol concentration was increased (0 to 15 pmol), complex III activity decreased in a linear fashion while the rates of respiration and ATP synthesis stayed between 85 and 100% of the control values and then decreased sharply at amounts of myxothiazol greater than 15 pmol. The 80% threshold observed for complex III (Fig.4) was greater than that found for complex I (Fig. 2); however, there was a gradual decline (between 100 and 70% of the control) in rates of respiration and ATP synthesis before this threshold was reached.Figure 4Complex III threshold in synaptic mitochondria. The data points from Fig. 3 were used to plot rates of respiration (○) and ATP synthesis (•) against the percent inhibition of complex III activity. Data are mean ± S.E.

Increasing the KCN concentration (0 to 0.2 nmol) caused a linear decrease in complex IV activity, rapidly decreasing to approximately 50% of the control values. The rates of respiration and ATP synthesis linearly decreased over this range of KCN concentration but stayed between 85 and 100% of the control levels. Generation of a threshold curve showed that complex IV activity must be decreased by approximately 70% before a rapid decline in the rates of respiration and ATP synthesis occurred (Fig. 6).Figure 6Complex IV threshold in synaptic mitochondria. The data points from Fig. 5 were used to plot rates of respiration (○) and ATP synthesis (•) against the percent inhibition of complex IV activity. Data are mean ± S.E.

The initial slope of the respiration inhibition profile was calculated and expressed as a ratio to the initial slope of the complex activity profile as described in the equation for calculating flux control coefficients under “Experimental Procedures.” The same procedure was carried out for all three inhibitors (Figs. 1, 3, and 5) and TableI shows the flux control coefficients for all three complexes, with complex I having the higher control on oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis in synaptic mitochondria.Table IFlux control coefficients in synaptic mitochondriaRespiratory chain complexFlux control coefficientsComplex I0.29Complex III0.20Complex IV0.13The flux control coefficients for complexes I, III, and IV were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using the data in Figs. 1, 3, and 5. Open table in a new tab The flux control coefficients for complexes I, III, and IV were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using the data in Figs. 1, 3, and 5. Incubation of PC12 cells with l-BSO for 24 h resulted in a 80% decrease in GSH levels (control PC12 cells, 18.2 ± 2.1 nmol of GSH/mg of protein; l-BSO treated PC12 cells, 4.0 ± 0.3 nmol of GSH/mg of protein). Rotenone-insensitive complex I activities were subtracted from total complex I activities and the resulting rotenone-sensitive complex I activities were plotted against respiration rates (Fig. 7). During 0–40% inhibition of complex I activity, oxygen consumption rates were reduced to approximately 80% of the control rate. Further inhibition resulted in a threshold effect similar to that found in Fig. 2 for synaptic mitochondria, and oxygen consumption rates decreased rapidly as a higher proportion of complex I activity was inhibited. Depletion of GSH in the l-BSO-treated PC12 cells to 20% of the control level abolished the threshold effect, and oxygen consumption decreased in a linear fashion proportional to the inhibition of complex I activity. We investigated the involvement of respiratory chain complexes in oxidative phosphorylation in synaptic mitochondria that were energized with NAD-linked substrates. Of the complexes tested, complex I possessed the highest flux control coefficient (0.29) for oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. Metabolic thresholds existed whereby 25, 80, and 70% inhibition of complex I, III, and IV activities, respectively, were required before ATP synthesis and respiration were severely compromised. Additionally, depletion of GSH abolished the threshold effect for complex I in PC12 cell mitochondria, thus having possible ramifications for the process of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. When complex I activity was inhibited by approximately 25% there was an abrupt decrease in rates of respiration and ATP synthesis (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to the threshold of 72% found for complex I that is present in nonsynaptic mitochondria (26Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The significance of this finding is important in that the reported decrease of 40% in complex I activity in Parkinson's disease patients (12Schapira A.H.V. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Jenner P. Clark J.B. Marsden C.D. Lancet. 1989; 8649: 1269Abstract Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 13Schapira A.H.V. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Clark J.B Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 14Schapira A.H.V. Mann V.M. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Daniel S.E. Jenner P Clark J.B. Marsden C.D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2142-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) would extrapolate to a 35–40% inhibition of ATP synthesis and respiration in the synaptic mitochondria model (Fig. 2). Although cultured astrocytes appear capable of surviving extensive periods of anaerobic conditions, presumably by glycolytic mechanisms, the same cannot be said about neurons where, following inhibition of aerobic metabolism, neuronal glycolysis cannot compensate for loss of mitochondrial ATP synthesis (36Pauwels P.J. Opperdoes F.R. Trouet A. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Walz W. Mukerji S. Glia. 1988; 1: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 38Walz W. Mukerji S. Glia. 1990; 3: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), so it would seem possible that a 40% inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation would compromise energy homeostasis in the synapse. Synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria have similar respiratory control ratios suggesting no major differences introduced during the mitochondrial isolation techniques. However, synaptic mitochondria have a 36% lower complex I activity than nonsynaptic mitochondria (39Almeida A. Brooks K.J. Sammut I. Keelan J. Davey G.P. Clark J.B. Bates T.E. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), therefore subtraction of this difference from the 72% nonsynaptic complex I threshold may partly account for the lower complex I threshold observed in synaptic mitochondria. Threshold effects were also seen for complexes III and IV in synaptic mitochondria, whereby once the activities were reduced by 80% (Fig. 4) and 70% (Fig. 6), respectively, rates of respiration and ATP synthesis sharply declined. In contrast to the different complex I thresholds present in synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria, complex III and IV thresholds in synaptic mitochondria are similar to those found in nonsynaptic mitochondria (26Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These threshold effects are not restricted to brain mitochondria and have been have observed in rat muscle mitochondria for complex IV (40Letellier T Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and III (41Malgat M. Letellier T. Jouvaille S.L. Mazat J.P. J. Biol. Syst. 1995; 3: 165-175Crossref Google Scholar), where the activity must be reduced by approximately 70 and 60%, respectively, before major changes in oxidative phosphorylation occur. The results shown in this study imply that the threshold effects for complexes III and IV will allow rat brain mitochondria to maintain near-optimal levels of oxidative phosphorylation even if their complex activities are reduced by up to 70%. Decreases in complex IV activity of up to 30% of the control activities reported in Alzheimer's disease (15Mutisya E.M. Bowling A.C. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar,42Kish S.J. Bergeron C. Rajput A. Dogic S. Mastrogiacomo F. Chang L.J. Wilson J.M. DiStefano L.M. Nobrega J.N. J.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1964-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) brain would produce less than a 10% decrease in respiration and ATP synthesis in the synaptic mitochondria model (Fig. 6), thereby implying that a complex IV deficiency alone would not lead to a reduction in energy stores. Previous studies have shown that respiratory chain complexes are involved in the control of mitochondrial respiration and that the distribution of the control indices of these complexes may be different, depending on the tissue from which the mitochondria were isolated (43Groen A.K.

In the case of synaptic mitochondria, complex I has a flux coefficient of 0.29 (Table I) and is approximately twice that found in nonsynaptic mitochondria (26Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that a large proportion of the control of oxidative phosphorylation rests with complex I in synaptic mitochondria. Additionally, complex III and IV share some of the control having coefficients of 0.2 and 0.14, respectively. However, according to the summation theory for flux control (34Kacser H. Burns J.A. Rate Control of Biological Processes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1973: 65-104Google Scholar), the sum of all the control coefficients in any pathway is equal to unity; so in the case of the three complexes described above the total is 0.63. Other systems known to contribute to the control of mitochondrial respiration are; adenine translocator (43Groen A.K. Wanders R.J.A. Westerhoff H.V. van der Meer R. Tager J.M. J. Biol.

Complex I thresholds were monitored in the PC12 cell line and compared with in vitro preparations of synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria. PC12 cells were grown in suspension which did not allow for dendritic growth, thus providing a system where mitochondria were primarily of cell body origin. As shown in Fig. 7, oxygen respiration exhibited a threshold effect at 40% inhibition of complex I activity, suggesting that PC12 cell mitochondria have a different complex I threshold to that found in synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria. As previously stated, nonsynaptic mitochondria which are of neuronal and astrocytic cell body origin, have a complex I threshold of 72%, while synaptic mitochondria have a complex I threshold of 25%, suggesting heterogeneous complex I thresholds in mitochondria of different origin. Depletion of GSH in PC12 cells reduces complex I activity and also abolishes the threshold effect. The mechanism by which GSH causes removal of the complex I threshold in mitochondria is not known. GSH is an antioxidant which protects mitochondria from lipid peroxidation (51Meister A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 155-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and when depleted may render complex I susceptible to free radical attack. Previously, depletion of GSH has been shown to cause enlargement and degeneration of brain mitochondria (52Jain A. Martensson J. Stole E. Auld P.A.M. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and a decrease in complex IV activity in purified brain mitochondrial preparations (53Heales S.J.R. Davies S.E.C. Bates T.E.

GSH also plays a role in protection of sympathetic neuronsin vivo from the effects of the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (54Bhave S.V. Johannessen J.N. Lash L.H. Wakade T.D. Wakade A.R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and when mesencephalic cultures are treated with l-BSO, toxicity is potentiated upon exposure to the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, malonate (55Zeevalk G.D.

These results suggest that, under conditions of GSH depletion, mitochondria are more vulnerable to metabolic insult, which results in a compromise in energy metabolism. The finding of a reduced complex I threshold may have implications for processes involved in neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. GSH depletion is a primary event in incidental Lewy body disease (thought to be presymptomatic Parkinson's disease), and as such may cause a reduction in complex I threshold in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra which are selectively destroyed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. This finding, in conjunction with a constitutive metabolic deficiency in dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (56Mary-Semper I. Gelman M. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 57Mary-Semper I. Gelman M. Levi-Strauss M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5912-5918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may account, in part, for the selective vulnerability of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway to neurodegeneration. In addition, heterogeneity of mitochondrial thresholds may exist in different types of neurons and may be involved in specific neuronal death in selectively vulnerable brain regions. Threshold effects have been described in mitochondrial diseases (58Wallace D.C. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,59Shoffner J.M. Brown M.D. Torroni A. Lott M.T. Abell P. Mirra S.S. Beal M.F. Yang C.C. Gearing M. Salvo R. Watts R.L. Juncos J.L. Hanson L.A. Grain B.J. Fayad M. Wallace D.C. Genomics. 1993; 17: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and may be related to the balance between normal and mutant mtDNA. If the expression of this heteroplasmy of mtDNA is at the level of a given respiratory complex enzyme, then these may reinforce threshold effects observed in mitochondrial metabolism (40Letellier T Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 41Malgat M. Letellier T. Jouvaille S.L. Mazat J.P. J. Biol. Syst. 1995; 3: 165-175Crossref Google Scholar). Whether or not respiratory chain complex activities would be reduced sufficiently to seriously compromise oxidative phosphorylation would depend on the type of mitochondria effected. Due to the heterogeneous nature of brain mitochondria in which complex I thresholds in synaptic mitochondria (this study) are different to those in non-synaptic mitochondria (26Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), it may be possible that degeneration preferentially occurs in synapses. And in the case of a neurodegenerative disorder such as Parkinson's disease, a primary depletion of antioxidant such as glutathione may render certain neurons more susceptible to degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1976690335,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is believed to function as an important regulator of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Previously we reported that interleukin-1β induces activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK with concomitant up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that overexpression of ΔMEKK1 (a constitutively active truncation mutant of MEKK1 containing the C-terminal 324 amino acids) increases Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production which is completely blocked by SC68376, a pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 MAPK. ΔMEKK1 overexpression results in activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (JNK/SAPK) and p38 MAPK. Furthermore, activation of MEKK1 increases SEK1/MKK4 but not MKK3 or MKK6 activity. These findings suggest that MEKK1 → SEK1/MKK4 may function as an upstream kinase capable of activating both p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK with subsequent induction of Cox-2 expression and PGE2production. We also found that overexpression of the constitutively active form of SEK1 (SEK1-ED) increases both p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK phosphorylation, and increases PGE2 production and Cox-2 expression. By comparison, overexpression of the dominant negative form of SEK1 (SEK1-AL) decreases the phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK and reduces Cox-2 expression. Together, this data suggests a potential role for the MEKK1 → SEK1/MKK4 → p38 MAPK →→ Cox-2 cascade linking members of the MAPK pathway with prostaglandin biosynthesis.

Prostaglandins are ubiquitous compounds involved in various homeostatic and inflammatory processes throughout the body. They are formed by the combined action of a phospholipase A2(PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; Cox, cyclooxygenase; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MEK, mitogen-activated protein/Erk kinases. which liberates arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of cellular membrane phospholipids and the cyclooxygenase (Cox) which converts arachidonic acid to the endoperoxide intermediate PGH2. PGH2 is subsequently converted to prostaglandins by the action of cell-specific synthases (1DeWitt D. Smith W.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There are two cyclooxygenase enzymes which have been identified (60% homology), Cox-1 and Cox-2. Cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and mediates physiologic responses such as regulation of renal and vascular homeostasis and cytoprotection of the stomach. By comparison Cox-2 is primarily considered an inducible immediate-early gene product whose synthesis can be up-regulated by mitogenic or inflammatory stimuli including: tumor promoters (2Kujubu D.A.

A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the cyclooxygenase has been the topic of much interest. Cyclooxygenases are the main therapeutic target for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which exhibit their antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects in humans via inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis (7Smith W.L. Meade E.A. DeWitt D.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been effective in the reduction of inflammatory symptoms in carrageenan-induced rat paw inflammation models (8Seibert K. Zhang Y. Leahy K. Hauser S. Masferrer J. Perkins W. Lee L. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12013-12017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) and in the reduced incidence of colon cancer (9Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5575-5589PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rao C.V. Rivenson A. Simi B. Zang E. Kelloff G. Steele V. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1464-1472PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, rat intestinal epithelial cells overexpressing Cox-2 demonstrate resistance to apoptosis (11Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells demonstrate increased metastatic potential when transfected with Cox-2 (12Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the most striking evidence for the pervasive role of Cox-2 is obtained from targeted gene disruption models. Mice which are homozygously deficient for Cox-2 develop severe renal pathology and die prematurely of renal failure (13Morham S.G. Langenbach R. Loftin C.D. Tiano H.F. Vouloumanos N. Jennette J.C. Mahler J.F. Kluckman K.D. Leford A.L. Lee C.A. Smithies O. Cell. 1995; 83: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel class of cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to be inhibitors of endotoxin-stimulated tumor necrosis factor and IL-1 induction (14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). These cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs have been further shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of p38 MAPK. These and other recent findings serve to potentially link prostaglandin biosynthetic pathways which mediate inflammatory responses, with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Components of the MAPK pathway have been implicated as mediators of phosphorylation of intracellular substrates such as protein kinases and transcription factors (15Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) as well as regulators of cell growth and differentiation (16Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, at least three different subfamilies of MAPK have been identified each having several isoforms. They include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p44 MAPK (ERK1) and p42 MAPK (ERK2); stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also called c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs): which include JNK2 (p54 SAPKα/β/γ) and JNK1 (p45 SAPKα/β) and the p38 MAPKs (α, β, γ, and δ). These kinases are in turn activated by distinct upstream MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs, MKKs) which recognize and phosphorylate threonine and tyrosine residues within a tripeptide motif (Thr-X-Tyr) required for MAPK activation (17Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, these MAPKs then activate their specific substrates on serine and/or threonine residues to produce their effects on downstream targets. Recent work has demonstrated that both SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK cascades are activated preferentially by the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as by a wide variety of cellular stresses such as ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, oxidative stress, etc. (17Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). These findings further implicate the role of these two kinase pathways as important signaling mechanisms underlying the inflammatory process. Recent work has linked activation of the prostaglandin generative pathway with the MAPK pathway. Lin et al. (18Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is mediated by MAPK. Furthermore, Kramer et al. (19Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that thrombin activates both ERK and p38 MAPK in human platelets which may utilize cPLA2 as a downstream target. We have shown that IL-1 stimulation of renal mesangial cells mediates prostaglandin E2 production and Cox-2 expression with concomitant activation of p38 MAPK and SAPK-mediated signaling pathways (20Guan Z.H. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Guan Z.H. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F634-F641Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that inhibition of p38 MAPK with a pyridyl oxazole results in the down-regulation of IL-1 mediated Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production, suggesting a role for p38 in the modulation of prostaglandin synthesis (20Guan Z.H. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Previous work by Templeton et al. (22Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) has shown that cells induced to overexpress a constitutively active form of ΔMEKK1 directly activate the SAPK pathway. The availability of this model system encouraged exploration of possible SAPK-mediated effects on prostaglandin production suggested by our previous cytokine stimulation data. In our current study, we describe the ability of ΔMEKK1 expressing cells to induce Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production and analyze the intermediate kinases involved in the regulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis.

Both wild type His-c-Jun-(1–79) and mutant His-c-Jun-(1–79, S63A/S73A) were expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli NovaBlue (DE3) and purified by His-bind resin (Novagen). pGEX ATF-2-(1–96) was obtained from Dr. J.

GST-ATF-2-(1–96) and GST-p38 MAPK were expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified by GST-binding resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All experiments were performed with NIH 3T3 cells as well as NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with an IPTG inducible EE-epitope-tagged MEKK1 truncation mutant (containing the C-terminal 324 amino acids, ΔMEKK-1) subcloned into the lacSwitch promoter construct (Stratagene) (22Yan M.

Normal NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm HEPES. MEKK1 3T3 cells were maintained in the above media with 500 mg/liter of G418 and 200 mg/liter of hygromycin. ΔMEKK1 expression was induced using 1 mm IPTG for various time periods. SEK1/MKK4 wild type (SEK1-WT), a constitutively active mutation form of SEK1 (SEK1-ED, serine 220 and threonine 224 mutated to glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively) or the dominant negative mutation (SEK1-AL, serine 220 and threonine 224 mutated to alanine and leucine, respectively) were subcloned into the popRSV1 mammalian expression vector (Stratagene) and stably transfected in NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were plated and transfected at 50–80% confluence using 20 μg of DNA per 75-cm2 flask using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc). Stably transfected isolates were selected in G418 for several weeks. At the time of harvest, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer and lysed in whole cell extract buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μmNaVO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to which 6 × Laemmli sample buffer was added before heating. After boiling for 5 min, equal amounts of protein were run on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were saturated with 5% fat-free dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin TBS-T. After washing with 5% milk TBS-T solution, blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) at 1:3000 dilution in TBS-T. Blots were then washed five times in TBS-T before visualization. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham) was used for detection. Harvested cells were solubilized in whole cell extract buffer. Protein kinase assays were performed using our previously described methods (20Guan Z.H. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-polyacrylamide was polymerized in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml His-c-Jun-(1–79), His-c-Jun-(1–79, S63A/S73A), or 400 μg/ml MBP. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed by incubation in 20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h. The gel was then washed for 1 h with 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To denature the proteins, gels were incubated in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h. Proteins were then renatured by overnight incubation in 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 0.04% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For the protein kinase assays, gels were equilibrated for 1 h in kinase buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 100 μm NaVO4. The kinase reaction was carried out for 1 h in kinase buffer with 30 μm ATP and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. Finally, the gels were washed extensively in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate until washes were free of radioactivity. Autoradiography of dried gel was performed at −80 °C. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight with anti-p38 MAPK antibody and then with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold whole cell extract buffer. The immunecomplex p38 MAPK activity assay using MBP or GST-ATF-2-(1–96) as the substrate was performed at 30 °C for 20 min in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (5 μg of MBP or GST-ATF-2-(1–96), 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 mm HEPES, and 20 mm MgCl2). The reaction was terminated with Laemmli sample buffer and the products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated MBP or GST-ATF-2 was visualized by autoradiography. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight with anti-MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 antibodies and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold whole cell extract buffer. The immunecomplex MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 activity assay using GST-p38 MAPK (10 μg/reaction) as the substrate was performed at 30 °C for 20 min in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (10 μg of GST-p38 MAPK, 100 μm ATP, 25 mm HEPES, and 20 mmMgCl2). The reaction was terminated with Laemmli sample buffer and the products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated p38 MAPK was detected by anti-phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibody by Western blot analysis and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. PGE2 in the overlying culture media was measured by a PGE2 ELISA Kit (Cayman Chemical). All the experiments were performed at least three times. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by using a paired or unpaired Student'st test. A difference with a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A MEKK1 inducible model system was utilized in which NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with a constitutively active truncated fragment of MEKK1 (the C-terminal 324 amino acids, ΔMEKK-1) under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. Confluent normal NIH 3T3 cells as well as ΔMEKK1 3T3 cells were incubated for varying periods of time with 1 mm IPTG to confirm overexpression of ΔMEKK1 protein by Western blot assay using an anti-MEKK1 antibody. Normal NIH 3T3 cells were virtually unaffected by IPTG stimulation. By comparison, in MEKK1 3T3 cells, ΔMEKK1 expression was minimally detected under basal conditions and was maximally induced at 12–36 h following IPTG stimulation (Fig. 1). Notably, the MEKK1 antibody detected duplicate bands of equal intensity following IPTG stimulation. Previous data suggests that the lower band represents untagged ΔMEKK1 (resulting from an internal initiation product), whereas the upper band represents the EE epitope-tagged ΔMEKK1 (24Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether activation of ΔMEKK1 expression induces prostaglandin biosynthesis. Comparison of untreated ΔMEKK1 3T3 cells with cells induced by IPTG demonstrates an approximately 4-fold enhancement in PGE2 production (Fig.2 B). Since cyclooxygenase is a key rate-limiting enzyme which mediates prostaglandin biosynthesis, we further examined whether the enhancement of PGE2 production was correlated with changes in the expression of these enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2 A, induction of ΔMEKK1 by IPTG resulted in a significant increase in Cox-2 expression. However, induction of ΔMEKK1 did not increase either Cox-1 or cPLA2 protein expression (data not shown). To demonstrate whether MEKK1-induced PGE2 synthesis is mediated by the activation of Cox-2, a Cox-2 specific inhibitor, NS-398, was utilized. As shown in TableI, NS-398, at a concentration of 0.1 μm, completely blocked PGE2 production induced by the activation of MEKK1. These findings suggest that Cox-2 plays an important role in MEKK1-induced PGE2biosynthesis.Figure 2ΔMEKK1 induces Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production.

Results are expressed at mean ± S.E. (n = 3). To investigate the signal transduction pathway responsible for mediating induction of COX-2 expression in MEKK1 cells, in-gel kinase assays using His-c-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate were performed to measure SAPK activity following ΔMEKK1 induction by IPTG. Fig.3 A demonstrates that two bands corresponding to the molecular weights of p46 SAPK and p54/55 SAPK were maximally induced in MEKK1 3T3 cells by 24 h after IPTG induction. Similar experiments utilizing mutated His-c-Jun-(1–79, S63A/S73A) as a substrate demonstrated no phosphorylation of this substrate (Fig.3 B). Similarly, Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-specific JNK which recognizes both phosphorylated (and presumably active) p46 SAPK and p54/55 SAPK further illustrated that ΔMEKK-1 induction could increase phosphorylation of both p46 SAPK and p54/55 SAPK, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Western blot analysis employing a pan-JNK antibody (which also recognizes murine SAPK) indicated that ΔMEKK1 induction did not influence total protein expression of p46 SAPK or p54/55 SAPK (Fig. 3 D). Recent data generated in our laboratory has suggested that the p38 MAPK activated pathway may contribute to the signaling mechanism for IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and prostaglandin synthesis in renal mesangial cells (20Guan Z.H. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). With this data in mind and the above observations linking Cox-2 expression with MEKK-1 activation, we assessed IPTG-induced ΔMEKK1 3T3 cells for p38 MAPK activity. As shown in Fig.4, p38 MAPK activity increased within 24–36 h after ΔMEKK1 induction which was examined by immunocomplex kinase assay using MBP (Fig. 4 A) or GST-ATF-2-(1–96) (Fig.4 B) as the substrate. This increase in activity was further correlated with Western blot analysis illustrating increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at 24 h following IPTG stimulation (Fig. 4 D). Western blot analysis using anti-p38 MAPK indicated that total protein expression was unaffected by ΔMEKK1 induction (Fig. 4 C). Together, these results demonstrate a role for MEKK1, a kinase heretofore considered upstream of the SAPK pathway, as an activator of p38 MAPK in an intact cell system. Previous in vitro and overexpression studies suggest that MEKK1 is able to activate and phosphorylate MEK which in turn, can phosphorylate and activate ERK (23Yan M. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19067-19073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). However, similar to observations by Yan et al. (22Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of ΔMEKK1 at the functional time points failed to activate ERK (data not shown) although SAPK and p38 MAPK were phosphorylated and activated. To ascertain whether p38 MAPK signaling pathways mediate PGE2 production and cyclooxygenase expression induced by ΔMEKK1 induction, we studied the effects of SC68376, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK. SC68376 directly inhibits p38 MAPK catalytic activity (IC50 of 2–5 μm) without influencing ERK and JNK activity. When ΔMEKK1 3T3 cells were treated with 1 mm IPTG and 10 μm SC68376 for 24 h, the inhibitor completely eliminated Cox-2 expression and concomitant PGE2 production normally induced by ΔMEKK1 induction. As shown in Fig.5, SC68376 exhibits selectivity for inhibition of Cox-2 protein expression. There was negligible influence on MEKK-1, SAPK, and cPLA2 expression (data not shown). Similarly, PGE2 production induced by ΔMEKK1 was completely inhibited by the presence of 10 μm SC68376 (Fig. 5). The above observations confirm that the activation of p38 MAPK provides a crucial signaling mechanism which promotes Cox-2 expression and prostaglandin biosynthesis. Previous data has suggested that SEK1/MKK4 is the immediate upstream kinase of SAPK/JNK (26Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Therefore, we decided to investigate whether this proposed signaling cascade was responsible for expression of Cox-2 and activation of p38 MAPK in ΔMEKK1 inducible cells. In accordance with previous findings, IPTG induction of ΔMEKK1 produced phosphorylation of SEK1/MKK4 (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, our experiments also demonstrated that the active ΔMEKK1 resulted in an increase of SEK1/MKK4 activity which was demonstrated by its ability to enhance p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). However, phosphorylation of both MKK3 and MKK6 (as evidenced using an anti-phospho-MKK3/MKK6 antibody) was not induced by IPTG stimulation (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, these findings were reinforced by immunocomplex kinase assays using p38 MAPK as the substrate for either MKK3 (Fig. 7 B) or MKK6 activities (Fig. 7 C). As a positive control, anisomycin (31Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Cuenda A. Barratt M.J. Cohen P. Mahadevan L.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1028-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) activated MKK3/MKK6 phosphorylation and activation in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 7 A, right panel). Thus in both circumstances, either via kinase activity assay or direct phosphorylation analysis, MKK3 and MKK6 were not activated with IPTG induction of p38 MAPK activity. These findings suggest a signaling mechanism for activation of p38 MAPK involving activation of SEK1/MKK4 induced by MEKK1.Figure 7MEKK1 does not induce MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylation and activati"
https://openalex.org/W2080590768,"Members of the Rho family of small GTPases activate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (Perona, R., Montaner, S., Saniger, L., SaÖnchez-Pérez, I., Bravo, R., and Lacal, J. C. (1997), Genes & Dev. 11, 463–475). We have investigated whether different members of the family of exchange factors specific for Rho proteins (Dbl family) could activate the transcription factor NF-κB and have explored both their specificity under in vivo conditions and the mechanisms involved. Activated forms of Dbl, Ost, and Vav proteins induce NF-κB activation. While the activation induced by the Vav oncogen was efficiently inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, the corresponding mutant of Cdc42Hs was able to block selectively NF-κB activation mediated by Dbl. Finally, mutants of RhoA and Cdc42Hs, but not that of Rac1, inhibited the activation of NF-κB by Ost. Thus, under in vivo conditions, different members of the Dbl family are related to specific Rho GTPases for the regulation of NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB by Rho or Ras proteins is mutually independent. However, there is a link between the NF-κB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) cascades since a dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 is able to inhibit NF-κB activation induced by Rac1 and Cdc42Hs proteins, but not by RhoA. These results indicate that, in mammalian cells, multiple pathways coexist for the activation of NF-κB, some of which are mediated by specific members of the Ras and Rho families of small GTPases. Members of the Rho family of small GTPases activate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (Perona, R., Montaner, S., Saniger, L., SaÖnchez-Pérez, I., Bravo, R., and Lacal, J. C.

These results indicate that, in mammalian cells, multiple pathways coexist for the activation of NF-κB, some of which are mediated by specific members of the Ras and Rho families of small GTPases. The Rho family of small GTPases are involved in the regulation of critical cellular functions, such as cell growth, apoptosis, invasion, and cytoskeleton organization, and in several aspects of development (2Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 3Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). During the last few years, a growing body of evidence has emerged revealing the implication of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs proteins in signal transduction cascades that regulate the activity of different transcription factors. Constitutively activated forms of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs GTPases are able to induce the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK/SAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; SRF, serum response factor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MEKK1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinase kinase; MEKK1 WT, MEKK1 wild-type. in COS-7, NIH-3T3, and HeLa cells (4Coso O.A.

Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). However, RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, and Cdc42Hs, but not Rac1, induce the activation of JNK/SAPK in human kidney 293T cells (6Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Activated Rac1 and Cdc42Hs mutants have also been shown to activate the p38/Mpk2 pathway, which is induced by different stress conditions (5Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hill et al. (7Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar) have reported the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the serum response factor (SRF) by RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42Hs mediated by, at least, two independent mechanisms. Recently, our group has described the activation of the nuclear factor κB by members of the Rho family of small GTP binding proteins (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The NF-κB complex is composed of different homodimers and heterodimers of the members of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors. In its inactive state, NF-κB is located in the cytoplasm where it is retained by a third inhibitory protein denominated IκB (8Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Activation by multiple external stimuli triggers the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of the IκB protein, releasing the NF-κB dimer, which translocates to the nucleus and binds DNA. We have reported that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs GTPases induce the transactivation of the NF-κB-dependent HIV promoter in COS-7, NIH-3T3, and Jurkat cells. Rho proteins activate the translocation of NF-κB complexes by inducing the phosphorylation of the IκBα isoform in Ser-32 and Ser-36 residues. Furthermore, RhoA and Cdc42Hs seem to mediate specifically the activation of NF-κB by certain physiological stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The activity of Rho proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that promote the transition between the inactive, GDP-bound state and the active, GTP-bound state of these GTPases (10Lacal J.C. McCormick F. The ras Superfamily of GTPases. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 259-282Google Scholar). Rho-related exchange factors acquire tumorigenic activity by deletion of their N-terminal region, and in fact, most of them have been identified as potent oncogenes isolated from different transformed cell lines. The ability of catalyzing the GDP/GTP exchange is critically mediated by two conserved regions of these molecules, designated as the Dbl homology (DH) domain and the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (11Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Because of these features, these exchange factors have been enclosed in a rapidly growing family known as the Dbl family, which includes the Dbl protein itself, identified in 1985 from a diffuse B-cell lymphoma (12Eva A. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), Ost, isolated from a rat osteosarcoma (13Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Vav, cloned as a transforming gene from a human hematopoietic cell line (14Katzav S. MartıÖn-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Results derived from in vitro experiments have shown that the members of the Dbl family have a wide specificity regarding their nucleotide exchange activity for the different Rho proteins. Nevertheless, during the last few years, a considerable effort has been made in order to identify which processes these Dbl-related proteins could mediate in vivo. Overexpression of some of these exchange factors induces cytoskeleton arrangements that had previously been related to RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42Hs (15Ridley A.J. Hall A.

On the other hand, there is also abundant information relating activation of Rho proteins with signaling events. Thus, activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase is induced by overexpression of the Dbl and Fgd1 proteins (22Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol.

Moreover, activation of JNK/SAPK induced by Vav and Tiam1 oncogenes seems to be inhibited by the dominant negative mutant of Rac1, Rac1/Asn-17 (20Michiels F. Stam J.C.

These results indicate that the Dbl-related guanine nucleotide exchange factors have a limited specificity for Rho proteins in vivo. Although it is well established that Rho GTPases are regulated by specific nucleotide exchange factors that generically belong to the Dbl family of proteins, little is known about their specificity under physiological conditions. In this study, we have investigated further the pathways leading to the activation of NF-κB where Rho proteins are implicated. Both specificity by some members of the family of exchange factors for Rho proteins and the mechanisms involved are addressed. Simian COS-7 fibroblast-like cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mmglutamine. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method in 60-mm dishes (25Perona R. Esteve P. Jiménez B. Ballestero R.P. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 5–6 μg/plate. (−453/+80) HIV-LUC reporter containing the two NF-κB binding sites of the HIV enhancer region and the same plasmid with 3-base pair substitutions in the κB sites (ΔHIV-LUC) were previously described (26Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). The 5 × Gal4-LUC reporter and the plasmids GAL4-c-Jun(1–223) and GAL4-c-Jun(1–223;A63/73) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego). GAL4-c-Jun(1–223) and GAL4-c-Jun(1–223;A63/73) expression vectors encode for fusion proteins containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the c-Jun activation domain (5Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Both phosphorylation sites by JNK/SAPK are substituted by alanine residues in GAL4-c-Jun(1–223;A63/73) protein. The plasmids pJ5Ω-MEKK1 WT and pJ5Ω-MEKKΔ(K432M) were also kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin. The vector pJ5Ω-MEKKΔ(K432M) codifies for a catalytically inactive MEKK1 mutant (5Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). PCDNAIIIB-derived vectors containing cDNAs for constitutively activated RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs proteins (QL) and pCEV27-derived vectors encoding the dominant mutants RhoA/Asn-19, Rac1/Asn-17 and Cdc42Hs/Asn-17 were kindly provided by Drs. T. Miki (NCI, National Institutes of Health) and S. Gutkind (National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD). Plasmids pZIP-Neo-Ras/Asn-17 and pZip-Neo-C4-Raf were a generous gift from L. Feig (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston) and U. Rapp (Universitat Wurzburg, Germany), respectively, and have been previously described (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Oncogenic versions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho proteins are as follows: pMEX-derived vector encoding for a truncated Vav protein that lacks the helix-loop-helix domain (PJC7) was kindly provided by Dr. X. Bustelo (SUNY, Stony Brook); pZipNeo-derived vector encoding for a truncated Dbl protein (12Eva A. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and PCEV27-derived vector encoding for a truncated Ost protein (13Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. S. Gutkind and T. Miki, respectively. Cells were transfected as described above and harvested 24 h after transfection. Protein extracts for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were obtained as described previously (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Transfection of the (−453/+80) HIV-LUC reporter was used for the determination of the NF-κB activity. Analysis of c-Jun transcriptional activation by JNK/SAPK was performed by transfection of the 5 × Gal4-LUC reporter and the plasmids GAL4-c-Jun(1–223) or GAL4-c-Jun(1–223;A63/73). Transfection efficiencies were routinely corrected by obtaining the ratio of the luciferase and the β-galactosidase activities observed in the same sample. Results are expressed as -fold induction considering 1 as the luciferase activity of the cells transfected with the corresponding empty vector or as percentage of maximal induction. We have recently described that members of the Rho family of small GTP binding proteins are capable of activating the transcription factor NF-κB (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either normal or constitutively activated forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs induced the transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter, which is mostly mediated by the presence of two κB binding sites in its enhancer region (26Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of NF-κB by Rho proteins implicated the translocation of RelA/p50 and p50/p50 dimers to the nucleus and was observed in a variety of cell types, such as simian COS-7, murine NIH-3T3, and human T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells. Overexpression of Rho GTPases has been useful to reveal the possible role of these molecules in the regulation of NF-κB. However, it could also induce artifacts that are not representative of their physiological role due to improper localization or other indirect effects. Activation of Rho proteins is catalyzed under physiological conditions by the activation of certain specific nucleotide exchange factors that belong to the Dbl family of proteins. Thus, we investigated whether some of these Dbl-related molecules, which are known specific exchange factors for Rho proteins, were able to activate NF-κB. COS-7 cells were transfected with the HIV-LUC plasmid as a reporter along with the expression vectors encoding for the constitutively activated forms of Dbl, Ost, and Vav proteins or their corresponding empty vectors. These oncogenic versions contain a deletion in their N-terminal domain that confers transforming potential to these molecules. As shown in Fig.1 A, transient expression of either Dbl, Ost, or Vav oncogenes was able to induce the transactivation of the HIV promoter, as we had observed for the constitutively activated Rho proteins (QL-mutants). This activation was mostly due to the presence of the two κB sites located in the HIV enhancer domain because this effect was blocked when a mutant plasmid ΔHIV-LUC with 3-base pair substitutions in the κB sites was used (data not shown). By contrast, while a significant activation was obtained with the corresponding Rho proteins as previously reported (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), no effect was observed by the overexpression of the PKCζ isoenzyme, in keeping with previous reports (27Genot E.M.

Activation of the transcriptional activity of c-Jun induced by all these proteins was also assayed in parallel experiments. The corresponding vectors for the activated forms of Rho GTPases and the truncated versions of Dbl, Ost, and Vav were cotransfected in COS-7 cells along with the 5 × GAL4-LUC reporter and the plasmid GAL4-c-Jun(1–223) encoding for a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the c-Jun activation domain (5Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, expression of either Rac1 or Cdc42Hs was able to induce the c-Jun transcriptional activity while expression of RhoA was negative as the expression of PKCζ, in agreement with previous reports (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). The oncogenic forms of Dbl, Vav, and Ost proteins were also able to induce the activation of the c-Jun transcription factor. This effect was mediated by the phosphorylation of c-Jun at residues serines 63 and 73, since activation was efficiently blocked by cotransfection of the plasmid GAL4-c-Jun(1–223;A63/73). These results indicate that members of the family of specific exchange factors for Rho proteins, in addition to the JNK/SAPK cascade, are able to activate the transcription factor NF-κB. These results provide further evidence to support the concept that Rho proteins may be involved in the physiological regulation of NF-κB. Using NF-κB activation as a reporter assay, we next investigated whether distinct proteins of the Dbl family of exchange factors had any degree of specificity for different members of the Rho family of small GTPases. This information may be very useful to identify the physiological pathways where each Rho protein may exert its regulatory function on NF-κB-dependent transcription. The product of the vav proto-oncogen is mostly expressed in hematopoietic cell lines, and this exchange factor has been found to be critical for antigen receptor-mediated activation and proliferation of B and T lymphocytes (14Katzav S. MartıÖn-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 30Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L.J.

Recently it has been described that a truncated Vav protein could efficiently activate the JNK/SAPK by a Rac1-dependent pathway since a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, Rac/Asn-17, inhibited the activation induced by this exchange factor (24Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. LoÖpez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Rac1 GDP/GTP exchange reaction catalyzed by Vav is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation (32Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the specificity for this exchange factor regarding the activation of NF-κB. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the corresponding expression vectors encoding for the constitutively activated form of Vav and the dominant negative mutants of Rho proteins, RhoA/Asn-19, Rac1/Asn-17, and Cdc42Hs/Asn-17, along with the HIV-LUC reporter. As shown in Fig. 2, only the dominant negative mutant Rac1/Asn-17 was able to block efficiently the activation of NF-κB mediated by the overexpression of Vav. Neither RhoA/Asn-19 nor Cdc42Hs/Asn-17 expression had a significant inhibitory effect on this assay. These results corroborate that this exchange factor seems to be selective for Rac1 GTPase. Similar studies were also carried out with the Dbl exchange factor. The Dbl protein had previously shown in vitro exchange activity for both RhoA and Cdc42Hs GTPases (33Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 34Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is capable of activating the JNK/SAPK cascade in COS-7 cells and phosphoprotein 70 S6 kinase in NIH-3T3 cells (4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 23Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the expression vector of the activated form of Dbl and the different dominant negative mutants of Rho proteins, along with the HIV-LUC reporter. As shown in Fig. 3, the dominant negative mutant of Cdc42Hs was capable of efficiently interfering the activation of NF-κB induced by overexpression of Dbl. By contrast, no significant inhibitory effect in the activation of NF-κB by Dbl was observed by the expression of the RhoA mutant, RhoA/Asn-19 or the Rac1 mutant, Rac1/Asn-17. Thus, even though there isin vitro evidence for exchange activity of Dbl for both GTPases, Cdc42Hs but not RhoA play a role in the activation of NF-κB induced by Dbl. These results also indicate that Dbl oncogen could induce the NF-κB transcriptional activity by catalyzing the GDP/GTP transition for Rho proteins in a selective manner. Finally, the specificity for the Ost exchange factor was also investigated. Horii et al. (13Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reported the in vitro GDP/GTP exchange activity of Ost for RhoA and Cdc42Hs. Furthermore, this molecule was able to bind specifically to the Rac1-GTP form, suggesting that Ost could also serve as an effector molecule for this GTPase. In keeping with these results, in vivo experiments have shown that Ost is able to activate the JNK/SAPK cascade in COS-7 cells (4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). However, no evidence is available to link Ost to RhoA under in vivo conditions since RhoA is not able to activate the JNK/SAPK in this cell system. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the encoding vector for the activated Ost protein along with the dominant negative mutants of the Rho proteins and the HIV-LUC reporter. As shown in Fig. 4, both RhoA/Asn-19 and Cdc42Hs/Asn-17 could efficiently block the transactivation of the HIV promoter induced by Ost. Thus both RhoA and Cdc42Hs seem to mediate the activation of NF-κB induced by this exchange factor. By contrast, we did not see any significant effect due to the expression of Rac1/Asn-17 with less than 20–25% inhibition. These results suggest that the Ost exchange factor can indeed promote the GDP/GTP transition, under in vivo conditions, for either RhoA or Cdc42Hs, and this activity seems to mediate the activation of NF-κB, but it does not affect Rac1, in agreement with the in vitro experiments reported by Horii et al. (13Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). From all these experiments, we can conclude that different exchange factors such as Dbl, Ost, and Vav proteins induce the activation of NF-κB by the regulation of specific members of the Rho family of GTPases. These data also indicate that these exchange factors, regardless of their activities under in vitro conditions, have a selective activity for these GTPases in vivo. Since each exchange factor may respond to the activation of specific receptors for growth factors and cytokines under physiological circumstances, they provide valuable information in order to identify the specific pathways where Rho GTPases may play a functional role in the regulation of NF-κB. As an extension of these results, Rho proteins can be related to the biological functions also described for NF-κB, such as regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, in agreement with previous results from our group (25Perona R.

We next investigated the mechanisms by which Rho GTPases and their exchange factors mediate the activation of NF-κB. It is important to note that Ras proteins do also activate the transcription factor NF-κB (41Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 42Finco T.S. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5273-5279PubMed Google Scholar) and that several groups have recently reported that Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs proteins mediate in the signaling cascades which confer transforming activity to the H-RasVal12 oncogene (37Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 38Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J.

However, this is not a universal effect since several signaling pathways which regulate the activity of different transcription factors activated by Rho and Ras have shown to be independent (4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 7Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the H-Ras/Raf kinase pathway was involved in the activation of NF-κB induced by Rho proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 A, we were not able to detect any effect of the overexpression of the dominant negative mutants of H-Ras and Raf kinase (H-Ras/Asn-17 and Raf-C4) in the transactivation of the HIV promoter induced by RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42Hs proteins. These results indicate that Rho-mediated activation of NF-κB is either independent of the Ras/Raf pathway or that it is located downstream of Ras. We then studied whether the Rho proteins could affect the activation of NF-κB mediated by the H-Ras protein. To that end, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the expression vectors of H-Ras-Val12 and the dominant negative mutants of Rho proteins, RhoA/Asn-19, Rac1/Asn-17, and Cdc42Hs/Asn-17 along with the HIV-LUC plasmid. In keeping with our previous results (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. SaÖnchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), the induction of the HIV-LUC reporter in response to TNFα was efficiently inhibited by the overexpression of the dominant negative mutants of RhoA and Cdc42Hs proteins (Fig.5 B), indicating that these two GTPases were implicated in this pathway. However, neither of the three Rho mutants had any significant effect in the activation of NF-κB induced by the H-Ras-Val12 protein. These results provide strong evidence that the signal transduction cascades regulated by H-Ras and Rho GTPases for NF-κB activation are mutually independent. It has also been shown that cytokines such as TNFα or environmental stress such as UV irradiation can induce both c-Jun and NF-κB activities simultaneously, a result that could suggest a cross-talking among these two signaling events. Thus, we then explored the possibility of a common link between the Rho-dependent signal transduction pathways that regulate the activity of c-Jun and NF-κB transcription factors. In this regard, it has been reported that overexpression of MEKK1 (JNKKK) is able to induce the transactivation of the HIV and IL-2Rα promoters in Jurkat cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner (44Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a kinase-defective, dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 inhibits the transactivation of a κB-CAT reporter induced by TNFα in NIH-3T3 cells (45Hirano M. Osada S. Aoki T. Hirai S. Hosaka M. Inoue J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Lee et al. (29Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) have also observed that MEKK1 is able to activate the IκBα kinase complex, which is responsible of the site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα in Ser-32 and Ser-36 residues. Thus, we investigated whether MEKK1 was involved in the activation of the nuclear factor κB induced by members of the Rho family of small GTP binding proteins. To that end, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the HIV-LUC plasmid and the derived expression vectors encoding for the wild type form of the kinase MEKK1, along with the constitutively activated forms (QL) of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs proteins or their corresponding empty vectors. As shown in Fig.6 A, the MEKK1 wild type protein was capable of activating NF-κB in COS-7 cells, acting in a cooperative manner in the transactivation of the HIV promoter when coexpressed with Rac1 (QL) or Cdc42Hs (QL). By contrast, the activation by the expression of the RhoA (QL) protein was not affected by the MEKK1 cotransfection. Furthermore, when the constitutively activated forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs were coexpressed with a catalytically inactive, dominant negative mutant of MEKK1, MEKKΔ(K432M), the transactivation of the HIV promoter by Rac1 (QL) and Cdc42Hs (QL) was efficiently inhibited, whereas this dominant negative mutant had no effect on the activation mediated by RhoA (QL) (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, but not RhoA, activate the transcription factor NF-κB through a MEKK1-dependent cascade. A further conclusion from these results is that activation of MEKK1 by Rac1 and Cdc42Hs can be a common link between the JNK/SAPK pathway and the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, agonists that activate Rac1 or Cdc42Hs may simultaneously activate these two pathways through MEKK1. On the other side, RhoA seems to follow an MEKK1-independent mechanism for the activation of NF-κB, and in keeping with this, it does not activate the JNK/SAPK pathway in the COS-7 cells (Fig.1 B). In summary, we have found that constitutively activated forms of Dbl, Ost and Vav proteins, known exchange factors for Rho GTPases, induce the transactivation of the NF-κB-dependent HIV promoter. We have investigated the in vivo specificity of these molecules for the different Rho GTPases and found that Dbl activates NF-κB in a Cdc42Hs-dependent manner while Vav seems to be selective for Rac1. Finally, both RhoA and Cdc42Hs are required for the activation of NF-κB by Ost. We have also concluded that Rho and H-Ras GTPases activate NF-κB by mutually independent cascades. We report that the wild type form of MEKK1 induces the transactivation of the HIV promoter in COS-7 cells. Activation of NF-κB by Rac1 and Cdc42Hs GTPases, but not that of RhoA, can be efficiently blocked by a kinase-defective mutant of MEKK1, indicating that Rac1 and Cdc42Hs activate the transcription factor NF-κB by a MEKK1-dependent pathway while RhoA follows an MEKK1-independent mechanism. Our study provides evidence for a cross-talking between NF-κB and JNK/SAPK pathways in COS-7 cells where specific members of the Rho family of GTPases are involved. All these results can be summarized in the scheme shown in Fig.7, where some of the signaling cascades in which the Ras and Rho GTPases participate are depicted. The results shown here open a new perspective in deciphering the relevance of Rho proteins in the regulation of multiple signal transduction pathways that control gene regulation and trigger diverse responses in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968545456,"Phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including vesicular transport, the respiratory burst, and mitogenesis. PLD1, first cloned from human, is activated by small GTPases such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and RhoA. Rodent PLD2, which is approximately 50% identical to PLD1 has recently been cloned from mouse embryo (Colley, W., Sung, T., Roll, R., Jenco, J., Hammond, S., Altshuller, Y., Bar-Sagi, D., Morris, A., and Frohman, M.

The mRNA for PLD2 was widely distributed in various tissues including peripheral blood leukocytes, and the distribution was distinctly different from that of hPLD1. hPLD1 and hPLD2 both showed a requirement for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Both isoforms showed optimal activity at 10–20 mol % phosphatidylcholine in a mixed lipid vesicle system and showed comparable basal activities in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Unexpectedly, ARF-1 stimulated the activity of hPLD2 expressed in insect cells about 2-fold, compared with a 20-fold stimulation of hPLD1 activity.

PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids, usually phosphatidylcholine, to generate phosphatidic acid plus the head group. Phosphatidic acid may act directly as a signaling molecule (2Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Tilly B.C. Verlaan I. Bierman A.J. de Latt S.W.

The latter may function as an activator of protein kinase C isoforms and possibly other diacylglycerol-dependent enzymes. PLD can be activated in cells by a variety of extracellular agonists including those that bind to G protein-coupled receptors (e.g. the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor in neutrophils) and those that stimulate receptor tyrosine kinases (3Lambeth J.D.

Phorbol esters are also potent activators of PLD in a variety of cell systems, implicating protein kinase C in PLD regulation. PLD activities from mammalian cells were initially studied in broken or permeabilized cell preparations.

These and other differences (e.g. subcellular localization, Ca2+ requirement, activation or inhibition by oleate, etc.) implied that several isoforms of PLD exist (3Lambeth J.D. Kuo J.F.

A rat PLD1 (rPLD1) has also recently been cloned and characterized (25Park S.-K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and shows similar properties to hPLD1. Two splice variants of PLD1 have been identified (15Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

A second isoform of PLD, PLD2, was recently cloned from mouse (mPLD2) (26Colley W. Sung T. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A. Frohman M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and rat (rPLD2) (27Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11408-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Both of the rodent PLD2s require PIP2 for activity and, unlike hPLD1, are constitutively active in the absence of other activating factors when PIP2 is present. Neither ARF nor other protein factors have been reported to further activate rodent PLD2. In the present studies, we have cloned, expressed, and partially characterized a PLD2 isoform from human cells, and we have compared its properties with those of hPLD1. Unexpectedly, hPLD2 is activated not only by PIP2 but also by ARF-1. Although the magnitude of the activation of hPLD2 by ARF is smaller than that of hPLD1, these data suggest that hPLD2 contains an ARF binding/regulatory site and that ARF along with other unknown factors may activate this isoform. A computer search of the human GenBankTM expressed sequence tag (EST) data base was conducted using regions sharing high homology among PLDs fromRicinus communis, cabbage, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to identify human mRNAs related to PLDs. Two EST clones, yq12f08.r1 and yq16g08.r1, showed a high degree of homology and contained putative open reading frames. Two hybridization probes (350 base pairs each) were generated from these EST clones using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers specific to the open reading frame of these EST clones, yq12f08.r1 (5′-GAGTATTCAATCCTGCATCGCCTT-3′ and 5′-GATCC AAGTCTGGCCGGGTATT-3′) and yq16g08.r1 (5′-GCCCTTACTCCCTGGCTTCGAG-3′ and 5′-ATGGTTCCGTCTCTGTGTCCTCG-3′). These probes were radiolabeled by the random priming method (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) and were used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed HSC-93 B-cell plasmid (pREP4) library (containing 3 × 1010 individual clones), obtained from Dr. Manuel Buchwald (University of Toronto). The average insert size of this library was approximately 1 kb; however, cDNA insert sizes of 4.6, 3.2, and 2.3 kb have been recovered in this library (29Strathdee C. Gavish H. Shannon W. Buchwald M. Nature. 1992; 356: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Two million clones were screened by Southern analysis starting with 20 plasmid DNA samples, each representing 100,000 individual cDNA clones. The plasmid DNA samples were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred onto nylon filters, and then hybridized overnight with the random-primed (Prime-It; Stratagene) [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 mNaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 1% SDS. Filters were washed twice at low (42 °C for 10 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) stringency and exposed overnight to film. Two positive pools of cDNAs were identified, which were then plated at 50,000 clones/plate; nylon filter lifts from these plates were hybridized overnight with random-primed (Prime-It; Stratagene) [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes (yq12f08.r1 and yq16g08.r1) at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 mNaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 1% SDS. Filters were washed twice under low stringency conditions (42 °C for 10 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS), and positive clones were identified and purified. Restriction enzyme analysis using BamHI revealed that all of the clones contained 1.3- or 2-kb inserts. The cloned cDNAs were sequenced using the Taq dye terminator method at the University of Georgia Molecular Genetics Facility, Department of Genetics, using Applied Biosystems 373 and 377 automatic sequencers. The full-length hPLD2 cDNA was generated by 5′ and 3′-RACE using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The cDNA was reverse transcribed from poly(A)+ mRNA obtained from the B-cell line, HSC-93 (a kind gift from Dr. Manuel Buchwald), using the cDNA synthesis primer provided with the kit. The PCR amplification was carried out using an adaptor primer (AP1; 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) provided with the kit and gene-specific forward, 5′GTGCAGCTGGACCGGCCTTTCGAAGA -3′ (3′-RACE) or reverse primers, 5′-GGAGAGTGGGTTGGGGTGTTAGGCTGAAG-3′ (5′-RACE). The first round PCR was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of 94 °C for 1 min, five cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 4 min, another five cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The second round of PCR was performed under the same conditions using a 1:50 dilution of the first round PCR amplification mixture as the template, adaptor primer 2 (AP2; 5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) and a nested gene-specific primer, 5′-ATTGGCCGTGCTGGTAGACTTGGGAA-3′ (5′-RACE). A Southern blot analysis using an end-labeled internal oligonucleotide (5-CTCCCACATACCCCTACCTGCTTCC-3) 5′ from the PCR primers confirmed that the PCR product contained the expected sequence. The PCR product was subcloned into the PCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Positive clones were identified by hybridizing filter lifts with the same labeled oligonucleotide that was described for the Southern blots. Clones containing the expected size DNA fragment were then sequenced along both strands. A single 1.8-kb DNA fragment was obtained after first round 3′-RACE. A Southern blot analysis of this band showed hybridization to an end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-CCAATCAGCTCCCCTTCACACTTCC-3′) probe. The fragment was subcloned into PCR2.1, and positive clones were identified by hybridization to the same oligonucleotide probe and analyzed by restriction digests to identify clones containing inserts greater than 1.6 kb. Those clones containing the expected size DNA fragment were sequenced along both strands. The full-length cDNA was obtained by ligating both the 5′ and 3′ cDNA fragments at theBstBI restriction site in the overlapping region and subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Human multiple-tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane were probed with full-length cDNA of hPLD1, hPLD2, or β-actin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 30 ng of hPLD1, hPLD2, or β-actin were random-primed with [α-32P]dCTP (<6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Unincorporated radionucleotide was removed from the probe by using Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The radiolabeled probes were then denatured by boiling for 5 min and placed on ice. Membranes were prehybridized in 15 ml of ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) with continuous shaking at 68 °C for 1 h. The prehybridization buffer was replaced with 10 ml of fresh ExpressHyb solution containing the radiolabeled probe. After a 2-h incubation at 68 °C with continuous shaking, the blots were quickly rinsed several times with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in the same buffer. This was followed by two 20-min washes with fresh 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and continuous shaking. The blots were then wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to HyperFilm MP x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C with two intensifying screens for 4–24 h before developing the film. Blots exposed to multiple probes were stripped of the first probe as suggested by the manufacturer's protocols. The hPLD2 cDNA was inserted into the unique EcoRI and KpnI sites of the pAcHLT-A baculovirus transfer vector (Pharmingen). Plasmids used for co-transfections were purified using Qiagen kits. Sf9 insect cells used for co-transfection and amplification were grown in IPL-41 insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 4 g/liter yeastolate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.6 g/liter tryptose phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Monolayers of exponentially growing Sf9 insect cells (3 × 106 cells in a 60-mm plate) were transfected with a mixture of the transfer vector (5 mg) alone or hPLD2 containing transfer vector (5 μg) and linearized BaculoGold virus DNA (0.5 μg) (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The virus was amplified by infecting a monolayer culture of Sf9 cells (8 × 106 cells in a 75-cm2 flask, approximately 80% confluent) for 5 days at 27 °C. The high titer virus stocks were stored at 4 °C. High five (Hi5) cells (Invitrogen) were used for expression of hPLD2. Monolayers of exponentially growing cells were cultured in ExCell 401 serum-free insect culture medium (JRH) in a 27 °C incubator. Insect cells (8 × 106 cells in a 75-cm2 flask) were infected with recombinant baculovirus obtained from the co-transfection. The infected cells were grown for 3 days in ExCell 401 medium. At the end of the infection period, the cells were detached, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet, washed once with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm pepstatin). The cells were then disrupted by N2 cavitation for 20 min at 500 p.s.i. and 4 °C and centrifuged at 500 × g to remove intact cells. The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 540,960 × gfor 20 min to obtain membrane and cytosolic fractions. Samples were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose at room temperature for 1 h at 5 V using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). PLD2 was detected by Western blot analysis using a primary antibody to either a peptide (DRPFEDFIDRETT) specific to PLD2 or an anti-tetra-His antibody (Qiagen) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (IgG). The PLD activity was determined as described by Brown et al. (9Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Membranes (5 μg of protein) from infected or uninfected Hi5 insect cells were incubated on ice in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm CaCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The substrate was added in the form of phospholipid dispersions composed of 5 mol % PIP2 (Sigma), 10 mol % dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC; Avanti Polar Lipids), 85 mol % dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; Avanti Polar Lipids), andl-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ([methyl-3H]choline; [3H]PC; NEN Life Science Products). [3H]PC (30–60 Ci/mmol) was added to give 300,000 dpm/assay. The total lipid concentration was 115 μm. Lipids were prepared by drying the appropriate amount of stock lipids under a stream of nitrogen. Lipid stocks were stored as chloroform solutions, and their concentrations were determined by a phosphorus assay (30Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residual chloroform was removed by placing the lipids under vacuum. The lipids were rehydrated in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, containing 80 mm KCl and were sonicated using a bath type sonicator. For some assays, the lipid composition was varied as indicated. Upon initiation of reaction, samples were transferred to a 37 °C shaking water bath. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min in a volume of 150 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of CHCl3/MeOH/HCL (50:50:0.3, v/v/v) and 350 μl of 1 m HCl, 5 mm EGTA. Release of [3H]choline into the aqueous phase was quantified by scintillation counting. RecombinantN-myristoylated human ARF1 was prepared fromEscherichia coli expressing recombinant human ARF1 and yeastN-myristoyltransferase (a kind gift from Dr. J. I. Gordon, Washington University) as described by Randazzo et al. (31Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To isolate a novel human PLD cDNA, a human B-cell library was screened with probes made from two partial cDNA clones obtained from the GenBankTM EST data base as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These EST sequences encode a portion of human PLD1. A clone was isolated by low stringency hybridization, and an open reading frame of 250 base pairs was identified. Primers specific to regions of the coding sequence were developed, and the full-length 3433 base pairs cDNA clone was generated by 5′- and 3′-RACE. Sequence analysis revealed a large open reading frame encoding a 933-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 106,000 (Fig.1 A). This region contained a 5′-translation initiation codon ATG, an in-frame stop codon, and a poly(A) tail, suggesting that the entire 3′-untranslated region was obtained. The hPLD2 mRNA transcript was found to be approximately 3.5 kb in size by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+mRNA obtained from the HSC-93 B-cell line using the open reading frame of the 1.8-kb 5′-RACE product as a probe (data not shown), indicating that the cDNA sequence reported is likely to be full-length. The sequence showed 53% amino acid sequence identity with hPLD1. hPLD2 also contained the consensus regions I–IV reported to be conserved among the eukaryotic PLDs (41Lee C. Kang H.-S. Chung J.-K. Sekiya F. Kim J.-R. Han J.-S. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Morris A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15986-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which include regions thought to be required for catalysis (I and IV) (Fig. 1). Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence for known protein motifs did not reveal the presence of Src homology 2 or 3 domains. Sequence comparison demonstrated that hPLD2 was 90% identical at the amino acid level with both mPLD2 and rPLD2 isoforms. The dendrogram in Fig. 1shows that hPLD2 clearly groups with the PLD2 isologues (mPLD2 and rPLD2) and is more distantly related to the PLD1 proteins. The expression of both hPLD1 and hPLD2 in various human tissues was determined by hybridizing human multiple tissue Northern blots with random primed full-length cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2, a ~3.5-kb message corresponding to hPLD2 is expressed in a variety of tissues including heart, placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, uterus, brain, lung, kidney, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Liver and skeletal muscle expressed relatively low amounts of hPLD2 mRNA. Peripheral blood leukocytes contained an additional transcript of slightly larger size, suggesting the possibility of an alternatively spliced form of hPLD2 mRNA in this tissue. In contrast, hPLD1 mRNA (~6-kb message) is expressed in high levels in brain placenta, spleen, uterus, and small intestine and in greatest abundance in pancreas and heart, and no signal was seen in peripheral blood leukocytes. hPLD2 was expressed in Hi5 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Three days after infection of Hi5 cells with the hPLD2-expressing baculovirus, cells were disrupted, and samples of the lysates were analyzed for the expression of the hPLD2 protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblot analysis. Coomassie staining revealed a distinct protein band of approximately 105 kDa in infected but not in uninfected cells (Fig.3 A). To further verify that the protein expressed was His-tagged hPLD2, Western blot analysis was performed utilizing anti-tetra-His (anti-His4) antibody as well as an antipeptide antibody to hPLD2 described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both antibodies detected a protein corresponding in size to the expressed protein seen by protein staining. Membrane and cytosol samples were also obtained from infected Hi5 cells, and the majority of the PLD2 was found in the membrane fraction (data not shown), although small quantities of the enzyme were also seen in the cytosol. PLD activity was seen in samples of cell lysates from infected Hi5 cells, but very low PLD activity was seen in uninfected cells (Fig. 3 C). Lysates from Hi5 cells infected with native baculovirus (no PLD2) yielded PLD activity levels similar to uninfected cells (data not shown). The catalytic properties of hPLD2 were examined using membrane fract"

Therefore, we addressed the mechanism of oxidant-induced cell death and investigated the role of ER stress proteins in Ca2+ regulation and cytoprotection after treating renal epithelial cells with TBHP. Prior ER stress induces expression of the ER stress proteins Grp78, Grp94, and calreticulin and rendered cells resistant to cell death caused by a subsequent TBHP challenge. Expressing antisense RNA targeted to grp78prevents grp78 induction sensitized cells to TBHP and disrupted their ability to develop cellular tolerance. In addition, overexpressing calreticulin, another ER chaperone and Ca2+-binding protein, also protected cells against TBHP. Interestingly, neither prior ER stress nor calreticulin expression prevented lipid peroxidation, but both blocked the rise in intracellular free Ca2+ after TBHP treatment. Loading cells with EGTA, even after peroxidation had already occurred, also prevented TBHP-induced cell death, indicating that buffering intracellular Ca2+ prevents cell killing. Thus, Ca2+ plays an important role in TBHP-induced cell death in these cells, and the ER is an important regulator of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis during oxidative stress. Given the importance of oxidants in human disease, it would appear that the role of ER stress proteins in protection from oxidant damage warrants further consideration.

Because we exist in an oxygenated atmosphere, oxygen radicals and organic oxidants are arguably the most important class of exogenous and endogenous human toxicants. Accordingly, oxidant toxicity has been implicated in many disease processes including ischemia reperfusion injury, aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, to name only a few (1Behl C.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); yet this proposal remains controversial. On the one hand, it has been suggested that an increase in free Ca2+ is nothing more than a late event associated with loss of membrane integrity and does not contribute appreciably to oxidant-induced cell killing (7Farber J.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Harman A.W. Maxwell M.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been proposed that an early increase in intracellular free Ca2+exacerbates oxidative stress, damages mitochondria, activates Ca2+-dependent degradative enzymes, and disrupts the cytoskeleton, all of which play a central role in oxidant-induced cell death (5Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Mcconkey D.J. Orrenius S. J.

Thus, the contribution of Ca2+ deregulation to oxidant-induced cell death remains unclear. In addition, in cases where Ca2+ appears to be involved in cell killing, the contribution of intracellular versusextracellular Ca2+ is not clear (5Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Chem. Res.

Oxidants, sulfhydryl active agents, and free radicals also inhibit Ca2+-ATPases and release Ca2+ from the ER (32Moore L. Davenport G.R. Landon E.J. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, despite the fact that the ER is the major intracellular Ca2+ store, that ER stress proteins regulate the ER Ca2+ pool, and that increased cellular free Ca2+ may contribute to oxidant-induced cell killing, there is no direct evidence linking regulation of cellular Ca2+by the ER to cell death after oxidant exposure. Prior induction of ER chaperones imparts tolerance to the translational block caused by ER Ca2+ depletion and protects against the toxicity of Ca2+ ionophores and other toxic insults (22Lee A.S.

Recently, we demonstrated that increasing the expression of ER stress protein genes protects renal epithelial cells against a subsequent challenge with the alkylating and acylating agents, iodoacetamide, or nephrotoxic cysteine conjugates, respectively (31Liu H.

With iodoacetamide, protection required grp78 induction and was linked both to inhibition of lipid peroxidation and maintenance of low intracellular free Ca2+ (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B.

Furthermore, overexpression of calreticulin, an ER Ca2+-binding chaperone that increases ER calcium retention (19Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J.

Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These and related studies (21Lievremont J. Rizzuto R. Hendershot L. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30873-30879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) indicate that control of intracellular Ca2+ by the ER may be important in preventing toxicant-induced cell death. However, the possibility that ER stress proteins blocked oxidative stress directly, thus preventing the rise in Ca2+, could not be excluded in these studies. TBHP is a prototypical organic oxidant and has been used extensively to study the role of Ca2+ in oxidant-induced cell death. TBHP treatment causes peroxidation of cellular lipids, oxidation of glutathione, loss of protein thiols, release of ER Ca2+, a general increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, a permeability transition in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and lipid peroxidation (36Henschke P.N.

However, the role of these perturbations in TBHP-induced cell death and in particular the role of Ca2+ remains unclear (5Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Harman A.W. Maxwell M.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Our previous studies on the ER stress response provided new insights into cell death induced by alkylating and acylating agents (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of ER stress on TBHP toxicity. The results indicate that prior ER stress or overexpression of calreticulin prevented TBHP-induced cell death and blocked the increase in cellular Ca2+. Notably, neither manipulation blocked lipid peroxidation pointing to a central role for Ca2+ and regulation of cellular Ca2+ levels by the ER in oxidant-induced cell death. The acetoxymethyl esters of EGTA (EGTA-AM) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sigma provided the TBHP. Other common chemical and cell culture reagents were obtained from commercial sources. LLC-PK1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) at passage 195 and were used from passage 205–215. LLC-PK1 cells expressing either an antisense grp78 construct (pkASgrp78 cells) or overexpressing calreticulin (pkCRT cells) as well as their counterparts transfected with the same pcDNA3 based plasmid containing no insert (pkNEO cells) were all selected for neomycin resistance and cloned as described (31Liu H.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (complete medium) as described (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). TBHP was added to Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS), and cultures were treated with TBHP for 40 min in EBSS. Following treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then returned to complete medium. An ER stress response was produced by treating cells with DTTox (10 mm), A23187 (7 μm), thapsigargin (0.3 μg/ml), or tunicamycin (1.5 μg/ml) as described (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B.

Cell death was assessed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium (48Chen Q. Stevens J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was used as a measure of lipid peroxidation (49Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, cells selected for neomycin resistance alone, i.e. pkNEO cells, may differ in their responsiveness to toxicant relative to wild type LLC-PK1 cells, an effect that is likely to be due to the selection process itself as noted before (50Zhan Y. Cleveland J.L. Stevens J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6755-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and have slightly lower levels of lipid peroxidation after TBHP treatment (see Table II). Intracellular free Ca2+measurements were carried out using Fura-2 as described (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with TBHP and then loaded with Fura-2 for 1 h, and the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was determined using a spectrofluorometer.Table IIOverexpression of calreticulin blocks cell death and Ca2+disturbances but not lipid peroxidationCellsTreatment[Ca2+]TBARSCell deathnmnmol%pkCRTnone48 ± 5a0.04 ± 0.01a4 ± 1apkCRTTBHP95 ± 7a1.94 ± 0.16b21 ± 2bpkNEOnone45 ± 9a0.01 ± 0.01a3 ± 2apkNEOTBHP219 ± 59b2.24 ± 0.05b55 ± 7cThree separate clones of pkCRT cells and pkNEO cells were treated with TBHP (1 mm) for 40 min.

When analysis of variance was performed, letter designations are used in the figures and tables to indicate significant differences. Means designated with a common letter are not different, but different letter designations indicate a significant difference from other means. If more than one letter designation is shown, it indicates that the mean is not different from other means with either letter designation. As an example, means designated C and D are different from each other, but neither is significantly different from a mean designated CD. Exposing cells to oxidants, including TBHP, increases cellular free Ca2+ and causes lipid peroxidation (44Sakaida I. Thomas A.P. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 717-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Chen Q. Stevens J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To establish the temporal relationship between these events and cell death in LLC-PK1 cells, we determined the time courses for all three events following TBHP exposure (Fig. 1). Lipid peroxidation increased within the initial TBHP treatment period (40 min) and continued to rise after TBHP removal. An increase in cellular free Ca2+ followed the increase in lipid peroxidation, but both events preceded cell death, which occurred between 2 and 4 h. Adding antioxidants prevented the rise in Ca2+ (data not shown) as reported previously (44Sakaida I. Thomas A.P. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 717-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that lipid peroxidation contributes to the Ca2+ increase. These temporal relationships are consistent with the proposal that oxidative stress preceded the rise in Ca2+. We next examined the effect of conditioning cells with prior ER stress on TBHP-induced cell death. Prior treatment with four different ER stress inducers, all of which activate expression of ER stress proteins in these cells (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), prevented cell death caused by a subsequent TBHP pulse treatment (Table I). However, with the exception of A23187, none of these agents blocked lipid peroxidation, even though they blocked the rise in cellular Ca2+ that was observed 2 h after TBHP treatment. The induction of grp78 and the protective effect of prior ER stress in iodoacetamide toxicity are disrupted in pkASgrp78 cells by forced expression of an 0.5-kilobase antisense grp78construct (31Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the TBHP sensitivity of three pkASgrp78 clones relative to pkNEO cells that carry only the neomycin resistance marker (Fig. 2). pkASgrp78 cells were more sensitive to TBHP relative to pkNEO cells. Pretreating pkASgrp78 cells with ER stress inducers was less effective in preventing TBHP toxicity compared with the pkNEO counterparts. A23187 was again the exception. Thus, the ability of prior ER stress to prevent TBHP toxicity depended on expression of ER chaperones.Table IER stress blocks cell death and Ca2+ perturbations but not lipid peroxidation following TBHP treatmentInducerTBHP[Ca2+]TBARSCell Deathnmnmol%None−44 ± 11a0.2 ± 0.1a0.7 ± 0.9aNone+281 ± 6b3.9 ± 0.2b54 ± 3bDTTox+82 ± 35a3.1 ± 0.2b6.4 ± 0.7aA23187+109 ± 22a1.9 ± 0.5c2.1 ± 3aThapsigargin+64 ± 17a3.2 ± 0.1b10 ± 7aTunicamycin+138 ± 68a3.5 ± 0.3b23 ± 2cControl cells or cells conditioned with DTTox, A23187, thapsigargin, or tunicamycin to cause ER stress were treated with TBHP (1 mm) for 40 min, then washed, and returned to DMEM plus 10% FBS.

https://openalex.org/W2068769123,"Abstract Cadmium is a potent cell poison known to cause oxidative stress by increasing lipid peroxidation and/or by changing intracellular glutathione levels and to affect the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in cadmium toxicity are still not well understood, especially in neuronal cells. To investigate the relationship between cadmium-induced oxidative stress and the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent pathway, we treated cultures of neuronal cells with different concentrations of the metal ion. In addition to decreases in glutathione levels, we observed marked increases in protein-mixed disulfides (Pr-SSGs) after exposure of HT4 cells (a mouse neuronal cell line) or rat primary mesencephalic cultures to Cd2+. The increases in intracellular levels of Pr-SSGs were concurrent with increases in the levels of ubiquitinated proteins (Ub proteins) when the HT4 cells were subjected to lower (25 μm or less) concentrations of cadmium. However, higher concentrations of cadmium (50 μm), which were toxic, led to increases in Pr-SSGs but inhibited ubiquitination, probably reflecting inhibition of ubiquitinating enzymes. The cadmium-induced changes in Pr-SSGs and Ub proteins were not affected when more than 85% of intracellular glutathione was removed from the cells by the glutathione synthetase inhibitorl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine. However, the reducing agent dithiothreitol, which prevented the build up of Pr-SSGs in the cell, also blocked the accumulation of Ub proteins induced by cadmium. In addition, dithiothreitol blocked the effects of the higher toxic (50 μm) concentrations of cadmium on cytotoxicity and on glutathione, Pr-SSGs, and Ub proteins. Together, these results strongly suggest that changes in the levels of intracellular Pr-SSGs and ubiquitin-protein conjugates in neuronal cells are responses closely associated with the disruption of intracellular sulfhydryl homeostasis caused by cadmium-mediated oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2146743052,"BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using the coding sequence of a human UDP-galactose:β-N-acetyl-glucosamine β-1,3-galactosyltransferase, designated β3Gal-T1, revealed no ESTs with identical sequences but a large number with similarity. Three different sets of overlapping ESTs with sequence similarities to β3Gal-T1 were compiled, and complete coding regions of these genes were obtained. Expression of two of these genes in the Baculo virus system showed that one represented a UDP-galactose:β-N-acetyl-glucosamine β-1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3Gal-T2) with similar kinetic properties as β3Gal-T1. Another gene represented a UDP-galactose:β-N-acetyl-galactosamine β-1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3Gal-T4) involved in GM1/GD1 ganglioside synthesis, and this gene was highly similar to a recently reported rat GD1 synthase (Miyazaki, H., Fukumoto, S., Okada, M., Hasegawa, T., and Furukawa, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 24794–24799). Northern analysis of mRNA from human organs with the four homologous cDNA revealed different expression patterns. β3Gal-T1 mRNA was expressed in brain, β3Gal-T2 was expressed in brain and heart, and β3Gal-T3 and -T4 were more widely expressed. The coding regions for each of the four genes were contained in single exons. β3Gal-T2, -T3, and -T4 were localized to 1q31, 3q25, and 6p21.3, respectively, by EST mapping.

Caskey C.T. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The identification of novel genes by sequence similarity was used recently to identify a large family of homologous UDP-galactose:β-N-acetyl-glucosamine β-1,4-galactosyltransferases (β4Gal-T). At least six novel genes were found of which four have been shown to represent functional β4Gal-Ts (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Hassan H.

Perhaps surprisingly, there are no sequence similarities between the β-4-galactosyltransferases and a putative UDP-galactose:β-N-acetyl-glucosamine β-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene submitted to GenBank in 1996 and here designated β3Gal-T1. The disaccharides Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ (type 1 chain) and Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ (type 2 chain) are core structures in glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins, where they occur in linear or branched repeated structures (6Kobata A.

The two core structures are differentially expressed in cells and organs (8Oriol R. Le Pendu J. Mollicone R. Vox. Sang. 1986; 51: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and synthesized by at least two independent galactosyltransferase activities (9Sheares B.T. Lau J.T. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 599-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sheares B.T. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9893-9898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a glycosyltransferase may transfer to either C-3 or C-4 of β-GlcNAc (e.g. the α-3,4-fucosyltransferases (11Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes. Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar)), suggesting that some enzymes may recognize common features of the two acceptor sites. In the present study, we found that β3Gal-T1 is one member of a β3-galactosyltransferase family. The human EST sequence data base was used to identify several novel members of a β3-galactosyltransferase gene family. The β3Gal-T1 gene was not found in the EST data base, but a large number of ESTs were identified that shared short sequence stretches with high similarity and had conserved cysteine residues. The full coding sequences of three of these genes were established; expression studies demonstrated that one gene encoded a new UDP-Gal: βGlcNAc β-1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3Gal-T2); and one gene encoded a UDP-Gal: βGalNAc β-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (β3Gal-T4), with different acceptor substrate specificity. Data base searches were performed with the reported coding sequence of a human β3Gal-T1 sequence (GenBank accession numberE07739) using the tBLASTn algorithm against the dbEST data base at The National Center for Biotechnology Information, U. S. A., as described previously (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Overlapping sequences were merged (Fig. 1), and the Unigene data base was used to select cDNA clones with the longest inserts and chromosomal assignments. EST cDNA clones were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. Four partly overlapping ESTs with approximately 360 bp open reading frame with sequence similarity to the C-terminal sequence of β3Gal-T1 were identified (Fig. 1). A further 5′ sequence was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) in combination with antisense primers EBER405 (5′-GGTGCATATCCTCGCATTAGG), EBER409 (5′-GGTGCTAGACTTTCATTGCCCC), and EBER412 (5′-TTCTTTCCAAATGTTCCGAAGG) for 35 cycles at 95 °C, 45 s; 55 °C, 15 s; 68 °C, 3 min, using the Expand kit enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim). The rapid amplification of cDNA ends products were cloned into theBamHI site of pT7T3U19, and multiple clones were sequenced. The entire sequence was confirmed by sequencing genomic P1 clones. The composite sequence contained an open reading frame of 1266 bp encoding a putative protein with a type II domain structure (Fig. 2), and an overall sequence identity of approximately 42% to β3Gal-T1. Five partly overlapping ESTs with approximately 900 bp of open reading frame and sequence similarity to β3Gal-T1 were identified (Fig. 1). An additional 5′ sequence was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using primers EBER606 (5′-GCAGTTTGAATGCTCTCGAAGTGTG) and EBER612 (5′-AGCAGCAGGAGGCTCCATTTG) as described for β3Gal-T2 above. The composite sequence contained an open reading frame of 993 bp encoding a putative protein with a type II domain structure (Fig. 2) and an overall sequence identity of approximately 40% to β3Gal-T1 and 33% to -T2. Two overlapping EST clones with sequence similarity to the N-terminal sequence of β3Gal-T1 were identified (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the inserts revealed an open reading frame of 1134 bp potentially encoding a protein with a type II domain structure (Fig. 2) with an overall sequence identity of approximately 33% to β3Gal-T1. Expression constructs were designed to exclude the hydrophobic transmembrane segment and include a maximum amount of the putative stem region. (i) β3Gal-T1, encoding amino acid residues 21–326, was prepared by RT-PCR with mRNA from MKN-45 cell line using the primer pair EBER300FOR (5′-TGGTACTTGAGTATAACTCGC) and EBER304 (5′-TACCAACACCTATGGTCCCATTTC); (ii) β3Gal-T2, encoding amino acid residues 39–422 was prepared by RT-PCR with RNA from MKN45 gastric carcinoma cell line using the primer pair EBER400FOR (5′-ATGTTTTTGTTTTTCAATCATCATGAC) and EBER415 (5′-TCTAATGTAGTTTACGGTGGC) (Fig. 2); β3Gal-T3, encoding amino acid residues 33–331 was prepared by PCR with P1 and genomic DNA, as well as by RT-PCR with RNA from MKN45, using the primer pair EBER600FOR (5′-ATGTGGTACCTCAGCCTTCCC) and EBER614 (5′-GTTAATAATGGCATGTGGTGTTCC) (Fig. 2); and β3Gal-T4, encoding either residues 30–378 or 78–378 were prepared by RT-PCR with RNA from MKN45, using the primers EBER521 (5′-GAGGAGCTGCTGAGCCTCTCA) or EBER520 (5′-TGCACGGCTCCGGAGAACCCTG) in combination with EBER514 (5′-ACTCTCAGCTCTGAAGCC) (Fig. 2). The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI site of pAcGP67 (Pharmingen). Expression constructs designed to encode the full open coding region were prepared by using primers that included the first potential initiation codon and genomic DNA as template (for β3Gal-T4 cDNA from EST H2O623, which contained the full coding sequence). The following primer pairs were used: (i) β3Gal-T1, EBER306 (5′-AGACAATGGCTTCAAAGGTCTC) and EBER 304; (ii) β3Gal-T2, EBER400FUL (5′-TACAACATGCTTCAGTGGAGGAG) and EBER415; (iii) β3Gal-T3, EBER600FUL (5′-TGACCATGGCCTCGGCTCTCTGGACTG) or EBER611 (5′-GTAGGATGTCACTGAGATCCC) (for second in-frame ATG) in combination with EBER614; and (iv) β3Gal-T4, EBER509 (5′-CCATGCAGCTCAGGCTCTTCC) and EBER514. The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI site of pVL1193 (Pharmingen). All constructs were fully sequenced. The plasmids with pAcGP67 or pVL1193 were co-transfected with Baculo-GoldTM DNA (Pharmingen) as described previously (12Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recombinant Baculo virus were obtained after two successive amplifications in Sf9 cells grown in serum-containing medium. Controls included the pAcGP67-GalNAc-T3-sol (12Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Standard assays were performed in 50 μl of total reaction mixtures containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 100 μm UDP-[14C]Gal (2,300 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and varying concentration of acceptor substrates (Sigma) (see Table I for structures). Reaction products were quantified by Dowex-1 chromatography. Assays with hen egg ovalbumin (Sigma) were performed with the standard reaction mixture modified to contain 200 μm UDP-Gal, 54 mm NaCl, and 1 mg of ovalbumin. The transfer of galactose was evaluated after separation by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. Constructs that encoded soluble secreted enzymes (lacking the signal-anchor sequence) were assayed with 5–20 μl of culture supernatant from infected cells, whereas the full-length enzymes were assayed with 1% Triton X-100 homogenates of cells. Assays used for assessment ofK m of acceptor substrates and donor substrates were modified to include 500 μm UDP-[14C]Gal (2,300 cpm/nmol) or 100 mm GlcNAcβ-benzyl. Assays with glycolipid acceptors were conducted as described previously (13Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem.

The secreted form of β3Gal-T2 was partially purified by sequential DEAE and S-Sepharose chromatographies from serum-free medium as described previously (14Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E.

Terminal glycosylation of GM2(Sigma) was performed with 50 μl of a 1:1 suspension of a membrane fraction prepared from High Five™ (Invitrogen) cells infected with the full coding expression construct of β3Gal-T4. Briefly, cells were harvested 2 days postinfection, lysed, and homogenized in 1.0% CF54, 150 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5), 10 mmMnCl2, and 2 mm EDTA. The extract was pelleted by low speed centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 10 min), and the supernatant from this was pelleted again by high speed centrifugation (30,000 rpm for 30 min). Most of the enzyme activity was retained in the high speed-pelleted fraction and used as enzyme source. The reaction mixture included 250 μg of GM2, 150 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.3% Triton CF-54, and 5 mm UDP-Gal in a final volume of 200 μl. The glycosylations were monitored by high performance TLC, and the products were purified on octadecyl silica cartridges (Bakerbond, J. T. Baker Inc.) and deuterium-exchanged as described previously (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy of the product of β3Gal-T2 was performed on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer (temperature, 308 K; spectral width, 5000 Hz acquired over 16,000 data points; relaxation delay, 2 s; solvent suppression by presaturation pulse). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy of the product of β3Gal-T4 was performed on a Varian Unity-INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer (temperature, 308 K; spectral width, 6000 Hz acquired over 16,000 data points; relaxation delay, 1.5 s; solvent suppression by presaturation pulse). The human multiple tissue northern blot was obtained fromCLONTECH and used once for the experiments shown. The soluble expression constructs were used as probes. Probes were random-primed-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) and an oligo labeling kit (Amersham). The blots were probed overnight at 42 °C as described previously (12Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), washed 2× 10 min at RT with 2×SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate), 1% Na4P2O2; 2× 20 min at 65 °C with 0.2×SSC, 1% SDS, 1% Na4P2O2; and once 10 min with 0.2 x SSC at RT. P1 genomic clones were obtained for β3Gal-T2 and -T3 by screening a human foreskin P1 library (DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Human Foreskin Fibroblast P1 Library) using the primer pairs EBER400 (5′-ACCAGACCTCTACCCAAGTGAGCG)/EBER402 (5′-CAGCTCGAATAAGAGACTCGC) or EBER603 (5′-GTGATAGAACGCGTGAACTGG)/EBER604 (5′-CCCCAAGTAACTCTAATGGCC). Three P1 clones each for β3Gal-T2 and -T3 were obtained from Genome Systems (Fig. 1). DNA from P1 phages were prepared as recommended by Genome Systems. The chromosomal localization of β3Gal-T2, -T3, and -T4 were determined using 3′EST mapping data (National Center for Biotechnology Information). No ESTs corresponding to the available sequence of β3Gal-T1 was found; thus, the localization of this gene was not determined. The search and cloning strategy outlined in Fig.1 produced three novel genes with significant sequence similarity to β3Gal-T1 (Fig.2). Additionally, three genes with less similarity were identified (not shown). Multiple sequence alignment of the three β3-galactosyltransferases as well as a homologousDrosophila gene designated Brainiac (15Yuan Y.P. Schultz J. Mlodzik M. Bork P. Cell. 1997; 88: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession number U41449) is shown in Fig. 2. The sequence similarities between the four human genes are limited to the central regions; there were no significant similarities in the N-terminal regions. Several sequence motifs in the putative catalytic domains are conserved between all the sequences. In the high similarity region, β3Gal-T2 is most similar to β3Gal-T1, β3Gal-T3 was the second most similar, and the least similar is β3Gal-T4. At least three cysteine residues align within all the human genes; an additional two align within β3Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3 (Fig. 2). Although Brainiac has most of the sequence motifs conserved among the human genes, none of the conserved cysteines in the human genes were found in Brainiac. There are two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in β3Gal-T1, five in β3Gal-T2 and -T3, and one in β3Gal-T4, respectively. The glycosylation sites are mainly in the N-terminal region, to the carboxyl side of the putative transmembrane region. Interestingly, one site occurs in the region of high sequence similarity and is conserved among the four human genes andBrainiac. The predicted coding region of β3Gal-T2 has two potential initiation codons, both of which are in agreement with Kozak's rule (16Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The coding sequence thus depicts a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with two different N-terminal cytoplasmic domains of 24 or 11 residues and a transmembrane segment of 19 residues flanked by charged residues, and 379 residues contain the stem region and catalytic domain (Fig. 2). β3Gal-T2 differs significantly from the other genes by having an extended putative stem region (approximately 50 residues) which is hydrophilic, as is found in most glycosyltransferase genes (Figs. 2 and3). The 3′-UTR with one polyadenylation signal at position 2497 (1228 bp 3′-UTR) was found in all the identified EST clones. The 3′ESTs (WI-13433) were linked to chromosome 1q31 between microsatellite markers D1S461 and D1S412 at 208–213 centimorgan. The predicted coding region of β3Gal-T3 has two potential initiation codons; only the second is in agreement with Kozak's rule (16Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The coding sequence depicts a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with two potentially different N-terminal cytoplasmic domains of 19 or 7 residues, a transmembrane segment of 14 residues, and a stem region plus catalytic domain of 298 residues (Fig. 2). The 774-bp 3′-UTR obtained from all EST clones did not include a consensus polyadenylation signal. The 3′ESTs (WI-9638) were linked to chromosome 3q25 between D3S1275 and D3S3702 microsatellite markers at 176–179 centimorgan. The predicted coding region of β3Gal-T4 has a single initiation codon, in agreement with Kozak's rule (16Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The coding sequence yields a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 8 residues, a short transmembrane segment of 11 residues, and a stem region and catalytic domain of 359 residues (Fig. 2). All conserved sequence motifs within the human β3-galactosyltransferase genes are found in β3Gal-T4. Whereas these align fully within β3Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3, there is an inserted sequence element in β3Gal-T4 that is illustrated by inserted spacings in the multiple sequence alignment analysis (Fig. 2) and in the hydropathy plot (Fig.3). The hydropathy plot of β3Gal-T4 shows a very hydrophobic putative stem region that differs significantly from the other genes. This has not been observed for other animal glycosyltransferases except for a ceramide galactosyltransferase (17Schulte S. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10265-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The human β3Gal-T4 exhibits relatively high similarity to a recently reported rat gene (overall amino acid sequence identity of 79%) (18Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although this is lower than the similarity found in comparisons between most rat/human glycosyltransferase genes, it suggests that these two genes are homologues. A 3′-UTR with a polyadenylation signal at position 1387 (250-bp 3′-UTR) was included in the EST clones. The 3′ESTs (stSG4027) were to linked to chromosome 6p21.3 between microsatellite markers D6S276 and D6S439 at 44–48 centimorgan. Expression of a soluble construct of β3Gal-T1 and -T2 in Sf9 cells resulted in a marked increase in galactosyltransferase activity using βGlcNAc-benzyl as an acceptor substrate, compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with control constructs for polypeptide GalNAc- transferases (12Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (Table I). Analysis of the substrate specificity of β3Gal-T1 and -T2 activities showed that only saccharides with a terminal βGlcNAc residue and not αGlcNAc or αGalNAc were acceptor substrates. It was not possible to determineK m for benzyl-βGlcNAc or Umb-βGlcNAc with β3Gal-T1 and -T2 due to substrate inhibition at concentrations above 100 mm. The K m for UDP-Gal of β3Gal-T1 and -T2 were 90 ± 5 μm and 37 ± 9 μm, respectively, using Benzyl-βGlcNAc as an acceptor substrate. β3Gal-T2 catalyzed glycosylation of hen egg ovalbumin, whereas β3Gal-T1 showed poor activity with this substrate (TableII). Analysis of enzyme activities with a panel of glycolipid substrates revealed that both enzymes were capable of catalyzing glycosylation of βGlcNAc-terminating structures Lc3Cer and nLc5Cer, but β3Gal-T1 showed lower activity with nLc5Cer. Both enzymes showed low activities with GlcCer (Table III). β3Gal-T2 and to a lesser extent β3Gal-T1 incorporated galactose into nLc4Cer. Secreted forms of β4-galactosyltransferases were included as controls (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Clausen, manuscript in preparation.Both β3Gal-T1 and -T2 showed strict donor substrate specificity for UDP-Gal and did not utilize UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcNAc with the acceptor substrates tested (data not shown). The reaction product formed by β3Gal-T2 with Lc3Cer was shown by 1H NMR to be Lc4Cer, thus verifying that T2 formed the Galβ1–3GlcNAc linkage. In the downfield region (3.7–5.7 ppm) (Fig.4), the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of Lc4Cer as well as residual Lc3Cer, and this was in agreement with results of TLC analysis, which indicated approximately 40% conversion of Lc3Cer to Lc4Cer. The spectral features of the two components were virtually identical with those previously observed (19Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Harris D.D. Hakomori S.

Expression of the full-length coding construct for β3Gal-T4 in Sf9 cells produced no detectable activity with any of the simple sugar derivatives listed in Table I. However, analysis of enzyme activity with a panel of glycolipids revealed that products migrating as Gg4 and GM1were formed with Gg3 and GM2 glycolipid substrates, respectively (Table IV). The reaction product formed by β3Gal-T4 with GM2 was analyzed by 1H NMR to verify that T4 formed the Galβ1–3GalNAc linkage to make GM1 (Fig. 5). Aside from the appearance of a number of impurities mainly ascribed to membrane phospholipids not separated from the ganglioside product, the proton NMR spectral data of the reaction product were comparable with those of Koerner et al.

https://openalex.org/W2072105385,"We have studied the intracellular localization of poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) by indirect immunofluorescence as well as by tagging with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in living cells. We show that PABP1 is able to enter the nucleus. Accumulation of PABP1 in the nuclei was observed upon transcription inhibition, suggesting that active transcription is required for PABP1 export. The nuclear import of PABP1 is an energy-dependent process since PABP1 fails to enter the nucleus upon ATP depletion and at low temperature. Transfection of PABP1 or PABP1-GFP resulted in heterogeneity of intracellular distribution of the protein. In the low expressing cells, PABP1 was localized in the cytoplasm, whereas in the high expressors, we observed accumulation of the protein in the nucleus. Nuclear PABP1 observed either after overexpression or after transcription inhibition was found in speckles and colocalized with splicing factor SC35. The ability of PABP1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm was also shown by heterokaryon formation upon cell fusion. Deletion mutagenesis showed that the minimal part of PABP1 retaining the ability to shuttle consists of the first two RNA-binding domains. This mutant interacted with poly(A) RNA with high affinity and accumulated in the nucleus. Deletion mutants exhibiting reduced RNA binding affinity did not accumulate in the nucleus. PABP1 has been proposed to participate at various steps of mRNA utilization. Our results suggest involvement of PABP1 in nuclear events associated with the formation and transport of mRNP to the cytoplasm and identify a new trafficking pattern for RNA-binding proteins.

Eukaryotic mRNAs are organized in ribonucleoprotein complexes (1Dreyfuss G. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 459-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). One predominant protein of these complexes is the poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) 1The abbreviations used are: PABP1, poly(A)-binding protein 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; INS1, inhibitory/instability sequence 1; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; LTR, long terminal repeat; nt, nucleotide(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RDR, rhodamine red; DRB, 5,6- dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole., which associates with the 3′ poly(A) tail of mRNA (3Grange T. de Sa C.M.

PABP1 is an essential protein in yeast (7Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms (3Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R.

Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). PABP1 is clearly a multifunctional protein, proposed to participate in 3′ end formation of mRNA, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization, protection of poly(A) from nuclease activity, mRNA deadenylation, inhibition of mRNA decapping, and mRNP maturation (8Baker E.J. Harford J.B. Morris D.R. mRNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation. Wiley-Liss, New York1997: 85-105Google Scholar, 9Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T. Strahm Y. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PABP1 may be a key factor in mediating regulation of mRNA turnover through the inhibition of mRNA decapping by the poly(A) tail or by influencing the rate of deadenylation (10Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 11Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 12Muhlrad D. Parker R.

Several lines of evidence argue that PABP1 plays a role in stimulating translation initiation (14Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15Grossi de Sa M.F. Standart N. Martins de Sa C. Akhayat O. Huesca M. Scherrer K. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction of this protein with the 3′ poly(A) sequence can influence events at the 5′ end of mRNA. PABP1 availability for interaction with processed mRNA is very important. Recent studies have shown that PABP1 is involved in the processing of 3′ end of premessenger RNA (9Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T. Strahm Y. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These results imply that interaction of PABP1 with poly(A) tail occurs in the nucleus. Mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus accompanied by several hnRNP proteins (17Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 19Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Presence of PABP1 on the poly(A) tails of exported mRNA could be advantageous for translation initiation. Recently, we have shown that PABP1 can also bind internal mRNA sites and that binding to the inhibitory/instability sequences (INS1) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may affect HIV-1 mRNA stability and utilization (20Afonina E. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2307-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since our previous experiments suggested that the presence of INS1 affects not only expression but also the export of gag mRNA (21Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 150-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schwartz S. Campbell M. Nasioulas G. Harrison J. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7176-7182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that interaction with PABP1 already occurs in the nucleus. PABP1 is thought to be a cytoplasmic protein and has been detected in the cytoplasm by immunofluorescence (23Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that PABP1 is not a purely cytoplasmic protein, but it is also found in the nucleus. We studied the localization of PABP1 by using both indirect immunofluorescence and tagging of the PABP1 by fusion to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). We present data demonstrating that PABP1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The RNA-binding ability of PABP1 is important for nuclear retention. These results suggest an expanded role for PABP1 in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and utilization of mRNP particles. Plasmid pGEM1 containing the coding sequence of human PABP1 was obtained from T. Grange (Institut Jacques Monod, France) (3Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The PABP1 coding sequence was inserted into theBssHII-BamHI sites of pB37R, replacing thegag gene of HIV-1 (24Tabernero C. Zolotukhin A.S. Valentin A. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5998-6011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting vector, pPABP1, contains the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. To generate a PABP1-GFP fusion protein, the coding sequence of PABP1 was inserted in the NheI site of plasmid pF25, which contains the mutant GFPsg25 gene linked to the immediate early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (25Stauber R. Gaitanaris A.S. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of PABP1-GFP were generated by PCR. The corresponding primers also contained NheI restriction site, and resulting PCR fragments were inserted into pF25. Deletion mutants shown in Fig. 2 contained the following PABP1 coding sequences: M1, nt 1–255; M1"", nt 1–450; M12, nt 1–555; M2, nt 270–555; M1234, nt 1–1125; M4c, nt 835–1499; and c, nt 1128–1499. HLtat is a HeLa-derived cell line that constitutively produces Tat protein (26Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Fenyo¨ E.M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5448-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293 is an adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line (27Graham F. Smiley J. Russell W. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique as described previously (28Graham F.J. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar, 29Felber B.K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Copeland T. Pavlakis G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cell line constitutively expressing PABP1-GFP was generated by transfection of the PABP1-GFP-expressing plasmid into HeLa cells, followed by selection of G418-resistant clones. After a week of selection, cells expressing PABP1-GFP were sorted by FACS and maintained in G418-containing medium for 2 weeks, followed by a single-cell sorting procedure to generate clonal cell lines. Of three clones examined in detail, we report results obtained with clone F4.2. Analysis of protein expression in two clonal cell lines by Western blot using anti-PABP1 antiserum 39473 revealed that the level of expression of PABP1-GFP was less than 30% of the endogenous PABP1 in this clonal cell population. Therefore, the majority of the cells contain a small fraction of PABP1-GFP compared with the endogenous PABP1 protein. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as described previously (29Felber B.K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Copeland T. Pavlakis G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into coated 50-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek) and transfected 24 h later with the indicated plasmids. One day later, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min followed by incubation with 10% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 15 min. Staining was performed by incubation with anti-PABP1 antiserum 39473 (1:50 dilution in PBS) for 40 min at 37 °C (20Afonina E. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2307-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (KRL, Rockville, MD) (1:20 dilution in PBS) for 40 min at 37 °C. For colocalization experiments, cells were incubated in addition to the anti-PABP1 antiserum with a mouse monoclonal anti-SC35 antibody (a gift from F. Maldarelli National Institutes of Health) followed by incubation with rhodamine red (RDR)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (KRL). The cells were examined by an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 135). GFP signals were obtained with an FITC-fluorescence filter set (Zeiss 09, excitation 450–490 nm, beam splitter 510 nm, emission filter >520 nm). 12-bit black and white images were captured using a digital CCD camera (Photometrics, AZ). Image analysis and presentation were performed using IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA). The total cellular GFP signal was measured by calculating the integrated pixel intensity in the imaged cell multiplied by the area of the cell. Nuclear signal was similarly obtained by measuring the pixel intensity in the nucleus. The cytoplasmic signal was calculated by subtracting the nuclear signal from the total cellular signal. All pixel values were measured below the saturation limits of the CCD camera. Analysis of PABP1 by immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Afonina E. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2307-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with pF25PABP1-GFP were seeded 24 h after transfection with a 10-fold excess of untransfected HeLa cells. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 1 h, and then treated with pre-warmed 4% polyethylene glycol for 3 min (30Drysdale C.M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed with medium containing 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide and incubated for 1–5 h. Cells were observed under phase contrast and fluorescent illumination, and fusions involving one donor cell and surrounding acceptor cells were selected for analysis over a 5-h period. Serial CCD camera images were analyzed using IPlab Spectrum software. Although PABP1 is localized in the cytoplasm by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 A,panel 1) (23Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), several experiments have suggested a nuclear role for this protein (4Sachs A.B. Bond M.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 9Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T. Strahm Y. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2307-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine a possible nuclear localization of PABP1, we tested whether localization of PABP1 depends on ongoing transcription since PABP1 is a mRNA-binding protein. For this, we treated cells with transcription inhibitor, 5,6-dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) known to cause early termination of pre-mRNA transcription (Fig. 1 A) (31Tamm I. Sehgal P.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1978; 22: 187-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Treatment with DRB (25 μg/ml) for 6 h, resulted in accumulation of PABP1 in the nucleus, mostly in speckles, as shown by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 A, panel 2). In addition, we constructed a HeLa-derived stable cell line expressing PABP1-GFP (Fig. 2) as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the great majority of these cells, PABP1-GFP was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B,panel 1), while in few cells we observed nuclear speckles containing PABP1-GFP. After 4 h of incubation of this clonal cell line with either DRB (25 μg/ml) or with actinomycin D (0.5 μg/ml or 5 μg/ml), PABP1-GFP was observed in nuclear speckles (Fig.1 B, panels 2, 3, and 4). The DRB effect was reversible; after removing DRB and incubating the cells in fresh DRB-free medium, all PABP1-GFP was relocated to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B, panel 5). To test whether localization of PABP1 was dependent on ongoing translation, we examined the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the subcellular distribution of PABP1 or PABP1-GFP in living cells. We did not observe any significant changes in the localization upon cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) treatment alone (Fig.1 B, panel 6). To demonstrate complete inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloxehimide under the conditions used in our experiments, we measured incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble protein fraction from untreated and cycloheximide-treated cells. The presence of cycloheximide inhibited protein synthesis by 97%. These results suggested that PABP1 is able to enter the nucleus, and its exit to the cytoplasm is dependent on active RNA transcription. Given the size of the protein, we thought it is unlikely that PABP1 passively diffuses into the nucleus. To investigate whether the nuclear uptake of PABP1 is an energy-dependent process, we treated cells with actinomycin D or with DRB at 4 °C. PABP1-GFP failed to accumulate in the nucleus under these conditions (Fig. 1 B, panels 7 and 8). Import of PABP1 was also abolished in the cells upon inhibition of transcription in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose (10 mm) and sodium azide (10 mm) that deplete ATP pools (32Guiochon-Mantel A.

Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B,panel 9). Administration of sodium azide alone did not completely prevent the accumulation of the PABP1 in the nucleus (data not shown). We interpret the results of these experiments to suggest that the import of PABP1 to the nucleus is an energy-requiring process. We studied the localization of PABP1 in HeLa cells upon transient transfection of plasmids expressing a full-length PABP1 cDNA (pPABP1, Fig. 2). Indirect immunofluorescence showed that PABP1 accumulated in the nucleus of cells producing high levels of the protein, whereas PABP1 showed cytoplasmic localization in cells expressing low levels of protein or in non-transfected cells (Fig.3, A and B). We also introduced GFP-tagged PABP1 protein into the cells by transient transfections of pF25PABP1-GFP, a plasmid producing a PABP1-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2). Similarly to transfected PABP1, PABP1-GFP was found to have a variable distribution in transfected cells. In low expressing cells, PABP1-GFP was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 D), whereas high expressing cells displayed nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein (Fig. 3 C). Similar results were obtained upon transfection of human kidney 293 cells and mouse NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown). Comparison of the levels of expression of PABP1-GFP in cells containing nuclear/cytoplasmic versus cytoplasmic only PABP1-GFP was performed by quantitation of GFP fluorescence. Series of images of transfected cells were taken at identical settings and total GFP signal was measured as described under “Materials and Methods,” below the saturation limits of the CCD camera. The fluorescence levels of cells containing PABP1-GFP only in the cytoplasm was on average 3–5-fold lower than that of cells containing PABP1-GFP both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In most cells containing nuclear PABP1, the protein accumulated in nuclear speckles. This was observed both in live cells expressing PABP1-GFP and in fixed cells expressing untagged PABP1 (Fig.4, A and D). Because this localization was reminiscent of the nuclear speckles containing splicing factors, the cells were immunostained with antiserum against the splicing factor SC35 to further characterize the intranuclear location of PABP1 (Fig. 4, C and F). Combining the signal from PABP1-GFP with the corresponding immunostaining image of SC35 or double immunostaining of cells transfected with PABP1 revealed significant colocalization of PABP1 and SC35 nuclear speckles (Fig. 4, B and E). These results suggested that PABP1 may traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Another way to study nuclear-cytoplasmic transport is to utilize heterokaryon assay upon cell fusion similar to previously published procedures (35Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1991; 253: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Heterokaryon formation temporarily creates a nonequilibrium situation, allowing real-time study of protein redistribution among different intracellular compartments. This assay allows simultaneous monitoring of the exit of the protein of interest from the donor nucleus to the cytoplasm and the import into the surrounding acceptor nuclei. HeLa cells containing PABP1-GFP in the nucleus were fused to excess of untransfected cells. The localization of PABP1-GFP was followed in living cells after cell fusion. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was added to prevent de novoprotein synthesis. Fig. 5 Ashows the movement of PABP1-GFP over a period of 4.5 h in two independent heterokaryons initially containing one bright nucleus and either one or two empty nuclei. We were able to detect PABP1-GFP in the acceptor (untransfected) nuclei within 1–2 h after fusion. We also observed a decrease in the intensity of fluorescence in the donor nucleus in parallel to the increase in the acceptor nuclei (Fig.5 A, compare donor nuclei of both fusions at 1- and 4.5-h time points). Quantitation of the fluorescence signal revealed that the ratio of the total nuclear signal to the cytoplasmic signal for the whole heterokaryon was not changed over this period, whereas the signal within the donor nucleus decreased and that of the acceptor nuclei increased (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, PABP1-GFP migrated out of the donor nucleus and was imported into the acceptor nuclei. PABP1 contains four RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a proline-rich C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). To investigate the part of PABP1 responsible for nuclear accumulation, we generated deletion mutants coupled to GFP and introduced them into HeLa cells by transient transfection (Fig. 2). Interestingly, deletion mutants containing the two N-terminal RBDs (M12) or all four RBDs (M1234) of PABP1 showed predominantly nuclear localization (Fig.6, A and B). In contrast to PABP1-GFP, we did not observe any significant differences in the intracellular distribution of these mutant proteins associated with different levels of expression in individual transfected cells. Mutants containing single RBDs (M1 or M2; Fig. 6, C andE, respectively) or only the C-terminal part of PABP1 (Fig.6 G) were distributed throughout the entire cell, and their localization was indistinguishable from that of GFP alone (Fig.6 H). Mutants containing the first RBD and part of the second domain (M1"", Fig. 6 D) or the fourth RBD and the C-terminal part of PABP1 (M4c, Fig. 6 F) were also distributed throughout the entire cell. This distribution of GFP hybrids containing small fragments of PABP1 may reflect passive diffusion among cellular compartments. We conclude that mutant M12 contains the minimal part of PABP1 necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. We next investigated the ability of the mutant polypeptides to bind poly(A) in vitro. Cell lysates from cells transfected with DNA expressing the different mutants were incubated with poly(A)-Sepharose, and the presence of bound PABP1 or mutant polypeptides was examined by immunoblotting after extensive washing with 1 m KCl (Fig. 7). Both PABP1 and PABP1-GFP bound tightly to poly(A), and were retained on the poly(A)-Sepharose matrix after this wash step. The mutants M12 and M1234 also bound efficiently to poly(A). A significant amount of each polypeptide was retained on the poly(A)-Sepharose beads after the wash step with 1 m KCl (Fig. 7, lanes 2, 6, 8, and14). We did not observe any significant poly(A) binding activity with either M1, c (the C-terminal fragment of PABP1), or M4c (Fig. 7, lanes 4, 10, and 12). The decrease of the intensity of the retained band corresponding to these mutant polypeptides could not be attributed to the degradation of the protein during the experiment since we were able to detect the unbound mutant polypeptides in the flow-through fractions (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the results of Burd et al.(37Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showing that a contiguous two RBD combination is required for efficient RNA binding. As shown above, none of the single-domain polypeptides were able to be retained in the nucleus, suggesting a correlation between nuclear accumulation and the ability of the polypeptides to bind tightly to poly(A) RNA. In this study, we present evidence that the cytoplasmic localization of PABP1 represents a dynamic equilibrium of the protein, which has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Different types of evidence support this conclusion. First, inhibition of transcription results in PABP1 accumulation in nuclear speckles. Removal of the inhibitor (DRB) restores the cytoplasmic localization of PABP1. Second, overexpression of the protein results also in nuclear speckle accumulation. We have performed analysis of either PABP1 or PABP1-GFP localization and trafficking. In all cases, the results were in agreement, indicating that GFP tagging did not affect PABP1 function. We show that the import of PABP1 is an active process, since PABP1 fails to enter the nuclei upon ATP depletion or at low temperature. We observed that two deletion mutants of PABP1 containing two or four RBDs have retained the ability to enter the nucleus. In agreement with our data, a truncated form of PABP1 encompassing only four RBDs, which is very similar to our M1234 mutant, was previously found in the nucleus (4Sachs A.B. Bond M.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These mutants, M12 and M1234, readily interacted with poly(A) RNA with an affinity comparable with that of the full-length protein. Deletion mutants exhibiting reduced RNA binding activity did not show any preference in localization. Therefore, the minimal putative nuclear localization signal of PABP1 is composed of two RBDs and was not associated with any short peptide sequence. RNA binding and nuclear import may be distinct, and RNA binding may be the cause for nuclear retention. Such mechanism has been proposed for the Rev protein of HIV-1, based on the demonstration of nuclear import but not nuclear retention of Rev mutants that lack RNA binding. 2R. Stauber, E. Afonina, and G. N. Pavlakis, unpublished data. Previously, it was reported that PABP1 is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm, even upon overexpression of hemagglutinin-tagged PABP1 (17Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We do not know the reason for this discrepancy although it might reflect differences in the levels of expression, the type of cells used for transfection, or accessibility of the hemagglutinin tag to the antibodies. Similar to our results, Sachs (4Sachs A.B. Bond M.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) et al. have suggested the presence of nuclear PABP1 in yeast. Nuclear PABP1 was concentrated in speckles that also contained splicing factor SC35. Speckles containing the splicing factors SC35, Sm, and U2AF were initially thought to be a factor storage compartment (38Fu X.-D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 39Carmo-Fonseca M. Tollervey D. Pepperkok R. Barabino S.M. Merdes A. Brunner C. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Hurt E. Lamond A.I.

Others have suggested a more dynamic functional role for nuclear speckles, due to their marked reorganization upon cell differentiation or inhibition of transcription (43Huang S. Spector D.L.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Huang and Spector (43Huang S. Spector D.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) reported colocalization of poly(A)-containing RNA and SC35 speckles and reorganization of such structures upon inhibition of transcription, suggesting an active role in the RNA processing itself. Therefore, we suggest that the binding of PABP1 to poly(A)-containing RNA occurs in the nuclear speckles during or shortly after transcription. Since PABP1 accumulated in the nucleus upon overexpression, we hypothesize that the export pathway of the protein is saturable. To explore the possible mechanism of PABP1 export, we investigated its dependence on the inhibition of transcription and translation. Transcription inhibition resulted in accumulation of PABP1 in the nuclei of the cells expressing low levels of PABP1. Inhibition of translation by cycloheximide did not affect the intracellular distribution of PABP1. The requirement for ongoing transcription for PABP1 export suggests that PABP1 utilizes its RNA binding activity to exit the nucleus as RNP particles. mRNA export has been suggested to be mediated by hnRNP proteins. Of these, the best characterized candidate is hnRNP A1, which is constantly shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm (17Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G.

Future experiments are required to investigate whether PABP1 and hnRNP proteins utilize the same export pathway. The trafficking pattern identified for PABP1 may be shared with other proteins. We have recently shown that the product of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (pVHL) (49Gnarra J.R. Duan D.R. Weng Y. Humphrey J.S. Chen D.Y. Lee S. Pause A. Dudley C.F. Latif F. Kuzmin I.

Lee, M. Neumann, R. Stauber, A. Pause, S. Zhou, G. N. Pavlakis, and R. D. Klausner, submitted for publication. The similarity between the intracellular localization changes and trafficking pattern for PABP1 and pVHL suggests similar trafficking mechanisms for the two proteins. The suggestion that PABP1 has the ability to interact with poly(A)-containing RNA in the nucleus and that it exits the nucleus as a complex with newly synthesized poly(A)-containing RNA raises the possibility that PABP1 binding to the poly(A) tail in the nucleus is important for mRNA processing, transport, and utilization. Recently, PABP1 was identified as a component of CF I complex responsible for premessenger mRNA 3′-end formation (9Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T. Strahm Y. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, PABP1 is involved in early steps of regulation of mRNA expression that occur in the nucleus. It was hypothesized that PABP1 binds to progressively growing poly(A) tail and that the amount of bound PABP1 regulates poly(A)-polymerase activity. The yeast PABP1 homologue Pab1p was also reported to interact with the cap-binding complex via the eIF-4G subunit (16Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that mRNA is transported out of the nucleus as an RNP complex competent for translation initiation. We have previously shown (20Afonina E. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2307-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that PABP1 binds the INS1 sequences within the HIV-1 mRNA and may participate in down-regulation of this mRNA. The proposed mechanism of this inhibition included the formation of aberrant complexes of PABP1 and the adenosine-rich regions of INS1. Our present finding that PABP1 is capable of trafficking between cellular compartments suggests that the complexes of PABP1 and INS1-containing RNA may form in the nucleus, which is consistent with the conclusion that INS acts in the nucleus. Incorrect binding of PABP1 within the mRNA may affect efficient RNP formation and export of this mRNA. PABP1 is clearly a multifunctional protein involved in several steps of mRNA metabolism. Our results suggest that, by binding to the poly(A)-containing mRNA in the nucleus, PABP1 may participate in mRNP formation, transport, and utilization. Association of PABP1 with poly(A) RNA in the nucleus and transport of the protein as part of an RNP particle is an attractive hypothesis explaining different aspects of PABP1 function, and especially participation in mRNP maturation.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12295-12299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The role of MPT is still unknown, but evidence is accumulating that MPT may be an initial event in the process of cell death which occurs in a variety of pathological states, such as ischemia/reperfusion (13Pastorino J.G.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) formulated the hypothesis that ROS-producing mitochondria suffer MPT, leading to release of the apoptosis inducing factor. If the number of ROS-producing mitochondria is large, sufficient quantities of the apoptosis inducing factor accumulate, leading to cell death. Thus, MPT would be a mechanism for eliminating cells which have high ROS generation (16Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The thiol-specific antioxidant enzyme (TSA), also known as thioredoxin peroxidase, is a new antioxidant enzyme originally isolated from yeast and later found in mammalian tissues (17Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This protein has the ability to protect biomolecules from oxidative damage if a thiol reductant such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or thioredoxin is present (17Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the antioxidant property of TSA was attributed to its thiol peroxidase activity as follows: 2 RSH + H2O2 → RSSR + 2 H2O (20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Because proteins belonging to the TSA family are usually present in large quantities in protozoan, yeast, and mammalian cells (21Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kieb M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1995; 216: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we questioned whether this antioxidant protein may play an important role in defense against MPT. The results presented in this paper were designed to investigate both if TSA is capable of inhibiting mitochondrial permeabilization associated with MPT and if the inhibition of MPT by peroxidases is strictly related to their H2O2 removal activity. The effect of ebselen, a selenium-containing heterocycle and analogue of glutathione peroxidase, which presents peroxidase, but not free-radical scavenging activity (25Sies H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), was also studied. Mitochondria were isolated as described in Refs. 5Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J.

Other additions are indicated in the figure legends. The results shown are representative of a series of at least three experiments. Mitochondrial swelling was estimated from the decrease in the absorbance at 520 nm measured by a SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL). Mitochondrial membrane thiol groups were determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) as described in Refs. 11Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 26Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Castilho R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar. In control conditions, mitochondrial membrane protein thiol content was approximately 45 nmol/mg protein and was reduced to approximately 30 nmol/mg protein after treatment with Ca2+and Pi. H2O2 production was assessed by the oxidation of scopoletin by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 (27Boveris A. Martino E. Stoppani A.O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Scopoletin fluorescence was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of, respectively, 365 and 450 nm, on a Hitachi F-4010 fluorimeter. Calibration was performed by adding known quantities of H2O2. In these determinations, citrate was used as a Ca2+chelator, because the presence of EGTA interferes with scopoletin fluorescence. Cyclosporin A was present in all determinations in order to prevent artifacts due to mitochondrial swelling. Oxygen concentration was measured using a Clarke-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co.) in a glass cuvette equipped with magnetic stirring. Antimycin A, catalase (C-10), horseradish peroxidase (type IV-A), ebselen, reduced glutathione, cyclosporin A, EGTA, Hepes, rotenone, and succinate were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were commercial products of the highest purity grade available. Yeast TSA has two highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys-47 and Cys-170) (18Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant proteins C47S and C170S, where the respective cysteine residues were replaced by serine, were purified as described previously (28Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that MPT is dependent on the presence of mitochondria-generated ROS (for review, see Ref. 4Vercesi A.E. Kowaltowski A.J. Grijalba M.T. Meinicke A.R. Castilho R.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) is further supported by the results presented in Fig. 1, showing that mitochondrial swelling associated with MPT induced by Ca2+ and Pi (line e) was prevented by the presence of 16 μm thiol-specific antioxidant enzyme (TSA, line b). This inhibition was similar to that observed in the presence of 2 μm catalase (line c). Similar results were also obtained using MER-5 (results not shown), a mammalian mitochondrial isoform of TSA that is 58% identical to the yeast protein (28Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, we chose to use yeast TSA in this investigation due to the ready availability of site-specific mutant forms. C47S, a mutant form of TSA devoid of thiol peroxidase activity (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar and 28Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), did not show an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial permeabilization (line f), demonstrating that the protective effect of TSA on mitochondrial swelling is not due to a nonspecific protein effect. The full inhibition of the mitochondrial swelling obtained in the presence of cyclosporin A (line a) confirms that the permeabilization is due to MPT (2Zoratti M. Szabó I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). In cell-free systems, the peroxidase activity of TSA is dependent on the addition of a thiol reductant such as thioredoxin or DTT (20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Since in our experiments TSA was added in its oxidized form, it is safe to assume that it is reduced by components of the mitochondrial suspension, possibly thioredoxin, reduced glutathione, or even outer membrane protein thiol groups. Indeed, thioredoxin, a 12.5-kDa protein containing two vicinal cysteines, has been considered the physiological substrate for TSA (19Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C170S is a site-specific mutant of TSA that is active in the presence of low molecular weight thiols such as DTT but is inactive when thioredoxin is used as electron donor (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 19Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). C170S promoted partial inhibition of MPT induced by Ca2+ and Pi (line d), indicating that mitochondrial thioredoxin is at least partially responsible for the reduction of TSA. Although TSA seems to have higher affinity for thioredoxin (19Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this antioxidant protein is also reduced by other thiol compounds (17Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Since mitochondrial suspensions are rich in reduced thiols, such as outer membrane protein thiol groups, it is reasonable to assume that these reductants can also donate electrons to TSA. Indeed, the addition of thioredoxin to the mitochondrial suspension did not stimulate the effect of TSA (results not shown), indicating that TSA is fully reduced by mitochondrial components. A comparison between the effects of TSA, catalase, and ebselen, a selenium-containing heterocyclic compound that exhibits peroxidase-like activity (for review, see Ref. 25Sies H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), on mitochondrial swelling and membrane protein thiol oxidation induced by Ca2+ and Pi is shown in Fig. 2. We observed that catalase (▪) and TSA (•) inhibit mitochondrial swelling and membrane protein thiol oxidation in a dose-dependent manner, although TSA requires concentrations 6–8 times higher than catalase to present the same effect. This is in agreement with the hydrogen peroxide removal activities of these antioxidant proteins (20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Ebselen (▴) also presented an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial swelling and membrane protein thiol oxidation induced by Ca2+ and Pi, in concentrations similar to TSA, but required the concomitant presence of reduced glutathione. Inhibition of mitochondrial swelling and membrane protein thiol oxidation in the presence of 16 μm ebselen or reduced glutathione alone was less than 10% that observed in the presence of both reagents (results not shown). In Fig. 3, mitochondrial H2O2 generation was monitored by the oxidation of scopoletin catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 (27Boveris A. Martino E. Stoppani A.O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As observed previously by monitoring the formation of horseradish peroxidase compound II (8Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Grijalba M.T. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the H2O2 generation of Ca2+-loaded mitochondria is largely increased by the addition of Pi(line a), an event which precedes mitochondrial swelling observed in Fig. 1. The presence of the Ca2+ chelator citrate completely prevented the burst in mitochondrial H2O2 generation induced by Pi(line e), demonstrating that this production is Ca2+-dependent. Ebselen plus reduced glutathione (line b), catalase (line c), and TSA (line d) decreased significantly the detection of mitochondria-generated H2O2. These compounds, which are large molecules not capable of entering intact mitochondria, remove mitochondria-generated H2O2 that diffuses through the membrane and would combine with horseradish peroxidase. We propose that the presence of these peroxidases, by decreasing significantly the concentration of extramitochondrial H2O2, would stimulate H2O2 diffusion through the membrane, resulting in lower intramitochondrial H2O2concentrations. This would decrease the intramitochondrial generation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, probably the main radical species responsible for mitochondrial membrane protein thiol oxidation leading to MPT (4Vercesi A.E. Kowaltowski A.J. Grijalba M.T. Meinicke A.R. Castilho R.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J. Meinicke A.R. Vercesi A.E. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Further supporting this hypothesis, mitochondrial permeabilization induced by the thiol cross-linking reagent phenylarsine oxide, which directly promotes mitochondrial membrane protein thiol cross-linking (26Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Castilho R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), leading to MPT independently of the presence of ROS, was not inhibited by TSA or ebselen (results not shown). This indicates that neither TSA nor ebselen are capable of inhibiting MPT by directly reducing mitochondrial membrane protein thiol groups. Recently, Scorrano et al. (12Scorrano L. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12295-12299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) attempted to reproduce our results showing that MPT is inhibited by catalase and anoxia, obtaining in both situations only a partial inhibition. Based on these results, the authors concluded that MPT was stimulated but not dependent on ROS. We believe that the partial inhibition of ROS-induced MPT by H2O2 removing compounds is due to the fact that mitochondria-generated H2O2 must diffuse through the membrane in order to be removed by catalase, ebselen, or TSA. Therefore, if mitochondrial ROS generation is too intense, as occurs under experimental conditions in which mitochondrial permeabilization is very fast, part of the generated H2O2 may accumulate, decreasing the inhibitory effect of these peroxidases. Indeed, the authors (12Scorrano L. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12295-12299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) observed that catalase presented a larger inhibitory effect on MPT promoted under low mitochondrial Ca2+ loads. The observation that MPT induced by uncouplers was not completely inhibited by the lack of molecular oxygen, as detected by a Clarke electrode (12Scorrano L. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12295-12299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), is not so readily explained, since mitochondria in this situation are expected not to generate ROS. However, it is important to remember that even under very low oxygen tensions, many organic molecules remain tightly bound to molecular oxygen. The experiments shown in Fig.4 were designed to verify the efficiency of oxygen removal from a mitochondrial suspension. Here, respiring mitochondria were incubated in a closed glass chamber in the presence of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and allowed to gradually consume the oxygen present in the reaction medium. After different time periods, mitochondrial respiration was inhibited with antimycin, resulting in different final oxygen tensions, as measured by a Clarke electrode. After total inhibition of mitochondrial respiration occurred, mitochondrial swelling (•) and membrane protein thiol oxidation (▪) induced by Ca2+ and Pi added at different oxygen tensions (see numbers in parentheses) were measured. Under these experimental conditions, in which mitochondria were uncoupled and Ca2+ uptake was driven through a high Ca2+ gradient (300 μm Ca2+, see Refs. 5Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J. Meinicke A.R. Vercesi A.E. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and 8Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), mitochondrial swelling and membrane protein thiol oxidation decreased after oxygen concentrations were progressively lowered by mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, we observed that when mitochondria were allowed to respire during 12 min, and oxygen concentration measured by a Clarke electrode indicated an apparent total anoxia (see numbers in parentheses in Fig. 4), a small but significant mitochondrial swelling and membrane protein thiol oxidation could still be observed. This swelling did not occur when mitochondria were allowed to respire for an additional period of 3 min, suggesting that even when the electrode indicates complete anoxia in the reaction medium, a small quantity of oxygen may still be present in the mitochondrial suspension, allowing for the generation of ROS and occurrence of MPT. In conclusion, the present results show that MPT is fully inhibited by the lack of molecular oxygen or the presence of one of three compounds capable of removing extramitochondrial H2O2, namely catalase, ebselen, and TSA. TSA is known to protect biomolecules from oxidative damage due to its thiol peroxidase activity (20Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the results obtained suggest that it may play an important rolein vivo preventing the occurrence of MPT. MPT inhibition by TSA can be attributed to its hydrogen peroxide removal activity, since no inhibition was observed in the presence of C47S (Fig. 1, line f), a site-specific mutant of TSA which lacks thiol peroxidase activity and does not protect biomolecules from oxidative damage (18Chae H.Z.

A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), although the intramitochondrial forms are probably more important for inhibition of MPT. SP-22 is one of the mammalian mitochondrial isoforms of TSA and seems to account for about 5% of mitochondrial matrix proteins in the bovine adrenal cortex, where steroid hydroxylation generates large amounts of ROS (23Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Also, the TSA isoform thioredoxin peroxidase was shown to inhibit endogenous H2O2 accumulation which precedes apoptosis induced by a variety of compounds (30Zhang P. Liu B. Kang S.W. Seo M.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30615-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that these enzymes are important in the defense of mammalian mitochondria against oxidative stress.

Receptors activate G proteins by stimulating the release of GDP from the α subunit, allowing GTP to bind and to induce dissociation of the G protein α and βγ subunits, which interact with effector proteins to modulate cellular responses (2Freissmuth M.

At least 19 RGS protein cDNAs have been identified in mammalian tissues, all sharing a homologous carboxyl-terminal region of ~120 amino acid residues termed the RGS domain (13Koelle M.R.

Biochemical studies with αi and αq family of G proteins demonstrated that RGS4 and Gα-interacting protein (GAIP) act as GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs) (16Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G.

Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). GAP activity of Sst2 for Gpa1 has also been recently demonstrated (18Apanovitch D.M. Slepak V.Z. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GTPase activity is enhanced by RGS appears to be the stabilization of the transition state conformation of Gα for nucleotide hydrolysis (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 20Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). RGS4 also directly inhibits the interaction of the GTPγS-bound αq subunit with phospholipase Cβ, presumably by binding to the effector region of activated αq (16Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A mutant yeast Gα subunit, Gpa1sst, was recently identified in a screen for novel strains showing the “supersensitive to pheromone” (sst) phenotype. It has a single glycine to serine mutation and escapes from negative regulation by the RGS protein, Sst2 (21DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since many RGS proteins affect Gi-family G proteins, and the crystal structure of the RGS4·αi1 complex was recently reported, we wanted to see if the corresponding G → S mutation in αi1 and αo would produce insensitivity to RGS. A major objective was to obtain a detailed biochemical and mechanistic analysis of this newly identified class of mutations. We report that G αi1 and αo subunit G → S mutants are insensitive to GTPase activation by two different RGS proteins. Quantitative flow cytometry studies demonstrated that a >30–100-fold reduction in affinity of RGS for the α subunit transition state is the mechanism of the insensitivity. In future studies, these mutant α subunits should be useful for evaluating the role of endogenous RGS proteins in the kinetics and function of Gi family members. Given the existence of nearly 20 RGS proteins of which at least 5 act on Gi-family proteins, it would be difficult to inactivate all of them to determine the physiological role of endogenous RGS proteins in Gisignaling. Thus, a Gi α subunit insensitive to RGS proteins can be used to assess the combined role of all RGS proteins in Gi function in vivo. The G184S mutation in the αo sequence was introduced by the megaprimer polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis technique using mutagenic antisense primer 5′-GGTTTCTACGATCGAAGTTGTTTTGAC-3′ as described (22Chen B. Przybyla A.E. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lan K.-L. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The G183S mutation in αi1 was constructed by overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction using sense and antisense mutagenic primers 5′-AGTGAAAACGACGTCAATTGTGGAAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTCCACAATTGACGTCGTTTTCACT-3′, respectively. The coding region of rat RGS4 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from an Expressed Sequence Tag obtained from The Institute of Genomic Research and cloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector. A restriction fragment comprising nucleotides 913–1358 of the complete human RGS7 cDNA 2A. Moritz and R. Taussig, unpublished information. was cloned into the GST expression vector pgGSTag2. The expressed protein contained the RGS domain (nucleotides 985–1341) but only a portion of the long amino terminus of RGS7. All Gα subunits in this paper were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as amino-terminal His6 constructs by a modification of the method of Leeet al. (24Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The GST-RGS4 and -RGS7 fusion proteins were purified as described (25Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The bacterial supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the GST-RGS4 was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. The fusion proteins were cleaved by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 10 units of thrombin/mg of fusion protein followed by incubation with glutathione-agarose to remove GST and any uncleaved GST-RGS4. [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm) was allowed to bind to 50 nm αo for 20 min at room temperature (23–24 °C) or 50 nm αi1for 15 min at 30 °C. After lowering the temperature to 4 °C, the hydrolysis reaction was started by the addition of MgSO4and GTPγS to final concentrations of 15 mm and 200 μm in the presence or absence of 100 nm RGS4 or RGS7. Aliquots (50 μl) were diluted in 1 ml of 15% (w/v) charcoal solution (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2.3, 0 °C) at the indicated time points. The amount of [γ-32P]Pi released at each time point was fit to an exponential function, cpm(t) = cpmo + Δcpm × (1 − e −kt). Wild type or mutant GDP-bound α (1 μm) was mixed with GST-RGS4 fusion protein (1 μm) bound to glutathione-agarose beads (5 × 105 beads/ml) in a final volume of 100 μl of HEDML buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgSO4, 20 ppm deionized Lubrol) with 0.05% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 20 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF (HEDML/AF). After 2 h, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold HEDML/AF buffer with bovine serum albumin, and bound products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain. Labeling of purified His6 αo with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was conducted as described (26Sarvazyan N.S. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham) with sizes between 35 and 78 μm were prepared for flow cytometry by filtering through stainless steel Tyler sieves in HEDML buffer. Two nm GST or GST-RGS4 fusion protein was bound to the beads (5 × 104/ml) for 20 min at room temperature in HEDML buffer. Beads were then washed and incubated with 4 nm FITC-αo with the indicated amounts of unlabeled α subunit in 100 μl of HEDML/AF buffer at room temperature for 2.5 h. The amount of FITC-αo bound to the GST-RGS4 was quantitated on a Becton Dickinson FACScan as described (26Sarvazyan N.S. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data are presented as a fraction of the control fluorescence after subtracting nonspecific binding (~20% of the total). Results were fit to a one-site competition binding function, and the IC50 for the competitors were calculated using Prism version 2.01 for Windows 95 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). The time course of nucleotide binding to α subunits was determined by use of the fluorescent nucleotide derivative, methylanthraniloyl GTPγS as described (27Remmers A.E. Posner R. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13771-13778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar rates of binding were seen for both the G → S mutants and the wild type proteins. Rate constants were 0.20 ± 0.06 and 0.21 ± 0.08 min−1 for αo and 0.049 ± 0.002 and 0.12 ± 0.03 min−1 for αi1, wild type and mutant, respectively. The k cat values for wild type and G → S mutant proteins in the absence of RGS were very similar (Fig. 1 and TableI). In the presence of 100 nmRGS4, the reaction was completed by the first time point for wild type αo and αi1 (Fig. 1). Even at 4 °C, the reaction was too fast to measure with a rate constant greater than 5 min−1. There was no effect of RGS4 on thek cat of either G → S mutant (Fig. 1,B and D, and Table I). The RGS domain fragment of RGS7 (100 nm) increased the k cat of wild type αi1 by ~9-fold, whereas there was no effect on the αi1 G → S (Fig. 1 C and Table I).Table ISingle turnover rates for α subunit with and without RGSk catControl+RGS4+RGS7min−1Wild type αo0.10 ± 0.01>5ND1-aND, not determined.G184S αo0.12 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.01NDWild type αi10.23 ± 0.02 (5)>52.0 ± 0.2G183S αi10.16 ± 0.02 (4)0.22 ± 0.040.16 ± 0.02Rate constants were determined from exponential fits of the data in Fig. 1.

Values are the mean ± S.E. of three determinations except where noted. To determine if GAP activity could be restored at higher concentrations of RGS4, GTP hydrolysis at 1 min was measured with 50 nm Gα subunit and 0–3 μm RGS4. The EC50 values for RGS4 were 5 ± 1 and 10 ± 4 nm for wild type αo and αi1, respectively (Fig.2). There was only a slight increase in GTP hydrolyzed by either G → S mutant α subunit, even at the maximum concentration of RGS4 (Fig. 2). To determine whether the marked reduction in sensitivity of mutant α to RGS4 was due to decreased binding, we tested co-precipitation of α and RGS4. In the absence of AlF4−, GDP-bound α subunit did not bind to GST-RGS4 (Fig. 3). In the presence of AlF4−, wild type αo and αi1 showed substantial binding to GST-RGS4 immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. 3The apparent excess of bound Gα over GST-RGS4 protein was due to incomplete elution of the GST-RGS4 from the beads in this experiment.In contrast, there was no detectable binding of either of the G → S mutant α subunits. To more quantitatively characterize the interaction of α subunits with RGS4, we used a recently developed flow cytometry approach (26Sarvazyan N.S. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of FITC-labeled αoto GST-RGS4 on glutathione-agarose beads was detected by measuring the amount of fluorescence associated with the beads in a FACScan flow cytometer (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unlabeled wild type and mutant α subunits were added to compete for the binding of FITC-αo to RGS4. All binding was done in AlF4−-containing buffer with 4 nmFITC-His6αo and 2 nm GST-RGS4. Nonspecific binding in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled αo represented less than 20% of the total binding. Similarly, GTPγS-bound FITC-αo did not show any specific binding (data not shown). Wild type αo and αi1 reduced the binding of FITC-αo, with IC50s of 30 and 96 nm, respectively (and 95% confidence intervals of 18–35 and 60–150 nm; see Fig.4). As observed for the effects of RGS4 on GTPase activity, we were unable to demonstrate significant interactions of the αi1 G → S mutant protein with RGS4 up to 3 μm α subunit. Because of the limited purity and amounts of αo G → S, the highest concentration used was 300 nm. At this concentration, there was an ~20% decrease in bound FITC-αo. Thus the affinity for both G → S mutant α subunits is at least 30–100-fold lower than that of wild type.Figure 4Affinity of α subunits for GST-RGS4.Binding of FITC-αo was measured by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples contained 4 nm FITC-αo, 2 nm GST-RGS4 on glutathione-agarose beads, and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled α subunits. All incubations were done in the in the presence of AlF4− at room temperature for 2.5 h. Data are presented as a fraction of control with nonspecific binding (~20% of total) subtracted. Experiments have been replicated twice in duplicate. The data for wild type (WT) proteins were fit a to one-site competition function.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report, we identify a G → S point mutation in the conformationally flexible “switch I” region of αo and αi1 that completely eliminates the interaction of these α subunit with RGS proteins. This mutation should be useful in determining the role of endogenous RGS proteins in the physiological functioning of G proteins. This is especially important for Gi, since the kinetics of Gi-mediated regulation of effectors (e.g. adenylyl cyclase (28Thomsen W.J. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8778-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and potassium channels (9Szabo, G., and Otero, A. S. (1989) Trends Pharmacol. Sci.Suppl. 46–49Google Scholar)) are faster than expected for the in vitro GTP hydrolysis rates in the absence of RGS proteins. Deactivation of potassium currents was recently shown to be accelerated by overexpressed RGS1, 3, or 4 in oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells (29Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These data show that exogenous RGS proteins can alter G protein function, but the question of whether normal cellular concentrations of RGS proteins alter the kinetics of ion channel function has not been answered experimentally. With the α subunit mutation described here, it is now possible to directly address that question. This class of G → S mutations was first described in yeast by DiBelloet al. (21DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). They identified, in a genetic screen for the supersensitive phenotype, a G → S mutation in the yeast α subunit (Gpa1sst) that resulted in insensitivity to 1) the functional effects of the yeast RGS protein, Sst2, and 2) the biochemical effects of the Gα-interacting protein. The loss of function due to these G → S mutations is selective, since our mutant α subunits retain nearly normal intrinsic GTPase activity and kinetics of GDP release. The corresponding mutation in αq prevented the RGS7-mediated reduction of phospholipase C activation in co-transfection studies (21DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These latter data also demonstrate that the G → S mutation in αq does not disrupt effector coupling. In preliminary data, 4M. Nanamori, K-L.. Lan, and R. R. Neubig, unpublished information. a myristolylated mutant G → S αi1 inhibited forskolin stimulated type IV adenylyl cyclase activity. Thus, mutating this glycine residue has profound and consistent effects on four different α subunits and their interactions with four different RGS proteins. In the crystal structure of the αi1·RGS4 complex (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), the switch I region of α interacts with three of the four different segments of the RGS consensus domain, but there are also contacts with switch II and switch III. Glycine 183 is located in the switch I region of αi1, forming a turn just before the β1 strand (31Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 33Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Natochin and Artemyev (32Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4300-4303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) recently found that the mutation of Ser-202 in switch II of transducin prevents interaction with retinal specific RGS. Glycine 183 provides a substantial contribution to the buried surface area between αi1 and RGS4 (see Ref. 21DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar for details). There is direct contact of glycine 183 with the Cα and Cβ of serine 85 and Cα of tyrosine 84 of the RGS protein. Introduction of the hydroxymethyl side chain of serine would sterically hinder the formation of a tight complex of α and RGS. Also, threonine 182, which is directly adjacent to glycine 183 mutated in the αi1 G → S mutant, exhibits the greatest change in accessibility of any α residue upon forming the αi1·RGS4 complex (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Thus the G → S mutation may also disrupt local protein conformation and prevent threonine 182 from interacting with the highly conserved residues in RGS. The glycine at position 183 in αi1 is highly conserved among all α subunits. There are only two exceptions; in α7 ofDictyostelium discoidum and in open reading frame B0207.3 ofC. elegans it is replaced by a serine (34Wu L. Gaskins C. Zhou K. Firtel R.A. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is the same residue found in the Gpa1sst, suggesting that these proteins may be naturally occurringsst variants that are insensitive to modulation by RGS proteins. The contact site in RGS is similarly conserved. Either serine or cysteine is present at the position equivalent to 85 in RGS4 where the Gα glycine interacts. Druey and Kehrl (36Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12851-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) recently showed that modification of asparagine 88 and leucine 159 in RGS4 disrupted α subunit binding and GAP activity. In the three-dimensional structure, both residues are very close to serine 85 where glycine 183 in Gα makes contact (19Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Both in co-precipitation and fluorescence competition studies, the affinity of the AlF4--bound mutant α subunits for RGS4 are dramatically reduced. With the flow cytometry method, we obtained quantitative measures of subunit affinities. The IC50values of wild type αo and αi1 (30 and 96 nm, respectively) are similar to the K Dof 45 nm determined by surface plasmon resonance for transducin binding to retinal-specific RGS (37Wieland T. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our IC50is significantly higher than the K D estimated from on and off rates by plasmon resonance for RGS4 and αi1(38Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The differences between the latter data and ours may be due to methodological differences (kinetic versus equilibrium determination or direct binding versus competition methods). In any case, the 30–100-fold lower affinity of the G → S mutant Gα proteins is very clear. Our data also include the first biochemical demonstration of GAP activity by RGS7. At 100 nm, the effect of the RGS7 RGS domain on GTP hydrolysis by αi1 is significantly less than the effect of RGS4. Interestingly, the FITC-αo did not show detectable binding to the GST-RGS7 fusion protein (data not shown). These results are probably due to a lower affinity of RGS7 for αo compared with RGS4. This may be due in part to the lack of full-length RGS7 in the expression construct. In summary, our data show a dramatic disruption in both RGS binding and RGS-mediated GAP activity when the glycine in the switch 1 region of αi1 or αo is mutated to serine. The effect of the G → S mutation is both specific in that it only disrupts RGS binding and quite general in the range of α subunit and RGS proteins that it effects. The introduction of this mutation into G protein α subunits can be used in conjunction with expression or transgenic animal studies to evaluate the physiological role of endogenous RGS proteins in the function of a given G protein. The authors thank Dr. Albrecht Moritz for providing the GST-RGS7 expression construct and Masakatsu Nanamori for expression and purification of the αo protein.

Previously, we have shown that the region between residues 23 and 97 in p53 is necessary for such activity. In an effort to more precisely map a domain necessary for apoptosis within the N terminus, we found that deletion of the N-terminal 23 amino acids compromises, but does not abolish, p53 induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, p53(Δ1–42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, retains the ability to induce apoptosis to an even higher level than wild-type p53. A more extensive deletion, which eliminates the N-terminal 63 amino acids, renders p53 completely inert in mediating apoptosis. In addition, we found that both p53(Δ1–42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate a subset of cellular p53 targets. Furthermore, we showed that residues 53 and 54 are critical for the apoptotic and transcriptional activities of both p53(Δ1–42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23). Taken together, these data suggest that within residues 43–63 lie an apoptotic domain as well as another transcriptional activation domain.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Following stress conditions such as in the presence of damaged DNA or insufficient growth and survival factors, the cellular levels of p53 increase. This leads to one of at least three well understood cellular responses as follows: cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis. Several factors have been shown to determine how a cell responds to the accumulation of p53, e.g. cell type and the presence of several cellular and viral proteins (4Gottlieb M.T. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 5Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 6White E.

Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In addition, the levels of p53 in a given cell can dictate the response of the cell such that lower levels of p53 result in cell cycle arrest (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) or differentiation (10Ronen D. Schwartz D. Teitz Y. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar), whereas higher levels result in apoptosis (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 10Ronen D. Schwartz D. Teitz Y. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar). The functional domains of p53 have been subjected to extensive analysis (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 4Gottlieb M.T. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). A transcriptional activation domain has been shown to lie within N-terminal residues 1–42 (11Unger T. Mietz J.A. Scheffner M. Yee C.L. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 5186-5194Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Chang J. Kim D.-H. Lee S.W. Choi K.Y. Sung Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25014-25019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Within this region there are a number of acidic and hydrophobic residues, characteristics of the acidic activator family of transcriptional factors (13Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Indeed, a double point mutation of the two hydrophobic amino acids at residues 22 and 23 renders p53 transcriptionally inactive (14Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). These two residues presumably are required for the interaction of the activation domain with the TATA box binding protein and/or TATA box binding protein-associated factors (15Lu H. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5154-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 16Thut C. Chen J.L. Klemm R. Tjian R.

It is well established that as a transcriptional activator, p53 up-regulates p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (19el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D.

However, it is not certain what function(s) of p53 is required for apoptosis. The transactivation function of p53 was shown to be required in some experimental protocols (22Attardi L.D. Lowe S.W. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 23Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E.

A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). There are several candidate genes that play roles in apoptosis that can be activated in response to p53 induction, such as BAX (25Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewski M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar),IGFBP3 (26Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N.

Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Several other studies, including our own observations, have provided evidence that p53 might have a transcription-independent function in apoptosis (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 30Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 31Haupt Y. Rowan S.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Recently, the proline-rich region between residues 60 and 90, which comprises five “PXXP” motifs (where P represents proline and X any amino acid), was found to be necessary for efficient growth suppression (33Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (34Sakamuro D. Sabbatini P. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and to serve as a docking site for transactivation-independent growth arrest induced by GAS1 (35Ruaro E.M. Collavin L. Del Sal G. Haffner R. Oren M. Levine A.J. Schneider C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4675-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the region between residues 23 and 97 is necessary for apoptosis (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). To more precisely map such a domain in the N terminus necessary for apoptosis, we have made several new mutants. Analyses of these mutants lead to identification of a novel domain between residues 43 and 63 that can mediate apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets. We also found that a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes both the transcriptional and apoptotic activities mediated by this novel domain. Thus, we hypothesize that a transcriptional activity located in this novel domain regulates a subset of cellular p53 targets that are responsible for apoptosis. Mutant p53 cDNAs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length wild-type p53 cDNA as a template. To generate p53(Δ1–23), the pair of primers used were as follows: forward primer N24, GAT CGA ATT CAC CAT GGG CTA CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC TAA ACT ACT TCC TGA A; and reverse primer C393, GAT CGA ATT CTC AGT CTG AGT CAG GCC CTT. To generate p53(Δ1–42), the pair of primers used were as follows: forward primer N43, GAT CGA ATT CAC CAT GGG CTA CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC TTT GAT GCT GTC CCC G; and reverse primer C393. To generate p53(Δ1–63), the pair of primers used were: forward primer N64, GAT CGA ATT CAC CAT GGG CTA CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC TCC CAG AAT GCC AGA GGC T; and reverse primer C393. To generate p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54), cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–59 and 60–393 were amplified independently and ligated together through an internalAvaII site. The p53(Gln22-Ser23) cDNA was used as a template (14Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The pair of primers for the cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–59 were as follows: forward primer N1, GAT CGA ATT CAC CAT GGG CTA CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC TGA GGA GCC GCA GTC AGA TCC; and reverse primer C59, TTC ATC TGG ACC TGG GTC TTC AGT GCT CTG TTG TTC AAT ATC. The pair of primers for the cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 60–393 were as follows: forward primer N60, ACT GAA GAC CCA GGT CCA; and reverse primer C393. To generate p53(Δ1–42/Gln53-Ser54), the p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) cDNA was amplified by forward primer N43 and reverse primer C393. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The above mutant p53 cDNAs were cloned separately into a tetracycline-regulated expression vector, 10-3, at its EcoRI site, and the resulting plasmids were used to generate cell lines that inducibly express p53. The H1299 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using the calcium chloride method as described (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing inducible proteins of interest were generated as described previously (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Individual clones were screened for inducible expression of the p53 protein by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies against p53. The H1299 cell lines that inducibly express either wild-type p53 or p53(Δ364–393) are p53-3 and p53(Δ364–393)-1, respectively, as described previously (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The H1299 cell line that inducibly expresses p53(Δ62–91) is p53(Δ62–91)-5. 1J. Zhu, W. Zhou, J. Jiang, and X. Chen, manuscript in preparation. Cells were collected from plates in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended with 1× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (37Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4257-4263PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies used to detect p53 were Pab240 and Pab421 (37Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4257-4263PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity purified monoclonal antibody against p21 (Ab-1) was purchased from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Affinity purified anti-actin polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. To determine the rate of cell growth, cells were seeded at 5–10 × 104 cells per 60-mm plate, with or without tetracycline (2 μg per ml). The medium was replaced every 72 h. At times indicated, two plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline twice to remove dead cells and debris. Live cells on the plates were trypsinized and collected separately. Cells from each plate were counted three times by Coulter cell counter. The average number of cells from at least two plates were used for growth rate determination. Cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105 per 90-mm plate with or without tetracycline. Three days after plating, both floating dead cells in the medium and live cells on the plate were collected and fixed with 2 ml of 70% ethanol for at least 30 min. For FACS analysis, the fixed cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 50 μg/ml each of RNase A (Sigma) and propidium iodide (Sigma). The stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCaliber, Becton Dickinson) within 4 h. The percentage of cells in sub-G1, G0-G1, S, and G2-M phases was determined using the ModFit program. The percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase was used as an index for the degree of apoptosis. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per 90-mm plate with or without tetracycline. Three days after plating, both floating cells in the medium and live cells on the plate were collected and concentrated by centrifugation. After stained with trypan blue (Sigma) for 15 min, both live (unstained) and dead (stained) cells were counted two times in a hemocytometer. The percentage of dead cells from control plates was subtracted from the percentage of dead cells from experimental plates, and the resulting value was used as an index for the degree of apoptosis. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed as described (37Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4257-4263PubMed Google Scholar). The p21 probe was made from an 1.0-kilobase pair EcoRI-EcoRI fragment (19el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar); the MDM-2 probe was made from a 2.1-kilobase pair NotI-SmaI fragment (38Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar); the BAXprobe was made from a 290-base pair PstI-BglII fragment (39Oltvai Z.N. Milman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar); the GADD45 probe was from a 400-base pairEcoRI-BamHI fragment (40Smith M.L. Chen I.-T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.-Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar); the GAPDHprobe was made from an 1.25-kilobase pairPstI-PstI cDNA fragment (41Marty F.L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S.L. Dani C. Jeateur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar); and theMCG14 cDNA probe was a 200-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment identified by CLONTECH PCR-Select cDNA subtraction.2 Previously, we showed that p53(Δ1–22), which lacks the N-terminal 22 amino acids, can still induce apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Since both residues 22 and 23 are critical for p53 transcriptional activity (14Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), we decided to determine whether p53(Δ1–23), which deletes the N-terminal 23 amino acids, would also be able to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets. We have previously established a cell line that expresses high levels of wild-type p53 called p53-3 (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). This line was established using a tetracycline-regulated expression system as described previously (42Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). By using similar techniques, we established nine stable cell lines that express p53(Δ1–23). Three representative cell lines, p53(Δ1–23)-9, -10, and -23, are shown in Fig.1 A. Western blot analysis showed that these cell lines express p53(Δ1–23) at levels comparable to wild-type p53 in p53-3 cells (Fig. 1 A). To characterize p53(Δ1–23), we looked at its transcriptional and apoptotic activities and the growth rate of the cell line p53(Δ1–23)-9. The transcriptional activity was determined by monitoring the expression of the endogenous gene, p21, a well defined transcriptional target of p53 (19el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). We found that p53(Δ1–23) is still capable of activating p21, albeit to a much less degree than wild-type p53 (Fig. 1 A). Next, the growth rates of p53(Δ1–23)-9 cells under both uninduced and induced conditions were determined, and these cells failed to multiply following p53 expression (Fig. 1 B). To exclude potential effects of the regulator tetracycline and/or the tet-vp16 transactivator (42Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) on cell growth, we analyzed the growth rate of the cell line H24-1, which was similarly established but did not express any protein. The results showed that the growth rates of H24-1 cells under both the uninduced (+tet) and induced (−tet) conditions were nearly identical (Fig. 1 C), indicating that both tetracycline and tet-vp16 transactivator have no effect on cell growth. It is well established that the percentage of cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content reflects the extent to which cells are undergoing apoptosis (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 23Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Since p53 can induce apoptosis in H1299 cells (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 31Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), FACS analysis was used to observe the extent of apoptosis by determining the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. The results showed that 18% of cells expressing p53(Δ1–23) had a sub-G1 DNA content 3 days after induction of this mutant, compared with less than 5% of the same cells expressing no p53 (Fig. 1, D and E; TableI). Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that 15% of cells were dead, which is consistent with FACS analysis. In contrast, about 45 and 30% of cells had a sub-G1 DNA content at day 3 following expression of either wild-type p53 or transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23), respectively (Table I). The FACS results also showed that the number of cells in S phase was decreased from 38 to 22.3% following induction of p53(Δ1–23), and these cells primarily arrested in G1(Fig. 1, D and E). Similar results were obtained using another high p53(Δ1–23) producer, p53(Δ1–23)-10.Table ICharacteristics of various mutant p53 proteinsArrest1-aArrest was assayed by the relative growth rate of cells and the number of cells in S phase.Apoptosis1-bApoptosis was assayed at day 3 by the percentage of cells staining with trypan blue and by determination of the sub-G1phase cells using the Modfit program.Wild-type p53+++45p53(Gln22-Ser23)−30p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54)−p53(Δ1–22)+++>60p53(Δ1–23)++15–18p53(Δ1–42)+/−50–68p53(Δ1–42/Gln53-Ser54)−p53(Δ1–63)−1-a Arrest was assayed by the relative growth rate of cells and the number of cells in S phase.1-b Apoptosis was assayed at day 3 by the percentage of cells staining with trypan blue and by determination of the sub-G1phase cells using the Modfit program. Open table in a new tab Since p53(Δ1–23) is still capable of inducing apoptosis and p53 activation domain lies within residues 1–42 (11Unger T. Mietz J.A. Scheffner M. Yee C.L. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 5186-5194Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Chang J. Kim D.-H. Lee S.W. Choi K.Y. Sung Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25014-25019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we determined whether the other half (residues 24–42) of the previously defined activation domain is required for apoptosis. To this end, we established 16 individual stable cell lines that inducibly express p53(Δ1–42) that lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids. Three representative cell lines, p53(Δ1–42)-2, -5, and -11, were shown in Fig. 2 A. Consistent with previous results that p53(Gln22-Ser23) cannot activate p21 (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 22Attardi L.D. Lowe S.W. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 33Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), p53(Δ1–42) only minimally activated p21 as compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 2 A). We then determined the growth rate of a high producer, p53(Δ1–42)-2. Surprisingly, we found that a majority of cells died within 3 days following induction of p53(Δ1–42) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, both trypan blue exclusion assay and FACS analysis showed that approximately 50–68% of cells underwent apoptosis (Fig.2 C; Table I). Similar results were obtained from several other cell lines. These results suggest that the entire previously defined activation domain within the N-terminal 42 amino acids is dispensable for apoptosis. In fact, deletion of this region enhanced the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (Table I). To delineate further the domain in the N terminus required for apoptosis, we generated seven inducible cell lines expressing p53(Δ1–63) which lacks the N-terminal 63 amino acids but contains an intact proline-rich region. Three representative cell lines, p53(Δ1–63)-14, -22, and -27, were shown in Fig.3 A, and the activity of p53(Δ1–63) was analyzed as above. The results showed that p53(Δ1–63) was unable to activate p21 expression (Fig.3 A), and p53(Δ1–63)-14 cells, a high p53 producer, continued to multiply when p53(Δ1–63) was induced (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, both FACS analysis and trypan blue exclusion assay showed that neither apoptosis nor cell cycle arrest was observed in cells expressing p53(Δ1–63) (Fig. 3 C and Table I). The ability of transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23) to induce apoptosis leads to the hypothesis that p53 has transcription-independent apoptotic activity (9Chen X. Ko L.J. Jarayaman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 31Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 33Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Since p53(Δ1–42) lacks the previously defined activation domain and only minimally activates p21 as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 A), it appears that it can induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner. To ascertain whether p53(Δ1–42) contains a transcriptional activity, the expression patterns of four well defined cellular p53 targets, p21, MDM2,GADD45, and BAX, were analyzed in cells expressing p53(Δ1–42) by Northern blot analysis (Fig.4 A). The expression levels of these genes in cells with or without p53 were quantitated by PhosphorImage scanner, and the fold increase of their relative mRNAs was calculated after normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels (TableII). The results showed clearly that p53(Δ1–42) significantly activated MDM2 (8-fold),GADD45 (7.03-fold), and BAX (3.9-fold) but only minimally activated p21 (1.83-fold). As expected, wild-type p53 but not mutant p53(Gln22-Ser23) activated these cellular p53 targets (Fig. 4 A; Table II). As a control, p53(Δ64–91), which lacks all of the five PXXP motifs, was examined. The proline-rich domain in p53 is dispensable for transactivation (33Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 34Sakamuro D. Sabbatini P. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As expected, p53(Δ64–91) activated these p53 targets (Fig. 4 A and Table II). Since p53(Δ1–63) failed to activate any of these p53-regulated genes (data not shown), the results suggest that another activation domain lies within residues 43–63. For clarity, we designate the originally defined activation domain located within residues 1-42 as activation domain I and this novel domain as activation domain II.Table IITranscriptional activities of various mutant p53 proteins=Fold increase in relative mRNA2-a=Fold = mRNA(+p53)/mRNA(−p53).p21mdm2gadd45baxWild-type p536.7940.69.454.2p53(Δ1–42)1.838.87.033.9p53(Δ62–91)3.65672.7p53(Gln22-Ser23)1.431.21.441.32-a =Fold = mRNA(+p53)/mRNA(−p53). Open table in a new tab The above observations raise the following question: why does p53(Gln22-Ser23) fail to activate these well-defined p53 transcriptional targets (Fig. 4 A; Table II) despite the fact that it still contains an intact activation domain II? One of the possibilities is that p53(Gln22-Ser23) might be still able to activate a subset of p53 transcriptional targets which have yet been identified. To this end, we tested the expression patterns of several potential p53 targets identified in our laboratory. We found that one putative p53 transcriptional target, MCG14, was activated by p53(Gln22-Ser23) to a level comparable to that by wild-type p53, p53(Δ1–42), p53(Δ64–91), and p53(Δ364–393) (Fig. 4 B). Since a double point mutation at residues 22 and 23 abolishes the transcriptional activity of the activation domain I (14Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1999664492,"The Kidd (JK) blood group is carried by an integral membrane glycoprotein which transports urea through the red cell membrane and is also present on endothelial cells of the vasa recta in the kidney. The exon-intron structure of the human blood group Kidd/urea transporter gene has been determined. It is organized into 11 exons distributed over 30 kilobase pairs. The mature protein is encoded by exons 4–11. The transcription initiation site was identified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction at 335 base pairs upstream of the translation start point located in exon 4. The 5′-flanking region, from nucleotide −837 to −336, contains TATA and inverted CAAT boxes as well as GATA-1/SP1 erythroid-specificcis-acting regulatory elements. Analysis of the 3′-untranslated region reveals that the two equally abundant erythroid transcripts of 4.4 and 2.0 kilobase pairs arise from usage of different alternative polyadenylation signals.No obvious abnormality of the Kidd/urea transporter gene, including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, has been detected by Southern blot analysis of the blood of two unrelated Jknull individuals (B.S. and L.P.), which lacks all Jk antigens and Jk proteins on red cells, but was genotyped as homozygous for a “silent”Jk b allele. Further analysis indicated that different splice site mutations occurred in each variant. The first mutation affected the invariant G residue of the 3′-acceptor splice site of intron 5 (variant B.S.), while the second mutation affected the invariant G residue of the 5′-donor splice site of intron 7 (variant L.P.). These mutations caused the skipping of exon 6 and 7, respectively, as seen by sequence analysis of the Jk transcripts present in reticulocytes. Expression studies in Xenopusoocytes demonstrated that the truncated proteins encoded by the spliced transcripts did not mediate a facilitated urea transport compared with the wild type Kidd/urea transporter protein and were not expressed on the oocyte's plasma membrane. These findings provide a rational explanation for the lack of Kidd/urea transporter protein and defect in urea transport of Jknull cells.

These findings provide a rational explanation for the lack of Kidd/urea transporter protein and defect in urea transport of Jknull cells. The Kidd blood group system (JK) is defined by two codominant alleles, Jk a and Jk b, of similar frequency (0.51 and 0.49, respectively) in the Caucasian population, but showing large differences in other ethnic groups (1Race R.R. Sange R. Blood Groups in Man. 6th ed. Blackwell, Oxford1975: 178-260Google Scholar,2Daniels G. Human Blood Groups. Blackwell, Oxford1995: 257-355Google Scholar). Alloantibodies against the Jk antigens may occasionally be involved in severe transfusion incompatibilities and newborn hemolytic disease. There are three common phenotypes Jk(a+b−), Jk(a−b+), and Jk(a+b+) and a rare null phenotype, Jk(a−b−), first described by Pinkertonet al. (3Pinkerton F.J. Mermod L.E. Liles B.A. Jack Jr., J.A. Noades J. Vox Sang. 1959; 4: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), also called Jknull. The frequency of this phenotype is increased in certain populations (Asian, Polynesian, or Indian extraction). The Jknull phenotype results from two different genetic backgrounds: (i) homozygous inheritance of a “silent” allele Jk at the JK locus and (ii) inheritance of a dominant inhibitor gene In(Jk), unlinked to the JK locus (1Race R.R. Sange R. Blood Groups in Man. 6th ed. Blackwell, Oxford1975: 178-260Google Scholar, 2Daniels G. Human Blood Groups. Blackwell, Oxford1995: 257-355Google Scholar). Following immunization by transfusion or pregnancy, Jknull individuals may produce an antibody called anti-Jk3 (or anti-Jkab), which reacts with all common red cells carrying the Jka and/or Jkb antigens, but is unreactive with Jknullcells themselves. The discovery that red cells from Jknull individuals exhibited an increased resistance to lysis in aqueous 2 murea (4Heaton D.C. McLoughlin K. Transfusion. 1982; 22: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) led to the suspicion that the Jk antigens might be related to the urea transporter of the human erythrocytes (for a review, see Moulds (5Moulds J.M. Blood Cell Biochem. 1995; 6: 267-278Crossref Google Scholar)). This prediction was fully confirmed by molecular cloning of the human erythroid urea transporter (clone HUT11) (6Olivés B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by cross-hybridization with a rabbit cDNA transporter (7You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W-S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and the demonstration that the HUT11 urea transporter and the Kidd blood group are carried by the same protein (8Olivés B. Mattei M-G. Huet M. Neau P. Martial S. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15607-15610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This is based on the following findings: (i) in coupled transcription-translation assays, the HUT11 cDNA directed the synthesis of a 36-kDa protein, which was immunoprecipitated by a human anti-Jk3 antibody; (ii) the anti-Jk3 immunoprecipitated also a protein material of similar mass from all red cell membranes (after N-glycanase treatment), except those from Jknull cells; (iii) a rabbit antibody against the HUT11-protein reacted on immunoblots with all human erythrocytes except those from Jknull; and (iv) the structural gene encoding HUT11 was assigned to chromosome 18q12-q21 byin situ hybridization, like the Kidd blood group locus. More recently, the Kidd blood group Jka/Jkbpolymorphism (D280N) was determined and used to demonstrate its lack of association with type 1 diabetes mellitus (9Olivés B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnell A. Todd J. Cartron J-P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Kidd/HUT11 polypeptide is expressed on human red cells as well as on the endothelial cells of vasa recta in the inner and outer medulla of the kidney (10Xu Y. Olivés B. Bailly P. Fischer E. Ripoche P. Ronco P. Cartron J-P. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1996; 51: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Promeneur D. Rousselet G. Bankir L. Bailly P. Cartron J-P. Ripoche P. Trinh-Trang-Tran M.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid urea transport may help to preserve the osmotic stability and deformability of the red cells and to stabilize osmotic gradients in the renal medulla (12Macey R.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Macey R.I. Youssef L.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C669-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the kidney, this transport system contributes to the urinary concentrating mechanism (14Knepper M.A. Star A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F393-F401PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gillin A.G. Sands J.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 146-154PubMed Google Scholar) involved in water preservation. Recently, a new urea transporter specific for the human kidney (clone HUT2) was cloned (16Olivés B. Martial S. Mattei M-G. Matassi G. Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and functionally compared with the erythroid transporter (17Martial S. Olivés B. Abrami L. Couriaud C. Bailly P. You G. Hediger M. Cartron J-P. Ripoche P. Rousselet G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1264-F1268PubMed Google Scholar). These transporters are analogous to those found in other species, and their characterization, probably as a new family of transporters, will contribute to the clarification of their critical role in the renal water conservation mechanism (see Hediger et al. (18Hediger M.A. Smith C.P. You G. Lee W-S. Kanai Y. Shayakul C. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1615-1623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) for review) (19Shayakul C. Steel A.

In this report we have further characterized the gene encoding the erythroid Kidd/HUT11 polypeptide, and we have analyzed the molecular basis of the Jknull phenotype from two unrelated individuals. Blood samples from individuals of common Jk phenotypes came from the Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine (Paris, France). Two Jknull blood samples were investigated; donor L.P. was from the Center National de Référence sur les Groupes Sanguins in Paris, and donor B.S. was from the Irwin Memorial Blood Center (San Francisco, CA). Restriction endonucleases, modifying enzymes, pUC vectors, andN-glycosidase F (PNGase-F purified from Flavobacterium meningosepticum) came from New England Biolabs (UK). Radiolabeled nucleotides, [14C]urea (1.96 GBq/mmol), and [3H]raffinose (188.7 GBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham (Bucks, UK). Expand High Fidelity and Expand Long Template PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UT, untranslated; SP, sense primer; AP, antisense primer; nt, nucleotide; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). systems from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) were used for PCR amplification. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger) with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) or with ThermoSequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit from Amersham (Bucks, UK) using 5′(Cy5)-primers (Genset, France). Approximately 2.5 × 106 phages from a human leukocyte genomic library constructed in EMBL3 Sp6/T7 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) were plated and hybridized under standard procedures with a 32P-labeled full-length HUT11 cDNA probe (1–1528) using the random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). The positive clones were initially mapped bySacI digestion followed by Southern blot hybridization using HUT11 and the 5′-end region (see below) as probes. The positive individual gene fragments were subcloned into pUC vector and sequenced. The exons, identified from the HUT11 cDNA sequence, and their flanking regions, were fully sequenced as were some short introns. The introns were sized by PCR using primers from flanking regions of the intron. At least, all sizes were confirmed by PCR using human genomic DNA as template and Expand Long Template PCR system. The 5′-UT sequence was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) (16Olivés B. Martial S. Mattei M-G. Matassi G. Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), using the human fetal liver 5′-RACE Ready cDNA kit with Advantage KlenTaq Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH). Briefly, a hemi-nested PCR amplification under stringent conditions (94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, for 30 cycles) was carried out between the primer complementary to 5′-end anchor and two antisense primers from the 5′-coding sequence of HUT11 cDNA, AS-1 (antisense primer, position 109–86) and AS-2 (antisense primer, position 44–21). After agarose gel analysis, transfer, and Southern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled probe Pr.2* (nt −194 to −174), 5′-CTACCTAAAATAAAGATTATA-3′, deduced from the 5′-end of an unpublished human bone marrow cDNA clone, the positive bands were subcloned and sequenced. Similarly, the 3′-UT sequence was amplified using human bone marrow Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) between the primers complementary to 3′-end adaptor and two sense primers from the 3′-coding sequence of HUT11 cDNA, SP-1 (sense primer, position 1219–1242) and SP-2 (sense primer, position 1304–1327. For primer designation, nt +1 was taken as the first nucleotide of the HUT11 initiation codon (6Olivés B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA from human fetal liver (CLONTECH) or total RNAs isolated from six injected oocytes according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% (w/v) formaldehyde, 1% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred to nylon filters (Zeta-probe GT, Bio-Rad). Hybridization with 32P-labeled probes was carried at 65 °C in 0.25 m Na2HPO4, 7% (w/v) SDS. Stringent washes were performed in 0.02 mNa2HPO4, 1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and exposed to Biomax-MR film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. Total genomic DNA from B lymphoid cell lines (Epstein-Barr virus-transformed) or from leukocytes was digested with SacI restriction enzyme according to the supplier (10 units/μg of DNA), resolved by electrophoresis in 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham, UK). The blot was prehybridized in 0.25m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS for 5 min at 65 °C and then hybridized using a full-length32P-labeled cDNA probe (exon 1–5′ to end exon 11) in the same buffer. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C, and the last washing was in 0.02 mNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 3% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Five micrograms of total reticulocyte RNA extracted by the acid-phenol-ammonium method (22Izraeli S. Ppfleiderer C. Lion T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were used to produce the first cDNA strands using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). One sixth of the cDNA products was used to perform a hemi-nested PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min 15 s, for 30 cycles) in a first step between primers SP-A (sense primer, position −21 to −1) and AS-B (antisense primer, position 1260–1237). The second PCR was performed with 1/25 of the first PCR products in the same conditions, using primers SP-A and AS-C (antisense primer, position 1234–1211). Final PCR products were identified by Southern blot analysis, subcloned, and sequenced on both strands, using an automated Alf-Express sequencer (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Direct PCR amplification was carried on genomic DNA (100 ng) under stringent conditions (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, for 30 cycles) between primers designed from intronic sequences flanking each exon. The PCR products were subcloned and sequenced. To avoid PCR artifacts, sequencing was performed on both strands using independent PCR reactions. Full-length (Jk+) and spliceoforms (Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7)) cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRV-digested pT7TS plasmid (kindly provided by P. Krieg, Austin, TX) and placed under the control of the T7 promoter. The corresponding proteins were synthesized in vitro in the transcription-translation coupled reticulocyte lysate kit from Promega (Madison, WI) in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine (1.85 Gbq/mmol, Amersham, Bucks, UK) and immunoprecipitated with the human anti-Jk3antiserum obtained from an immunized Jk(a−b−) individual and with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal region (residues 8–22) of the Kidd/urea transporter polypeptide (anti-HUT11), as described previously (8Olivés B. Mattei M-G. Huet M. Neau P. Martial S. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15607-15610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% separating gel) on a discontinuous buffer system (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), followed by enlightening treatment (NEN Life Science Products) and autoradiography. After linearization of the pT7TS-cDNA constructs with SmaI restriction enzymes, capped sense RNAs were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase from the mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression studies were carried out by microinjection of cRNAs (40 ng/oocyte) in collagenase-treatedXenopus oocytes (24Martial S. Ripoche P. Ibarra C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and functional tests were realized 3 days after injection as described previously (6Olivés B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the expression of Jk+, Jk−(Δ6), and Jk−(Δ7) isoforms, fractions enriched for oocyte plasma membranes were prepared from 25 oocytes, as described by Wall and Patel (25Wall D.A. Patel S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). N-Glycosidase F treatments were performed according to the manufacturer, and a control reaction was carried out in enzyme-free buffer in otherwise identical conditions. Untreated andN-glycosidase F-treated plasma membranes, equivalent to six oocytes, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the affinity-purified antibody anti-HUT11 (2 μg/ml). Specifically bound antibodies were detected with affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) (1:15,000 dilution) and using Luminol/Enhancer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocole. Of the seven positive clones isolated from partially Sau3A-digested human leukocyte genomic DNA library, three λJk2, λJk10, and λJk12 were used to characterize the exon organization and to define the intron/exon junction sequences (Fig. 1).SacI restriction mapping was established by Southern blot hybridization with the HUT11 cDNA and the 5′- and 3′-end regions (see below) as probes. Sequence analysis of the SacI fragments from the three genomic clones revealed that the humanJK gene was composed of 11 exons distributed over 30 kb of DNA (Fig. 1 A). The exon sizes ranged from 50 bp (exon 10) to 551 bp (refer to the first used polyadenylation signal). The three first exons include the 5′-UT part of the gene (see below) and the remaining eight exons the open reading frame. The translation initiation codon was located in exon 4 and the stop codon in exon 11. Thus, exons 4–11 corresponded to amino acids 1–50, 51–113, 114–156, 157–221, 222–270, 271–315, 316–332, and 333–389, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The intron sizes determined by PCR, ranged from 0.6 kb to approximately 8.6 kb. After partial sequence of the introns, all exon/intron junctions were found to contain the canonical 5′-donorgt and the 3′-acceptor ag sequences (Fig.1 B). Each class of intron-exon boundary was found in theJK gene. When all exons were sequenced and compared with the published HUT11 cDNA isolated from a human bone marrow library, two differences, one amino acid change (K44E) and one dipeptide deletion were noted in exon 4 and 8, respectively. These changes correspond to nonallelic differences previously reported between HUT11 and theJka/Jkb alleles (9Olivés B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnell A. Todd J. Cartron J-P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the Jk transcript was cloned by a modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, using a fetal liver cDNA as matrix, and hemi-nested PCR between the 5′-end anchor (sens primer, 49 bp) and the AS-1 and AS-2 antisense primers (see “Materials and Methods”). When the amplification products were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with the probe Pr.2* (nt −194 to −174), two bands of ~270 and ~430 bp were detected, indicating the presence of an alternative splicing event (Fig. 2). These bands, which corresponded to the first ~220 and ~380 bp, respectively, at the 5′ end of the primer AS-2 (after deduction of the 49 bp from the 5′-anchor primer), were subcloned, and five independent clones were sequenced. The results indicated that the ~430-bp fragment included the full- length transcript and located the transcription initiation site at 335 nt upstream from the translation initiation codon (Fig. 2). The ~270-bp fragment, however, which was generated by alternative splicing lacked 157 nt corresponding to exon 3 (Fig. 2). This was confirmed by Southern blot with an exon 3-specific probe which hybridized with the ~430-bp but not the ~270-bp fragments (not shown). All of this information was used to deduce the structure organization of the three first exons of the JKgene described above. Further studies (reverse transcription-PCR) of the transcripts isolated from normal human reticulocytes indicated the presence of alternatively spliced transcripts lacking sequences encoded by exons 8 and 9, and exons 7–9 (data not shown). Next, 500 bp upstream of the erythroid transcription initiation site from the λJk2 genomic clone was sequenced and analyzed to identify putative cis-acting regulatory elements. This region (nt −837 to −336) contains the consensus motifs AP-3, NF-ATp, and GATA-1 in reverse orientation at position −529/−522, −586/−581, and −806/−801, respectively. Sequence deviating by one nucleotide from the consensus motifs Ets-1, AP-2, reverse Ets-1, CTCF, and a reverse SP-1 were identified between positions −587 and −794 (Fig. 2). A typical TATA box was also present at nt −362/−358, which is in the expected range of 25 to 30 nucleotides upstream of the erythroid transcription initiation site (nt −335). Although two inverted CAAT boxes (ATTG) were identified at nt −95 and −220, only the closest of transcription initiation site might be functional. The transcription start site of the JKgene is short (335 bp upstream of the translation initiation site) and cannot account for the size difference between the two major transcripts (~2.0 and ~4.4 kb) detected in erythroid tissues by Northern blot (16Olivés B. Martial S. Mattei M-G. Matassi G. Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether these differences arose from the 3′ end of the Jk transcripts. At first, two unconsensus polyadenylation signals (AATTAAA and TATAAA) and four consensus sites (AATAAA) have been located by sequence analysis of 3′-RACE-PCR amplifications performed with reticulocyte transcripts (see “Materials and Methods”) and by sequence analysis of the 3′-end from the λJk12 genomic clone (Fig. 3). Then, Northern blot analysis using the HUT11 probe as well as probes p1, p2, and p3 located in the 3′-UT region of the JK gene clearly indicated that the two erythroid transcripts of 4.4 and 2.0 kb arose from differential usage of two distinct polyadenylation signals which are separated by 2.0 kb. Indeed, the HUT11 probe located 5′ to the proximal signal AATTAAA hybridized both with the 4.4- and 2.2-kb transcripts, while probes p1, p2, and p3, located downstream this signal hybridize only with the 4.0-kb species (Fig. 3). The colinearity of the full 3′-end region (exon 11) was confirmed by hemi-nested reverse transcription-PCR and hybridization of the 2.7-kb reaction product with the HUT11 probe (see Fig. 3). In preliminary investigations, we confirmed by Western blot analysis with the affinity-purified anti-HUT11 antibody (nonglycosylation dependent) (10Xu Y. Olivés B. Bailly P. Fischer E. Ripoche P. Ronco P. Cartron J-P. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1996; 51: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar), that the Jknull cells under study (B.S. and L.P.) lack the Jk erythrocyte membrane protein (45–69 kDa), as seen in Fig. 4 A, as well as the Jka and Jkb antigens (data not shown). Next, we demonstrated by Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA an identical SacI digestion pattern of the Jknullsamples as compared with common Jk(a+b−) and Jk(a−b+) phenotypes (Fig. 4 B), indicating that a gross rearrangement ofJK gene did not occur in these variants. The five detected bands (ranging from 2 to 7 kb) are fully concordant with the known restriction sites in the JK gene (see Fig. 1) and altogether contain all 11 exons (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, restriction analysis with a number of other enzymes showed a simple pattern consistent with a single copy gene (data not shown). Further analysis by DNA genotyping (9Olivés B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnell A. Todd J. Cartron J-P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) indicated that both Jknullindividuals were homozygous for a silent Jk b allele (data not shown). To determine the molecular basis of the Jknull phenotypes, total reticulocyte RNA from donors B.S. and L.P. were prepared and used to amplify full-length Jk transcripts. Three amplification products of different size (not shown) were obtained from the B.S. sample, and several independent clones of each size were sequenced. We identified spliceoforms that resulted from the alternative splicing of exon 6 (Jk−(Δ6)), exons 6, 8, and 9 (Jk−(Δ6, 8, and 9)) and exons 6–9 (Jk−(Δ6–9)). The nucleotide sequence of the 5/7 exon junction found in the Jk−(Δ6) transcript is shown in Fig. 5. All of these spliced transcripts corresponded to the spliceoforms found in normal Jk+ individuals (see above), which in addition, all lacked exon 6 sequences. The Jk−(Δ6) clone carried the nt 838A polymorphism typical of the Jk b allele (9Olivés B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnell A. Todd J. Cartron J-P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which confirmed the results from the DNA genotyping (see above). No other alteration of the nucleotide sequence was detected. Since exon 6 was missing in all transcripts, the intron/exon junctions surrounding this exon were analyzed on the genomic DNA prepared from donor B.S. We found that the skipping of exon 6 was most likely caused by a G → A transition that affected the invariant G residue of the 3′-acceptor splice site of intron 5 (Fig. 4 C). The transcripts from B.S. potentially encode truncated polypeptides; the predicted Jk−(Δ6) polypeptide would lack amino acid residues 114–156 (encoded by exon 6) of the third and fourth transmembrane domains of the Kidd/urea transporter. The other spliceoforms (Jk−(Δ6, 8, and 9) and Jk−(Δ6–9)) would encode much smaller peptides with a new C-terminal extension generated by a frameshift and premature termination. Examination of the second Jknull sample (L.P.) revealed the presence of Jkb transcripts lacking exon 7 sequences (Jk−(Δ7) and Jk−(Δ7, 8, and 9)). The nucleotide sequence of the 6/8 exon junction found in the Jk−(Δ7) spliceoform is shown in Fig. 5. Further studies of the genomic DNA indicated that the skipping of exon 7 was most likely caused by a G → T transversion that affected the invariant G residue of the 5′-donor splice site of intron 7 (Fig. 4 D). The protein isoform encoded by the Jk−(Δ7) transcript would lack amino acids 157–221 and include new C-ter residues generated by a frameshift and premature termination. In all instances, the protein isoforms potentially encoded by the spliced transcripts identified in B.S and L.P. were not detected on red cells by Western blot analysis with the anti-HUT11 antibody (see above). To understand why Jknull red cells lack Jk polypeptides and exhibit a defective urea transport activity, we examined whether the Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7) transcripts characteristic of these cells could be expressed in vitroand in vivo. In the cell-free transcription-translation coupled system, the plasmids pT7TS-Jk+, -Jk−(Δ6), and -Jk−(Δ7) directed the synthesis of 36-, 31-, and 17-kDa protein bands, respectively, which were immunoprecipitated with the affinity-purified anti-HUT11 antibody and with the human anti-Jk3 antibody (Fig. 6). No radioactive material in these regions could be immunoprecipitated from transcription-translation of the luciferase peptide control vector. To test whether these Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7) proteins were expressed as functional urea transporters, cRNA transcripts were synthesized and injected into Xenopusoocytes. Three days later, we found that the [14C]urea uptake of Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7) cRNA-injected oocytes was not different from that of water-injected control oocytes, whereas the [14C]urea uptake of Jk+ cRNA-injected oocytes reached 38 pmol/oocyte after 3 min (Fig. 7 A). Northern blot analysis also revealed that all cRNA injected oocytes showed a stable specific signal between day 0 and 3 after injection (see Fig.7 B). Protein expression in oocyte plasma membranes was also analyzed by Western blot analysis with the affinity-purified anti-HUT11 antibody. We found that a strongly reactive band of 46–69 kDa was present in control oocytes expressing the functional Jk+ protein, the size of which was reduced to 36 kDa after N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 7 C). However, using oocytes injected with the Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7) cRNAs, no signal could be detected by Western blotting, neither in the total cell lysates (not shown) nor in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig.7 C). The studies reported here define the structural organization of the JK gene which encodes the human Kidd blood group/urea transporter protein. This gene spans 30 kb of DNA and consisted of 11 exons, of which exons 4–11 contained all the coding information for the mature protein. Exons 4–11 appear as being distributed along the gene into two groups of two times two exons separated by a large intronic sequence (E4, E5 and E6, E7, then E8, E9 and E10, E11), evocative of an internal gene duplication. Indeed, this may parallel the topology of the Jk polypeptide which can be subdivided into two homologous hydrophobic parts, each carrying a LP box (LPXXTXPF) encoded by exons 7 and 11, respectively, and previously reported to be an internal duplicated signature sequence of urea transporters (26Rousselet G. Bailly P. Ripoche P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F554-F555PubMed Google Scholar). The erythroid transcription initiation site of the JK gene was identified 335 bp upstream from the translation initiation site. Examination of nucleotide sequences that are immediately upstream revealed a typical TATA box, one inverted CAAT box at the expected position, and several putative cis-regulatory elements that may bind a variety of transcription factors (27Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), among which are those involved in erythroid/megakaryocytic expression (28Mignotte V. Lemarchandel V. Roméo P.H. Hematologie. 1995; 1: 19-30Google Scholar, 29Orkin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The presence of a potential binding site for a NF-ATp factor which regulates the inducible expression of several cytokine genes is intriguing (30Ahuja S.K. Shetty A. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26381-26389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, functional analysis will be required to determine which elements and which factors bind to this promoter in tissues were the Kidd/urea transporter is expressed. We have also shown that the 4.4- and 2.0-kb erythroid Kidd/urea transport mRNAs detected by Northern blot (16Olivés B. Martial S. Mattei M-G. Matassi G. Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) arise from usage of two different polyadenylation signals, indicating that the two equally abundant transcripts encode the same 45-kDa polypeptide. This is at the opposite to UT1 and UT2 urea transport transcripts from rat kidney (4.0 and 2.9 kb, respectively), which are alternative splice products derived from a single gene by differential utilization of alternative 5′-exon groups (19Shayakul C. Steel A. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The rat homologue of HUT11, called UT3 (20Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Takui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is encoded by a single 3.8-kb transcript, which is translated into a protein of 384 amino acids sharing 80% identity with HUT11. It is possible that the first polyadenylation signal used in the human primary transcript is absent or not used in the rat. The role of large 3′-UT sequences in some transcripts is not well understood, although some may play a role in regulation of expression (32Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 903-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 33Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We next examined blood from two rare unrelated Jknullindividuals, one Caucasian (L.P.) and another of Chinese (B.S.) origin, that lacked Jk antigens and Jk protein expression on red cells. Genomic DNA analysis indicated that both donors were homozygotes for aJk b allele that exhibited no alteration of the coding sequence. Therefore, although the JK genes were present in these variants, they were not phenotypically expressed. Sequence analysis of reticulocyte transcripts from B.S. and L.P. indicated that alternatively spliced transcripts lacking at least exon 6 and exon 7, respectively, were present. Examination of exon/intron junctions of the JK gene further revealed that B.S. and L.P. were homozygous for point mutations at conserved 3′-acceptor (ag → aa) and 5′ donor (gt →tt) splice sites of introns 5 and 7, respectively. Splice site mutations lead to exon skipping and are well known to abolish or reduce normal splicing (see Maquat (34Maquat L.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar) and references therein). Since the Kidd/urea transporter protein is absent from Jknullcells, it is likely that the spliced transcripts are either unstable and not translated, or the corresponding truncated proteins are misrouted. At first, we found that the Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7) transcripts typical of Jknull cells could be translated into polypeptides of 31 and 17 kDa, respectively, as seen by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies in a cell-free transcription-translation coupled system (Fig. 6). Next, we found that when expressed in Xenopus oocytes these truncated proteins did not mediate a facilitated urea transport, in contrast to the full-length wild type Jk+ protein, although all injected cRNAs had a similar stability on a 3 days period, as seen by Northern blot analysis. Further analysis revealed that the plasma membrane fraction from oocytes expressing the functional urea transporter (encoded by the Jk+ cRNA) carried a 46–69-kDa glycoprotein component, which could be deglycosylated into a 36-kDa protein, as expected for the Kidd/urea transporter protein (6Olivés B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Olivés B. Mattei M-G. Huet M. Neau P. Martial S. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15607-15610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the Jk−(Δ6) and Jk−(Δ7) polypeptides were neither detected in total cell lysates nor in the enriched plasma membrane fraction from the oocytes, which could be explained by a rapid intracellular degradation. Indeed, the predicted truncated proteins are most likely misfolded by lack the transmembrane domains 3 and 4, and transmembrane domain 5, including the hydrophilic loop carrying theN-glycosylation site at Asn221, respectively. Therefore, these findings provide a rationale explanation for the lack of Kidd/urea transporter protein and defect in urea transport of Jknull cells. As the Kidd/HUT11 transcript is distributed widely in various organs (16Olivés B. Martial S. Mattei M-G. Matassi G. Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Cartron J-P. Bailly P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is surprising that Jknull individuals who have a urea transport deficiency (35Fro¨hlich O. Macey R.I. Edwards-Moulds J. Gargus J.J. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C778-C783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not suffer a clinical syndrome, except for a reduced capability to concentrate urine (36Sands J.M. Gargus J.J. Fro¨lich O. Gunn R.B. Kokko J.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as was the unexpected finding that donors of the blood group Colton null phenotype, who lack the water channel aquaporin-1, did not produce a severe or lethal phenotype (37Preston G.M. Smith B. Zeidel L.M. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 38Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zijl P.C.M. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1309-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is postulated that mechanisms which compensate or reduplicate the function of the missing protein may exist. This should stimulate more studies of these transporters in red cell membranes and various organs. In addition, further investigations of other Jknull individuals from different ethnic groups (5Moulds J.M. Blood Cell Biochem. 1995; 6: 267-278Crossref Google Scholar), from both physological and fundamental aspects, may provide new information for addressing these issues. We are grateful to Phyllis S. Walker (Irwin Memorial Center, San Francisco, CA) for the help in collecting the B.S. blood sample and to Peter M. T Deen (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) for advice in oocyte methodology."

The mitogenic response of fetal TD I chondrocytes in primary cultures upon stimulation by either FGF 2 or FGF 9 did not significantly differ from controls. Although the levels of FGFR 3 mRNAs in cultured TD chondrocytes were similar to controls, an abundant immunoreactive material was observed at the perinuclear level using an anti-FGFR 3 antibody in TD cells. Transduction signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was assessed by measuring extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity (ERK 1 and ERK 2). Early ERKs activation following FGF 9 supplementation was observed in TD chondrocytes (2 min) as compared with controls (5 min) but no signal was detected in the absence of ligand. By contrast ligand-independent activation of the STAT signaling pathway was demonstrated in cultured TD cells and confirmed by immunodetection of Stat 1 in the nuclei of hypertrophic TD chondrocytes. Moreover, the presence of an increased number of apoptotic chondrocytes in TD fetuses was associated with a higher expression of Bax and the simultaneous decrease of Bcl-2 levels. Taken together, these results indicate that FGFR 3 mutations in TD I fetuses do not hamper chondrocyte proliferation but rather alter their differentiation by triggering premature apoptosis through activation of the STAT signaling pathway.

Based on expansion of the cartilage growth plate inFgfr 3 null mice, FGFR 3 was regarded as a negative regulator of long bone growth during endochondral ossification (10Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A.

Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Subsequent transfection experiments in immortalized cell lines have shown that FGFR 3 mutations trigger constitutive activation of the receptor in a ligand-independent manner (12Webster M. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D. Nat.

Activation of the receptor would result in the recruitment of two different Grb2·Sos adapter complexes leading to activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (4Kanai M. Go¨ke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6621-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but activation of the STAT pathway via the nuclear translocation of Stat 1 has been also demonstrated in chondrocytes of TD II patients (15Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Yet, the mechanisms leading to disorganization of the growth plate cartilage in TD remains unclear and the question of whether TD mutations interfere with chondrocyte proliferation or alter terminal differentiation is still opened. In an attempt to address this issue, chondrocytes isolated from cartilage of TD I fetuses were grown in primary cultures and used for proliferation assays, transduction signaling, and programmed cell death analyses. The normal mitogenic response of TD chondrocytes along with the high figure of apoptotic cells in TD fetuses suggest that FGFR 3 mutations alter differentiation rather than proliferation by inducing premature apoptosis of chondrocytes.DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to elucidate the functional consequences of FGFR 3 mutations on endochondral ossification, primary cultured chondrocytes from control and TD I fetuses and the growth plate of cartilage sections were studied. We first investigated the pattern of FGFR gene expression in cultured fetal chondrocytes. Northern blot and in situ hybridization experiments on normal and TD chondrocytes detected comparable levels of FGFR 3 gene expression. Similar results have been obtained with fetal cartilage sections (23Delezoide A.L. Lasselin-Benoist C. Legeai-Mallet L. Brice P Senée V. Yayon A. Munnich A. Vekemans M. Bonaventure J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 11: 1899-1906Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FGFR 1 was more strongly but equally expressed in both cell types, while no FGFR 2 gene product was detected. These results are consistent with previousin situ hybridization studies which have shown that (i) the mouse Fgfr 3 gene is mainly expressed in the resting and proliferative zones of cartilage (10Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 24Peters K. Ornitz D. Werner S. Williams L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), (ii) Fgfr 1predominates in hypertrophic chondrocytes, and (iii) Fgfr 2is absent from cartilage and expressed in the periosteum and perichondrium only (25Peters K.G. Werner S. Chen G. Williams L.T. Development. 1992; 114: 233-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Orr-Urtreger A. Givol D. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Lonai P. Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We subsequently investigated the proliferative capacities of primary cultured chondrocytes from TD I fetuses carrying the R248C and S249C mutations. Mean TD chondrocyte density at subconfluency did not significantly differ from that of age-matched controls. Similarly, mitogenic responses of control and mutant cells were in the same range, irrespective of the ligand tested. Serum deprivation equally affected the mitogenic response of both control and TD cells. Taken together, our data suggested that FGFR 3 mutations did not alter the proliferative capacities of resting chondrocytes and that the defective growth of the long bones in TD is more likely related to an abnormal cell differentiation than to a lack of chondrocyte proliferation during fetal development. These results are at variance with in vitro studies on hematopoietic BaF3 cells transfected with a mutant FGFR 3 cDNA carrying the R248C mutation. Indeed, the transfected cells failed to respond to mitogenic stimulation by FGF 1, while they actively proliferated in the absence of FGF (13Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These discrepancies might be ascribed to (i) differences between the cell types and/or to (ii) homozygosity for the mutation in transfected cells (while heterozygous mutations are present in TD chondrocytes).In normal chondrocytes as in transfected cells, FGF-mediated FGFR activation induced signal transduction and triggered stimulation of the MAPK pathway (3Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Kanai M. Go¨ke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J.

At variance with the transient MAPK activation by EGF, FGF 9 stimulation resulted in a sustained MAPK activation, suggesting that differentiation rather than proliferation is involved (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Studying the possible constitutive activation of the receptor in TD chondrocytes indicated that FGF 9 supplementation produced a faster phosphorylation of MAPK/ERKs in mutant cells than in controls. However, no stimulation was detected in the absence of ligand as observed in PC12 cells transfected with a chimeric mutant receptor carrying the G375C achondroplasia mutation (28Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our inability to detect ERK phosphorylation in the absence of FGF should be ascribed to (i) the low receptor number, (ii) the low kinase activity of FGFR 3 in primary cultured chondrocytes, and/or (iii) the ability of FGFR 3 to heterodimerize with FGFR 1. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that the MAPK pathway is not the only FGFR signaling pathway. A highly controlled balance between the MAPK and STAT pathways has been recently demonstrated in growth factor-stimulated cells (29Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The observation of a Stat 1 activation by the recurrent K650E FGFR 3 mutation in TD II gives support to the view that this pathway might also play a key role in growth retardation (15Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, we have observed a significant ligand-independent Stat 1 phosphorylation in cultured TD I chondrocytes and a Stat 1 nuclear staining in hypertrophic chondrocytes of TD I cartilage growth plate while a cytoplasmic staining only occurred in control cartilage cells.Although FGFRs transfected cells have shown immunostaining patterns consistent with a plasma membrane localization of receptors (12Webster M. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30Johnston C.L. Cox H.C. Gomm J.J. Coombes R.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, nuclear localization of FGFR 1 in FGF 2-stimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and accumulation of a truncated FGFR 3 form in the nucleus of breast epithelial cells have been demonstrated (30Johnston C.L.

Biol. 1996; 134: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, our detection of a perinuclear staining in cultured TD I chondrocytes with anti-FGFR 3 antibodies is not totally unexpected and seems consistent with the perinuclear localization of FGFR 3 in the cartilage growth plate of TD patients (23Delezoide A.L. Lasselin-Benoist C. Legeai-Mallet L. Brice P Senée V. Yayon A. Munnich A. Vekemans M. Bonaventure J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 11: 1899-1906Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If one hypothesizes that ligand-independent FGFR 3 homodimerization in TD cells mimics the ligand stimulation occurring in 3T3 cells, it is conceivable that FGFR 3 mutations triggered the translocation of the receptor from the cell surface to the juxtanuclear region (32Prudovsky I.

Indeed, the co-localization of anti-FGFR 3 and anti-nucleoporin antibodies in the perinuclear compartment of TD chondrocytes gives support to this assertion and tends to exclude accumulation of the mutant receptor in the lysosome/endosome system for degradation.The growth of tubular bones normally involves chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation into hypertrophic cells followed by replacement of cartilage by bone tissue. Indeed, terminally differentiating hypertrophic chondrocytes are known to undergo cell death through apoptosis (35Roach H.I. Erenpreisa J. Aigner T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Gibson G. Lin D-L. Roque M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The reduced length growth of long bones in TD fetuses could result from defective chondrocyte proliferation, premature terminal differentiation, or both. Our observation that chondrocytes from TD fetuses proliferated normally suggests that defective terminal differentiation of chondrocytes is involved. In keeping with this, a marked reduction in the proportion of hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing collagen type X, a specific marker of terminal differentiation, has been observed in the growth plate of TD I patients (23Delezoide A.L. Lasselin-Benoist C. Legeai-Mallet L. Brice P Senée V. Yayon A. Munnich A. Vekemans M. Bonaventure J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 11: 1899-1906Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and chondrocytes expressing PCNA were found in the hypertrophic zone of TD cartilage. Interestingly, activation of the STAT signaling pathway in EGF-treated cancer cell lines has been proved to induce apoptosis (29Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Hence, the Stat 1 activation in TD I hypertrophic chondrocytes along with the occurrence of apoptotic cells (1–2%) and the reduced Bcl-2/Bax ratio in TD I chondrocytes strongly suggest that apoptosis is involved in defective endochondral ossification. Indeed, programmed cell death of hypertrophic cells in normal mouse cartilage has been recently shown to be controlled by balanced levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, two members of a survival gene family with opposite effects (37Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The decrease in Bcl-2 levels are expected to promote cell death, possibly through Bax homodimerization (38Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Alternatively, stimulated expression of caspases (the ICE family of proteases, Ref. 39Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) through Stat 1 activation could also participate to the apoptotic pathway (15Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N.

Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In any case, increased chondrocyte apoptosis would result in reduced bone elongation. The previous demonstration that overexpression of a dominant negative mouse FGFR 1 mutation suppressed apoptosis (41Chow R.L. Roux G.D. Roghani M. Palmer M.A. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D.A. Lang R.A.

In the presence of soluble or cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) binding to FGFRs induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues thus triggering cell proliferation or differentiation through the Ras-Raf-dependent and phospholipase Cγ-dependent signal transduction pathways involving MAPK stimulation (2Spivak-Kroizman T.

Based on expansion of the cartilage growth plate inFgfr 3 null mice, FGFR 3 was regarded as a negative regulator of long bone growth during endochondral ossification (10Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar,11Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Subsequent transfection experiments in immortalized cell lines have shown that FGFR 3 mutations trigger constitutive activation of the receptor in a ligand-independent manner (12Webster M. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D. Nat.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4081-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor would result in the recruitment of two different Grb2·Sos adapter complexes leading to activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (4Kanai M. Go¨ke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6621-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but activation of the STAT pathway via the nuclear translocation of Stat 1 has been also demonstrated in chondrocytes of TD II patients (15Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Yet, the mechanisms leading to disorganization of the growth plate cartilage in TD remains unclear and the question of whether TD mutations interfere with chondrocyte proliferation or alter terminal differentiation is still opened. In an attempt to address this issue, chondrocytes isolated from cartilage of TD I fetuses were grown in primary cultures and used for proliferation assays, transduction signaling, and programmed cell death analyses. The normal mitogenic response of TD chondrocytes along with the high figure of apoptotic cells in TD fetuses suggest that FGFR 3 mutations alter differentiation rather than proliferation by inducing premature apoptosis of chondrocytes. DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to elucidate the functional consequences of FGFR 3 mutations on endochondral ossification, primary cultured chondrocytes from control and TD I fetuses and the growth plate of cartilage sections were studied. We first investigated the pattern of FGFR gene expression in cultured fetal chondrocytes. Northern blot and in situ hybridization experiments on normal and TD chondrocytes detected comparable levels of FGFR 3 gene expression. Similar results have been obtained with fetal cartilage sections (23Delezoide A.L. Lasselin-Benoist C. Legeai-Mallet L. Brice P Senée V. Yayon A. Munnich A. Vekemans M. Bonaventure J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 11: 1899-1906Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FGFR 1 was more strongly but equally expressed in both cell types, while no FGFR 2 gene product was detected. These results are consistent with previousin situ hybridization studies which have shown that (i) the mouse Fgfr 3 gene is mainly expressed in the resting and proliferative zones of cartilage (10Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 24Peters K. Ornitz D. Werner S. Williams L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), (ii) Fgfr 1predominates in hypertrophic chondrocytes, and (iii) Fgfr 2is absent from cartilage and expressed in the periosteum and perichondrium only (25Peters K.G. Werner S. Chen G. Williams L.T. Development. 1992; 114: 233-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Orr-Urtreger A. Givol D. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Lonai P. Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We subsequently investigated the proliferative capacities of primary cultured chondrocytes from TD I fetuses carrying the R248C and S249C mutations. Mean TD chondrocyte density at subconfluency did not significantly differ from that of age-matched controls. Similarly, mitogenic responses of control and mutant cells were in the same range, irrespective of the ligand tested. Serum deprivation equally affected the mitogenic response of both control and TD cells. Taken together, our data suggested that FGFR 3 mutations did not alter the proliferative capacities of resting chondrocytes and that the defective growth of the long bones in TD is more likely related to an abnormal cell differentiation than to a lack of chondrocyte proliferation during fetal development. These results are at variance with in vitro studies on hematopoietic BaF3 cells transfected with a mutant FGFR 3 cDNA carrying the R248C mutation. Indeed, the transfected cells failed to respond to mitogenic stimulation by FGF 1, while they actively proliferated in the absence of FGF (13Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These discrepancies might be ascribed to (i) differences between the cell types and/or to (ii) homozygosity for the mutation in transfected cells (while heterozygous mutations are present in TD chondrocytes).In normal chondrocytes as in transfected cells, FGF-mediated FGFR activation induced signal transduction and triggered stimulation of the MAPK pathway (3Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Kanai M. Go¨ke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J.

Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently investigated the proliferative capacities of primary cultured chondrocytes from TD I fetuses carrying the R248C and S249C mutations. Mean TD chondrocyte density at subconfluency did not significantly differ from that of age-matched controls. Similarly, mitogenic responses of control and mutant cells were in the same range, irrespective of the ligand tested. Serum deprivation equally affected the mitogenic response of both control and TD cells. Taken together, our data suggested that FGFR 3 mutations did not alter the proliferative capacities of resting chondrocytes and that the defective growth of the long bones in TD is more likely related to an abnormal cell differentiation than to a lack of chondrocyte proliferation during fetal development. These results are at variance with in vitro studies on hematopoietic BaF3 cells transfected with a mutant FGFR 3 cDNA carrying the R248C mutation. Indeed, the transfected cells failed to respond to mitogenic stimulation by FGF 1, while they actively proliferated in the absence of FGF (13Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These discrepancies might be ascribed to (i) differences between the cell types and/or to (ii) homozygosity for the mutation in transfected cells (while heterozygous mutations are present in TD chondrocytes). In normal chondrocytes as in transfected cells, FGF-mediated FGFR activation induced signal transduction and triggered stimulation of the MAPK pathway (3Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Kanai M. Go¨ke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6621-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At variance with the transient MAPK activation by EGF, FGF 9 stimulation resulted in a sustained MAPK activation, suggesting that differentiation rather than proliferation is involved (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Studying the possible constitutive activation of the receptor in TD chondrocytes indicated that FGF 9 supplementation produced a faster phosphorylation of MAPK/ERKs in mutant cells than in controls. However, no stimulation was detected in the absence of ligand as observed in PC12 cells transfected with a chimeric mutant receptor carrying the G375C achondroplasia mutation (28Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our inability to detect ERK phosphorylation in the absence of FGF should be ascribed to (i) the low receptor number, (ii) the low kinase activity of FGFR 3 in primary cultured chondrocytes, and/or (iii) the ability of FGFR 3 to heterodimerize with FGFR 1. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that the MAPK pathway is not the only FGFR signaling pathway. A highly controlled balance between the MAPK and STAT pathways has been recently demonstrated in growth factor-stimulated cells (29Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The observation of a Stat 1 activation by the recurrent K650E FGFR 3 mutation in TD II gives support to the view that this pathway might also play a key role in growth retardation (15Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, we have observed a significant ligand-independent Stat 1 phosphorylation in cultured TD I chondrocytes and a Stat 1 nuclear staining in hypertrophic chondrocytes of TD I cartilage growth plate while a cytoplasmic staining only occurred in control cartilage cells. Although FGFRs transfected cells have shown immunostaining patterns consistent with a plasma membrane localization of receptors (12Webster M. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30Johnston C.L. Cox H.C. Gomm J.J. Coombes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a perinuclear localization of FGFR 1 in FGF 2-stimulated ovine epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes or FGF 1-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells has been also reported (31Kilkenny D.M. Hill D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5078-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, nuclear localization of FGFR 1 in FGF 2-stimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and accumulation of a truncated FGFR 3 form in the nucleus of breast epithelial cells have been demonstrated (30Johnston C.L. Cox H.C. Gomm J.J. Coombes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Maher P.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, our detection of a perinuclear staining in cultured TD I chondrocytes with anti-FGFR 3 antibodies is not totally unexpected and seems consistent with the perinuclear localization of FGFR 3 in the cartilage growth plate of TD patients (23Delezoide A.L. Lasselin-Benoist C. Legeai-Mallet L. Brice P Senée V. Yayon A. Munnich A. Vekemans M. Bonaventure J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 11: 1899-1906Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If one hypothesizes that ligand-independent FGFR 3 homodimerization in TD cells mimics the ligand stimulation occurring in 3T3 cells, it is conceivable that FGFR 3 mutations triggered the translocation of the receptor from the cell surface to the juxtanuclear region (32Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mason I.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Indeed, the co-localization of anti-FGFR 3 and anti-nucleoporin antibodies in the perinuclear compartment of TD chondrocytes gives support to this assertion and tends to exclude accumulation of the mutant receptor in the lysosome/endosome system for degradation. The growth of tubular bones normally involves chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation into hypertrophic cells followed by replacement of cartilage by bone tissue. Indeed, terminally differentiating hypertrophic chondrocytes are known to undergo cell death through apoptosis (35Roach H.I. Erenpreisa J. Aigner T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Gibson G. Lin D-L. Roque M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The reduced length growth of long bones in TD fetuses could result from defective chondrocyte proliferation, premature terminal differentiation, or both. Our observation that chondrocytes from TD fetuses proliferated normally suggests that defective terminal differentiation of chondrocytes is involved. In keeping with this, a marked reduction in the proportion of hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing collagen type X, a specific marker of terminal differentiation, has been observed in the growth plate of TD I patients (23Delezoide A.L. Lasselin-Benoist C. Legeai-Mallet L. Brice P Senée V. Yayon A. Munnich A. Vekemans M. Bonaventure J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 11: 1899-1906Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and chondrocytes expressing PCNA were found in the hypertrophic zone of TD cartilage. Interestingly, activation of the STAT signaling pathway in EGF-treated cancer cell lines has been proved to induce apoptosis (29Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Hence, the Stat 1 activation in TD I hypertrophic chondrocytes along with the occurrence of apoptotic cells (1–2%) and the reduced Bcl-2/Bax ratio in TD I chondrocytes strongly suggest that apoptosis is involved in defective endochondral ossification. Indeed, programmed cell death of hypertrophic cells in normal mouse cartilage has been recently shown to be controlled by balanced levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, two members of a survival gene family with opposite effects (37Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The decrease in Bcl-2 levels are expected to promote cell death, possibly through Bax homodimerization (38Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Alternatively, stimulated expression of caspases (the ICE family of proteases, Ref. 39Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) through Stat 1 activation could also participate to the apoptotic pathway (15Su W-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W. Fu X-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar,40Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In any case, increased chondrocyte apoptosis would result in reduced bone elongation. The previous demonstration that overexpression of a dominant negative mouse FGFR 1 mutation suppressed apoptosis (41Chow R.L. Roux G.D. Roghani M. Palmer M.A. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D.A. Lang R.A. Development. 1995; 121: 4383-4393PubMed Google Scholar) gives support to the view that FGFR mutations producing a gain of receptor function increase apoptosis. We thank Dr A.

The cDNA clones encode a polypeptide of 738 amino acids, including a signal peptide. The amino acid sequence has a high overall identity with LH1 and LH2, the isoforms characterized earlier. Conserved regions are present in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the isoforms and also in the central part of the molecules. Histidine and asparagine residues, which are conserved in the other isoforms and are known to be required for enzymatic activity, are also conserved in the novel isoform. The gene for LH3 (PLOD3) has been assigned to human chromosome 7q36 and rat chromosome 12. Gene expression of LH3 is highly regulated in adult human tissues. A strong hybridization signal, corresponding to an mRNA 2.75 kilobases in size, is obtained in heart, placenta and pancreas on multiple tissue RNA blots.

Expression of the cDNAin vitro results in the synthesis of a protein that hydroxylates lysyl residues in collagenous sequences in a non-triple helical conformation. Collagen is a group of structural proteins that are found essentially in all tissues. To date, 19 different collagen types have been identified that participate in the assembly of various kinds of polymers in the extracellular matrix (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

Collagens form the structural building blocks of tissues, but it is also clear that they have important regulatory functions. Some collagens form scaffolds that keep cells in place within tissues, connect tissues within an organ, and facilitate attachment and migration of cells. Collagens can also form links between cells and matrices, and some regulate the assembly and properties of the scaffold-forming collagens (5Reichenberger E. Olsen B.R. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 631-638Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that collagen can directly serve as a ligand for receptor tyrosine kinases and, as a consequence of binding to the receptor, induces a cascade of phosphorylation in cells (6Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 7Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of collagens includes several posttranslational modifications, one of which is hydroxylation of lysyl residues. Hydroxylysine occurs in the Y position of the repeatingX-Y-Gly triplets within the helical region of the collagen molecule. Hydroxylysine also occurs in the sequence of nonhelical telopeptide regions of some collagen molecules, when glycine is replaced by either serine or alanine (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 8Barnes M.J. Constable B.J. Morton L.F. Royce P.M. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amount of the hydroxylysyl residues varies considerably between different collagen types. Variation is also found within the same collagen type in different tissues and even within the same tissues in different physiological and pathological states (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

J. 1974; 139: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to collagens, hydroxylysine residues are found in some other proteins, these include C1q complement, acetylcholinesterase, mannose-binding proteins, bovine conglutinin, and anglerfish somatostatin 28. It should be noted, however, that all these proteins, with the exception of somatostatin 28, contain collagenous domains in their structure (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar). Hydroxylysyl residues may be glycosylated to form galactosylhydroxylysyl or glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine residues. This glycosylation is unique to collagenous structures, although the function of the glycosylation is unclear. There is evidence, however, that carbohydrates bound to collagen may play a role in collagen receptor recognition and activation (6Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Hydroxylysine residues have an important function in the formation of covalent cross-links in collagens. Two related pathways exist for cross-link formation in fibrillar collagens, one based on lysine aldehydes and the other on hydroxylysine aldehydes. Hydroxylysine derived cross-links predominate in bone, cartilage, ligament, most tendons, embryonic skin, and most major internal connective tissues of the body (2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagens in a reaction that requires Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar). Two enzymes (lysyl hydroxylase 1, LH1; lysyl hydroxylase 2, LH2) 1The abbreviations used are: LH, lysyl hydroxylase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: LH, lysyl hydroxylase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s). with lysyl hydroxylase activity have been isolated and characterized in human tissues so far (1Kivirikko K.I.

We report here a novel enzyme (lysyl hydroxylase 3, LH3), which is capable of hydroxylating lysyl residues of collagenous peptides. The gene for the enzyme has been localized to human chromosome 7q36, which is distinct from the locations of other lysyl hydroxylases (10Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy L.R. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I.

Genome. 1997; 8: 707-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating that there are at least three different genes for lysyl hydroxylase in vivo. The Blast program was used to find homologies between human LH1, LH2, and expressed sequence tags. Several sequences having homologies to lysyl hydroxylases were found in the search: AA250735, AA410941, AA010762, AA040561, AA353120,AA411291, AA313622, AA340606, AA077166, and W04357. Oligonucleotides were synthesized from the sequences. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, CLONTECH) and human kidney mRNA (CLONTECH) was used to prepare oligo(dT)-primed cDNA (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). PCR amplifications of DNA templates were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold™, Perkin-Elmer) in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 0.2 mm dNTPs. The following oligonucleotide pair and conditions were used in the amplification of the clone corresponding to the middle part of the novel cDNA: M1 (5′-GGGTGATGTGGCTCGAACAG-3′ fromAA250735) and M15 (5′-CCTTCCTCGGGGAGGAGATCA-3′ from AA340606), 95 °C, 15 min; 95 °C, 40 s; 59 °C, 40 s; 72 °C, 2 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the novel cDNA were obtained using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The Marathon cDNA adaptor (containing the oligonucleotides AP1 or AP2) was ligated to the blunt-ended double-stranded cDNA prepared from oligo(dT)-primed human kidney poly(A) RNA. For cloning the 5′ end of the molecule the following oligonucleotide pairs were used in amplification: M5 (5′-CGGATACGCACACACGGTTCCGA-3′) and AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), 95 °C, 15 min; 95 °C, 40 s; 63 °C, 40 s; 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min; M19 (5′-CAGTGATCACCAGCAGCTTC-3′) and AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) and M18 (5′-CCACCAACTGTTCGAGCCA-3′) paired with AP2, 95 °C, 15 min; 95 °C, 40 s; 55 °C, 40 s; 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min. For cloning the 3′ end of the molecule the following oligonucleotide pairs were used: M20 (5′-CTGCTGCGGACGTATGTGGGC-3′) and AP1, M20 and AP2, 95 °C, 15 min; 95 °C, 40 s; 65 °C, 40 s; 72 °C, 1.5 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min. All fragments were subcloned into pUC18-plasmid (SureClone, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid DNA or PCR products were used for sequencing. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen). PCR products were extracted from the agarose gel by a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing system using the ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator, dRhodamine terminator, or Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits (Perkin-Elmer) or Thermo Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing was carried out using an Abi Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). A human multiple Northern blot containing poly(A) RNA from different tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized for 1 h in Express Hyb solution (CLONTECH) at 42 °C using radioactively labeled M1-M15 PCR product as a probe. The blot was washed in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 40 min and then in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. Expression of the novel cDNA was carried out by baculovirus transfer vector in the BAC-TO-BAC™ expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was used to generate a cDNA construct for the novel molecule using human kidney cDNA as a template in the amplification. The construct covered the nucleotides from 214 to 2447 of the cDNA. The nucleotides of the construct were confirmed by sequencing. Insect cells were harvested 48 or 72 h after infection as described previously (9Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K.

Lysyl hydroxylase activity was assayed in supernatants of transfected insect cell extracts. The activity was measured by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (9Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J.

Human kidney mRNA was used as a starting material for the reverse transcriptase reaction to prepare an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA. The oligonucleotides M1 and M15 (Fig. 1) were used to synthesize the first cDNA clone, which was 1.9 kb in size. The M1-M15 clone was sequenced, and the sequence was used to develop primers (M5, M18, M19, and M20) for 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA (Fig. 1) was 2745 base pairs long and contained an open reading frame from nucleotide 217 to nucleotide 2433. The 5′-noncoding region of the clone was 216 base pairs in length and the 3′-noncoding region 312 base pairs in size. The 3′ end of the sequence contained a putative poly(A) signal, AATAAA, which precedes multiple A nucleotides ending the sequence.Figure 1Nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding a novel human lysyl hydroxylase (LH3).

The data indicate that the novel molecule, which is now called LH3, belongs to a family of lysyl hydroxylases. The PLOD3 gene was first assigned to human chromosome 7 by Southern blot analysis of 13 human X rodent hybrid clones (Ref. 15Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Riviére M. Hajnal A. Kiess M. Scharm B. Schäfer R. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and references therein), using a cloned cDNA (M1-M15 clone, Fig. 1). In SacI-digested human DNA, the probe detected two fragments, at 5.7 and 4.3 kb. These two fragments could be followed unambiguously in the hybrids. They segregated together and with human chromosome 7 (no discordant clone for chromosome 7, and at least four discordant clones for each of the other chromosomes) (data not shown). To further localize the gene, the regional position of the PLOD3 gene was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, as described elsewhere (16Pinkel D. Landegent J. Collins C. Fuscoe J. Segraves R. Lucas J. Gray J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9138-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 17Stephanova E. Tissir F. Dusetti N. Iovanna J. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 72: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), using the same probe. Double spots (two labeled sister chromatids) formed by the probe were found only on chromosome 7. The fluorescent signals were clearly located at the end of the 7q arm, corresponding to the terminal band, i.e. 7q36 (Fig.3). The results indicate that thePLOD3 gene is not linked to other lysyl hydroxylases, because the gene for LH1 (PLOD1) has been localized to 1p36.2 (10Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy L.R. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Van Roy N. Laureys G. Versteeg R. Opdenakker G. Spelman F. Genomics. 1993; 17: 71-78Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and LH2 (PLOD2) to 3q23–24 (12Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Riviére M. Vanvooren P. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 707-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The homologous rat gene (Plod3) was also localized using a panel of 13 somatic cell hybrids segregating rat chromosomes (15Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Riviére M. Hajnal A. Kiess M. Scharm B. Schäfer R. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The human probe detected two fragments in BamHI-digested rat DNA (15.0 and 9.0 kb). These fragments could easily be distinguished from the three homologous mouse fragments (sizes <5.0 kb). They segregated together and with rat chromosome 12 (no discordant clone for chromosome 12 and at least three discordant clones for each of the other chromosomes) (data not shown). The human probe did not generate specific signals on rat chromosomes, preventing the regional localization of the rat gene. Human chromosome 7 and rat chromosome 12 are known to be partially homologous: they share seven genes, thus showing conserved synteny (18Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Klinga-Levan K. Ståhl F. Levan G. Folia Biol. ( Paha ). 1996; 42: 175-226PubMed Google Scholar, 19RATMAP (1997) The Rat Genome Data Base, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. World Wide Web.

Interestingly, six of these genes (tropoelastin, erythropoietin, glucuronidase β, mucin 3, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) map to a more proximal region than 7q36, i.e.between 7cen and 7q22 (the regional localization of the seventh gene, epimorphin, is not known). Thus it appears that PLOD3defines a new region of homology between rat chromosome 12 and human chromosome 7, located near the telomeric region of 7q. The intermediate region (7q31.1 to 7q35) contains genes whose rat homologs map on chromosomes others than chromosome 12 (most are on rat chromosome 4) (18Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Klinga-Levan K. Ståhl F. Levan G. Folia Biol. ( Paha ). 1996; 42: 175-226PubMed Google Scholar, 19RATMAP (1997) The Rat Genome Data Base, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. World Wide Web.

URL:http://gdbwww.gdb.org (December 1997)Google Scholar). These observations provide a new and clear example of a synteny group split into distinct conserved segments disrupted by a region of homology to a different chromosome (see, for instance, Ref.21Watkins-Chow D.E. Buckwalter M.S. Newhouse M.M. Lossie A.C. Brinkmeier M.L. Camper S.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Expression of LH3 in various human tissues was determined by multiple tissue Northern blot (Fig. 4), where the probe for LH3 hybridized with an mRNA 2.75 kb in size. A strong hybridization signal was obtained in heart, placenta, and pancreas, whereas the signal was much fainter in brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. The data furthermore indicate that the expression is highly regulated. Comparison of the size of the LH3 mRNA with that of LH1 and LH2 (9Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K.

Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) indicates that the LH3 mRNA is smaller than the mRNA for LH1 (3.2 kb) or LH2 (4.2 kb). Comparison of expression levels of lysyl hydroxylases in different human tissues indicates that heart, placenta, and pancreas are the tissues that have high expression levels for lysyl hydroxylase 2 (9Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and 3. The expression of LH1 differs from the others, the constitutive expression of the gene in variety of tissues agrees with the housekeeping gene-like structure of its 5′-flanking region (22Heikkinen J. Hautala T. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1994; 24: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Yeowell H.N. Ha V. Clark L.C. Marshall M.K. Pinnell S.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 382-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the novel human lysyl hydroxylase is compared with human LH1 and human LH2 (Fig. 1). The length of the translated product of LH3 is 738 amino acids, which is one amino acid longer than the length of LH2. The overall identity in amino acid sequences between LH3 and LH1 or between LH3 and LH2 was 59%. The identity between all lysyl hydroxylases is 47%. The similarity values between the isoforms were 83 and 85%, respectively. Over 80% identity in amino acid sequences (more than 10 amino acids) between all three lysyl hydroxylases was found in the sequence covering the amino acids 160–171, 217–233, 254–264, 420–445, 448–460, 559–570, 577–588, 602–616, and 727–738 of lysyl hydroxylase 3. The data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule is highly conserved in all three lysyl hydroxylases, but in addition, there are also regions in the middle part of the molecules, which are identical in all of them. Less identity is seen in the region of amino acids 271–356 (32% identity between all isoforms). A search for conserved residues within the sequences of 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases and a related dioxygenase, isopenicillin N synthase, suggested that two histidine-containing motifs in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule may function as ferrous binding ligands (24Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Roach P.L. Clifton I.J. Fülo¨p V. Harlos K. Barton G.J. Hadju J. Andersson I. Schofield C.J. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of LH1 (26Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) confirms the importance of the histidines for the function of the enzyme. It is interesting to find that these histidines are conserved in all lysyl hydroxylases, His-667, His-668, His-711, His-717, His-719, in the sequence of LH3. Furthermore, two aspartate residues, Asp-669 and Asp-685, causing dramatic reduction in enzyme activity in the LH1 mutational analysis (26Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), are also conserved in all three hydroxylases. Seven out of eight cysteine residues, conserved between LH1 and LH2, are also conserved in the sequence of LH3. Glycosylation of asparagine residues is probably required for the enzymatic activity of LH1 and LH2 (9Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol.

J. 1988; 253: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acids between three hydroxylases indicate that there is no potential attachment site for asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, which is conserved in all three enzymes. Mutation analysis of LH1 indicated that Asn-209 and Asn-697 are required for LH1 activity (26Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); these amino acids have been changed to serine and aspartate residues, respectively, in the novel lysyl hydroxylase. Asn-63 may function as an attachment site for mannose-rich oligosaccharides in LH2 and LH3; this is not, however, a potential glycosylation site for LH1. Characterization of a novel isoform for lysyl hydroxylase (LH3) indicates that there are at least three genes for lysyl hydroxylase activity in cells. The gene for the LH3 isoform (PLOD3) is located on human chromosome 7 (7q36) and on rat chromosome 12. The isoform has a high identity with the lysyl hydroxylases characterized earlier (9Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol.

The expression patterns of LH2 and LH3 resemble each other but differ from that of LH1. The discovery of multiple isoforms for lysyl hydroxylase is significant because they provide tools for further investigation of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI, a disease associated with gene defects in LH1 (28Hyland J.

Several questions remain unanswered, such as: why hydroxylation of collagenous lysyl residues is normal in cartilage of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI patients, although it is markedly reduced in skin (34Pinnell S.R.

Myllylä, unpublished data.; and why removal of the most conserved portion of LH1 does not totally abolish the enzyme activity within cells (28Hyland J. Ala-Kokko L. Royce P. Steinmann B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The comparison of these isoforms in their substrate specificity, distribution in different tissues/cells, activity at different developmental stages, and under conditions in which the genes have been mutated or knocked out will provide more information about the function of the different isoforms in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035588379,"Organic amine-based buffer compounds such as HEPES (Good's buffers) are commonly applied in experimental systems, including those where the biological effects of peroxynitrite are studied. In such studies 3-morpholinosydnonimineN-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1), a compound that simultaneously releases nitric oxide (ċNO) and superoxide (O2˙¯), is often used as a source for peroxynitrite. Whereas in mere phosphate buffer H2O2 formation from 1.5 mmSIN-1 was low (~15 μm), incubation of SIN-1 with Good's buffer compounds resulted in continuous H2O2 formation. After 2 h of incubation of 1.5 mm SIN-1 with 20 mm HEPES about 190 μm H2O2 were formed. The same amount of H2O2 could be achieved from 1.5 mm SIN-1 by action of superoxide dismutase in the absence of HEPES. The increased H2O2 level, however, could not be related to a superoxide dismutase or to a NO scavenger activity of HEPES. On the other hand, SIN-1-mediated oxidation of both dihydrorhodamine 123 and deoxyribose as well as peroxynitrite-dependent nitration ofp-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were strongly inhibited by 20 mm HEPES. Furthermore, the peroxynitrite scavenger tryptophan significantly reduced H2O2 formation from SIN-1-HEPES interactions. These observations suggest that peroxynitrite is the initiator for the enhanced formation of H2O2. Likewise, authentic peroxynitrite (1 mm) also induced the formation of both O2˙¯ and H2O2 upon addition to HEPES (400 mm)-containing solutions in a pH (4.5–7.5)-dependent manner. In accordance with previous reports it was found that at pH ≥5 oxygen is released in the decay of peroxynitrite. As a consequence, peroxynitrite(1 mm)-induced H2O2 formation (~80 μm at pH 7.5) also occurred under hypoxic conditions. In the presence of bicarbonate/carbon dioxide (20 mm/5%) the production of H2O2 from the reaction of HEPES with peroxynitrite was even further stimulated. Addition of SIN-1 or authentic peroxynitrite to solutions of Good's buffers resulted in the formation of piperazine-derived radical cations as detected by ESR spectroscopy. These findings suggest a mechanism for H2O2 formation in which peroxynitrite (or any strong oxidant derived from it) initially oxidizes the tertiary amine buffer compounds in a one-electron step. Subsequent deprotonation and reaction of the intermediate α-amino alkyl radicals with molecular oxygen leads to the formation of O2˙¯ from which H2O2 is produced by dismutation. Hence, HEPES and similar organic buffers should be avoided in studies of oxidative compounds. Furthermore, this mechanism of H2O2formation must be regarded to be a rather general one for biological systems where sufficiently strong oxidants may interact with various biologically relevant amino-type molecules, such as ATP, creatine, or nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2037403678,"This study examined the signal transduction pathways involved in thrombin-induced neuroprotection and compares these results with those of a similar study of thrombin-induced neuronal death. In thrombin-induced protection of astrocytes from hypoglycemia, pretreatment of astrocytes with tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, cytochalasin D, or exoenzyme C3, a potent inhibitor of the small GTPase RhoA, attenuated thrombin-induced protection. These same inhibitors were previously shown to block thrombin-induced cell death, implying a similarity in the cell death and cell-protective pathways. Biochemical assays determined that thrombin increased available RhoA activity, although more slowly and to a lesser extent than occurs in thrombin-induced cell death. A clear difference in these pathways was revealed when a time course study of thrombin-induced cell death indicated that unlike thrombin-induced protection, cells must be exposed to thrombin for >16 h to irreversibly enter the cell death pathway. Addition of lower doses of thrombin every 24 h also induced cell death. These studies indicate that exposure of cells to micromolar concentrations of thrombin alone does not induce cell death, but the continued exposure to thrombin is required. Thus the cell death and protective pathways may share initial signaling proteins, but differences in the amplitude as well as the duration of the signal may result in different final pathways.

Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease immediately produced at sites of vascular injury. Although well known for its role in hemostasis and thrombosis, thrombin also induces a wide range of cellular inflammatory and proliferative responses associated with both normal and disease processes (1Shuman M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Coughlin S.R. Vu T. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Most recently, thrombin was shown to induce two responses that indicate an important role for thrombin in central nervous system disease and injury. Moderate concentrations of thrombin protected hippocampal neurons and astrocytes from a variety of cellular insults, including hypoglycemia, growth supplement deprivation, oxidative stress, and β-amyloid toxicity (3Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pike C.J. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), while high concentrations of thrombin induced apoptosis in these same cells (3Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smith-Swintosky V.L. Zimmer S. Fenton J.W., II Mattson M.P. J.

Both responses were shown to be due to activation of the PAR-1 receptor (thrombin receptor) (3Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Donovan F.M. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5316-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but many questions remain concerning the mechanisms underlying these responses. How does thrombin stimulate cells to survive toxic insults? What are the pathways underlying this response, and as these pathways appear to be similar to pathways recently reported to be involved in the apoptosis response, how do cells distinguish between these signals? The central nervous system is exposed to thrombin upon breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. This occurs in acute trauma such as head injury or stroke and may also occur in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and cerebral-vascular dementia (7Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Kondo H. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 146: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8McGeer P.L. Klegeris A. Walker D.G. Yasuhara O. McGeer E.G. Tohoku J. Exp.

Studies on the effects of thrombin on neuronal cells in culture have revealed a variety of responses to thrombin. Thrombin induces process retraction in neuroblastoma cells (11Gurwitz D.

Brain Res. 1993; 600: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In one study, thrombin was directly infused into the rat caudate nucleus. This resulted in increased reactive gliosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, proliferation of mesenchymal cells, and induction of angiogenesis, effects that resemble inflammation, reactive gliosis, and scar formation that occurs following injury to the central nervous system (20Nishino A. Suzuki M. Ohtani H. Motohashi O. Umezawa K. Nagura H. Yoshimoto T. J. Neurotrauma. 1993; 10: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These studies and the reports of thrombin-induced protection and apoptosis indicate the possible impact of thrombin exposure to central nervous system cells. Apoptosis is a common feature of both acute central nervous system injury and chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (21Bredesen D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 22Chopp M. Chan P.H. Hsu C.Y. Cheung M.E. Jacobs T.P.

It is of general interest to understand any mechanism that allows neuronal cells to survive toxic insults; thus a more clear understanding of how thrombin induces the protective and apoptotic responses is warranted. Cellular responses induced by thrombin are due, in most cases, to activation of the PAR-1 receptor (24Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar, 25Rasmussen U.B. Vouret-Craviari V. Jallat S. Schlesinger Y. Pages G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The PAR-1 receptor is a proteolytically activated, seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor that has been linked to a variety of cellular pathways, including hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, calcium mobilization, and activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, tyrosine kinases, and monomeric G-proteins (for review, see Ref. 26Grand R.J.

The PAR-1 receptor mRNA is also widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (27Niclou, S., Suidan, H., Brown-Luedi, M., and Monard, D. (1994)Cell. Mol. Biol.(Oxford) 40, p. 421–428Google Scholar, 28Soifer S.J. Peters K.G. O'Keefe J. Coughlin S.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 60-69PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weinstein J.R. Gold S.J. Cunningham D.D. Gall C.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2906-2919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we questioned how thrombin induces both apoptosis and protection in astrocytes. One possibility is that different signal transduction pathways are involved in each response. Another possibility is that the pathways are similar, but that the different concentrations of thrombin required to induce each response result in a different level of stimulation of this pathway, so that the correct signal is ultimately generated. A third possibility is that the different culture conditions of the cells may also account for the different responses. Astrocytes experiencing hypoglycemia or another stress may express a different background of downstream effector proteins so that the connection to the protective pathway is made, rather the apoptosis pathway. We employed pharmacological and biochemical methods to help determine second messenger pathways involved in thrombin-induced protection of astrocytes from hypoglycemia and contrasted these results with a similar study of thrombin-induced apoptosis. Highly purified, high specific activity, human α-thrombin was purchased from Calbiochem and from Sigma. Because of variation in specific activity between thrombin supplies, all thrombin treatments were carried out using units/ml with 200 units/ml roughly equivalent to 1 μm thrombin. Herbimycin A, cytochalasin D, genistein, pertussis toxin, HA 1004, H-7, wortmannin, and exoenzyme C3 were purchased from Calbiochem. Leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Primary cultures of type 1 astrocytes were prepared from the brains of 1- to 2-day-old rat pups (Sprague-Dawley) using a modification of previously described procedures (40McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Briefly, the frontoparietal cortex from eight pups was isolated, stripped of meninges, and dissociated by a combination of trypsin digestion and mechanical trituration. A single cell suspension was prepared from this dissociated tissue by passage though Nitex nylon screens. The cells were plated into 75-cm2 plastic flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 7.5 mm sodium bicarbonate, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Once the cultures reached confluence (approximately 10–12 days), the flasks were shaken at 260 rpm for 24 h at 37 °C to remove nonadherent cells. The remaining type 1 astrocytes were trypsinized and reseeded into 75-cm2 flasks. Once these cells had reached confluence they were replated for experiments as detailed below. The purity of the cultures was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining with a monoclonal antibody to the type 1 astroglial specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein; >95% of the cells were immunoreactive for this marker. Astrocytes were removed from flasks by trypsinization and plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. After growth to 70–80% confluence (2–3 days after plating), the cells were used in experiments. In all experiments cells were rinsed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in this medium for 16–18 h prior to experimental treatments. Cells were then differentiated for 24 h with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP was present in all media throughout the experiments. For experiments measuring the effect of pharmacological agents on thrombin-induced protection, astrocytes were serum-starved, differentiated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1.5 mm) for 24 h, and then pretreated for 3 h with each agent. For experiments involving pertussis toxin, cells were pretreated for 24 h. Cells were then washed three times and incubated in medium containing 0.5 mm glucose, and each agent in the presence or absence of 0.2 unit/ml (1 nm) thrombin. Cell viability was determined 72 h later. In all experiments, cell viability was calculated relative to its control wells, which were maintained in either low glucose medium alone or low glucose medium containing the pharmacological agent throughout the experiment. In experiments examining the time course of thrombin-induced cell death, cells were serum-starved overnight, washed, then incubated in serum-free medium plus bovine serum albumin (0.1%), in the presence or absence of 200 units/ml thrombin. After the indicated duration of exposure, both control and thrombin-treated wells were washed three times with serum-free medium, then incubated in this medium for the remainder of the experiment. In experiments examining whether lower doses of thrombin could induce cell death, cells were serum-starved overnight, washed, then incubated in serum-free medium plus bovine serum albumin (0.1%), in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of thrombin. Thrombin was then added directly to this medium 24 h from the start of the experiment. Cell viability was measured 72 h following initial exposure to thrombin. In all experiments, cell viability was determined by assaying the medium from each well for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1The abbreviation used is: LDH, low density lipoprotein.activity using a diagnostic kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Released LDH is a stable enzymatic marker that correlates linearly with cell death. To determine total LDH activity, cells from control cultures were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were assayed for LDH activity. This cell-associated LDH activity was then added to the LDH activity released from control cultures, and the total activity was considered to represent 100% cell death. The amount of LDH present in the medium was then calculated as a percentage of the total, which determines the percent cell death in that sample. For clarity, results were then presented as the percent cell viability. In some experiments, SYTO 11 (Molecular Probes) was added to the control and thrombin-treated cultures to monitor viability microscopically. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples. Data were statistically examined by one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparisons using the Fisher procedure. All studies were repeated in at least three independent experiments. Cell fractionation and in vitroribosylation were performed as described previously (41Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 10-cm culture dishes for 3–4 days, serum-starved, and differentiated as described above, then exposed to hypoglycemic conditions in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of thrombin for 0–48 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into ice-cold 20 mmTris/HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μmleupeptin, 0.05 unit/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and homogenized using a tight pestle Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 30 min to separate the cytosolic from the crude membrane fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Ribosylation assays were carried out using 30 μg of protein from each fraction that was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 5 min and then taken up in reaction buffer (90 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 2.6 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA, 10 mm thymidine, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 100 μm GTP, 10 μCi/ml [32P]NAD). Reaction was started by addition of exoenzyme C3 (5 μg/ml) and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were acid-precipitated (10% trichloroacetic acid, w/v), centrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min), and washed with ether. Samples were then subject to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (12.5%) and ribosylated proteins visualized by autoradiography. PAR-1 receptor activation can result in induction of a variety of different second messengers, including hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, calcium mobilization, and activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, tyrosine kinases, and monomeric G-proteins (26Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To identify second messenger pathways involved in thrombin-induced neuroprotection, we tested several pharmacological agents for their ability to block thrombin-induced protection of astrocytes from hypoglycemia. Astrocytes were serum-starved, differentiated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1.5 mm) for 24 h, and then pretreated for 3 h with each agent, except pertussis toxin for which the cells were pretreated for 24 h. Cells were washed three times and incubated in medium containing 0.5 mm glucose, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and each agent in the presence or absence of 0.2 unit/ml (1 nm) thrombin. Cell viability was measured using the LDH assay 72 h following exposure to hypoglycemic conditions. Consistent with the previous study (3Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), untreated hypoglycemic cultures showed 31% viability, whereas hypoglycemic cultures treated with thrombin were protected and showed greater than 75% viability (Fig.1 A). Two broad spectrum serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, HA 1004 and H7, were used to determine the involvement of serine/threonine kinases. H7, at 10 and 100 μm, blocked thrombin-induced protection. HA 1004, at concentrations up to 100 μm, failed to inhibit thrombin-induced protection. The primary difference in the in vitro inhibition profile of these two inhibitors is that H7 is a more potent inhibitor of protein kinase C than is HA 1004, suggesting a possible role for protein kinase C in thrombin-induced protection from hypoglycemia. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, also blocked thrombin-induced protection with both thrombin-treated and -untreated cultures retaining only 38 and 47% viability, respectively. Another broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, did not block thrombin-induced protection; however, genistein treatment alone attenuated hypoglycemic death, making the effect on thrombin signaling difficult to determine (Fig. 1 A). The PAR-1 receptor is a G-protein-linked receptor and has been shown to have pertussis toxin-sensitive responses (42Huang C.L. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Paris S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested the role of the Gi subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins in thrombin-induced protection. Pretreatment of astrocytes with pertussis toxin (0.1 and 1 μg/ml) for 24 h did not significantly decrease thrombin-induced protection (Fig.1 B), indicating this pathway is not pertussis toxin-sensitive. To test the possible involvement of phospholipase D, phospholipase A2, and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, cells were treated with wortmannin at 10 nm and 1 μm. Wortmannin at either concentration did not affect thrombin-induced protection (Fig. 1 B). We tested cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin filament assembly and regulator of the actin cytoskeleton previously shown to block other thrombin activities (44Li R.Y. Ragab A. Gaits F. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. Cell. Mol. Biol. ( Oxford ). 1994; 40: 665-675PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14989-14994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D at 0.5 μg/ml significantly attenuated thrombin-induced protection (Fig. 1 B). This finding suggests that an intact actin cytoskeleton is necessary for thrombin-induced protection. It should be noted that in previous studies using non-neuronal cell types, increases in cyclic AMP level are known to inhibit signaling through the PAR-1 receptor; this does not appear to be the case in neural cell types. In our protection model using astrocytes, and in other reponses to thrombin, including thrombin-induced neurite retraction in neuroblasoma cells (11Gurwitz D. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3440-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Gurwitz D. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and human fetal neurons (13Grand R.J. Grabham P.W. Gallimore M.J. Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2209-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and process retraction in astrocytes (14Cavanaugh K. Gurwitz D. Cunningham D.D. Bradshaw R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), treatment with dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin does not inhibit responses to thrombin. Thus increases in cAMP do not appear to affect PAR-1 signaling in these cells. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA has previously been linked to thrombin-induced cellular responses, including neurite retraction in NEI-115 neuroblastoma cells (41Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and, most recently, thrombin-induced apoptosis in astrocytes and hippocampal neurons (6Donovan F.M. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5316-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RhoA has been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and is thought to contribute to mitogen-associated protein kinase cascades (47Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 48Narumiya S. Morii N. Cell Signalling. 1993; 5: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility of RhoA involvement in thrombin-induced protection, we assayed for the level of available RhoA, RhoA that is not inactivated by the cellular ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme, under hypoglycemic conditions in the presence or absence of thrombin. Cells were cultured and differentiated as described, washed twice, and incubated in medium containing 0.5 mm glucose and 0 or 20 units/ml (10 nm) thrombin. At 3, 12, and 24 h post-treatment, cells were lysed and membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared. These fractions were assayed for protein concentration and 30 μg of each sample were tested for the level of available, nonribosylated RhoA by in vitro ribosylation assay (41Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Proteins were ADP-ribosylated by exoenzyme C3 and [32P]NAD, precipitated, and electrophoresed though 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and ribosylated proteins visualized by autoradiography. Thrombin increased available RhoA activity in the membrane fraction, but only after at least a 3-h incubation with thrombin (Fig.2 A). This thrombin-induced increase in available RhoA continued and increased over the time course of the experiment (Fig. 2, B and C). As a control for endogenous ribosylation activity, 30 μg of a thrombin-treated sample was assayed without the addition of exoenzyme C3; no RhoA is labeled (lane 1, all panels). This result indicates that although nanomolar concentrations of thrombin do not immediately increase available RhoA, prolonged exposure to thrombin, even under hypoglycemic conditions, increases available RhoA activity. This raises the possibility that RhoA is involved in transducing thrombin protective signals. Since prolonged treatment with thrombin showed a small but consistent increase in available RhoA activity, we questioned whether the activity of RhoA was necessary for thrombin-mediated protection from hypoglycemia. Cells were cultured as described and pretreated with exoenzyme C3 (25 μg/ml) for 3 h. Cells were then incubated in medium containing 0.5 mm glucose and exoenzyme C3 in the presence or absence of 0.2 unit/ml (1 nm) thrombin. Cell viability was measured using the LDH assay 72 h following exposure to hypoglycemic conditions. Pretreatment with exoenzyme C3 completely blocked thrombin-induced protection (Fig. 3). Exoenzyme C3 did not affect cell viability as compared with control untreated hypoglycemic cultures, indicating it was not increasing the toxicity of the hypoglycemic treatment. Thus, RhoA activity appears to be necessary for thrombin-induced protection in astrocytes. The results of these studies on the signal transduction cascade underlying thrombin-induced protection when compared with the previous study of thrombin-induced apoptosis (6Donovan F.M. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5316-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate a similar pathway is stimulated in both cases. How does thrombin cause these very different effects in these cells? One possibility is that although the signal pathway is similar, perhaps identical in the beginning, the different concentrations of thrombin required for each response result in a different level of stimulation of this pathway so that a different signal is ultimately generated. Another possibility is that duration of signal plays a part, that the cells must be continuously exposed to elevated levels of thrombin in order to induce cell death. To test the latter hypothesis, astrocytes were exposed to 200 units/ml thrombin for 8, 12, 16, 20, or 72 h, after which cells were washed three times, and serum-free medium was added back to the culture well. Control cells were maintained in serum-free medium and washed with media exactly as thrombin-treated cells. Cell viability was then measured 72 h from the addition of thrombin. Astrocytes exposed to thrombin for up to 16 h showed no loss in cell viability; however, exposure of cells to thrombin for 20 h or longer resulted in nearly as much cell death as a full 72-h thrombin exposure (Fig.4 A). This demonstrated that duration of exposure to thrombin contributes to the cellular response to thrombin. It is also noteworthy that the control culture not treated with thrombin had a consistent decrease in cell viability (approximately 30%). This is most likely due to the removal of the cells from the incubator every 4 h of the experiment, because control cells not removed from the incubator showed no significant loss in cell viability over a similar 72 h time course. Importantly, thrombin treatment up to the 16-h time point actually protected the cells from the deleterious stresses of this experiment, showing that not only were the high doses of thrombin not toxic, but actually protected the astrocytes (Fig. 4 A). These results, in combination with the pharmacological studies, suggest the possibility that thrombin activates a common pathway when inducing either protection or apoptosis and that in the case of apoptosis, the persistence of the signal contributes to the altered response of the cell. In the initial report of thrombin-induced neuroprotection, a time course study determined that no pretreatment of astrocytes with thrombin was necessary to protect these cells from hydrogen peroxide toxicity (3Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the protect"
https://openalex.org/W2066508034,"We have previously shown that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) increases type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) expression in human dermal fibroblasts in culture (Mauviel, A., Lapiére, J.-C., Halcin, C., Evans, C. H., and Uitto, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25–28). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of COL7A1 by this growth factor, we performed transient cell transfections with a series of 5′-deletion promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs. We identified a 68-base pair region between nucleotides −524 and −456, relative to the transcription start site, as critical for TGF-β response. Using electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with an oligonucleotide spanning the region from −524 to −444, we discovered that a TGF-β-specific protein-DNA complex was formed as early as 11 min after TGF-β stimulation and persisted for 1 h after addition of the growth factor. Deletion analysis of the TGF-βresponsive region of the COL7A1 promoter by EMSA identified segment −496/−444 as the minimal fragment capable of binding the TGF-β-induced complex. Furthermore, two distinct segments, −496/−490 and −453/−444, appeared to be necessary for TGF-β-induced DNA binding activity, suggesting a bipartite element. Supershift experiments with a pan-Smad antibody unambiguously identified the TGF-β-induced complex as containing a Smad member. This is the first direct identification of binding of endogenous Smad proteins to regulatory sequences of a human gene. We have previously shown that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) increases type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) expression in human dermal fibroblasts in culture (Mauviel, A., Lapiére, J.-C., Halcin, C., Evans, C.

The collagens comprise a superfamily of proteins that play a critical role in the maintenance of extracellular matrix integrity. Type VII collagen is found primarily in the basement membrane zone of specialized squamous epithelia, such as in the skin, various mucous membranes, and the cornea of the eye (1Wetzels R.H.W.

Dermatol. 1992; 1: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is the predominant, if not the exclusive, component of anchoring fibrils, attachment structures that play a critical role in ensuring stability to the association of the epithelial basement membrane zone to the underlying papillary dermis (3Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 4Burgeson R.E. J. Invest.

Synthesis of functional anchoring fibrils is of critical importance in providing integrity to the cutaneous basement membrane zone, and abnormalities in these adhesion structures clinically manifest as dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of heritable bullous diseases characterized by cutaneous fragility and the tendency to sub-basal lamina densa blister formation (5Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Curr. Opin. Dermatol. 1996; 3: 225-232Google Scholar). In fact, our laboratory recently demonstrated that mutations within the COL7A1 gene are associated with different forms of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (6Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S.

Analysis of the 5′-end sequences of the human COL7A1 gene has revealed a promoter devoid of a canonical TATA or CAAT box (GenBank/EMBL accession no. L23982). Its expression requires the integrity of an Sp1-binding site located between residues −512 and −505, relative to the transcription start site (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D.

Despite these structural features usually associated with promoters of so-called “housekeeping” genes, type VII collagen expression has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by several cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ARE, activin-responsive element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; TBSB, TGF-β-specific band; TBRS, TGF-β-responsive sequence; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ARE, activin-responsive element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; TBSB, TGF-β-specific band; TBRS, TGF-β-responsive sequence; bp, base pair(s).

Woodley D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 125-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have previously shown that cytokine-mediated regulation of COL7A1 gene expression is strikingly different from that of type I collagen, as evidenced by synergistic activation of COL7A1 gene expression by TGF-β and tumor necrosis factor-α (11Mauviel A. Lapiére J.-C. Halcin C. Evans C.H. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, however, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the above mentioned regulation of COL7A1 gene expression. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β up-regulates the activity of human COL7A1 in dermal fibroblasts. We report, for the first time, evidence for Smad-mediated, immediate-early activation of a human gene by TGF-β through direct interaction of a Smad-containing transcription complex with the TGF-β-responsive region of the COL7A1 promoter. Human dermal fibroblast cultures, established by explanting tissue specimens obtained from neonatal foreskins, were utilized in passages 3–6. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-G, and 0.25 μg/ml FungizoneTM). Human recombinant TGF-β2 was a kind gift from Dr. David Olsen, Celtrix Co., Palo Alto, CA. It is referred to as TGF-β throughout the text. To study the transcriptional regulation of human type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) expression, transient transfection experiments were performed with various COL7A1 promoter 5′-deletion fragments cloned into promoterless pBS0CAT vector (13Fazio M.J.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After glycerol shock, the cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum, and TGF-β was added 3 h later. After 40 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The β-galactosidase activities were measured according to a standard protocol (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, aliquots corresponding to identical β-galactosidase activity were used for each CAT assay with [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate (16Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar), using thin layer chromatography. Following autoradiography, the plates were cut and counted by liquid scintillation to quantify the acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol. Several fragments spanning the region between nucleotides −524 and −444 of the COL7A1 promoter responsive to TGF-β were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the plasmid −722COL7A1 as template and purified by electroelution after electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. Each oligonucleotide was used either as a probe or as a competitor in electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments. Nuclear extracts were isolated from human dermal fibroblasts using a small scale preparation (17Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar), aliquoted in small fractions to avoid repetitive freeze-thawing, and stored at −80 °C until use. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined using a commercial assay kit (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 20 min on ice in binding reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 4% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), prior to the addition of [32P]5′-end-labeled oligomers (0.05–0.1 pmol, 2–6 × 104 cpm) for another 20 min of incubation at 4 °C. For competition experiments, a 1–60-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA was added to the binding reaction. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated overnight with antisera prior to the binding reaction. Sp1 and c-Jun/AP-1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The pan-Smad antibody 367 was described previously (21Lechleider R.J. de Caestercker M.P. Dehejta A. Polymeropoulos M.H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 17617-17620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C, fixed for 1 h in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, vacuum-dried, and autoradiographed. We and others have previously demonstrated that TGF-β is a potent inducer of type VII collagen gene expression in dermal fibroblasts, as determined at both protein and mRNA levels (10Ko¨nig A. Brückner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,11Mauviel A. Lapiére J.-C. Halcin C. Evans C.H. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether TGF-β up-regulates COL7A1 gene expression at the transcriptional level by activation of the promoter, human dermal fibroblast cultures were transiently transfected with several 5′-end deletion/CAT reporter gene constructs spanning the COL7A1 promoter region from positions −722 to +92, relative to the transcription start site, +1 (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 40 h, at which point CAT activity (representing COL7A1 promoter activity) was determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a stimulatory effect of TGF-β was observed with constructs −722COL7A1/CAT (~4.4-fold induction) and −524COL7A1/CAT (~5.3-fold induction), indicating that the up-regulation of type VII collagen gene expression by TGF-β occurs, at least in part, at the transcriptional level through activation of the promoter. Subsequent 5′-deletion to position −456 abolished the COL7A1 promoter responsiveness to TGF-β, which was similarly lost when further 5′-deletions extended to positions −396 and −230 (Fig. 1 A). These data indicate that the DNA sequences between residues −524 and −456 of the COL7A1 promoter are essential in providing TGF-β responsiveness in fibroblasts. We have recently demonstrated that a GT box, −512/−505, binds the transcription factor Sp1 and is crucial for high expression of COL7A1 (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sp1 has been shown to play a role in TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of COL1A2 (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although other transcription factors, such as AP-1, are also involved (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested the effect of a functional mutation in this GT box on the TGF-β responsiveness of COL7A1 promoter. For this purpose, the TGF-β responsiveness of mutant −524mCOL7A1/CAT construct, harboring the GT box mutation, was compared with that of −524COL7A1/CAT in transient cell transfection experiments. As anticipated from our previous studies (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the mutation drastically reduced the basal activity of the promoter. It did not, however, alter its up-regulation by TGF-β. On the other hand, 5′-deletion up to position −456 not only reduced basal promoter activity by ~90% but also totally eliminated TGF-β responsiveness, confirming the data presented in Fig. 1 A. These data indicate that the −512/−505 GT box is not involved in the TGF-β response. To determine whether the region of COL7A1 promoter shown above to confer TGF-β responsiveness to a CAT reporter construct contained a putative TGF-β specific cis-element, EMSAs were performed using a radiolabeled 81-bp oligonucleotide spanning the region located between residues −524 and −444, encompassing the entire TGF-β-responsive COL7A1 promoter region. In the first set of experiments, fibroblast cultures were incubated without or with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h prior to nuclear extract preparation. No difference in the EMSA pattern could be detected between nuclear extracts from control cultures and those from TGF-β-treated cultures (not shown). In the second set of experiments, fibroblast cultures were treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) and nuclear extracts were prepared at several times thereafter, between 1 min and 3 h. As shown in Fig.2 A, incubation of the nuclear extracts with the −524/−444 oligonucleotide resulted in the formation of two major, TGF-β-independent DNA-protein complexes, identified as shifts 1 and 2, and present in nuclear extracts from either control or TGF-β-stimulated fibroblasts. These two bands have been previously shown to contain the transcription factor Sp1 (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An additional complex migrating between complexes 1 and 2 was induced as early as 15 min after TGF-β stimulation, persisted with a similar intensity until the 1-h time point, and disappeared at 3 h. This new complex was not present in nuclear extracts from control fibroblast cultures and will be referred to as the TGF-β-specific band (TBSB). Accurate determination of the earliest time point at which the TBSB could be observed was performed in a third set of experiments. For this purpose, fibroblast nuclear extracts were prepared every 2 min, from 5 to 15 min, after addition of TGF-β to the fibroblast cultures and tested in EMSAs, using the COL7A1 promoter fragment −524/−444 as a probe. The results indicate that binding of the TGF-β-specific complex appears with maximal intensity as early as 11 min poststimulation (not shown). To address the specificity of the TBSB and to attempt to identify the protein(s) that it may contain, competition experiments were carried out with several oligonucleotides spanning the −524/−444 region of COL7A1 promoter, as well as oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for known transcription factors, Sp1, AP-2, and AP-1. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled −524/−444 fragment efficiently competed all binding associated with the probe (lane 3). Fragment −524/−491, containing the GT box described above, efficiently competed Sp1-related binding (lane 4), confirming our previous observations (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas fragments −490/−457 (lane 5) and −500/−475 (lane 6) failed to compete either Sp1 or TBSB binding. Fragment −504/−444 (lane 7) competed TBSB binding and most of the Sp1 binding, suggesting that the TBRS is, indeed, comprised within this fragment. As expected from our previous observations (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), an Sp1 oligonucleotide (60-fold molar excess) abolished shifts 1 and 2 but did not alter the TBSB. Also, an AP-2 oligonucleotide significantly displaced both shifts 1 and 2 but without altering TBSB formation (lane 9). Competition of Sp1 binding is likely due to the sequence similarity between Sp1 and AP-2 consensus sequences. Finally, an AP-1 oligonucleotide (lane 10) did not displace either Sp1 binding or the TBSB. The next set of experiments was designed to further refine the cis-acting element(s) responsible for the appearance of the TBSB. Toward this end, a series of oligonucleotides was generated, representing a stepwise deletion from either the 5′- or 3′-ends of the −504/−444 promoter fragment. Their sequences and relative positions are depicted in Fig.3 A. First, EMSA experiments were performed with nuclear extracts from fibroblast cultures treated for 30 min with TGF-β, using each of the various stepwise deletion oligonucleotides as probes. As expected from the competition experiments presented above, the −504/−444 fragment efficiently bound the TBSB (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). 5′-End deletion from nucleotide −504 to nucleotide −496 did not affect TBSB formation with oligonucleotides extending to position −444 in 3′ (lanes 4 versus lane 2). However, further 5′-end deletion to residue −490 or 3′-end deletion to residue −453 resulted in complete loss of TGF-β-induced binding activity (lanes 6 and8, respectively). Three conclusions could be drawn from these experiments. First, the minimal COL7A1 promoter fragment capable of binding the TBSB is −496/−444. Second, it is likely that two distinct sites, one located within the sequences surrounding nucleotides −496/−490 at the 5′-end of the TBRS and the other between nucleotides −453/−444 at the 3′-end of the TBRS, are simultaneously required for providing the TGF-β-induced binding activity. Third, deletion of the Sp1 binding GT box between −512 and −505 did not influence the formation of the TBSB, further indicating that the GT box is not involved in TGF-β response. Finally, despite the removal of the GT box, residual Sp1 binding activity was still observed, suggesting the presence of a secondary Sp1 binding sequence within the −490/−453 DNA fragment of COL7A1 promoter. The latter observation was confirmed in two subsequent experiments. First, recombinant Sp1 protein was capable of binding this fragment, as determined in gel mobility shift assays, and second, an antibody specifically directed against Sp1 supershifted the weak protein-DNA complexes 1 and 2 generated with the −504/−444 COL7A1 probe (not shown). Confirmation of the data presented above was provided in a series of competition experiments in which the deletion fragments described in Fig. 3 A were utilized to compete the TGF-β-induced protein-DNA complex formation with the longer −524/−444 COL7A1 fragment. Only the fragments containing both discrete regions −496/−490 and −453/−444 were able to compete binding of the TBSB to the −504/−444 probe, whereas shorter fragments lacking either one or both of these elements were unable to compete (not shown). We next attempted to delineate the signaling pathway by which TGF-β induces the formation of the TBSB. For this purpose, fibroblast cultures were first incubated with several inhibitors of different signaling pathways, prior to TGF-β stimulation (30 min) and subsequent nuclear protein preparation. All inhibitors were tested at three concentrations, which have been shown in previous publications to effectively block their target pathways. Protein kinase C inhibitors (GF10923X, staurosporine, calphostin, H7), phospholipase C inhibitors (D609, U73122), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, tyrphostin 51), the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors (SB203580, PD 98059), calcium ionophore, pertussis and cholera toxins, and okadaic acid all failed to block TBSB formation (not shown). This lack of effect from all inhibitors tested suggests a rapid mechanism that may be triggered directly through the TGF-β receptors, without a complex cytoplasmic cascade of events, involving the several pathways listed above. In this context, Smad proteins were recently identified as immediate-early response factors, which are translocated into the nucleus following their phosphorylation by TGF-β receptor type I (reviewed in Refs. 22Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Derynck R. Zhang Y. Curr.

Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). To identify the transcription factor(s) participating in the TGF-β-induced complex, we performed supershift assays with antibodies specific for Sp1, c-Jun, and a recently developed pan-Smad antibody, 367 (21Lechleider R.J. de Caestercker M.P. Dehejta A. Polymeropoulos M.H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 17617-17620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 2R. J. Lechleider and A. B. Roberts, unpublished data. As shown in Fig.4, an Sp1 antibody recognized and supershifted both shifts 1 and 2 without altering the TGF-β-specific band (lane 4). These results were anticipated from our previous demonstration of the essential role played by Sp1 in high basal activity of the COL7A1 promoter (8Vindevoghel L. Chung K.-Y. Davis A. Kouba D. Kivirikko S. Alder H. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10196-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Anti c-Jun had no effect on any of the three DNA-protein complexes (lane 5). Interestingly, the anti-Smad polyclonal antibody 367 was able to supershift part of, and to reduce the total amount of, the TBSB (lane 3). Collectively, these data indicate that a member of the Smad family is rapidly complexing to the TGF-β-responsive region of the COL7A1 promoter following treatment of fibroblasts with TGF-β. Our studies of the human COL7A1 promoter reported here demonstrate that this gene is an immediate-early target of TGF-β transcriptional activation in dermal fibroblasts, with evidence of formation of a TGF-β-specific transcriptional complex within 11 min after TGF-β addition in a ligand-dependent manner. Smad proteins have recently been identified as critical intracellular mediators of TGF-β family-induced signals (reviewed in Refs. 22Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Derynck R. Zhang Y. Curr.

Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding to TGF-β type I and II receptors, two Smad isoforms, Smad2 and Smad3, are recruited to the type I receptor where they undergo phosphorylation on conserved serine residues in the C terminus. Following activation, these proteins associate with the tumor suppressor Smad4/DPC4 and are translocated to the nucleus where they presumably act in transcriptional complexes (reviewed in Refs. 22Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Derynck R. Zhang Y. Curr.

Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). In our experiments, supershift assays using a pan-Smad antibody (21Lechleider R.J. de Caestercker M.P. Dehejta A. Polymeropoulos M.H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 17617-17620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar) show that the protein-DNA complex, TBSB, contains one or more Smad proteins. Based on signaling specificity, this complex likely contains Smad2 or Smad3 along with Smad4. The method of transcriptional activation by Smads has recently begun to be elucidated. Chen et al. (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) identified a DNA-binding protein of the forkhead family (FAST-1) that specifically and inducibly interacts with an activin-responsive element (ARE) in the promoter of the Xenopus homeobox gene Mix.2 (27Huang H.-C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FAST-1 also interacts with Smad2 and Smad4/DPC4 in the ARE binding complex (28Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of this system in mammalian cells demonstrates that efficient DNA binding and transcriptional activation require FAST-1, Smad2, and Smad4 in the same complex (29Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3158-3167Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Our data represent the first example of a mammalian promoter directly regulated by interactions with endogenous Smad proteins and as such make COL7A1 the first example of an immediate-early gene regulated by TGF-β in a Smad-dependent fashion. Although the cis-elements necessary for interaction with Smad transcriptional complexes are not known, some architectural constraints may be deduced from comparison of the TBRS in the COL7A1 promoter with the ARE from the Mix.2 gene. Chen et al. (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) identified a direct 6-bp AAATGT repeat separated by 11 bp, and this sequence was used to clone the DNA binding protein FAST-1. Mutation of either element of this repeat disrupts DNA binding by FAST-1 (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Similarly, the COL7A1 element contains two 5-bp ATGGC repeats, two adjacent CAGA repeats in the 5′end and two pairs of 4-bp repeats, CCCA and ACAG. Deletion studies suggest that two elements are necessary for Smad/DNA interaction, as both the COL7A1 −490/−444 and −496/−453 probes failed to bind the TGF-β-inducible complex, whereas the −496/−444 fragment was the minimum required to generate a gel-shifted band. This suggests a mechanism similar to that observed with the Mix.2 ARE, with two separated elements required for full activity (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The nature of the exact cis-elements required for DNA-Smad interaction is currently under investigation. Whether a Smad protein binds the COL7A1 promoter directly cannot be ascertained from our data. The Drosophila Smad1 homologue, the mad gene product, can bind elements in thevestigial promoter directly, and a consensus Mad binding sequence (GCCGnCGc) that can bind recombinant Mad protein has been identified (30Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Similarly, the tumor suppressor Smad4 can bind DNA directly (31Yingling J. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this has not been convincingly demonstrated in an endogenous complex. In the COL7A1 promoter, an accessory DNA binding protein may be required, as in the Mix.2 ARE, or a Smad or Smads may bind the TGF-β-responsive elements without additional binding proteins. Experiments are under way to explore these possibilities. The expert technical assistance of Ying-Jee Song is gratefully acknowledged."

Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) are effective in increasing its affinity for Ca2+. A more relevant physiological significance is represented by a calpain activator protein recently identified in human red blood cells (14Salamino F. De Tullio R. Mengotti P. Viotti P.L. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in rat skeletal muscle (15Michetti M. Viotti P.L. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This protein factor, which is significantly effective in reducing the requirement of the proteinase for calcium ions, binds Ca2+ with high affinity (10Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and associates to the particulate fraction of the cells; in fact, it is recovered in the soluble fraction only when cell lysis is performed by a medium containing metal chelators. Furthermore, the activator-Ca2+ complex interacts with calpain and thereby induces those conformational changes required to trigger the activation process of the proteinase. On the basis of these results, the protein factor could be visualized as a physiological mean to obtain a site-directed activation of calpain elicited in response to an increased intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. In this study we report the purification of a bovine brain calpain activator. Taking advantage of new strategies for the purification procedure, we have obtained sufficient amounts of protein to establish its amino acid sequence. The primary structure of the rat brain calpain activator is almost completely identical to that of a known protein called UK114 (16Ceciliani F. Faotto L. Negri A. Colombo I. Berra B. Bartorelli A. Ronchi S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), similar to that of a 23-kDa protein from rat liver (17Levy-Favatier L. Cuisset L. Nedelec B. Tichonicky L. Kruh J. Delpech M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), corrected as reported by Ceciliani et al. (16Ceciliani F. Faotto L. Negri A. Colombo I. Berra B. Bartorelli A. Ronchi S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and to that of HR12 heat-shock YABJ and YJGF proteins (SwissProt sequence data base). The calpain activator is highly selective for the μ-isoforms of the proteinase and does not reveal any apparent species specificity. Superose 12 and Source 15 Q columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Purified UK114 (10Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Severino Ronchi, Istituto di Fisiologia Veterinaria e Biochimica, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. Freshly collected bovine brain was suspended in 4 volumes of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and disrupted by using Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Cells were lysed by sonication (6 bursts of 10 s each), and the particulate material was removed by centrifugation. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 5.8, and the sample was heated at 90 °C for 3 min and centrifuged, and the clear supernatant was collected. The proteins were concentrated by adding ammonium sulfate at the 80% concentration, suspended in 50 mm sodium borate, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA (Buffer A), dialyzed against the same buffer, then submitted to ion exchange chromatography on the Source 15 Q column (1.6 × 5 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The unabsorbed proteins, also containing the calpain activator, were collected and applied to a butyl-agarose column equilibrated in Buffer A. The unretained material, containing calpain activator activity, was collected and submitted to gel chromatography on the Superose 12 column (1.8 × 50 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. Calpain activator from rat skeletal muscle was purified from 120 g of fresh tissue, suspended in 10 volumes of cold 0.25 msucrose containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and homogenized in a tissue grinder. All purification steps were carried out as reported above for bovine brain activator. The activator protein was also isolated from human erythrocytes. Erythrocytes were deprived of leukocytes and platelets and washed three times with 10 mm sodium phosphate solution containing 0.15 m NaCl. Cells were then packed and lysed with 5 volumes of 50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.3, containing 1 mm EDTA. The membranes were discarded by centrifugation and the clear supernatant was heated at 90 °C for 3 min. The human erythrocyte activator protein was further purified to homogeneity as described for bovine brain activator. The activator protein activity was assayed by adding the appropriate amounts of the activator sources to the routine calpain assay mixture containing 2 μm Ca2+ (18Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Di Lisa F. Siliprandi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One unit of calpain activator activity is defined as the amount causing the appearance of one unit of calpain activity in the presence of 2 μm Ca2+(14Salamino F. De Tullio R. Mengotti P. Viotti P.L.

Purified activator protein (100 pmol) was lyophilized in the presence of 0.05% SDS to avoid the irreversible denaturation and insolubilization of the protein, submitted to 16% SDS-PAGE, 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and then transblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride sheet. The region of membrane-containing activator protein, localized by staining with Ponceau S, was cut, washed with H2O, saturated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and then minced (19Aersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saevedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The fragments were suspended on 0.6 ml of 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 5% CH3CN and 1 μg of trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. After digestion, the soluble material was lyophilized, suspended in 50 μl of H2O, and the pH was acidified by addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was submitted to chromatography on a C-18 column (1 × 100 mm) equilibrated with distilled water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbed peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of CH3CN (from 0 to 70%) and fractions of 30 μl were collected. The fractions containing the tryptic peptides were directly loaded on the Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer to determine primary structure. A comparison of primary structure of rat brain activator and other protein sequences was done using the SwissProt sequence data base. Alignment of the sequences of brain activator and goat liver UK114 was performed using the PALIGN program. The alignment of the amino acid sequence of the calpain activator protein with a rat liver 23-kDa protein (16Ceciliani F. Faotto L. Negri A. Colombo I. Berra B. Bartorelli A. Ronchi S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), HR12 (HR12 MOUSE), YJGF (YJGF HAEIN), and YABJ (YABJ BACSU) proteins was obtained using the CLUSTAL program. μ-Calpain and m-calpain from rat brain were purified as reported (20Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and those from skeletal muscle were obtained as described previously (21Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human and bovine erythrocyte μ-calpain and m-calpain were purified as reported (10Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Calpains were routinely assayed as previously reported (18Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Di Lisa F. Siliprandi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following ion exchange chromatography of the heat-treated bovine brain homogenate on Source Q resin, which binds calpastatin with high efficiency, the protein factor is recovered in the washing material. When tested for its activity, it is found to promote activation of calpain at a concentration of calcium ineffective to promote activity of the native proteinase. The solution is then filtered through a column of butyl-agarose, which removes the residual traces of calpastatin activity and other contaminating proteins. Finally, the solution containing calpain activator activity is submitted to gel chromatography on a Superose 12 column. As shown in Fig.1, three major protein peaks are eluted: the first one showing an approximate molecular mass of 30 kDa (emerging immediately before carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa); a second one with a mass of approximately 22 kDa; and a third one with a mass below 10 kDa and identified as ubiquitin by its N-terminal amino acid sequence (data not shown). Only the first peak contains the calpain activator activity. All fractions under this peak are collected and submitted to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). A single protein band is detected with a mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 15 kDa, indicating that in the native active form the activator is present in a dimeric structure.Figure 2SDS-PAGE of bovine brain activator. A sample (200 μl) of fractions (from 13 to 16, see Fig. 1) containing activator activity obtained by Superose 12 column chromatography was lyophilized and suspended into 0.05 ml of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS and submitted to 16% SDS-PAGE. At the end of the electrophoretic run, the protein bands were identified by silver staining. The arrows indicate the molecular mass of standard proteins (bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; chicken egg albumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; and cytochromec, 13 kDa); lanes 1–4 refer to fractions from 13 to 16 of the chromatography shown in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the protein, the material recovered from ten separate chromatographic analyses, each one corresponding to that shown in Fig. 1, is loaded on a SDS-PAGE and transblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride sheet. The position of the single protein band is identified by staining with Ponceau S, cut, and destained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein is then solubilized by digestion with trypsin, and the peptides mixture separated on a C-18 reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 3). The peptides are eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 0 to 70%) and each peptide is separately collected, sequenced, and analyzed for its similarity with known proteins using SwissProt sequence data base (program FASTA3). All peptides show a sequence almost completely identical to the corresponding tryptic peptides from a known protein named UK114. The sequences are then aligned following the primary structure of UK114 protein, and the results are shown in Fig.4. The differences between the two amino acid sequences are confined at residues 7, 43, and 91 at the C-terminal end. The calpain activator protein also shows structural similarities with a 23-kDa protein from rat liver (16Ceciliani F. Faotto L. Negri A. Colombo I. Berra B. Bartorelli A. Ronchi S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the mouse heat-responsive protein HR12, and with two families of proteins, members of which (YJGF and YABJ) are reported in Fig.5. The similarity of this protein factor with heat-shock proteins is very suggestive and might indicate a “chaperonin-like function.”Figure 4Amino acid sequence of calpain activator and its similarity to that of the UK114 protein. Peptides, isolated as shown in Fig. 3, were collected, and their amino acid sequences were determined automatically with a Beckman LF 3000 protein sequencer. The calpain activator (C.

A sample of UK114 protein is submitted to Superose 12 column chromatography in the conditions used for the isolation of the brain calpain activator (Fig.6). Two protein peaks are separated; the major is eluted in an identical volume to that of the calpain activator, the second one in an elution volume corresponding to ubiquitin. The first peak is found to possess a potent activating effect on calpain, almost indistinguishable from that observed with the authentic bovine brain calpain activator. As shown in Table I, addition of the bovine brain activator to μ-calpains, isolated from different sources, promotes a more than 10-fold decrease in the Ca2+requirement of the proteinases without any modification of theirV max. On the contrary, the activator is ineffective on rat brain or skeletal muscle m-calpain.Table IEffect of bovine brain calpain activator on the Ca2+requirement and on the Vmax of μ- and m-calpains isolated from different sourcesCalpainCa2+requirement1-aExpressed as the [Ca2+] promoting 0.5V max.V max1-bExpressed as the ratio between V maxmeasured in the presence of the activator and V maxmeasured in its absence.SourceIsoform−Activator+ActivatorμmRat brainμ12 ± 20.45 ± 0.051.04Rat skeletal muscleμ10 ± 10.40 ± 0.051.09Bovine erythrocytesμ15 ± 30.52 ± 0.051.05Human erythrocytesμ27 ± 30.50 ± 0.081.12Rat brainm250 ± 30250 ± 301.0Rat skeletal musclem295 ± 30295 ± 301.0Ca2+ requirement was determined assaying calpain activity at increasing concentration of Ca2+ in the absence or presence of calpain activator in an amount causing the maximal effect (see Fig. 7).1-a Expressed as the [Ca2+] promoting 0.5V max.1-b Expressed as the ratio between V maxmeasured in the presence of the activator and V maxmeasured in its absence. Open table in a new tab Ca2+ requirement was determined assaying calpain activity at increasing concentration of Ca2+ in the absence or presence of calpain activator in an amount causing the maximal effect (see Fig. 7). The activator effect is dose-dependent (Fig.7) and reaches a maximum on activator/calpain molar ratio of approximately 1 to 1. Rat skeletal muscle μ-calpain shows a slightly lower affinity for the activator and requires a 1.1–1.2 factor excess. In Table II, the properties of calpain activators from human erythrocyte and goat liver sources are compared with those of the bovine brain protein factor. The three activators are equally efficient in promoting expression of catalytic activity of homologous and heterologous μ-calpains. All of these protein factors are ineffective on m-calpains.Table IIIsozyme and tissue specificity of calpain activatorCalpainCalpain activator fromSourceIsozymeBovine brainHuman erythrocytesGoat liver UK114%Rat brainμ889191Rat skeletal muscleμ828586Bovine erythrocyteμ104107106Human erythrocyteμ979598Rat brainmND2-aND, not detectable.NDNDRat skeletal musclemNDNDNDCalpain activator effect is expressed as the percentage of calpain activity measured in the presence of 2 μm Ca2+and equimolar amounts of activators.

Taken together, these findings indicate that the μ-calpain activator protein is not a characteristic of brain tissue, and it is probably widely distributed. It is generally recognized that the soluble calcium-dependent proteolytic system is composed by one or more proteinases (calpains) and by their natural inhibitor, calpastatin (1Murachi T. Biochem.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the past years, we have observed that a possible third component of this system, effective in reducing the Ca2+ requirement of calpains and thereby in promoting activation of these proteinases, is also present in different human and rat tissues (14Salamino F. De Tullio R. Mengotti P. Viotti P.L. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Michetti M. Viotti P.L. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Its molecular characterization and degree of identity with other proteins have never been defined, probably due to difficulties in the preparation procedures and in the concentration of the samples as well as in the chromatographic analyses. This protein, in fact, binds to many inert supports or membranes particularly to those employing hydrophobic materials. These difficulties have been overcome by the use of new purification strategies; on the basis of which it was possible to obtain a sufficient amount of pure calpain activator to determine the primary structure. The molecular mass resulted in being slightly higher than that of cytochrome c, approximately 15 kDa in denaturing conditions and around 30 kDa in native conditions, indicating that the native active form is a dimer. Sequence analysis has revealed its almost complete identity with a previously characterized protein isolated from the acid-soluble material of goat liver and called UK114 (16Ceciliani F. Faotto L. Negri A. Colombo I. Berra B. Bartorelli A. Ronchi S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, the bovine brain calpain activator shows structural similarities with a 23-kDa protein from goat liver (16Ceciliani F. Faotto L. Negri A. Colombo I. Berra B. Bartorelli A. Ronchi S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Levy-Favatier L. Cuisset L. Nedelec B. Tichonicky L. Kruh J. Delpech M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a high degree of similarity with the mouse heat-responsive protein HR12, or with heat-shock proteins (YJGF and YABJ), suggesting that the mechanism of action may also include a chaperonin-like activity directed at promoting conformational changes of target proteins. This hypothesis is in agreement with the previously described functional properties of the calpain activator and consistent with a sequential mechanism of activation involving at first an interaction of the Ca2+-activator complex with calpain, followed by a conformational change of the proteinase, resulting in its activation at very low [Ca2+]. Since the activator interacts with intracellular membrane structures upon binding of Ca2+ (data not shown), it could also be suggested that the overall mechanism consists of promoting a site-directed activation of calpain and thereby a site-directed specificity for digestion of protein substrates. This model can be considered to operate with a high degree of specificity in different cells in which the soluble calcium-dependent proteolytic system requires a sophisticated regulatory efficiency. However, we have observed that the calpain activator isolated from rat skeletal muscle, although showing a similar activating mechanism, displays different specificity in activating m-calpain (26Pontremoli S. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple activator forms, together with the observed structural similarities among the protein factor and other protein molecules, suggests the existence of a family of calpain-activating proteins with specific properties operating in various tissues in response to different stimuli. As revealed by the Garnier analysis method (27Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar), the calpain activator and the proteins showing a high degree of similarity with this factor contain a central region rich in helical conformation-preferring residues (residues 52–72 in the calpain activator protein), suggesting the existence of common structural features that could be involved in similar intracellular functions. Furthermore, these results represent the first demonstration for an intracellular function of UK114 protein related to the modulation of the soluble calcium-dependent proteolytic system and thereby stressing the role of the calcium-mediated proteolysis in cell functions. We thank Dr. Severino Ronchi, Istituto di Fisiologia Veterinaria e Biochimica, University of Milan, Milan, Italy, for the gift of a sample of pure UK114 and Roberto Minafra for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2099571525,"The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B plays a key regulatory role in the translation initiation phase of protein synthesis. The activity is markedly inhibited when the substrate, i.e. eIF2, is phosphorylated on Ser51 of its α-subunit. Genetic studies in yeast implicate the α-, β-, and δ-subunits of eIF2B in mediating the inhibition by substrate phosphorylation. However, the mechanism involved in the inhibition has not been defined biochemically. In the present study, we have coexpressed the five subunits of rat eIF2B in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system and have purified the recombinant holoprotein to >90% homogeneity. We have also expressed and purified a four-subunit eIF2B complex lacking the α-subunit. Both the five- and four-subunit forms of eIF2B exhibit similar rates of guanine nucleotide exchange activity using unphosphorylated eIF2 as substrate. The five-subunit form is inhibited by preincubation with phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2(αP)) and exhibits little exchange activity when eIF2(αP) is used as substrate. In contrast, eIF2B lacking the α-subunit is insensitive to inhibition by eIF2(αP) and is able to exchange guanine nucleotide using eIF2(αP) as substrate at a faster rate compared with five-subunit eIF2B. Finally, a double point mutation in the δ-subunit of eIF2B has been identified that results in insensitivity to inhibition by eIF2(αP) and exhibits little exchange activity when eIF2(αP) is used as substrate.

Regulation of translation initiation plays an important role in the control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Ref.1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). By modulating different steps in the initiation pathway, regulation of the translation of mRNAs coding for specific classes of proteins as well as regulation of overall mRNA translation can be achieved. The initiation pathway is composed of a number of discrete steps involving at least 12 unique proteins referred to as eukaryotic initiation factors, or eIFs. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; HCR, heme-controlled repressor.Of the many steps in translation initiation, only two are thought to be important in regulating the process in vivo. The two steps include the sequential binding of first mRNA and then initiator methionyl-tRNAi (met-tRNAi) to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In the latter step, eIF2 binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit as a ternary complex with GTP and met-tRNAi. With formation of the 80 S initiation complex, the GTP is hydrolyzed and eIF2 is released as an eIF2·GDP binary complex. The GDP bound to eIF2 must then be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange protein, termed eIF2B (reviewed in Ref. 2Price N. Proud C.G. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast to most guanine nucleotide exchange proteins, which are usually small and consist of a single subunit, eIF2B is composed of five dissimilar subunits present in equimolar amounts in a heteropentameric complex. Although eIF2B has been available in purified form from mammalian cells for 15 years (3Siekierka J. Mauser L. Ochoa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2537-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), no information is available about the role of the individual subunits in catalyzing the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction. Furthermore, little is known about the role of the individual subunits in mediating regulation of the exchange activity. The best characterized means of regulating eIF2B activity involves phosphorylation of the α-subunit of its substrate, eIF2, on Ser51. Phosphorylation of eIF2α converts eIF2 from a substrate into a competitive inhibitor (reviewed in Ref. 1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Based on genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been concluded that the eIF2B α-, β-, and δ-subunits are important in mediating the effect of substrate inhibition of eIF2B (4Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae deprived of amino acids, eIF2α becomes phosphorylated, leading to increased translation of a protein termed GCN4 (reviewed in Refs. 6Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and 7Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although not established experimentally, it has been assumed that eIF2B activity in yeast is inhibited in response to eIF2α phosphorylation and that the inhibition of eIF2B activity is responsible for the increased translation of GCN4 mRNA. This assumption is based on the finding that deletion of the α-subunit or point mutations identified in the α-, β-, and δ-subunits of eIF2B prevent the increase in translation of GCN4 mRNA in response to amino acid deprivation (4Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) without having any effect on cellular growth in nonstarved cells. In addition, overexpression of the eIF2B α-, β-, and δ-subunits leads to formation of a stable eIF2B subcomplex that overcomes the inhibitory effect of high level eIF2 phosphorylation, presumably through a mechanism involving sequestration of the phosphorylated eIF2 by the eIF2B subcomplex (5Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for the apparent insensitivity to eIF2α phosphorylation in cells expressing mutant forms of eIF2B subunits is unknown. In the present study, the five subunits of rat eIF2B were co-expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. A functional, five-subunit eIF2B complex was purified from the cells. In addition, a four-subunit complex lacking the α-subunit was expressed and purified. Both the four- and five-subunit forms of eIF2B exhibited similar specific activities, indicating that the α-subunit of the protein is not required for optimal guanine nucleotide exchange activity. However, whereas the four-subunit form of eIF2B was not inhibited by eIF2(αP), the five subunit form was. Furthermore, the exchange activity using eIF2(αP) as substrate was greater for four- than five-subunit eIF2B. Finally, the δ-subunit containing a double point mutation corresponding to mutations identified in yeast was expressed in combination with the other four subunits of eIF2B. The sensitivity of eIF2B containing the mutant δ-subunit to inhibition by eIF2(αP) was similar to that observed for eIF2B lacking the α-subunit. However, unlike eIF2B lacking the α-subunit, the ability of eIF2B containing the mutant δ-subunit to catalyze GDP exchange using eIF2(αP) was the same as wild-type eIF2B. Overall, the results provide the first biochemical evidence of the regulatory role of the α- and δ-subunits in mediating inhibition of exchange activity by substrate phosphorylation. In addition, they show that the α-subunit of eIF2B is not required for exchange activity. High titer stocks of baculoviruses encoding the wild-type eIF2B α/δ, β/γ, and ε subunits were generated as described previously (8Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.D. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12359-12365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For coexpression of eIF2B subunits, 2 × 108 Sf9 insect cells were infected for 1 h in a reduced volume of 15 ml containing each of the three different virus stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 2–5 for each virus. The infected Sf9 cells were then transferred to a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 85 ml of SF-900 serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were maintained in culture at 28 °C using an orbital shaker (100 rpm). At 72 h after infection, 1.0-ml aliquots were removed and centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes at 2000 rpm for 3 min and pellets were stored at −70 °C until lysis. Site-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites mutagenesis kit, Promega) was utilized to introduce specific changes to the eIF2Bδ cDNA. Oligonucleotide GDP140 (5′-AAT TGC CTG AGA TGCCTG CAC AAT CTT CTT TTG CAC ATA CCG) was used to change Glu311 and Leu315 to Lys and Gln, respectively (eIF2Bδ-E311K,L315Q), generating pAV1057. Plasmid pAV1153 (eIF2Bδ-E311K,L315Q) was created by subcloning the mutated eIF2Bδ 590-base pair BamHI-NdeI fragments from pAV1057 into identically cleaved J203 (also called pAc-2BαFLAG/δFLAG). Nucleotide sequencing of the subcloned 590-base pair fragment confirmed that the plasmid contained only the expected site-directed nucleotide substitutions (underlined in the above oligonucleotide sequence). The proteins expressed in Sf9 cells were immunoaffinity purified by chromatography on a matrix containing an immobilized anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel; IBI/Kodak). Briefly, the cells were lysed as described previously (8Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.D. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12359-12365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of affinity matrix for 2 h at 4 °C, and the mixture was then poured into a plastic column. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer B, followed by 30 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and the bound protein was eluted with 200 μg/ml FLAG octapeptide in buffer C. The protein was then concentrated using a Millipore Biomax 50K centrifugal concentrator and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B was measured as described previously (9Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using eIF2 purified from rat liver as substrate. In some assays, eIF2B (0.5 μg) was preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C with 1 μg of either unphosphorylated eIF2 or eIF2 phosphorylated on Ser51 of the α-subunit using the eIF2α kinase, HCR (10Kimball S.R. Antonelli D.A. Brawley R.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1969-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B was then measured as the exchange of [3H]GDP bound to eIF2 for nonradiolabeled GDP with time. The five rat eIF2B subunits were coexpressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (8Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.D. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12359-12365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Each of the recombinant proteins was expressed with an amino-terminal octapeptide extension referred to as FLAG to aid in purification. As shown in the left panel of Fig.1, a single immunoaffinity purification step utilizing an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody coupled to a solid matrix resulted in isolation of an approximately equimolar mixture of the five eIF2B subunits at a purity of greater than 90%. Likewise, expression of just the eIF2B β-, γ-, δ-, and ε-subunits yielded a complex lacking the α-subunit (Fig. 1, right panel). The four-subunit complex lacking the α-subunit will be hereafter referred to as eIF2B(−α). The specific activities of eIF2B and eIF2B(−α) were compared in a guanine nucleotide exchange assay using eIF2·[3H]GDP as substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, exchange activities were the same when equal amounts of eIF2B and eIF2B(−α) were added to the assay. The results show that the α-subunit of eIF2B is not required for exchange activity. In a previous study, incubation of Sf9 cell extracts expressing rat eIF2B with eIF2 phosphorylated with the eIF2α kinase, HCR, resulted in a decrease in exchange activity compared with extracts incubated with unphosphorylated eIF2 (8Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.D. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12359-12365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, extracts of cells expressing eIF2B(−α) showed no decrease in exchange activity when incubated with eIF2 phosphorylated on the α-subunit. In the present study, purified eIF2B and eIF2B(−α) were incubated with either unphosphorylated eIF2 or eIF2(αP) prior to assay. As shown in the inset to Fig. 3(lane 1), there was no detectable unphosphorylated eIF2α in the phosphorylated eIF2 preparation. Similarly, no phosphorylated eIF2α was detected in the unphosphorylated preparation (Fig. 3,lane 2). In confirmation of the results obtained previously with crude cell extracts, incubation of purified eIF2B with eIF2(αP) (Fig. 3, open symbols) prior to assay resulted in a substantial decrease in exchange activity compared with incubation with unphosphorylated eIF2 (Fig. 3, closed symbols). In contrast, the activity of eIF2B(−α) was nearly unaffected by phosphorylated eIF2. The sensitivity of the exchange activity of eIF2B and eIF2B(−α) to eIF2 phosphorylation was further examined using an eIF2(αP)·[3H]GDP complex as substrate. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 4, both eIF2B and eIF2B(−α) catalyzed GDP exchange using phosphorylated eIF2, although the exchange activity using eIF2(αP) as substrate (open symbols) was significantly slower than that observed using an equimolar amount of unphosphorylated eIF2·[3H]GDP (closed symbols). In addition, eIF2B(−α) catalyzed GDP exchange using eIF2(αP) as substrate at a significantly faster rate than did five subunit eIF2B. The exchange activity observed was not influenced by substrate dephosphorylation since the amount of eIF2(αP) was the same at the beginning and end of the assay (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Likewise, the difference in exchange activity between the four- and five-subunit forms of eIF2B was not due to substrate dephosphorylation. Pavitt et al. (4Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) recently described nine eIF2Bδ mutations that yielded a phenotype similar to that observed in cells lacking eIF2Bα, i.e. increased eIF2α phosphorylation was not accompanied by reduced cell growth rates and increased GCN4 translation. The results suggested that, like eIF2B lacking the α-subunit, eIF2B with any one of these point mutations in the δ-subunit should be resistant to inhibition by eIF2(αP). Four of the amino acids that were found to be mutated in yeast eIF2Bδ are conserved in the amino acid sequence of the rat protein (4Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Of the conserved residues, substitutions of Glu377 and Leu381 with Lys and Gln, respectively, yielded a phenotype exhibiting the least apparent sensitivity to substrate phosphorylation. When a double mutation was made in yeast eIF2Bδ combining these two substitutions, the phenotype observed was identical to the phenotype of the L381Q single mutation. Therefore, in the present study, the same double mutation was made in rat eIF2Bδ and the mutant protein was coexpressed with the other four wild-type subunits. Recombinant eIF2B containing the mutant δ-subunit (referred to hereafter as eIF2B(δ*)) was purified from Sf9 cells as described above for wild-type eIF2B. Unexpectedly, over 50% of the mutant eIF2Bδ was degraded during the purification procedure, even in the presence of a mixture of eight different protease inhibitors. Because of the difficulty in obtaining purified eIF2B(δ*) with equimolar amounts of all five subunits, the exchange activity of eIF2B(δ*) was assessed in cell extracts rather than with the purified protein. As shown in theinset to Fig. 5, no degradation of eIF2Bδ occurred during preparation of extracts from cells expressing either the wild-type or mutant protein. It can also be seen that the amount of expressed protein was essentially the same for each of the five. As observed using purified eIF2B, incubation of extracts of Sf9 cells expressing all five wild-type eIF2B subunits with eIF2(αP) prior to assay (Fig. 5, open symbols) significantly reduced exchange activity compared with extracts incubated with unphosphorylated substrate (Fig. 5,closed symbols). In addition, preincubation of extracts of cells expressing eIF2B(−α) with either eIF2(αP) or eIF2 resulted in little difference in exchange activity. Similar to the results observed for eIF2B(−α), the exchange activity of eIF2B(δ*) was only minimally inhibited by preincubation with eIF2(αP). The results show directly for the first time that both the α- and δ-subunits of eIF2B are important in mediating the inhibition of exchange activity by eIF2(αP). Finally, the exchange activity of eIF2B(δ*) was examined using phosphorylated eIF2 as substrate. As seen in Fig.6, both wild-type eIF2B and eIF2B(δ*) catalyzed GDP exchange using eIF2(αP) as substrate (open symbols), although the activity was substantially lower using phosphorylated compared with unphosphorylated eIF2 (closed symbols). However, unlike eIF2B lacking the α-subunit, the exchange activity using phosphorylated eIF2 as substrate was nearly the same for eIF2B(δ*) as for wild-type eIF2B. Thus, although eIF2B(δ*) was less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of eIF2(αP) on nucleotide exchange using unphosphorylated eIF2 as substrate (Fig. 5), it remained largely incapable of using phosphorylated eIF2 as substrate. Regulation of translation initiation through phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 occurs in response to a variety of stimuli including deprivation of amino acids (10Kimball S.R. Antonelli D.A.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α does not directly inhibit formation of either the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiternary complex or the 43 S preinitiation complex (i.e. a 40 S ribosomal subunit associated with eIF-1A, eIF-3, and the eIF2 ternary complex), as these reactions proceed efficiently in vitrowith the phosphorylated factor (14Trachsel H. Staehelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Instead, phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 is thought to impede eIF2B activity by sequestering eIF2B into an inactive complex. Three lines of evidence support this assumption. (a) eIF2B reportedly does not catalyze GDP exchange on eIF2(αP) (15Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) eIF2(αP) displaces unphosphorylated eIF2 bound to eIF2B but unphosphorylated eIF2 does not (16Safer B. Jagus R. Konieczny A. Crouch D. Grunberg-Manago M. Safer B. Interactions of Translational and Transcriptional Controls in the Regulation of Gene Expression. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1982: 311-325Google Scholar); and (c) eIF2(αP) inhibits the activity of eIF2B in the presence of low concentrations of substrate (i.e.<10-fold molar excess of eIF2·GDP to eIF2(αP)) but at higher substrate concentrations the inhibition caused by eIF2(αP) is negligible (15Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that eIF2(αP) is acting as a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α plays a critical role in the general control response in S. cerevisiae. Starvation of S. cerevisiae for any one of at least 10 amino acids leads to phosphorylation of eIF2α and increased translation of the mRNA coding for the transcription factor GCN4 (reviewed in Refs. 6Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and 7Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The latter effect is dependent upon the presence of eIF2B (reviewed in Refs. 7Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar and 17Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been suggested that three of the five subunits of eIF2B are involved in recognition of the phosphorylation status of eIF2α. In particular, deletion of eIF2Bα has no effect on cellular growth under nonstarvation conditions (18Cigan A.M. Foiani M. Hannig E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3217-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, eIF2Bα is required for induction of GCN4 translation under amino acid starvation conditions (19Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243-272Google Scholar) and the induction of GCN4 is dependent upon phosphorylation of eIF2α (20Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of eIF2Bα reduces the growth-inhibitory effect of high level eIF2 phosphorylation catalyzed by overexpression of the human double-stranded RNA-activated eIF2α protein kinase, PKR (21Dever T.E. Chen J.-J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A more recent study has identified point mutations in the α-subunit of eIF2B that are even more effective than deletion of the subunit in reversing the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation on translation and growth (4Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the primary function of the α-subunit of eIF2B is to mediate the inhibitory effects of eIF2α phosphorylation on exchange activity. The yeast eIF2B β- and δ-subunits exhibit regions of amino acid sequence similarity to eIF2Bα (22Bushman J.L. Asuru A.I. Matts R.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting that these other two subunits might also be involved in regulating the activity of eIF2B in response to eIF2α phosphorylation. In support of this suggestion, overexpression in yeast of the eIF2B α-, β-, and δ-subunits together results in formation of a stable subcomplex in vivowhose presence neutralizes the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation on translation (5Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was proposed that this subcomplex can sequester eIF2(αP) and permit native five-subunit eIF2B to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange on unphosphorylated eIF2. In addition, point mutations have been identified in both the β- and δ-subunits of yeast eIF2B that result in the expression of the same phenotype as is observed in cells in which eIF2Bα has been deleted, i.e.phosphorylation of eIF2α does not result in increased translation of GCN4 (4Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3208-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, eIF2B activity has not been measured in extracts of S. cerevisiae deprived of amino acids and the mechanism involved in the putative change is still speculative. The mutations identified in yeast eIF2B α-, β-, and δ-subunits could lead to the observed phenotype through several distinct mechanisms. For example, the mutations could lead to an overall increase in the specific activity of eIF2B, be permissive for guanine nucleotide exchange using phosphorylated eIF2 as substrate, or decrease the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2α(P) such that it is no longer a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B. In the present study, rat eIF2B lacking the α-subunit had the same specific activity as the wild-type protein. Although the specific activity of eIF2B(δ*) could not be directly measured, the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange was similar in extracts of Sf9 cells expressing the five wild-type eIF2B subunits and cells expressing a mutant form of the δ-subunit in combination with the remaining four wild-type subunits. Assuming that the catalytic properties of yeast eIF2B are similar to the rat protein, the results suggest that the phenotype observed in yeast lacking eIF2Bα or expressing mutant forms of eIF2Bδ in response to increased eIF2α phosphorylation is not a result of an overall increase in the specific activity of eIF2B. In addition, the results of the present study suggest that, although wild-type eIF2B can catalyze GDP exchange using eIF2(αP) as substrate and eIF2B(−α) catalyzes GDP exchange using eIF2(αP) as substrate at a faster rate than wild-type eIF2B, the difference in rate observed between wild-type eIF2B and eIF2B(−α) using eIF2(αP) as substrate may not be sufficient to account for the phenotype observed in yeast in response to phosphorylation of eIF2α. In contrast, both eIF2B(−α) and eIF2B(δ*) appear to be completely resistant to inhibition by eIF2(αP) when the proteins are incubated with eIF2(αP) prior to assay using unphosphorylated eIF2 as substrate. This result suggests that the affinity for eIF2(αP) is significantly less for the mutant forms of eIF2B than for the wild-type protein. In summary, the present study provides the first biochemical demonstration that both the α- and δ-subunits of eIF2B play important roles in regulating the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the protein in response to phosphorylation of eIF2α. In particular, eIF2B lacking the α-subunit or containing a mutant form of the δ-subunit is completely resistant to inhibition by eIF2(αP). Finally, lack of the α-subunit allows for faster GDP exchange using eIF2(αP)·[3H]GDP as substrate. We acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Lynne Hugendubler."
https://openalex.org/W1985759771,"To understand what processes contribute to the agonist-induced internalization of subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, we analyzed the role of arrestins. Whereas the m2 mAChR has been shown to undergo augmented internalization when arrestins 2 and 3 are overexpressed (Pals-Rylaarsdam, R., Gurevich, V. V., Lee, K. B., Ptasienski, J. A., Benovic, J. L., and Hosey, M. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23682–23689), the agonist-induced internalization of m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs was unchanged when arrestins 2 or 3 were overexpressed in transiently transfected HEK-tsA201 cells. Furthermore, when a dominant-negative arrestin was used to interrupt endogenous arrestin function, there was no change in the internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR whereas the internalization of the β2 adrenergic receptor was completely blocked. Wild-type and GTPase-deficient dominant-negative dynamin were used to determine which endocytic machinery played a role in the endocytosis of the subtypes of mAChRs. Interestingly, when dynamin function was blocked by overexpression of the GTPase-deficient dynamin, agonist- induced internalization of the the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs was suppressed. These results suggested that the internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs occurs via an arrestin-independent but dynamin-dependent pathway. To ascertain whether domains that confer arrestin sensitivity and dynamin insensitivity could be functionally exchanged between subtypes of mAChRs, chimeric m2/m3 receptors were analyzed for their properties of agonist-induced internalization. The results demonstrated that the third intracellular loop of the m2 mAChR conferred arrestin sensitivity and dynamin insensitivity to the arrestin-insensitive, dynamin-sensitive m3 mAChR while the analogous domain of the m3 mAChR conferred arrestin resistance and dynamin sensitivity to the previously arrestin-sensitive, dynamin-insensitive m2 mAChR.

Sequestration or internalization is a process that participates in the agonist-dependent regulation of many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPR, G-protein-coupled receptor; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NMS,N-[3H]methylscopolamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.

Within seconds to minutes of agonist exposure, many different types of GPRs are phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner, which leads to receptor/G-protein uncoupling and consequent desensitization of the receptors. Subsequently, certain GPRs are sequestered (internalized) away from their normal membrane environment. While certain receptors are reversibly sequestered and recycled back to the cell surface (3Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), others are targeted to lysosomes and degraded (4Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, sequestration may play different roles for different GPRs. For example, sequestration has been demonstrated to play a key role in the resensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor following desensitization (5Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C.

The mAChRs are members of the GPR superfamily (7Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 8Kubo T. Maeda A. Sugimoto K.

The m2 receptor has been used as a model of a Gi-linked receptor to understand the mechanisms underlying GPR regulation (15Hosey M.M. DebBurman S.K. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Richardson R.M. Benovic J.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 169-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has studied the regulation of the m2 mAChR subtype and has found that the receptor undergoes agonist-dependent phosphorylation, desensitization, and sequestration (16Debburman S.K.

Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that have been shown to play a role in regulating receptor desensitization and, more recently, to also participate in internalization (1Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H.

Arrestins show specificity for binding to activated, phosphorylated receptors (21Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). There are four cloned arrestin family members. Arrestin 1 or visual arrestin is found predominantly in the retina and acts by preventing light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin from interacting with transducin (22Palczewski K. Smith W.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Arrestin 2 (β-arrestin) and arrestin 3 (β-arrestin 2) regulate the interaction of non-visual GPRs with their G-proteins (1Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). X- or C-arrestin is a cone-specific arrestin isoform (23Sakuma H. Inana G. Murakami A. Higashide T. McLaren M.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, studies have shown that arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 can facilitate internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (19Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Arrestin facilitates the internalization of these GPRs by binding to clathrin and acting as an adapter to bring the GPRs to clathrin-coated pits for subsequent endocytosis (19Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). The process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been shown to require the protein dynamin, a GTPase-containing protein which oligomerizes and acts to pinch off the neck of the invaginated clathrin-coated pits (27Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar,28Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression of a GTPase-deficient dominant-negative dynamin, endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor has been shown to be inhibited (29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence has shown that some GPRs may also internalize in a dynamin-independent manner. The angiotensin II receptor (29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and the m2 mAChR (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have been shown to undergo agonist-dependent internalization in HEK293 cells even when dynamin-dependent endocytosis is blocked. Interestingly, overexpression of arrestin 2 or 3 in HEK293 cells, COS cells, or JEG-3 cells can direct a fraction of m2 mAChRs to follow an arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

These results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms that can contribute to the regulation of the m2 mAChR and that different mechanisms may predominate in different cell types. The present study seeks to identify the modes of internalization utilized by other members of the mAChR family, namely the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes.

The control conditions in each experiment were cells transfected with the receptor construct tested and empty vector (see figure legends). To measure the changes in the numbers of muscarinic receptors present on the cell surface as a function of time of agonist exposure, the hydrophilic radioligand, [3H]NMS, was used. One day post-transfection, cells from 100-mm plates were passed to 60-mm plates for use on the following day. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mmcarbachol (mAChR) or 10 μm isoproterenol (β2-adrenergic receptor) for 1 h at 37 °C. These cells were then washed with 5 × 3 ml of ice-cold PBS at 4 °C. The cells were removed from the plates with ice-cold Hepes-buffered DMEM and incubated with 2 nm [3H]NMS for 2 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10 μm atropine. For the β2-adrenergic receptor, internalization was measured as the reduction of binding sites for 10 nm [3H]CGP-12177 and nonspecific binding was defined as the binding observed in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

Assays were performed for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein assays were performed to correct for any differences in cell number between plates. Expression of arrestins and HA-tagged dynamin constructs were analyzed by Western blotting. In brief, 100 μg of protein from whole cell lysates was loaded onto SDS-acrylamide 8% gels and run at 60 mA constant current. The gels were then transferred overnight onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were used at concentrations as described in the text and were diluted in milk/TBS and incubated with the filters for at least 1 h at room temperature and in some cases overnight at 4 °C. Blots were rinsed in TBS and then incubated with secondary antibody. Secondary antibody was used at a concentration of 1:2000 in milk/TBS for 1–2 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect expressed proteins. The detection reagents were obtained from Pierce, and the film was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. To elucidate the role arrestins may play in the sequestration of subtypes of mAChRs, we transiently transfected HEK293-tsA201 cells with either the m1, m3, or m4 mAChRs, in the presence or absence of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3. Western blotting was performed to confirm that the arrestins were expressed (Fig.1 A). As previously demonstrated, expression of arrestins was increased approximately 150 times above that of endogenous arrestin levels (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with the agonist carbachol (1 mm) for 1 h, and the number of receptors remaining at the cell surface was measured using a saturating concentration (2 nm) of the hydrophilic ligand [3H]NMS. In the control cells (not overexpressing arrestin 2 or arrestin 3), each mAChR internalized as a consequence of agonist exposure (Fig. 1, B-D). Suprisingly, overexpression of either arrestin 2 or 3 had no effect on the internalization of the m1, m3, or m4 mAChR (Fig. 1, B-D). In the absence of overexpressed arrestins, the m1 mAChR internalized to 31 ± 2.8%, while in the presence of arrestins 2 or 3, the m1 mAChR internalized to 31 ± 8.8% or 31 ± 5.0%, respectively (Fig.1 B). The same pattern was observed for the m3 and m4 mAChR subtypes (Fig. 1, C and D). The m3 mAChR, when expressed alone, internalized 24 ± 3.7%, and in the presence of arrestin 2 or 3, internalization occurred to similar levels (30 ± 3.4% and 29 ± 3.5%, respectively) (Fig. 1 C). Internalization of the m4 mAChR alone was 34 ± 5.0%. When in the presence of arrestins 2 and 3, the m4 mAChR internalized to levels of 37 ± 4.1% and 38 ± 6.4%, respectively (Fig.1 D). Overexpression of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 has been shown to increase the ability of the m2 mAChR and the β2-adrenergic receptor to internalize under the same conditions used here (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain the inability of overexpressed arrestins to increase the internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs is that endogenous arrestins, although expressed at low levels (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), may be sufficient to mediate internalization of these mAChR subtypes. This idea led us to ask whether the endogenous arrestins within these cells were mediating the internalization of the subtypes. We next performed experiments using a dominant-negative arrestin, arrestin 2-(319–418), which binds to clathrin constitutively and blocks the internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (34Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected tsA cells expressing the β2-adrenergic receptor, m1, m3, or m4 mAChR in the presence or absence of arrestin 2-(319–418) were analyzed. Co-transfection of the arrestin 2-(319–418) construct was verified using immunoblot analysis with an antibody that recognizes the 15 amino acids at the C terminus of arrestin 2 (34Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, top). Expression of arrestin 2-(319–418) completely blocked the internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 2). However, under identical conditions, the internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs was not significantly reduced (Fig. 2). These data, together with the data presented in Fig. 1, suggested that the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs may internalize in an arrestin-independent manner, and conceivably that a novel pathway may serve to regulate the internalization of the mAChR subtypes. Because the mAChR subtypes described above appeared to internalize in an arrestin-independent manner, we postulated that the mAChR subtypes, like the m2 mAChR, may use an alternate endocytic machinery to the classical clathrin-dependent pathway to internalize. As a first step to test this possibility, we used strategies that interrupted dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Upon overexpression of a GTPase-deficient dynamin, dynaminK44A(dynK44A), clathrin-coated pits are unable to undergo fission, and proteins within the pit remain accessible to the external environment (37De Camilli P. Takei K. McPherson P.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression of the dominant-negative dynamin, we observed a complete inhibition in the ability of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes to internalize (Fig. 3,A, B, and C). Overexpression of wild-type dynamin had no significant effect on the m3 and m4 mAChR subtypes, although the overexpression of wild-type dynamin caused an unexplained partial inhibition of internalization of the m1 mAChR (Fig.3 A). These results led us to conclude that the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs utilize a dynamin-dependent, but arrestin-independent pathway to internalize. The experiments described above demonstrate that internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes could not be augmented by overexpression of arrestin 2 or 3, but could be blocked when dominant-negative dynamin is overexpressed. However, previous studies have demonstrated that arrestin 2 or 3 increased the extent of the internalization of the m2 mAChR and that a GTPase-deficient dynamin had no effect on m2 mAChR internalization (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To understand if the intracellular third loop of the m2 mAChR contains the determinants necessary for dynamin-independent endocytosis, chimeric m2/m3 receptors were used and analyzed for their ability to internalize in the presence and absence of overexpressed wild-type and dominant-negative dynamin (Fig. 4). The Hy9 chimera is an m2 mAChR containing an i3 loop entirely derived from the m3 mAChR, whereas the Hy10 chimera is an m3 mAChR with the i3 loop of the m2 mAChR (36Lechleiter J. Hellmiss R. Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Prealta E.G. EMBO J. 1990; 13: 4381-4390Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As described previously (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the m2 mAChR was unaffected when wild-type or dominant-negative dynamin was overexpressed (compare 45 ± 2.5% versus 32 ± 7.8% or 33 ± 1.4% internalization of the m2 mAChR aloneversus in the presence of wild-type or dominant-negative dynamin, respectively)(Fig. 4). When the Hy9 chimera was expressed alone, it internalized to 39 ± 5.0% (Fig. 4). Although overexpression of the wild-type dynamin had no effect on the ability of the Hy9 chimera to internalize, overexpression of the dominant-negative dynamin inhibited the internalization of the Hy9 chimeric receptor (36 ± 2.6% versus 15 ± 6.1% in the presence of wild-type versus dominant-negative dynamin, respectively). Interestingly, when the third loop of the m2 receptor was placed onto the body of the m3 mAChR (the Hy10 chimera), overexpression of dominant-negative dynamin had no effect on the ability of the Hy10 receptor to internalize (39 ± 7.4%, Hy10 alone versus34 ± 7.4% and 41 ± 2.8% in the presence of overexpressed wild-type and dominant-negative dynamin, respectively). This was in marked contrast to the wild-type m3 mAChR (Fig. 3 B). In all cases, overexpression of the dynamins was verified by Western blot (data not shown). Because it was possible to switch the dynamin sensitivity of the m3 mAChR to the previously dynamin-insensitive m2 mAChR, we postulated that the arrestin sensitivity could be switched as well. The third intracellular (i3) loop of the m2 mAChR has been shown to be important in mediating interaction with arrestins (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when specific sites of phosphorylation were removed from this domain, the ability of the m2 mAChR to interact with arrestins was lost, suggesting that the i3 loop plays an important role in regulating arrestin binding in vivo and in vitro (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we again used the Hy9 and Hy10 chimeras (36Lechleiter J. Hellmiss R. Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Prealta E.G. EMBO J. 1990; 13: 4381-4390Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These receptors were expressed in tsA201 cells alone or with arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 (Fig. 5). Cells expressing the m2 mAChR alone internalized 33 ± 4.4% after a 60-min exposure to 1 mm carbachol. Co-expression with arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 increased m2 mAChR internalization to 76 ± 4.3% and 69 ± 1%, respectively. Interestingly, when the i3 loop of the m2 mAChR was replaced with the i3 loop of the m3 mAChR (Hy9 receptor), the extent of internalization of the chimera was similar to the wild-type m2 mAChR; however, overexpression of either arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 did not enhance internalization (compare 39 ± 4.8% versus46 ± 1% or 39 ± 9.7% with arrestin 2 or 3, respectively). Studies with the reciprocal chimera, Hy10, indicated that the m3 mAChR containing the i3 loop from the m2 mAChR was able to respond to overexpressed arrestin 2 or 3 (compare 33 ± 6.7%versus 59 ± 8.5% or 65 ± 6.3% with arrestin 2 or 3, respectively), in marked contrast to the behavior of the wild-type m3 mAChR (Fig. 1 C). These results indicated that the region of the m2 mAChR that confers sensitivity to arrestin is found predominantly within the i3 loop and can convert a non-arrestin-sensitive receptor into an arrestin-sensitive receptor. The data presented in this study demonstrate that the agonist-induced internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes occurs via an arrestin-independent pathway. Overexpression of arrestins 2 and 3 had no effect on the agonist-induced internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs. Furthermore, when endogenous arrestin proteins were inhibited from interacting with clathrin by overexpression of a dominant-negative arrestin construct (34Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs were still able to internalize even under conditions where the β2-adrenergic receptor was inhibited (Fig. 2). These results suggested that the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR receptors do not use endogenous arrestins to internalize and are insensitive to overexpression of arrestins 2 and 3. On the other hand, when dynamin-dependent endocytosis was blocked by overexpression of dynK44A, the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes were unable to internalize (Fig. 2, A, B, and C) suggesting that a dynamin-dependent pathway is used for subtype internalization. Thus, it appears that the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes utilize an arrestin-independent but dynamin-dependent pathway of internalization. We cannot rule out that an unidentified arrestin may be interacting with the receptors that is insensitive to the dominant-negative arrestin construct used here. Perhaps a more definitive approach would be to utilize antisense or ribozyme technologies to inhibit the expression of all endogenous arrestins. It is possible that the lack of inhibition by the dominant-negative arrestin on m1, m3, and m4 mAChR internalization could be due to a poor co-transfection efficiency; however, it should be noted that the internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor was completely inhibited under identical conditions. The present results provide new insights into previously unappreciated differences in mAChR subtypes. While it appears that the m2 mAChR can utilize arrestin-independent and -dependent pathways for internalization (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes examined in these studies did not utilize arrestins for their agonist-induced internalization. Interestingly, in the absence of overexpressed arrestins, the m2 mAChR also internalized via an arrestin-independent pathway, but this pathway is also dynamin-independent (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple pathways appear to be used to achieve internalization of subtypes of mAChR in response to agonist stimulation. The present results suggest that arrestins do not appear to play a major role in mediating the internalization of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes; however it is still possible that arrestins may play a role in uncoupling these receptors from G-proteins, i.e. in rapid desensitization. Future studies will examine the possible role of arrestins in mAChR subtype desensitization and the role internalization plays in mAChR subtype signaling and desensitization. The present studies demonstrated that it is possible to switch the machinery utilized in receptor endocytosis. While the m2 mAChR internalized in a predominantly dynamin-independent manner, when the i3 loop from the dynamin-dependent m3 mAChR was placed onto the body of the m2 mAChR, the resulting chimera was unable to endocytose in the presence of dominant-negative dynamin (Fig. 4). The converse receptor, the Hy10 chimera, was insensitive to overexpressed dominant-negative dynamin. These results indicated that the i3 loop of the m2 mAChR contains an important domain (not found in the m3 mAChR) which mediates interaction with a component of dynamin-independent internalization machinery. The results also suggested that the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs utilize a different mechanism to internalize in tsA201 cells than the m2 mAChR. The portion of the m2 mAChR that interacts with arrestins 2 and 3 is likely to reside within the third intracellular loop of the m2 mAChR since chimeric m2 receptors lacking this domain were unable to internalize in an arrestin-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Furthermore, transfer of the i3 domain of the m2 mAChR to the m3 mAChR allowed the latter receptor to become arrestin-sensitive (Fig. 5). The i3 loop has been shown to play important roles in m2 mAChR regulation (17Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

The m1 and m3 mAChRs have been shown to contain important domains regulating their internalization within their i3 loops (38Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J. Sadee W. J. Biol.

Recently, our laboratory has identified certain key elements that contribute to the interaction of arrestins with the m2 mAChR (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A.

The m2 mAChR contains 2 clusters of serine/threonine residues located within the i3 loop (7Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R.

Removal of the serine/threonine (S/T) cluster at the N-terminal region (NAla-4) of the i3 loop had little effect on receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization (18Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, removal of the S/T cluster at the C-terminal region of the m2 i3 loop (CAla-4) produced a receptor that was unable to desensitize but still able to undergo phosphorylation and internalization (18Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The CAla-4 mutant was also unable to interact with arrestin (30Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

This indicated that a specific domain in the m2 mAChR was necessary to allow for arrestin interaction. Interestingly, the m1, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes tested here have similar clusters within their i3 loops. At present, little is known about the factors that are important in the regulation of the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs. Future studies will concentrate on determining if these receptors are regulated by phosphorylation, and if so, what role phosphorylation plays in the regulation of these receptors. In summary, the results presented here suggest that the m1, m3, and m4 mAChRs are internalized in an arrestin-independent manner via a dynamin-sensitive process. The data also suggest that the i3 loop of the m3 mAChR either lacks an arrestin binding domain or contains an inhibitory domain that precludes arrestin binding. The lack of effect of arrestins on the receptors studied here provide impetus to studies designed to elucidate the factors that do contribute to the regulation of these GPRs."

It has been suggested to form a ternary signaling complex with protein kinase Cα and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Syndecans each have a unique, central, and variable (V) region in their cytoplasmic domains, and that of syndecan-4 is critical to its interaction with protein kinase C and PIP2. Two oligopeptides corresponding to the variable region (4V) and whole domain (4L) of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain were synthesized for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. Data from NMR and circular dichroism indicate that the cytoplasmic domain undergoes a conformational transition and forms a symmetric dimer in the presence of phospholipid activator PIP2. The solution conformations of both free and PIP2-complexed 4V have been determined by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and dynamical simulated annealing calculations. The 4V peptide in the presence of PIP2 formed a compact dimer with two twisted strands packed parallel to each other and the exposed surface of the dimer consisted of highly charged and polar residues. The overall three-dimensional structure in solution exhibits a twisted clamp shape having a cavity in the center of dimeric interface. In addition, it has been observed that the syndecan-4V strongly interacts not only with fatty acyl groups but also the anionic head group of PIP2. These findings reveal that PIP2 promotes oligomerization of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain for transmembrane signaling and cell-matrix adhesion.

Cell adhesion mediated by cell surface receptors triggers signal transduction cascades. Integrins, which are well characterized transmembrane receptors, are known to be involved in several cell regulatory mechanism including cell proliferation, morphology, and motility. During cell-matrix interaction, integrin clustering activates tyrosine kinases (1Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo D.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J.

The specific interactions of the cytoplasmic domain of each integrin member are critical to trigger the downstream signal cascades. Although the functions of these interactions are not clear, some kinases such as focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase, and structural proteins such as α-actinin, talin, and filamin, are known to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β1integrin subunit. The four mammalian syndecans are type I glycoproteins that form dimers or higher order multimers. Oligomerization apparently involves their highly homologous transmembrane domains as well as regions of their cytoplasmic domains (12Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Syndecan-4 is the only family member that is a widespread focal adhesion component, potentially functioning as a coreceptor in integrin-mediated adhesion. It readily forms oligomers that may be required for its function (12Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) plays important roles in signal transduction, since PIP2 is hydrolyzed by phospholipase Cγ to generate two intracellular messengers: inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which mobilizes Ca2+, and diacylglycerol, which is a physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (15Asaoka Y.

However, in addition to its function as precursor for other second messenger, PIP2may also act as a second messenger by directly or indirectly regulating several proteins including PKC, phospholipase Cδ, phospholipase Cγ, G protein-coupled receptor kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. PIP2 binds the cytoskeletal proteins gelsolin, profilin, and vinculin and regulates their interaction with actin (20Sun H. Lin K. Yin H.L. J.

Recently, some β1integrin cytoplasmic domains have been demonstrated to affect phosphatidylinositol 4,5-kinase, possibly regulating PIP2synthesis in vivo (24Hinchlitte K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is known that PIP2 is accumulated in the cytoplasmic face of plasma membrane during cell adhesion and it may be regulated by G-proteins such as Rac and Rho, which may activate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-kinase (26Tolias K.F.

Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PIP2 is also known to be involved in focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (3Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), probably through its interactions with focal adhesion components such as vinculin, α-actinin, and syndecan-4. Focal adhesion formation is dependent not only on integrins, but syndecans (most likely syndecan-4), which may act as co-receptors (2Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar,8Woods A. Couchman J.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 313: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that syndecan and PKC are involved in the focal adhesion formation, and syndecan-4 regulates the distribution and activity of classical PKC (cPKC). In addition, it has been suggested the interaction of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain and cPKC depends on cPKC activity. Recently, we have reported that PIP2 interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4, and together with PIP2, syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain potentiated PKC activity (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was also shown that PIP2 regulates the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 with PKCα and potentiation activity of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain on PKCα (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As we suggested previously, syndecan-4 and PIP2 together with PKC may form a ternary complex. PKC is activated through this complex, which may then phosphorylate cytoplasmic proteins involved in focal adhesion formation. Here, we present the solution structures of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic core domain both with and without activator PIP2 by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and dynamical simulated annealing calculations. Peptides of both the whole domain with RMKKKDEGSYDLGKKPIYKKAPTNEFYA sequence corresponding to residues 170–197 (4L) and the variable region with LGKKPIYKKA corresponding to residues 181–190 (4V) of the chicken syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain were synthesized using an improved version of the solid phase method on a model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The peptide sequences are identical to those of human and rat syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography using a Vydac 218TP152050 C18 column on a Waters Delta Prep 4000 system. Purification was achieved by equilibrating the column with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and developing with a linear gradient of acetonitrile. The free peptide samples for NMR measurements were prepared by dissolving in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 99.9% D2O solution at pH value of 7.4 with 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer. The final peptide concentration was 2–4 mm in 0.5 ml of buffer solution. PIP2 was purchased from Sigma. For NMR measurements of PIP2-peptide complex, 10–50 μl of concentrated PIP2 solution was titrated to free peptide up to a maximum ratio of 1:1 (PIP2:peptide). The final pH value of 7.0 was adjusted by adding 0.1 n HCl solution before NMR experiments. CD data were collected on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using 1.0-mm path length cells with scan speed of 500 mm/min, 1-nm bandwidth, and 32 accumulations. Both free and PIP2-complexed samples of 4L and 4V peptides were prepared as volumes of 8 μm in H2O solution, and CD data were collected for temperatures ranges of 20–70 °C. A standard noise reduction procedure was used to prepare final spectrum. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer in quadrature detection mode equipped with an SGI INDY computer. All data were collected at either 10 °C or 20 °C, and the strong solvent resonance was suppressed by water-gated pulse sequence combined with pulsed-field gradient pulses. The temperature was calibrated using a methanol standard (29Van Geet A.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 679-680Crossref Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 30Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). A series of one-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded for both 4V and 4L peptide with concentration ranges of 0–2 mm PIP2. All of the two-dimensional NMR measurements were performed on both free and peptide-PIP2 (2:1) samples based on results from PIP2 titration analysis. Mixing times of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 800 ms were used in collecting NOE spectra for both free and PIP2 complex samples. Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) data were also recorded in both H2O and D2O solutions with a mixing time of 78 ms using MLEV17 spin lock pulses(30). Double quantum-filtered (DQF) COSY spectra (31Rance M. Soerensen O.W. Bodehausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) were collected in H2O solution. All data were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the time proportional phase incrementation method (32Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) with 2048 data points in the acquisition domain and 512 or 256 in the time domain. Two-dimensional NOESY (33Macura S. Ernst R.R. Mol. Phys. 1980; 41: 95Crossref Scopus (1583) Google Scholar) experiments were also performed to identify slowly exchanging amide hydrogens on a freshly prepared D2O solution after lyophilization of an H2O sample. Small flexible linear peptides such as 4V have relatively short correlation times compared with globular proteins. As a result, longer mixing times or rotating frame Overhauser effect spin lock times are typically needed before NOE or rotating frame Overhauser effect cross-peaks begin to build up in the spectrum. From the NOESY growth curve, we have ascertained that spin-diffusion effects are not significant even for 600–800-ms mixing times. The interesting cross-peaks observed in the NOESY spectra are due to direct effects since no other cross-peaks from protons that could mediate the intensity through spin diffusion were observed in the spectra. Long mixing times in the range of 400–800 ms have typically been used for small peptides. All NMR data were processed using nmrPipe (Biosym/Molecular Simulations Inc.) or Bruker XWIN-NMR (Bruker Instruments) software on SGI Indigo2 workstation. Prior to Fourier transformation in thet 1 dimension (34Otting G. Widmer H. Wagner G. Wuthrich K. Magn. Reson. 1988; 66: 187-193Google Scholar), the first row was half-weighted to suppress t 1 ridges. The DQF-COSY data were processed to 8192 × 1024 data matrices to obtain a maximum digital resolution for coupling constant measurements. The proton chemical shifts were referenced with internal sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane 1-sulfonate. All calculations were performed for syndecan-4V using XPLOR 3.1 (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, Inc) on an SGI Indigo2 workstation using the topology and parameter files of topallhdg.pro and parallhdg.pro. Monomer 4V structures were generated with random backbone dihedral angles and used as starting structures for simulated annealing (SA) calculations (35Nilges M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 36Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 37Nilges M.

Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) was also used for symmetric dimer generations with minor modifications described by Leeet al. (39Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) as follows. Symmetric dimers were generated by duplications of the random coordinates. The combined use of XPLOR noncrystallographic symmetry and symmetry pseudo-NOE term were served to satisfy monomer symmetry as described by Nilges (35Nilges M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The modeling protocol used by us consists of two separate stages: (i) initial and extensive regulation and (ii) simulated annealing and refinement. Regulation procedures were cycled twice to satisfy both experimental constraints and noncrystallographic symmetry parameters, followed by simulated annealing and refinement. The potential energy function consisted of covalent, repulsion, NOE, and torsional angle terms. The target function forms of NOE and torsional angles are the same as used by Driscoll et al. (40Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Beress L. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A total of 116 distance restraints and 16 torsional angle constraints were used for structural calculations. All NOEs were classified and converted to distance constraints as strong (1.8–2.7 Å), medium (1.8–3.3 Å), and weak (1.8–5.0 Å) based on their intensities of NOESY spectrum. Corrections for pseudoatom representations were used for non-stereo specifically assigned methylene, methyl group, and tyrosine ring protons (32Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle restraints were derived from measured3JHN-Hα coupling constants in DQF-COSY spectra in H2O solution (41Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T. Go N. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 42Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The structure of 4V·PIP2 complex was generated with Insight II (Biosym/Molecular Simulation Inc.) based on intermolecular NOE data of two-dimensional NOESY spectrum. The CD spectra of the 4V peptide (sequence LGKKPIYKKA) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C were consistent with a random coil characteristics (43Yang J.T. Wu C.-S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). However, the CD spectra obtained from 4V peptide complexed with PIP2were different from that of peptide alone, having a small positive mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. The same spectral changes of 4L peptide were observed in the presence of PIP2. The CD data suggested that the structural transitions of both peptides were occurred in the presence of PIP2. Fig.1 shows that the positive ellipticity intensity of 4V·PIP2 complex at 222 nm decreased gradually at temperature ranges of 20–60 °C, indicating a slow process of dissociation. The one-dimensional proton NMR spectra of both 4V and 4L peptides are shown in Fig. 2. The spectra have demonstrated that both peptides produced considerable changes in the whole peptide resonance as well as in linewidths of resonance throughout PIP2 titration. In particular, 4L peptide experiences a severe aggregation at ratio of 8:6 (4V:PIP2) (Fig. 2,B, d). There are only single glycine, tyrosine, and alanine residues in the 4V peptide sequence. Glycine was easily identified by the distinctive fingerprint pattern in the H2O COSY spectra, and the lone alanine residue was identified from connectivities in TOCSY spectra by its characteristic methyl resonance. One AMX spin system from the tyrosine residue was easily identified in TOCSY spectra. These preliminary resonance assignments served as starting points for the sequence-specific assignment procedure (44Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Sequential resonance assignments were made based on two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra in 90% H2O, 10% D2O solution. Sequential assignments for the backbone protons were completed by following dαN connectivities from NH-CαH COSY cross-peaks of previously identified amino acids. The side-chain proton chemical shifts were completed by TOCSY connectivities. The resonances of PIP2 were identified from the previously published chemical shifts (45Reid D.G. Gajjar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7967-7972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PIP2titration procedure (Fig. 2). Some of the PIP2 resonance signals in 4V·PIP2 complex were assigned from proton one-dimensional spectrum, followed by PIP2 titration to 4V. Since most of PIP2 resonances were severely overlapped with peptide signals, PIP2 chemical shifts were identified from all assigned peptide resonances in two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra. All these sequential and medium NOE connectivities for both free and complex are summarized in Fig.3. Most of the NOEs shown in Fig. 3 were measured at mixing times of 100–400 ms. For 4L peptide, since the backbone NMR resonances were severely overlapped due to 7 lysine residues in the sequence, not all NOEs from residues involved in the variable domain could be assigned completely.Figure 3Summary of the NOE connectivities identified in both free (A) and 4V·PIP2 (B) complex (peptide:PIP2 = 2:1) at 20 °C, pH 7.0 (complex) and pH 7.4 (free), respectively. Mixing times of 100–400 ms were used, and observed NOE intensities are classified by the thickness of the lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proton chemical shifts for the individual residues in free 4V peptide are in excellent agreement with the corresponding random coil values (46Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). As expected for a highly flexible peptide, NH-CαH coupling constants for all the residues are of the order of 6.5–8.0 Hz, suggesting retention of significant conformational flexibility. In addition, the sequential NOE intensities displayed a standard pattern of the preferred random coil conformation of the peptide. However, when peptide was titrated with PIP2, both the chemical shifts and NOE patterns exhibited a significant change in the entire peptide sequence indicating a structural transition (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, a number of intermolecular NOEs, which are NOEs between peptide and PIP2 and intersubunit NOEs on the 4V dimer, were observed. The aliphatic proton resonance region of the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of 4V·PIP2 is shown in Fig. 5, displaying both intersubunit and intermolecular NOEs in the complex.Figure 5600-MHz two-dimensional NOESY proton spectrum with mixing time of 400 ms in 90% H2O/10% D2O solution at 20 °C and pH value of 7.0. The spectrum are labeled with some of NOEs including intersubunit NOEs (marked as *) as well as intermolecular NOEs between PIP2 and 4V peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is of interest to compare the proton chemical shift differences between free and PIP2complex 4V. Fig. 4 shows that, whereas proton chemical shifts of the side chains showed not much changes, those of the backbone NH and CαH changed dramatically in N-terminal as well as C-terminal regions. The side-chain chemical shifts, especially Pro185 and Ile186 residues in the center of peptide, exhibited significant changes. These interesting results indicate that the 4V dimer has extensive intermolecular contacts not only at both peptide terminus but also in the middle of the peptide (Fig. 4). In addition, these results strongly suggest that, while the side-chain atoms would have close intersubunit contacts with each other in the center of peptide, the backbone atoms do so at peptide termini. The solution structures for the 4V dimer were generated using the experimental constraints described above. A total of 90 starting substructures were used in the initial stage. After two cycles of regulation protocol, 60 structures that show no constraint violations greater than 0.5 Å for distances and 5° for torsional angles were identified. Among 60 structures, the 14 lowest energy structures (〈SA〉kr) were selected for detailed analysis (Table I). The structures are well defined with a root-mean-square deviation between backbone atom coordinates of 1.05 Å for all residues. The average structure was generated from the geometrical average from 14 structure coordinates and was subjected to restrained energy minimization to correct bond length and angle distorsions. This average structure exhibited 0.59-Å root-mean-square deviation for backbone atoms with respect to 14 〈SA〉kr structures. A best fit superposition of all final structures and the backbone conformation for average restrained energy minimized structure (〈SA¯〉kr) are shown in Fig.6. The atomic average root-mean-square deviations of the final structures with respect to average restrained energy minimized structure are shown in Fig.7. A Ramachandran plot (Fig.8) indicates that φ,ψ values of all 14 final NMR structures are distributed properly in energetically acceptable regions (47Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchison E.G.

This compactness explains why 4V dimer dissociates slowly during the subunit exchange experiment as shown in Fig. 1. The exposed surface of the 4V consisted of very polar residues with basic side chains. Interestingly, the Pro185 residue that resides in the center of the cytoplasmic core has been shown to play a key role for twisted dimeric formation. No standard regular secondary structural elements were observed, as shown in Fig. 1. However, each monomer conformation exhibits similar to that of extended form with both N and C termini with kink. Strikingly, the overall three-dimensional structure of the 4V in solution demonstrates a twisted clamp shape having a cavity in the center of dimeric twist (Fig.6 C). A number of NOE contacts between 4V and PIP2 have been observed, which are NOEs between Pro185 ring protons of 4V and head group protons of PIP2, Ile186CδH3 methyl group of 4V and fatty acyl group of PIP2, and CγH2 of Lys188 and olefinic protons of PIP2. These NOEs strongly suggest that both anionic head group and fatty acyl side chain of PIP2 have close contacts with center of the peptide. Table II summarizes NOEs between 4V and PIP2. Especially, a possible hydrogen bond between phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate oxygen and Lys188εNH3+ of 4V was observed from modeling structure based on NMR data. Fig. 9 shows the averaged energy-minimized solution structure of 4V complexed with PIP2. The 4V dimer grips PIP2 having interactions with both head group and fatty acyl chains of PIP2. The solution structure clearly reveals that side chains of cytoplasmic core residues play an important role for PIP2 binding.Table IIIntermolecular NOEs between 4V peptide and PIP2PIP24V2-aNOEs are classified as s (strong), m (medium), and w (weak) at mixing times of 100–400 ms at 25 °C.

The numbering of PIP2 is based on IUPAC nomenclature. Open table in a new tab It has been suggested that the syndecan core proteins, which are highly conserved among the syndecan family, exhibit a propensity to form non-covalently linked dimers and higher order oligomers (12Oh E.-S.

It is also well known that oligomer formation is essential in protein kinase C interaction and activation (12Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that SDS-resistant multimerization of syndecan-4 core protein correlates with PKC regulatory activity and variable region unique to syndecan-4 (4V) could potentiate phospholipid-induced activation of PKCαβγ (12Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that a central penta-peptide KPIYK sequence is necessary for multimerization of syndecan-4 core protein, resulting in both direct activation of PKCαβγ and phospholipid-induced activation (12Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Further, 4V or 4L peptides in the presence of PIP2 strongly activate PKCα (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The data from NMR and gel filtration clearly support the hypothesis that PIP2 induces dimerization of both 4V and 4L peptide, and the induced dimer of 4V forms a compact structure bound to PIP2 (Fig. 2). We have recently reported that the peptide of whole cytoplasmic domain (4L) displayed less tendency to oligomerize than 4V in the absence of PIP2, resulting reduced activity of 4L. This could be due to highly basic residues of the conserved (C1) region, which lies between the V region of the cytoplasmic domain and the membrane. These residues may decrease the self-association of the 4L peptide. However, very recently, we have shown that both 4V and 4L peptides exhibited essentially the same activity with respect to PIP2-mediated activation of PKC (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that the solution structure of 4L in the presence of PIP2 should resemble that of PIP2-4V complex; in other words, the molecular topology of 4L and 4V in the presence of PIP2 must be similar. Major interaction of 4V peptide with PIP2 occurs between aliphatic side chains of peptide and whole area of PIP2. No close contacts of peptide backbone to PIP2 has been observed. The other finding is that, even though PIP2 promotes association of 4V initially, further driving or stabilizing forces could be peptide-peptide interactions. The NMR structure clearly shows that peptide backbones of each monomer consists of intertwined circular shape and side chains provide additional stabilizing forces by hydrophobic interactions from an outward position. Surprisingly, two extended monomers form a quite stable twisted dimeric conformation, even if there is no hydrogen bonds between monomers. Since the calculated 14 structures (〈SA〉kr) based on NMR constraints exhibited a good convergence, we conclude that the 4V dimer has a stable and unique conformation in solution state in the presence of PIP2. This was also confirmed by melting experimental data based on circular dichroism (Fig. 1) and NMR linewidth analysis at temperature ranges of 20–70 °C (data not shown). We have recently demonstrated that 4V peptides of altered sequence have much reduced ability to regulate PKCα activity (12Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was suggested that substitution of Lys184, Lys188, Pro185, and Ile186 compromised both oligomerization and cPKC activation. The data here support this hypothesis, showing that all these residues take part in monomer-monomer interactions. Our previous data also showed that, while replacement of Tyr187 with phenylalanine had a profound effect on PKC activation, it had the least effect on dimer formation. This is in very good agreement with solution structure analysis. Tyr187 appears not to be involved in oligomerization of 4V, and we hypothesize that since its side chain is mostly solvent-exposed, the hydroxyl group may be critical for contact with, and activation of, PKC. Structural studies of the 4V·PIP2·PKCα ternary complex will provide this important information.

The expression of tissue transglutaminase is regulated by a variety of molecules including retinoids, interleukin-6, and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Retinoid and interleukin-6 inductions of tissue transglutaminase expression are mediated by specificcis-regulatory elements located within the first 4.0 kilobase pairs of the promoter of the gene. The present studies were designed to identify the molecular mechanisms mediating the regulation of tissue transglutaminase gene expression by TGF-β family members. Transient transfection of Mv1Lu cells with transglutaminase promoter constructs demonstrated that 0.2 nm TGF-β1 maximally induced the activation of the promoter through a 10-base pair TGF-β1 response element (TRE; GAGTTGGTGC) located 868 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. This same element mediated an inhibitory activity of TGF-β1 on the transglutaminase promoter in MC3T3 E1 cells. The TRE through which TGF-β1-regulated the activity of the transglutaminase promoter was necessary and sufficient for bone morphogenetic protein 2- (BMP) and BMP4-dependent inhibition of the tissue transglutaminase promoter. The TGF-β1, BMP2, and BMP4 regulation of the transglutaminase promoter activity was similar to the responses we observed for the endogenous transglutaminase activity of Mv1Lu and MC3T3 E1 cells. For BMP2 and BMP4, this regulation was paralleled by a decrease in tissue transglutaminase mRNA in MC3T3 E1 cells. The results of these experiments suggest that TGF-β1, BMP2, and BMP4 regulation of mouse tissue transglutaminase gene expression requires a composite TRE located in the 5′-flanking DNA.

TGF-β1 and transglutaminase activity are associated with chondrogenesis and certain forms of apoptotic cell death. A cooperative interaction between TGF-β1 and tissue transglutaminase is suggested by the observations that TGF-β1 increases tissue transglutaminase expression, and in turn, tissue transglutaminase catalyzes the conversion of latent TGF-β1 to its active form (17Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Kojima S. Vernooy R. Moscatelli D. Amanuma H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell.

The studies presented here investigated the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β1 induces the expression of tissue transglutaminase. The results of these studies demonstrate that in Mv1Lu and MC3T3 E1 cells TGF-β1 and BMP2 and BMP4 regulate the activity of the tissue transglutaminase promoter via a composite TGF-β response element (TRE) located 868 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This regulatory activity of TGF-β1 was cell-specific; in Mv1Lu cells TGF-β1 was stimulatory on the tissue transglutaminase gene promoter, and in MC3T3 E1 cells it was inhibitory. Thus, our results indicate that TGF-β-family members can regulate the transcriptional activity of tissue transglutaminase via a TRE embedded within the promoter of the gene. Mv1Lu cells, an epithelial-like cell line derived from normal mink lungs, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). MC3T3 E1 cells, a mouse preosteoblastic cell line, were a gift from Dr. Renee Franchesci (University of Cincinnati). Recombinant human TGF-β1 (rhTGF-β1) was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and recombinant human BMP2 and BMP4 were generous gifts from Genetics Institute, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The pCAT-Basic, SV2-β-gal, and pRL-SV40 vectors were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The Quick Change mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Genosys (Houston, TX). Mv1Lu cells were maintained in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. MC3T3 E1 cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. Both cell lines were cultured in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. The regulation of transglutaminase gene expression by TGF-β family members was investigated in transient transfection experiments with mouse tissue transglutaminase promoter constructs (pmTG4.0-Luc, pmTG1.8-CAT, pmTG0.2-CAT, and pmTG1.8-ΔSmaI-CAT; Fig.1 A) (8Nagy L. Saydak M. Shipley N. Lu S. Basilion J.P. Yan Z.H. Syka P. Chandraratna R.A. Stein J.P. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J. J. Biol.

PmTG1.65-CAT, pmTG1.3-CAT, and pmTG1.0-CAT were constructed using a Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to introduce a HindIII restriction site at positions −1647, −1287, and −1006, respectively, followed by excision of the DNA fragment with HindIII (−1647, −1287, or −1006 to −1842; Boehringer Mannheim) and religation with T4-DNA ligase (Boehringer Mannheim). PmTG1.8-ΔMut-CAT was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the TGF-β1 regulatory element (TRE) within pmTG1.8-CAT using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and complementary primers that converted the TTGG (5 ′ → 3 ′) tetranucleotide sequence at position −871 toCTAG. The nucleotide sequence for each of the mouse tissue transglutaminase gene promoter constructs was determined. Samples were processed according to the standard protocol for the T7 Sequenase Quick-Denature Plasmid Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following the sequencing reaction, samples were resolved using a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and a GenomyxLR programmable DNA sequencer (Genomyx Corp., Foster City, CA). Co-transfection assays with test and control plasmids were conducted using approximately 70% confluent Mv1Lu or MC3T3 E1 cells and a 12-well dish format. Mv1Lu cells were washed with serum-free Eagle's MEM prior to Lipofectin-mediated transfection (Life Technologies, Inc.) of 1 μg of test plasmid along with 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40. Cells were transfected for 3 h prior to addition of Eagle's MEM plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing treatments described within figure legends. MC3T3 E1 cells were co-transfected using 3 μg of DOSPER (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μg of test plasmid, and 0.05 μg of pRL-SV40. MC3T3 E1 cells were transfected for 6 h prior to addition of α-MEM plus 10% heat-inactivated calf serum containing treatments. Mv1Lu and MC3T3 E1 cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the treatment(s), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and cell extracts were prepared as described for enzyme assays. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was determined using the method of Gorman et al. (19Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Mv1Lu or MC3T3 E1 cells were scraped into 250 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and lysed by three rounds of freeze-thawing. The extracts were briefly centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for CAT and renilla-luciferase (LucRen) assays. Duplicate 100-μl cell extracts were incubated with 200 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, 32 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μl of 8 mmacetyl-CoA for 20 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with 300 μl of xylenes and extracted with 500 μl of ethyl acetate. 700 μl of the organic phase was removed, dried, and separated by thin layer chromatography (Whatman silica gel) in chloroform:methanol (97:3) for 1 h. Acetylated products were detected by exposure to a phosphorimaging screen and developed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Di-acetylated chloramphenicol was quantified using ImageQuant version 1.1 software (Molecular Dynamics). CAT activity was normalized to LucRen activity to correct for any difference in transfection efficiency or generalized alterations in transcription. Cells were lysed with 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 20 μl of the extract was assayed for firefly-luciferase (LucFf) activity using a Luciferase Assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. LucRen activity was determined in 20 μl of the Mv1Lu cell extract using a Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The total protein concentration of each extract was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), and luciferase activity was normalized to the total protein concentration of the cell extract. Tissue transglutaminase activity in Mv1Lu and MC3T3 E1 cell extracts was determined as described previously (20Lorand L. Campbell-Wilkes L.K. Cooperstein L. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 50: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 250 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and lysed with three cycles of freeze-thawing. Cell lysates were incubated in the presence of [3H]putrescine andN,N′-dimethylcasein. Ca2+-dependent conjugation of [3H]putrescine toN,N′-dimethylcasein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by scintillation counting. Total RNA was prepared from MC3T3 E1 cells treated with either TGF-β1, BMP2, or BMP4 according to the QIAShredder and RNeasy protocols (Qiagen, Inc., Santa Carita, CA) and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. 50 ng of total RNA from MC3T3 E1 cells was reverse-transcribed according to a standard protocol (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology) using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with an oligonucleotide primer (300 nm) for either mouse tissue transglutaminase (CCAAGATCCCTCCTCCACAT; Genosys, Houston, TX) or mouse 36B4 (ATATGAGGCAGCAGTTTCTCCAG; Genosys, Houston, TX) in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 mm dNTPs. Following reverse transcription, the cDNA product was PCR-amplified using 300 nm forward primers for either mouse tissue transglutaminase (AGACTCACGTTCGGTGCT; Genosys, Houston, TX) or human 36B4 (AGATGCAGCAGATCCGCAT; Genosys, Houston, TX) and 100 nmof an oligonucleotide probe for either tissue transglutaminase (ACCGGCCCAGATCCCAGTGAAGA; Synthetic Genetics, San Diego, CA) or mouse 36B4 (AGGCTGTGGTGCTGATGGGCAAGAAC; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (5′ and 3′, respectively). The PCR amplification was accomplished with Taq DNA-polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in an ABI Prisim 7700 “real-time” PCR analysis instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), monitoring product generation throughout each of 40 cycles. Synthetic RNA was used to generate standard concentration curves for either mouse tissue transglutaminase (20 pg to 0.2 fg) or human 36B4 (20 pg to 2 fg). The point at which the fluorescent signal rose above the background (C t; 10 S.D. above the base-line values) was used to quantitate the amount of the specified mRNA in the starting sample. Quantification of the sample template from the determinedC t was accomplished by comparison with cRNA standards run in parallel. Differences within and between data sets were determined using SigmaStat for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). One-way analysis of variance and subsequent Tukey's or Dunnett's mean separation procedure were performed at a significance level of p≤ 0.05. TGF-β1 has been reported to increase the transglutaminase activity of several cell types (14Fukuda K. Kojiro M. Chiu J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15George M.D. Vollberg T.M. Floyd E.E. Stein J.P. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11098-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the ability of TGF-β1 to regulate the activity of the tissue transglutaminase gene promoter, we co-transfected mink lung epithelial cells line, Mv1Lu, and mouse preosteoblastic cells, MC3T3 E1, with reporter constructs that included segments of the mouse tissue transglutaminase promoter linked to a reporter gene (either CAT or LucFf) and a normalization plasmid (LucRen). Following transfection, cells were treated with recombinant human TGF-β1 or control media, and 48 h later cells were lysed and assayed for reporter gene (CAT or LucFf) and normalization gene (LucRen) activities. In each assay, differences in transfection efficiency were corrected by normalizing reporter gene activity to LucRen activity. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that pmTG3.8-Luc, a reporter gene construct containing 3.8 kilobase pairs of the mouse tissue transglutaminase promoter, possesses all the necessary information to direct physiological expression of tissue transglutaminase in vivo (16Nagy, L., Thomazy, V. A., Saydak, M. M., Stein, J. P., and Davies, P. J. A. (1997) Cell Death Differ., in pressGoogle Scholar). We therefore transfected Mv1Lu cells with pmTG3.8-Luc (Fig. 1 A) and measured the effect of TGF-β1 on the activity of the promoter. The results with Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 1 B) indicate that TGF-β1 induces a dose-dependent increase in pmTG3.8-Luc activity. To locate the regions of the transglutaminase promoter responsible for the induction by TGF-β1, we transfected Mv1Lu cells with a series of reporter constructs in which segments of the transglutaminase promoter were deleted. pmTG1.8-CAT, a construct containing 1834 bp of transglutaminase promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene, demonstrated the same dose-dependent increase in transcriptional activity as we obtained with pmTG3.8-Luc (Fig. 1 B). However, the ability of TGF-β1 to induce the activity of this promoter above the activity of the untreated controls was greater than what we observed with the pmTG3.8-Luc construct. In a series of experiments (n = 8), 0.2 nm TGF-β1 induced a 2.6-fold increase in reporter gene expression of the pmTG1.8-CAT construct (p < 0.001). Deletion of an additional 187 or 547 bp from the 5′-end of the promoter (pmTG1.65 and pmTG-1.3-CAT, respectively) had no deleterious effect on the TGF-β1 inducibility of the tissue transglutaminase gene promoter (Fig. 1 B). However, deletion of the promoter region 3′ to the SmaI site at −1094 (pmTG0.2-CAT and pmTG1.8-ΔSmaI-CAT) eliminated the TGF-β1 inducibility (Fig. 1 B). These studies indicated that the TGF-β1 induction of the transglutaminase promoter depended on the sequence located between −1094 and −256. TGF-β1 has been found to increase the activity of a number of promoters, but a precise TRE for TGF-β1-inducible genes has not been identified (21Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 22Riccio A. Pedone P.V. Lund L.R. Olesen T. Olsen H.S. Andreasen P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1846-1855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to its stimulatory activity, TGF-β1 has also been demonstrated to inhibit the expression of several genes (23Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 24Battey J. Moulding C. Taub R. Murphy W. Stewart T. Potter H. Lenoir G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Comparison of the promoter regions that were necessary for TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of gene expression led to the identification of a conserved sequence (GnnTTGGHGD; nn is A, G, C, or T; H is C, A or T; D is G, A, or T). This canonical TRE was suggested to be a necessary component for the inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 on gene expression (29Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Examining the sequence of the mouse tissue transglutaminase gene promoter necessary for TGF-β1 activity (−1094 to −256) led to the identification of a motif (GAGTTGGTCC; −877 to −868) similar to the canonical TRE (Fig. 1 C). Although this TRE was identified as an inhibitory motif for TGF-β1-regulated gene expression, we investigated whether this element mediated TGF-β1-induced activation of the transglutaminase promoter in transfected Mv1Lu cells. Alteration of the transglutaminase TRE was accomplished by mutating two of the positions common between the transglutaminase TRE and the canonical TRE (Fig. 1 D, mutant transglutaminase TRE). Comparison of the effect of TGF-β1 on the wild-type sequence (pmTG1.8-CAT) and the mutated sequence (pmTG1.8-ΔMut-Cat) (Fig. 1 C) indicated that mutation of these two nucleotides resulted in a complete loss of TGF-β1-inducible expression. In a series of experiments (n = 8) 0.2 nm TGF-β1 did not induce an increase in the activity of the mutated construct (p > 0.1), whereas it induced a 2.6-fold increase in the activity of its non-mutated parent construct (p ≤ 0.001). These results indicate that TGF-β1-induced activation of the tissue transglutaminase promoter in Mv1Lu cells requires a canonical TRE located at position −868 of the mouse transglutaminase promoter. To determine if the effects of TGF-β1 on the transglutaminase promoter activity could be extended to other members of the TGF-β superfamily, we examined the effects of BMP2 and BMP4 on the activity of the tissue transglutaminase promoter. Expression of BMP2 and BMP4 in the developing limb coincides with tissue transglutaminase, occurring in regions such as the interdigital web and the apical ectodermal ridge (16Nagy, L., Thomazy, V. A., Saydak, M. M., Stein, J. P., and Davies, P. J. A. (1997) Cell Death Differ., in pressGoogle Scholar, 30Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 31Jones C.M. Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L. Development. 1991; 111: 531-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mv1Lu cells, co-transfected with pmTG3.8-Luc and SV2-β-galactosidase, were treated with recombinant human BMP2, BMP4, or control media for 48 h. After 48 h, the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined in the cell extracts. Both BMP2 and BMP4 inhibited the activity of the transglutaminase promoter to a level that was 9 and 13%, respectively, of control (Fig.2 A; p ≤ 0.001, n = 2). The basal level of expression of the pmTG3.8-Luc construct in the Mv1Lu cells was low; thus, accurately assessing the level of BMP-mediated inhibition was difficult. Recently, we observed that inhibitors of histone deacetylation, such as sodium butyrate (NaB), greatly increased the basal level of activity of transiently transfected transglutaminase promoter constructs. In the absence of NaB, the basal level of luciferase activity in Mv1Lu cells transfected with pmTG3.8-Luc was 291 ± 52 lumens/μl. In comparison, the basal level of luciferase activity in Mv1Lu cells transfected with pmTG3.8-Luc and treated with 2.5 mm NaB was 14076 ± 703 lumens/μl. To evaluate the effects of BMP2 and BMP4 on transglutaminase promoter activity, Mv1Lu cells co-transfected with pmTG3.8-Luc and SV2-β-galactosidase were treated with 2.5 mmNaB or 2.5 mm NaB plus 2.5 nm BMP2 or -4 for 48 h. The results of this experiment (Fig. 2 B) confirmed that BMP2 and BMP4 inhibited the transcriptional activity of the mouse tissue transglutaminase promoter by 64 and 68%, respectively (p < 0.001; n = 5). The basal activity of the pmTG1.8-CAT construct in Mv1Lu cells is higher than the pmTG3.8-Luc construct. Thus, we were able to examine BMP-mediated inhibition of the basal activity of the pmTG1.8-CAT construct without recourse to NaB treatment. BMP4 induces a dose-dependent inhibition in pmTG1.8-CAT activity in Mv1Lu cells with an IC50 of 0.082 nm (Fig.3 A). Deletion of a proximal segment (−1094 to −90) of the pmTG1.8-CAT construct, pmTG1.8-ΔSmaI-Cat (Fig. 1 A), resulted in a complete loss of the inhibitory activity for all concentrations of BMP4 (Fig. 3 A). The level of reporter gene expression in cells transfected with pmTG1.8-ΔSmaI-Cat and treated with BMP4 for 48 h was 123% of control (Fig. 3 B;p > 0.1; n = 6). The stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on transglutaminase expression depends on the integrity of a TRE located at −868. To determine if the same element contributed to the inhibitory effect of BMP4 on transglutaminase promoter activity, we compared the activity of the intact promoter (pmTG1.8-CAT) with the mutated promoter (pmTG1.8-ΔMut-CAT) in BMP4-treated Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 3 B). In a series of experiments, the transglutaminase promoter activity in BMP4-treated Mv1Lu cells transfected with the wild-type promoter, pmTG1.8-CAT, was inhibited (48% of control, p < 0.001, n = 8). In contrast, BMP4 treatment of Mv1Lu cells transfected with the tissue transglutaminase promoter construct containing two mutated nucleotides (−872 and −874) within the core of the TRE, pmTG1.8-ΔMut-CAT, was unable to inhibit the activity of this construct (89% of control, p > 0.1, n= 6). BMP2 treatment was also ineffective at inhibiting pmTG1.8-ΔMut-CAT activity in Mv1Lu cells (data not shown). Thus, the TRE located at −868 of the tissue transglutaminase gene promoter is necessary for TGF-β1, BMP4, and BMP2 regulatory activities. Since inhibition of transcription for several genes is known to require the presence of the TRE sequence (23Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell.

To examine this question, mouse calvarial pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3 E1 cells) were transfected with the intact tissue transglutaminase gene promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene (pmTG1.8-CAT) or the tissue transglutaminase gene promoter containing the mutated TRE (pmTG1.8-Δmut-C"
https://openalex.org/W2019522750,"We have developed a biologically active analogue of cholecystokinin (CCK) that incorporates a photolabile benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) moiety in the middle of its pharmacophoric domain, which efficiently establishes a covalent bond with an interacting domain of the CCK receptor.

This was adequate to allow specific covalent labeling of the receptor. The labeled domain was within the cyanogen bromide fragment of the receptor including the top of TM6 (the sixth transmembrane domain), the third extracellular loop, and TM7 (the seventh transmembrane domain), as proven by direct Edman degradation sequencing. When this fragment was modified by the replacement of Val342 with Met to generate an additional site of cyanogen bromide cleavage, the labeled fragment was reduced in apparent size consistent with its representing the carboxyl-terminal portion of this fragment. Radiochemical sequencing of that fragment demonstrated covalent attachment of the probe to His347 and Leu348 in this domain. This represents the second experimentally demonstrated contact between a CCK analogue and this receptor, complementing the labeling of the domain just above TM1 (the first transmembrane domain) by a photolabile residue at the carboxyl terminus of CCK (Ji, Z.

Both contacts are consistent with the conformational model of CCK binding proposed on the basis of the initial contact. A molecular understanding of agonist-binding determinants provides important insights that may be useful in the development of drugs acting at the receptor of interest. While such insights are available for small, non-peptidyl agonists (2Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Strader C.D. Fong T.M.

Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), our understanding of the molecular basis for peptide and protein hormone binding is much more primitive. Most insights have been derived from mutagenesis studies in which functional changes in ligand binding have been correlated with the modification of distinct receptor domains or residues (2Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

In favorable situations, a direct causal relationship can be established between a specific mutation and modified receptor function (5Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). However, the vast majority of mutation studies have only interfered with a receptor function. The ability to interpret such observations is, therefore, quite limited, because point mutations may alter receptor function via indirect mechanisms such as modification of receptor processing, conformation, or even regulation, rather than by eliminating a direct site of contact with an agonist. Photoaffinity labeling has been a powerful approach to directly identify sites of interaction between a photolabile ligand and its receptor. However, it has been limited by the low efficiency of covalent labeling and selective nature of some labeling reagents (6Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-linking. CRC Press, Boston1991: 7-73Google Scholar). When these problems are added to their application toward site characterization within a sparse and physicochemically difficult target, the challenges of this approach become apparent. We have recently been successful in using this approach to identify the site of contact between a photolabile nitrophenylalanine positioned at the carboxyl terminus of cholecystokinin (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; Bpa, benzoylphenylalanine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; KRH, Krebs-Ringers-Hepes; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TM, transmembrane; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and its receptor (1Ji Z.

While a single contact between ligand and receptor allows for an initial placement of the ligand into a potential binding site within the receptor, additional contacts would provide additional constraints that could be extremely useful for refining our understanding of this molecular interaction. In this work, we have developed an additional novel analogue of CCK that incorporates a photolabile benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) into the mid-region of the peptide pharmacophore in the position of Gly29. Incorporation of such a benzophenone moiety has many theoretical and practical advantages (7Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such reagents are reactive enough to insert into alkyl carbon residues to establish a bond (6Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-linking. CRC Press, Boston1991: 7-73Google Scholar, 7Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are not quenched by water in the medium, making more reagent available to establish a covalent bond with adjacent proteins. When such a residue is optimally sited within a ligand, such that it is positioned adjacent to a receptor target upon binding, the efficiencies of covalent labeling can be very high (8Servant G. Boulay G. Bossé R. Escher E. Guillemette G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, there are examples reported of efficiencies of covalent labeling of 60–100% of bound receptor (9Shoelson S.E. Lee J. Lynch C.S. Backer J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4085-4091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of this CCK analogue demonstrated that it is a full agonist and is an effective and efficient photoprobe. It specifically labeled His347 and Leu348 just outside of TM7 in the third extracellular loop of the CCK receptor. This has been a site previously targeted by mutation studies of other structurally related peptide hormone receptors (4Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 10Huang R.-R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 690-695PubMed Google Scholar). It is also the site predicted to be adjacent to Gly29 of CCK in a conformational model of the ligand-occupied receptor we recently reported (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additional well defined constraints should enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of binding and activation of this important receptor. Wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was purchased from EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo CA, chromatographically purified collagenase and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Worthington, and cholecystokinin-8 was from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). The well characterized CCK analogues,d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] andd-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33)CCK-26–33] were synthesized as we have described previously (11Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other reagents were analytical grade. t-Butoxycarbonyl-dl-Bpa was synthesized starting from p-chloromethylbenzophenone (Aldrich) as described by Kauer et al. (7Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was incorporated into a standard solid phase peptide synthetic protocol (13Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fmoc-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Nle-(dl-Bpa)-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2was synthesized as we have reported, using standard solid phase methodology with t-butoxycarbonyl protection (except for the last residue) and using a p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (13Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This was cleaved from the resin by anisole/HF, lyophilized, and purified by semipreparative reversed-phase C-18 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with a gradient of 10 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was then sulfated on the Tyr residue using sulfur trioxide pyridine complex, and purified by reversed-phase HPLC with a gradient of acetonitrile in triethylamine-acetate, pH 5. The Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine/N,N-dimethylformamide, and the purified peptide was reacted with Bis-Fmoc-d-Tyr-ONSU or sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (to yield a probe with blocked amino terminus), as we have described (13Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fmoc protection was again removed, and the products were purified by HPLC. The probe with the blocked amino terminus was always used in experiments leading to Edman degradation sequencing. Amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed the expected identity of the synthetic peptides. The d and lstereoconformers were separated by HPLC and identified by the method of Miller and Kaiser (14Miller W.T. Kaiser E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The l-Bpa analogue was used for the present series of studies. This receptor probe was iodinated with both 125I and127I, using oxidative methods and HPLC purification, as described previously (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The radioiodinated probe achieved a specific radioactivity of 2000 Ci/mmol, while the unlabeled iodinated probe was used to provide increased yields for ultimate efforts to purify and sequence the labeled receptor fragment. Dispersed rat pancreatic acini were prepared as we previously described (16Lutz M.P. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11119-11124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreatic tissue was harvested from 80–120-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, and placed in iced, oxygenated Krebs-Ringers-Hepes (KRH) medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mmd-glucose, essential and nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm glutamine, with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The pancreas was injected with 250 units of purified collagenase in 4 ml of KRH, followed by shaking in a 37 °C water bath at 120 strokes/min for 5 min, followed by mincing and manual shaking for 10 min. Dispersed acini were then filtered through 200-μm nytex, and washed twice with KRH. CHO-CCKR cells, representing a rat CCK-A receptor-bearing CHO cell line which we previously established and characterized (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), were grown as a monolayer in flasks containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were harvested mechanically and used as a source of receptor-bearing plasma membranes. These were prepared by suspending the cells in 0.3 msucrose containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicating in a Sonifier cell disrupter (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY) at setting 7 for 10 s. The concentration of sucrose in the homogenate was adjusted to 1.3 m with 2.0 msucrose, and this was overlaid with 0.3 m sucrose prior to centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane band at the sucrose interface was then harvested and diluted with ice water. This was pelleted by centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in KRH for storage at −80 °C. The wild-type rat type A CCK receptor construct in m13mp18 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used as template for an oligonucleotide-directed method of mutagenesis (Sculptor system of Amersham Life Science). This was directed to change Val342 to Met, to provide a new site of cyanogen bromide cleavage. The mutant construct was then subcloned into pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the sequence was proven by direct dideoxynucleotide DNA sequence analysis (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). CHO cells not expressing any endogenous type A or B CCK receptors (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were transfected by lipofection, and neomycin-resistant cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. Surviving cells expressing an appropriate receptor density were selected by sequential rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting after incubation with a fluorescein-conjugated CCK receptor ligand, as we previously described (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured as described above for the CHO-CCKR cell line. Amylase release assay was utilized to determine the biological activity of the receptor probe (16Lutz M.P. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11119-11124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this, dispersed rat pancreatic acini were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of secretagogue. At the end of the incubation, cells were separated from medium by centrifugation through Nyosil oil (William F. Nye, Inc., New Bedford MA). The phadebas assay (18Ceska M. Birath K. Brown B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1969; 26: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) for amylase (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala Sweden) was applied to aliquots of a total cellular lysate and to each supernatant, allowing the calculation of percentages of cellular content secreted. Receptor binding was characterized using 2–5 μg of CHO-CCKR membranes or intact cells grown in 24-well culture dishes (approximately 500,000 cells/well), incubated at room temperature for 1 h in KRH medium with radioligand (3–5 pm) and various concentrations of competing cold peptide. For membrane binding, bound and free radioligand were separated using a Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments, Inc. Sterling, VA) with receptor-binding filter mats. Cells were lysed with 0.5 mNaOH to release cell-bound ligand. Bound radioligand was quantified in a gamma spectrometer. Affinity labeling was performed similarly, using a larger quantity of membrane (50–100 μg) and iodinated ligand (50–100 pm). When incubations were complete, samples were transferred to siliconized glass tubes and photolyzed at 4 °C for 30 min in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Company, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500 Å lamps. Membrane pellets were washed and either solubilized in SDS-sample buffer and directly applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis under the conditions described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), or solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in KRH medium, prior to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose affinity chromatography and subsequent SDS-PAGE. The efficiency of covalent labeling was determined by excising and counting the region of the gel in which the CCK receptor is known to migrate, subtracting any counts in that region in the absence of CCK stimulation from those in that region after hormone stimulation. Efficiency was compared for the Bpa analogue probe and for the established photoaffinity labeling reagent,125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33)CCK-26–33], which we have extensively characterized (12Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity labeled, lectin-purified receptor was washed twice with 0.5 m NaCl containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and once with water. It was then resuspended in endoglycosidase F buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, pH 6.1, 50 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) with 2 units of endoglycosidase F, and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The sample was diluted with SDS-sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Affinity labeled receptor, which had been adsorbed to lectin and separated on SDS-PAGE, was visualized by autoradiography, eluted, and lyophilized. It was then suspended in water and precipitated with 85% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The precipitate was pelleted at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were rinsed with 500 μl of iced ethanol and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Samples were suspended in cyanogen bromide (2.5 mg/tube) in 70% trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid for 72 h at room temperature in the dark. Sample volumes were reduced under vacuum and washed twice with water in preparation for separation on a NuPAGE gel using MES running buffer. The affinity labeled receptor was visualized by autoradiography, cut out, eluted, and lyophilized. Samples were suspended in water and precipitated with 90% acetone in 1 mm HCl for 3 h at −20 °C. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min and rinsed with iced acetone, prior to being dried under vacuum. This was then further purified by HPLC. Two sequential HPLC steps were utilized to further purify the receptor fragments to homogeneity for Edman degradation sequencing. The first HPLC step was performed with a Vydac analytical C-4 column (catalog no. 214TP5415), utilizing a 1 ml/min flow rate and a gradient of 10 to 80% solution B (A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile). Peak fractions were then injected onto a Perkin-Elmer/Brownlee microbore C-18 HPLC column (catalog no. 401966), utilizing a flow rate of 5 μl/min and 10 min of 1% solution B, followed by a linear gradient up to 80% solution B over 190 min (A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile). The C-4 separation was monitored at 220 nm, and the C-18 separation was monitored at 280 nm, with a UV absorbance detector. The eluant from the microbore column was collected directly onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was subsequently exposed to x-ray film for detection of the position of the radioactive peak. This was then analyzed by densitometry. The peak area was excised from the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation sequencing using an Applied Biosystems automated instrument. The radiolabeled cyanogen bromide fragment of the V342M mutant receptor was purified following analogous steps. Radiochemical sequencing of the peak labeled fraction eluting from HPLC was also performed, in manner analogous to that previously reported (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For this, the relevant labeled receptor-containing fraction was coupled toN-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl glass beads either through its α-carboxyl group with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide at pH 5.0 or through a cysteine sulfhydryl side chain. The latter was accomplished by derivatizing amino group-expressing glass beads withm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester at pH 7.0, quenching remaining amino reactivity with Tris, and then adding the labeled receptor fragment. The peptide-bound beads were treated with triethylamine, dried, and derivatized with triethylamine:methanol:phenylisothiocyanate (1:7:1, v:v) for 5 min at 50 °C. They were then washed three times with 400 μl of ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum. Beads were then incubated with 50 μl of trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min at 25 °C, and elution was achieved with three successive 200-μl aliquots of methanol. Cycles were repeated for up to 15 complete cycles. Radioactivity in each pooled eluate was quantified in a gamma spectrometer. Noncovalently bound radiolabeled fragments were eluted from the beads with a minimum of three complete cycles excluding the phenylisothiocyanate, before initiating formal cycle number one. The photolabile CCK receptor probe incorporating the l-Bpa residue was synthesized and purified to homogeneity on reversed phase HPLC. Its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry and it was quantified by amino acid analysis. The determination of the identity of the l- andd-Bpa stereoisomers was based on the differential sensitivity to digestion by aminopeptidase M (14Miller W.T. Kaiser E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only digestion of the earlier eluting peak (identified as the l-Bpa analogue) yielded a product that comigrated with a parabenzoylphenylalanine standard, while the specificity of this protease did not permit the release of this residue from the d-Bpa analogue. The probe was radioiodinated using the solid phase oxidant, iodobeads (Pierce), and its products were purified by reversed phase HPLC, using methods analogous to those we have reported (20Pearson R.K. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 1985-1991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The radioiodinated product was fully resolved from unlabeled peptide to yield a specific radioactivity of 2000 Ci/mmol. This reagent was stored in the dark at −70 °C until ready for use. The probe was an agonist, stimulating dispersed rat pancreatic acini to secrete amylase in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1, left). These are cells that naturally express the wild type CCK receptor. The probe was also a potent secretagogue (EC50 = 28 ± 6 nm), and was as efficacious as the native hormonal agonist, CCK-8. Competition binding studies were performed with a well characterized native CCK-like radioligand (125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33]) (11Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and enriched plasma membranes were prepared from CHO-CCKR cells (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The l-Bpa analogue competed for binding of this radioligand in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 450 ± 126 nm (Fig. 1,right). When used in affinity labeling experiments, the photolabile probe covalently labeled a protein that migrated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the M r 85,000–95,000 position of the CCK receptor (11Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its identity was further supported by its migration at M r 42,000 after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F (Fig. 2), a position well established for the core protein of the CCK receptor (21Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can also be seen in Fig. 2, unlabeled CCK inhibited the affinity labeling of the receptor band in a concentration-dependent manner. The efficiency of covalent labeling of the CCK receptor with thel-Bpa analogue was 14-fold greater than that using125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33)CCK-26–33] (12Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Klueppelberg U.G. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Receptor. 1990; 1: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar), as determined by cutting out and counting the receptor band from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Peptide mapping after cyanogen bromide cleavage was utilized to gain insight into the receptor domain representing the site of covalent attachment of the l-Bpa analogue probe. This was chosen because of the nicely spaced distribution of methionine residues in the CCK receptor sequence (Fig.3), and the efficient and specific cleavage of peptide chains at such residues with this reagent. After reduction, alkylation, and cyanogen bromide cleavage of the radiochemically pure affinity-labeled receptor, only a single labeled band was observed which migrated on urea-SDS-polyacrylamide, NuPAGE or Tris-Tricine gels at M r 6,700 ± 400 (Fig.3). When corrected for the mass of the receptor probe (M r 1,647), this best corresponded with the calculated mass of the fragment extending from residue 329 to 374 (5,129 + 1,647 = 6,776). Consistent with this assignment, as expected, treatment with endoglycosidase F did not modify the electrophoretic migration of this peptide (data not shown). As definitive evidence for the identity of the labeled fragment, it was also exposed to Edman degradation sequencing after extensive purification, as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig.4). This resulted in the identification of Ile-Phe-Ser-X-Asn-Ala-Trp in cycles two through eight. The residues in cycles one and five were ambiguous. This sequence exists only in fragment 14, and residues are in the appropriate positions relative to the site of cyanogen bromide cleavage at Met328, thus confirming its identity. The location of labeling within this receptor domain was further defined by mutagenesis to introduce an additional site for cyanogen bromide cleavage within this fragment (V342M). CCK bound to this mutant receptor similarly to the wild type CCK receptor (Fig.5). The mutant receptor was affinity labeled efficiently (Fig. 6), and cleavage with cyanogen bromide demonstrated the labeling of a fragment of M r 5,500, consistent with its representing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the previously described fragment, extending from residue 343 to 374.Figure 6A typical autoradiograph of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel used to separate the products of affinity labeling the V342M mutant CCK receptor-bearing membranes with125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,Bpa29)CCK-26–33] in the absence or presence of competing unlabeled CCK (left). Also shown is a representative autoradiograph of a 16% Tris-Tricine gel used to separate cyanogen bromide fragments of the wild type CCK receptor and the V342M mutant receptor affinity labeled with this reagent (right). The labeled cyanogen bromide fragment of the mutant receptor migrated as a fragment smaller than that of the wild type receptor. It had an approximateM r 5,500, corresponding to the fragment extending from residue 343 to 374. This was typical of 11 similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The site of covalent attachment of probe to receptor was further defined by radiochemical sequencing using Edman degradation with quantification of the radioactivity in the released cleavage products, analogous to that recently reported (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows the profile of eluted radioactivity above background in each cycle. This was repeated with five independent samples, with the peak in radioactivity in four samples corresponding to His347 in cycle five, and in one sample the peak corresponded to Leu348 in cycle six, with substantial radioactivity also present in cycle five. This suggests that both the His347 and Leu348 in the third extracellular loop can be labeled, with the His labeling most efficient. No additional significant radioactivity was released through fifteen cycles. Affinity labeling approaches are ideal to define sites of contact between molecules that interact with high affinity and structural specificity, such as a ligand and its receptor. The specificity of this interaction is provided by the reproducible spatial geometry of the interacting functionalities within those molecules. If a photolabile moiety can be introduced into an agonist ligand, without interfering with its ability to bind and activate its receptor, it can function as a probe of receptor domains adjacent to it. The most useful such probes incorporate a photolabile moiety into a domain that is intrinsic to the pharmacophore, thereby being in a position to potentially define critical sites of molecular contact. In designing such “intrinsic” probes, there is often a trade-off between the use of a relatively small moiety that may be less likely to interfere with conformation and function, and the use of a bulkier substituent that may have more ideal characteristics of photolability or reactivity. An example of the former may involve replacing an existing aryl group with an aryl-azide (6Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-linking. CRC Press, Boston1991: 7-73Google Scholar). Given the advantages provided by a benzophenone which were discussed in the introduction (6Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-linking. CRC Press, Boston1991: 7-73Google Scholar,7Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we attempted to find a position for this residue within the receptor-binding domain of CCK. Extensive primary structure-activity data exist for the action of this hormone at the type A CCK receptor (23Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Engel S.L. Pluscec J. Sheehan J.T. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The position of Gly29 was utilized, due to experimental data indicating that modifications of that residue are tolerated (24Yanaihara C. Sugiura N. Kashimoto K. Kondo M. Kawamura M. Naruse S. Yasui A. Yanaihara N. Biomed. Res. 1985; 6: 111-115Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and a recent molecular model of the ligand-bound receptor that suggests that a Bpa substitution would be tolerated at this position (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have often utilizedd-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33] as a “parent” probe for the CCK receptor that is stable in oxidizing conditions and radioiodinatable (25Miller L.J. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1992; 65: 441-448PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we further modified that CCK analogue to replace Gly29 with l-Bpa. This analogue was a potent pancreatic secretagogue that bound with adequate affinity to allow efficient covalent attachment to the receptor. Like previous analogues of CCK, which incorporate photolabile residues within the pharmacophore of this hormone (12Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Klueppelberg U.G. Gaisano H.Y. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3463-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the Bpa analogue affinity labeled the same M r 85,000–95,000 molecule previously described to represent the CCK receptor on the pancreatic acinar cell. We have recently demonstrated the identity of that molecule with the recombinant receptor molecule encoded by the cDNA clone originally isolated (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this work, we took further advantage of the CHO-CCKR cell line that we established to express 25-fold more receptors on the surface than on the pancreatic acinar cell (15Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), to provide an enriched source of this receptor for biochemical characterization. The Bpa analogue covalently labeled that molecule with efficiency 14-fold greater than that of the established CCK receptor probe,125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33)CCK-26–33] (12Powers S.P.

Receptor. 1990; 1: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of the affinity labeled receptor could not utilize the most efficient purification modality now available, a specific ligand-affinity column (27Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Gates L.K. Gaisano H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), since the ligand-binding site was already occupied. Instead, we utilized more traditional physical methods for purification, following the receptor and ultimately the fragment of interest by monitoring the position of elution of the radioactivity. This approach requires efficient covalent labeling of the receptor, since a very small labeled receptor fragment might be expected to elute differently than the same fragment not covalently bound to the probe. For this, the benzophenone-containing probe offers substantial advantage over a variety of previously described reagents that have substantially lower efficiencies of covalent labeling of the receptor (22Klueppelberg U.G. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Receptor. 1990; 1: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). The active sites of G protein-coupled receptors have been of substantial interest (2Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

This is particularly true as we enter the era of rational drug design. Receptors have long been very effective drug targets. Anything that can be done to improve the ability to develop reagents with improved selectivity, potency, or bioavailability would be very useful. Until recently, most of our knowledge of G protein-coupled receptor agonist binding sites was restricted to those receptors that bind small ligands, such as the 11-cis-retinal chromophore and biogenic amines, in binding sites within the helical bundle transmembrane domain (2Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

With the cloning of cDNAs that encode peptide and protein ligand receptors in this superfamily, attention has focused much more on extracellular loop regions as the principle ligand-binding domain. The rules are not nearly as clear for such receptors as for the small ligand receptors. It is of particular interest that the domain labeled in this study includes the carboxyl-terminal half of the third extracellular loop and TM7 of the CCK receptor. Indeed, this is a domain that includes residues that have substantial impact in mutagenesis studies of the substance P receptor (10Huang R.-R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 690-695PubMed Google Scholar, 28Huang R.R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is reassuring that the same domain is identified with two quite distinct experimental approaches. The specific residues that were labeled with this probe included His347 and or Leu348 just outside of TM7 in the third extracellular loop. This contact is fully compatible with the model we recently proposed for the peptide agonist ligand-occupied receptor, which was based on an initial contact between the carboxyl terminus of the ligand and Trp39 in the domain just above TM1 (1Ji Z.

Indeed, these residues were even predicted to represent the best receptor contact for the mid-region of CCK in that work. We acknowledge the advice and assistance of D. J. McCormick, Ph.D., and B. J.

Mildly oxidized low density lipoproteins (UV-oxLDL), which are mitogenic to cultured AG-08133A SMC, activate the sphingomyelin (SM)-ceramide pathway. We report here the following. (i) UV-oxLDL elicited a biphasic and sustained activation of MBP kinase activity, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and [3H]thymidine incorporation, which were inhibited by PD-098059, a MAPK kinase inhibitor. (ii) The use of preconditioned media (from SMC pre-activated by UV-oxLDL) transferred to native SMC and blocking antibodies against growth factors suggest that UV-oxLDL-induced activation of MAPK and [3H]thymidine incorporation seem to be independent of any autocrine secretion of growth factors. (iii) UV-oxLDL-induced activation of a neutral sphingomyelinase, SM hydrolysis, ceramide production, and [3H]thymidine incorporation were inhibited by two serine-protease inhibitors (serpins), suggesting that a serpin-sensitive proteolytic pathway is involved in the activation of the SM-ceramide signaling pathway.

Among the risk factors identified, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level is strongly predictive of coronary heart disease. LDL are believed to have an important role in atherogenesis (3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 897-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), following oxidative modifications (4Steinbrecher U.P. Zhang H. Lougheed M. Free Radical Biol.

These studies suggest that oxidized LDL may be considered as an additional mitogenic factor, alongside the classical growth factors implicated in SMC proliferation during atherogenesis (6Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism of the oxidized LDL proliferative effect is poorly elucidated and may result from the triggering of a mitogenic intracellular signal either directly by oxidized LDL or indirectly through an autocrine effect involving growth factor secretion and/or growth factor receptor over-expression. Recently, sphingolipids have emerged as key signaling molecules involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 12Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pushkareva M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Immunol.

In particular, the sphingomyelin (SM; ceramide phosphocholine)-ceramide pathway appears as a prototypic sphingolipid signaling pathway implicated in the positive or negative regulation of cell growth. Activation of this pathway leads to SM hydrolysis and subsequent generation of ceramide, the backbone of all sphingolipids, which serves as an intracellular second messenger. To date, several agents have been described to stimulate the SM-ceramide pathway (reviewed in Refs. 12Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Cell proliferation promoted by extracellular growth stimuli involves various intracellular signaling pathways leading to activation of gene transcription, DNA synthesis, and cell division (24Cantley L.

Physiol. 1992; 54: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation, mediated by a complex regulatory network of protein kinases, plays an essential role in the signal transduction between cell surface and nucleus (26Inagaki N. Ito M. Nakano T. Inagaki M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 448-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Despite the broad diversity of mitogens and receptors, these signaling pathways often converge toward the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, a group of serine/threonine protein kinases also referred to as extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs; p44/ERK1 and p42/ERK2, p44/42 MAPK) in mammalian cells (26Inagaki N. Ito M. Nakano T. Inagaki M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 448-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MAPKs are rapidly activated in response to stimulation of receptors for growth factors, hormones, or cytokines, G protein-coupled receptors, or in response to stress (25Pouysségur J. Seuwen K. Annu.

Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPKs, associated with their nuclear translocation, is essential to trigger entry into the S phase of cell cycle (31Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

The data reported in this study suggest that mitogenic concentrations of UV-oxLDL elicit the activation of the SM-ceramide pathway through a protease-dependent process. Subsequently, it induced a sustained activation and nuclear translocation of p44/42 MAPK and [3H]thymidine incorporation in cultured vascular SMC.

RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mmGlutamax, fetal calf serum (FCS), and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Merck. Bovine aortic SMC (AG-08133A, from the NIA Aging Cells Repository, Camden, NJ) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. After trypsinization, cells were grown in medium containing 10% FCS for 24 h. Then, the medium was removed, and cells were washed once with RPMI and grown for 48 h in RPMI medium containing 1% FCS prior to the addition of native or oxidized LDL. In some experiments, SV40-transfected SMC cells were used. For this purpose, SMC were electroporated (240 V, 960 μF) with a plasmid (pAS) carrying the large T antigen (33Jacquemin-Sablon H. Ganz L. Feunteun J. Biol. Cell. 1990; 187: 209-216Google Scholar); these transfected SMC exhibited a two to three times longer life span than the untransfected cells. For the experiments presented here, similar results were obtained with either SMC type. Human LDL (d 1.019–1.063) were isolated from pooled fresh sera by sequential ultracentrifugation, dialyzed, sterilized by filtration, and stored at 4 °C under nitrogen until use, as described previously (10Augé N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Négre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mildly oxidized LDL (UV-oxLDL) were prepared by UV-C irradiation under the previously defined standard conditions (254 nm, 0.5 mW/cm2 for 2 h) (34Négre-Salvayre A. Lopez M. Levade T. Pieraggi M.T.

Purified LDL were fluorescently labeled with DiIC18 according to Via and Smith (35Via D.P. Smith L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 848-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), re-isolated by ultracentrifugation, and dialyzed and sterilized again as indicated above. DiIC18-labeled LDL were added to the culture medium (100 μg of apoB/ml) and incubated with cells for the indicated times. Then, cells were washed once with PBS containing 5 g/liter bovine serum albumin and twice with PBS only. Afterward, cells were homogenized by sonication in 1 ml of distilled water, and an aliquot was used to extract DiIC18 by the procedure of Folch et al. (36Folch J.M. Lees G.N. Sloane-Stanley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to read the cell-associated fluorescence extracted in the chloroformic phase (using a Jobin-Yvon JY-3C spectrofluorometer; excitation 545 nm, emission 568 nm). DNA synthesis was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation (at time 24 h, under standard conditions, or at the time indicated in the figures). Cells (2 × 105/dish) were labeled for 12 h with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) before harvesting and then washed three times with PBS; after addition of 3% perchloric acid, the acid-precipitable material was dissolved overnight in 1 N NaOH, 1% SDS and counted by liquid scintillation (Packard Tricarb 4530 counter). SMC were metabolically labeled to equilibrium with [methyl-3H]choline (0.5 μCi/ml) or [3H]palmitic acid (0.5 μCi/ml) in RPMI medium containing 1% FCS. After 48 h of incubation, cells (about 300,000/assay) were washed once with PBS and chased for 2 h in fresh RPMI containing 1% FCS. Then, the medium was replaced by fresh 1% FCS-containing medium with or without UV-oxLDL (100 μg of apoB/ml). At the indicated times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested using a rubber policeman, and sedimented by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min). Cell pellets were immediately frozen at −20 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 0.6 ml of distilled water and homogenized by sonication (2 × 10 s, using an MSE probe sonicator). An aliquot was saved for protein determination (37Smith P.K.

Lipids from 0.5 ml of the cell lysate were extracted by 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (36Folch J.M. Lees G.N. Sloane-Stanley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and [3H]choline-labeled SM and [3H]palmitoyl-labeled ceramide were quantified as described previously (11Augé N. Andrieu N.

Machleidt T. Witte D. Kro¨nke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) but in the presence or absence of EDTA under the previously used conditions (21Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T.

Briefly, cells were homogenized by sonication (2 runs of 10 s as above indicated) in 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 750 μm ATP, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin. SMase assays contained 100 μl of cell homogenate (100 μg of protein) and 100 μl of substrate [choline-methyl-14C]SM (120,000 dpm/assay) in 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2 (and 10 mm EDTA when indicated) for the neutral activity, or in 250 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for the alkaline activity. For determining acid SMase activity, cells were homogenized by sonication in 0.1% Triton X-100. Assays contained 100 μl of cell homogenate (100 μg of protein) and 100 μl of substrate [choline-methyl-14C]SM (120,000 dpm/assay) in 250 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the liberated [methyl-14C]choline was partitioned by the Folch procedure (36Folch J.M. Lees G.N. Sloane-Stanley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under the previously used conditions (21Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. Bettaı¨eb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. MAP kinase activity was determined on immunoprecipitates according to a procedure derived from Ikeda et al. (40Ikeda U. Oguchi A. Okada K. Ishikawa S. Saito T. Ikeda M. Kano S. Takahashi M. Shiomi M. Shimada K. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: 87-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with (or without) LDL, cells (2 × 107) were placed on dry ice, washed twice with cold PBS, and scraped off with a rubber policeman in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation (300 ×g for 10 min), the cell pellets were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 500 μl of lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 g/liter Triton X-100, 1 g/liter SDS, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were centrifuged (12,500 ×g for 10 min, 4 °C). A 5-μl aliquot of the supernatant was used for protein determination (37Smith P.K. Khron R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

The supernatant was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose. After centrifugation (12,500 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of anti-ERK1 antibody (100 μg/ml), and 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (12,500 × g for 5 min), the pellet was washed twice with buffer A, solubilized in 200 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF) and used for determining the MAP kinase activity by phosphorylation of MBP in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP (300,000 dpm/assay) as described (40Ikeda U.

The reaction mixtures were spotted on phosphocellulose discs, which were washed with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. After drying, the discs were counted by liquid scintillation. Alternatively, proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and the radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography (Biomax-MR, Eastman Kodak). Phosphotyrosine proteins were detected in SMC by Western blotting (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106/assay) were solubilized in 100 μl in lysis buffer B for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged (12,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and 100 μg of protein of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (100 V, 9 mA for 16 h). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (300 V, 200 mA for 5 h), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (0.1%) at 4 °C for 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:500). The membranes were washed four times in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, and antibody reactions were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:3000) and the ECL chemiluminescent detection reagents (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, the cell lysate was precleared on protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibody exactly under the conditions described above for immunoprecipitating MAPKs with anti-ERK. Then, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, heated (90 °C for 10 min) and dissolved in the electrophoresis buffer, were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-ERK1 or anti-ERK2 antibody, as indicated above. SMC, grown on uncoated glass coverslips, were fixed in PBS and 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-ERK1 antibody (1:40) for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS, incubation with a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min, and washing again with PBS, slides were mounted in Fluoprep and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Diaplan (Leitz) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM model). The UV-oxLDL used here were defined by moderate lipid peroxidation (4 ± 1 nmol of thio-barbituric acid-reactive substances/mg of apoB) and only minor modifications of apoB (as shown by minor alterations of the electrophoretic mobility, no significant loss of surface amino groups and cellular uptake through the apoB/E receptor) (34Négre-Salvayre A.

Dousset N. Bascoul J. Salvayre R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We utilized here a concentration of UV-oxLDL (100 μg of apoB/ml) that gave maximal mitogenic effect to cultured AG-08133A SMC (as shown by [3H]thymidine incorporation) and only a low level of cytotoxicity, as assessed by LDH release (10Augé N.

Mitogenic concentrations of UV-oxLDL induced a biphasic increase of MBP kinase activity in SMC (Fig. 1,A and B). A first, transient peak of MAPK activity, maximal at 1 h, was followed by a second rise, sustained for at least 3 h. Native LDL induced a weak transient peak but not the second sustained peak of MBP kinase (Fig. 1, A andB). Similar results were obtained when using whole cell extracts (Fig. 1 A) and anti-ERK immunoprecipitates (data not shown). To provide more evidence for the MAPK activation in SMC stimulated by mitogenic doses of UV-oxLDL, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK was examined by immunoblotting. As reported in Fig. 1 C, UV-oxLDL induced an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of p44 and p42 that was evident after 1 h of incubation and plateaued at 3–5 h.

We characterized the consequences of the general control response upon the signal “amino acid starvation” induced by the histidine analogue 3-aminotriazole with respect to Gcn4p levels in more detail. Therefore, we established test systems to monitor the time course of different parameters, including GCN4 mRNA, Gcn4 protein, Gcn4p DNA binding activity, as well as Gcn4p transactivation ability. We observed a biphasic response of Gcn4p activity in the cell. At first, translation of GCN4 mRNA is induced within 20 min after switch to starvation conditions. However, an additional increase inGCN4 transcript steady state level was observed, leading to an additional second phase of GCN4 expression after 3–4 h of starvation. The DNA binding activity of Gcn4p, as well as the ability to activate transcription of target genes, correlate with the amount of Gcn4 protein in the cell, suggesting that under the tested conditions there is no additional regulation of DNA binding or transactivation ability of Gcn4p, respectively.

The survival of cells in their natural environment is dependent on their ability to adapt rapidly to occurring changes. For example, yeast cells must respond to changes in the availability of amino acids to survive in nature. In yeast, complex biological mechanisms have evolved to ensure a sufficient supply of amino acids within the cell. Starvation of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for any of several amino acids causes a coordinated derepression of genes encoding enzymes involved in more than 10 different unlinked amino acid biosynthetic pathways, as well as of amino acid tRNA synthetases (1Meussdoerffer F. Fink G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Mirande M. Waller J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18443-18451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and enzymes for purine biosynthesis (3Mo¨sch H.-U. Scheier B. Lahti R. Mäntsälä P. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20453-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex interplay between numerous control mechanisms is known as “general amino acid control” (4Hinnebusch A.G. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar). Under laboratory conditions, the general control response is not inducible by culturing cells on minimal medium (4Hinnebusch A.G. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar). Because of the high basal expression levels of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, the ability of yeast to synthesize at least one of the amino acids must be impaired. A common approach to impose amino acid limitation onS. cerevisiae is to cultivate yeast cells in the presence of amino acid analogues, as 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) 1The abbreviations used are: 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; eIF-2B, guanine nucleotide exchange factor of eIF-2; GCRE, general control responsive element; tRNAiMet, initiator tRNA charged with methionine; UAS, upstream activation site; uORF, small upstream open reading frame; bp, base pair(s). or 5-methyltryptophan. The histidine analogue 3-AT is a competitive inhibitor of the imidazole glycerolphosphate dehydratase, an enzyme involved in histidine biosynthesis (5Klopotowski T. Wiater A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 112: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Addition of 3-AT to exponentially growing yeast culture leads to insufficient supply of the cell with histidine which results in the activation of the general amino acid control (6Wolfner M. Yep D. Messenguy F. Fink G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The general control is a multifaceted regulatory mechanism that draws upon several different strategies to control gene expression. Gcn4p is the transcriptional activator of gene expression in this system. It enables the yeast cell to stimulate the expression of at least 40 different genes. Gcn4p is a member of the basic leucine zipper family (7Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) and binds directly as a homodimer to a conserved regulatory region of its target genes (8Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1986; 46: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This DNA sequence required for specific binding of Gcn4p is well defined and consists of the symmetric nucleotide motive TGA(C/G)TCA (9Oliphant A.R. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The rate of Gcn4p synthesis itself is regulated by the availability of amino acids. Under nonstarvation conditions the GCN4mRNA is poorly translated due to the negative effects of the translation of four small upstream open reading frames (uORFs) present in its 5′-untranslated region (10Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 11Thireos G. Driscoll Penn M. Greer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When cells are grown under conditions of severe amino acid limitation, an elevation in the cellular amount of Gcn4p is accomplished through an increased translation of GCN4 mRNA. A deletion of all four uORFs (12Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or point mutations in their four ATG start codons (13Mueller P.P. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) results in an increased translation of GCN4 mRNA. The model for this translational control is that the four uORFs in the leader ofGCN4 mRNA restrict the flow of scanning ribosomes from the cap site to the GCN4 initiation codon. When amino acids are abundant, ribosomes translate the first uORF and reinitiate at one of the remaining uORFs in the leader, after which they dissociate from the mRNA. Under conditions of amino acid starvation, many ribosomes which have translated uORF1 fail to reinitiate at uORFs 2 to 4 and utilize the GCN4 start codon instead. The failure to reinitiate at uORFs 2 to 4 in starved cells results from a reduction in the GTP-bound form of eIF-2 that delivers charged initiator tRNAiMet to the ribosome. When the levels of eIF-2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complexes are low, many ribosomes will not rebind this critical initiation factor following translation of uORF1 until after scanning past uORF4, but before reaching GCN4 (14Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It has been supposed that under amino acid starvation conditions, uncharged tRNAs accumulate and stimulate Gcn2p protein kinase activity by interacting with its histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain (15Lanker S. Bushman J.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Trachsel H. Mueller P.P. Cell. 1992; 70: 647-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Gcn2p phosphorylates the α-subunit of eIF-2 (16Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-2 reduces the amount of active eIF-2 available for ternary complex formation by inhibiting eIF-2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The resulting low level of eIF-2·GTP and ternary complex formation diminishes the rate at which initiation complexes are reassembled. An additional regulation mechanism for the general control system is the regulation by protein degradation of Gcn4p. Pulse-chase experiments showed that Gcn4p is highly unstable, with a half-life of about 5 min under nonstarvation conditions (17Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This degradation is inhibited under conditions of starvation for amino acids. Up to now nothing is known about other regulation mechanisms of GCN4 gene expression or Gcn4 protein itself. The rapid turnover of Gcn4p may be the reason that Gcn4p activity could hardly be detected in yeast cells. Virtually all biochemical analyses of Gcn4p function have used Gcn4p produced by recombinant techniques, for example, analyses of GCN4 regulation in vivohave used GCN4::lacZ fusion genes. Here we have characterized in detail the consequences of the general control response with respect to GCN4 mRNA and Gcn4p levels. We have examined several parameters of the changes of Gcn4p levels when exponentially growing cells were shifted from growth in minimal medium to amino acid starvation medium. Test systems were developed in order to monitor the time course of various steps of this induction process: (a) GCN4 mRNA steady state levels were determined. (b) Gcn4 protein was detected using a specific antibody raised against the DNA-binding domain of Gcn4p. (c) An assay to detect Gcn4p in a gel retardation experiment using cellular extracts was developed. (d) A highly sensitivelacZ fusion gene as efficient target of the general control was constructed carrying multiple cassettes of the Gcn4p recognition element in its promoter to monitor the trans-activation rate of the Gcn4 protein. These assays were performed with both a strain harboring the wild-type GCN4 allele and a strain containing aGCN4 allele which was unresponsive to the translational control due to point mutations of the four uORFs. We observed a biphasic response of Gcn4 protein levels, Gcn4p DNA binding activity and activation ability in the cell upon the signal “amino acid starvation.” The first phase started immediately after induction by 3-AT and is due to the translational control depending on the four uORFs. After 3–4 h of starvation, an additional 2-fold increase started which seems to be due to increased transcriptional initiation induced by amino acid starvation. pME1112 and pME1108 were constructed using the yeast integration vector pLI4 (18Sengstag C. Hinnen A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) containing the CYC1::lacZ reporter gene (19Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). pME1112 (GCRE6::lacZ) was used to integrate a Gcn4p regulated lacZ gene carrying six general control responsive elements (GCRE) in the CYC1 promoter region into the genome. The same construct without GCRE was used as control and named pME1108 (ΔUAS::lacZ). Replacement of the upstream activation site (UAS) of theCYC1::lacZ with GCREs was achieved by first cutting out the XhoI fragment containing the UAS. Religation of the XhoI site resulted in pME1108. Then, two synthetic oligonucleotides (GAC1, 5′-GATCGGATGACTCATTTTTT-3′ and GAC2, 5′-GATCAAAAAATGAGTCATCC-3′) were annealed to form an optimal double-stranded GCRE (20Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). T4 DNA ligase was added to produce multimeric GCRE DNA probes. The products were then blunt ended with Klenow and inserted into the blunt ended XhoI site of pME1108. The resulting plasmid pME112 contains six GCRE sites as determined by nucleotide sequence analysis (21Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Enzymatic manipulation and cloning of DNA were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T.

A 2.8-kilobaseEcoRI-SalI fragment containing theGCN4 gene was isolated from vector p164 (12Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and inserted between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBluescribe M13− to get vector pME1085. The complete GCN4open reading frame was deleted by removing aBstEII-BfrI fragment. A blunt endedHpaI-NarI fragment containing the LEU2gene isolated from vector YEp351 (23Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) was then inserted between the blunt ended BstEII and BfrI sites to obtain pME1105. A 2.8-kilobase EcoRI-SalI segment containing the GCN4 gene was isolated from vector p164 (12Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to get vector pGCN4 (pME1092). The 640-bpSalI-BstEII fragment of pGCN4 carrying the four short open reading frames in the GCN4 leader region was then replaced by a 640-bp SalI-BstEII fragment of vector p238 containing four mutated (non-functional) open reading frames in the GCN4 leader region (13Mueller P.P. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) to get vector pGCN4m (pME1098). The plasmids were kindly provided by Alan Hinnebusch (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD). p180 is aURA3,RS1,CEN4 plasmid containing aGCN4::lacZ fusion with lacZfused in-frame at the 55th codon of GCN4 (12Hinnebusch A.G.

Strains RH1796 and RH1798 were constructed by first performing a one-step replacement of the chromosomal GCN4 gene using theScaI fragment of vector pME1105 harboring theGCN4 deletion cassette. Then the His− phenotype was rescued by transformation with a linearAatII-NaeI fragment containing the intactHIS3 gene from vector pRS303 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, theStuI-linearized plasmids pME1112 and pME1108, respectively, were integrated at the ura3-52 locus. Transformations were carried out using the lithium-acetate yeast transformation method (27Ito H. Jukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 134: 48-59Google Scholar). Correct integration or replacement of all manipulations was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (28Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultivated on minimal medium (29Miozzari G. Niederberger P. Hütter R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 48-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate supplements were added in recommended amounts (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Routinely precultures were grown overnight, diluted, and cultivated for another 12 h to an optical density of approximately 0.5 at 546 nm. Then 40 mm 3-aminotriazole was added to induce histidine starvation. After the appropriate growth period, cultures were divided and harvested for parallel measurement of β-galactosidase activity and protein or RNA isolation. Total RNA from yeast was isolated following the protocol described by Zitomer and Hall (31Zitomer R.S. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6320-6326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA from each sample was separated on a formaldehyde agarose gel, electroblotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probe prepared from a 560-bp polymerase chain reaction-generatedGCN4 fragment using the oligolabeling technique described by Feinberg and Vogelstein (32Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled 540-bpClaI fragment of ACT1 was used as internal standard. Hybridizing signals were quantified using a BAS-1500 PhosphorImaging scanner (Fuji). Yeast protein crude extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared as described (33Arndt K. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Protein contents were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). 25 μg of protein from crude cell extracts were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently analyzed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against the COOH terminus of Gcn4p. Pure Gcn4p (10 ng) expressed and isolated fromEscherichia coli (9Oliphant A.R. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 35Arndt K. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was loaded as a control. Immune complexes were visualized with an alkaline phosphatase ImmunoBlot assay kit (Bio-Rad). Gcn4p signals were quantified using the Molecular Analyst software from Bio-Rad. For calibration, a standard curve derived from measurements of defined amounts of pure Gcn4p was used. Polyclonal anti-Gcn4p antibodies were raised in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide containing the 60 COOH-terminal amino acids of Gcn4p. The peptide was linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde and injected subcutaneously after being mixed with an equal volume of incomplete Freud's adjuvant. After 5 weeks, additional injections (six times, once per week) served as boosts. The gel retardation assay using Gcn4 protein expressed inE. coli was described earlier (36Braus G. Mo¨sch H.-U. Vogel K. Hinnen A. Hütter R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The DNA probe was a32P-end-labeled synthetic 49-bp TRP4-UAS1 DNA fragment (37Mo¨sch H.U. Graf R. Schmidheini T. Braus G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The TRP4-UAS1 fragment was obtained by annealing of two synthetic oligonucleotides identical to theTRP4 promoter region −273 to −225 containing one GCRE site. 15 μg of protein extracts were incubated with 10 fmol of32P-radiolabeled probe, separated on a native 6% polyacylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. UAS1-Gcn4p signals were quantified using a BAS-1500 PhosphorImaging scanner (Fuji). β-Galactosidase activities of permeabilized yeast cells were determined by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside as a fluorogenic substrate (38Künzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultivated in minimal medium. After addition of 3-AT, specific β-galactosidase activities were assayed. Concentration of product formation during the reaction was determined based on a standard curve with commercial products (4-methylumbelliferone; Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Product concentrations were normalized to the reaction time and the optical density of the culture. One unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as 1 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone h−1ml−1 OD546−1. The given values are means from measurements of at least five independent cultures. The standard errors of the means were below 25%. We performed a kinetic analysis of the steady state amount of GCN4 mRNA after induction of the general control system by 3-AT. A yeast strain carrying a deletion of the chromosomal GCN4-locus (RH1796,Δgcn4 strain) was transformed with either the wild-typeGCN4 allele (pGCN4) or a mutated GCN4 allele (pGCN4m) on a centromer-based plasmid. The translational control of mRNA expression of the GCN4 allele of pGCN4m is abolished by point mutations in the start codons of the four uORFs (13Mueller P.P. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Histidine starvation was induced by adding 3-AT to exponentially growing cultures. Samples were taken at different time points and GCN4 mRNA levels were subsequently analyzed by Northern blot analysis and quantified. GCN4 expression from both alleles, wild-type GCN4 as well asGCN4 m, showed identical kinetics after induction by 3-AT (Fig. 1). A 2-fold increase inGCN4 mRNA steady state levels was reached after approximately 2 h and remained constant for at least 6 h. Expression of GCN4::lacZ fusions were measured to distinguish between initiation of GCN4transcription and the stability of GCN4 mRNA. A wild-type strain (RH1415) containing aGCN4::lacZ allele with point mutations in the AUG codons of the four uORFs (plasmid p227 (25Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) was grown in the absence and presence of 3-AT. Kinetic analysis of the specific β-galactosidase enzyme activity showed an approximately 2-fold increase after 3 h of histidine starvation (Fig.2). These results suggest that amino acid starvation induced by 3-AT results in an increased GCN4mRNA steady state level due to initiation of transcription and not due to increased GCN4 mRNA stability. The changes of Gcn4 protein levels in yeast cells after the switch to histidine starvation conditions were analyzed in Western blot hybridization experiments. Crude protein extracts were prepared from cells cultivated for different time periods after addition of 3-AT to the medium. Gcn4 protein levels were assayed using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the DNA-binding domain of Gcn4p. In a strain harboring the wild-type GCN4 allele, a biphasic increase in Gcn4p after addition of 3-AT was observed (Fig.3, A and C). Elevation of Gcn4 protein levels started after 20 min and increased by a factor of 3 during the first hour. Afterward, Gcn4 protein levels remained constant for 2 h. Three to four hours after induction an additional 2-fold increase was observed leading to a 6-fold total increase in the amount of Gcn4p after the initial induction by 3-AT. Expression of a GCN4::lacZ fusion construct (plasmid p180 (12Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)) after histidine starvation corroborated the biphasic increase in Gcn4p. A biphasic increase in the specific β-galactosidase activity was induced by 3-AT, suggesting that one step correlated to translational derepression and a second step comprises increased transcriptional initiation (Fig. 2). However, the obtained biphasic increase in the specific β-galactosidase activity of the GCN4::lacZ fusion correlate in time but not in value with the results obtained by Western blot analysis of Gcn4p shown before. One reason might be an increased stability of the chimeric Gcn4-β-galactosidase fusion protein in comparison to the native Gcn4 protein. To discriminate between transcriptional and translational control, we performed kinetic measurements of Gcn4 protein levels in a strain containing the GCN4 m allele that is no longer translationally regulated. The basal level of Gcn4 protein in these cells corresponds to the expression after the first elevation phase of the wild-type allele induced with 3-AT (Fig. 3, B andC). The Gcn4 protein level was as high as in the wild-type after 1 h of starvation. However, mutant cells exhibited only one elevation step in Gcn4 protein levels after 3–4 h under starvation conditions which was similar in time and value to the second increase in Gcn4 protein levels in wild-type cells, indicating that the second elevation phase is independent of the translational control by the four uORFs. In summary, our data suggest that amino acid starvation by 3-AT results in a first quick response due to translational control of already synthesized GCN4 mRNA, but there is a second slow response which might be due to increased transcriptional initiation at the GCN4 promoter. The increased amount of Gcn4 protein upon amino acid starvation prompted us to analyze whether increased protein levels also correlate with increased functionality. As a first function of the transcriptional activator Gcn4p we analyzed its ability to bind to its specific DNA-binding site. Therefore, we established a gel retardation assay using crude protein extracts. Yeast cells were grown 8 h on minimal medium in the presence or absence of 3-AT. Crude extracts including Gcn4p expressed from pGCN4 were tested for specific binding to a synthetic DNA fragment that contains a Gcn4p responsive element originally derived from the TRP4 promoter (37Mo¨sch H.U. Graf R. Schmidheini T. Braus G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Induction of the general control system by 3-AT resulted in an increased intensity of the retarded band, suggesting an increased DNA binding activity in yeast crude cell extracts. The increased DNA binding activity correlated with the increased amount of Gcn4 protein in the cell as described above, suggesting that the affinity of the protein to its DNA was unaffected and only the amount of DNA-binding protein increased (Fig. 4 A). The time course of the elevation of Gcn4p DNA binding ability was analyzed in the same crude protein extracts as examined by Western blot analysis. The increase in gel retardation activity also proceeded in two steps when Gcn4 protein was expressed from pGCN4 (Fig. 4,B and D). Within the first hour Gcn4 protein able to bind DNA increased by a factor of 3 and remained constant up to 3 h. After 4 h of starvation a second maximum of 5-fold total increase was reached. This biphasic increase correlated both in time and in value with the elevation of protein levels analyzed by Western blot experiments, suggesting that the ability of Gcn4p to bind to DNA correlates to the amount of protein available in the cell and is not further regulated under these conditions. Gel retardation analysis of crude protein extracts prepared from a yeast strain lacking the translational control of GCN4 gene expression showed only one elevation phase of Gcn4 protein bound to DNA in the assay. The level of Gcn4 protein able to bind DNA in vitro was approximately constant during the first 3 h after addition of 3-AT (Fig. 4 C). Nevertheless, the Gcn4p DNA binding level was as high as in the case of pGCN4 after 1 h of starvation (Fig. 4 D). An elevation could only be observed after 4 h of histidine starvation. This increase corresponds to the second increase as observed for pGCN4. Both elevation steps occurred 4 h after addition of 3-AT by the same value. This suggests the existence of an additional regulation mechanism ofGCN4 gene expression beyond the translational control dependent on the four uORFs in the GCN4 leader region. We wanted to analyze whether the two-step increase of the Gcn4 protein after 3-AT induced histidine starvation is also reflected in the induction of a general control regulated target gene. To make sure that even small changes in the activation of the Gcn4p regulated gene can be detected, we constructed an artificial general control reporter gene based on aCYC1::lacZ fusion construct (19Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The promotor region of the CYC1::lacZ gene was replaced by six Gcn4p responsive elements resulting in a highly sensitive general control regulated target gene. This construct was stably integrated into yeast strain RH1796 at its ura3–52locus. The consequences of the observed biphasic increase of the Gcn4p levels were monitored by the transactivation ability of Gcn4 protein using this Gcn4p regulatedCYC1::lacZ-reporter gene (Fig.5 A). Quantification of the Gcn4p dependent β-galactosidase activity in a kinetic induction experiment showed that the response to histidine starvation also occurs in two steps (Fig. 5 B). In a yeast strain containing the wild-type GCN4 allele, a first phase of increased CYC1::lacZ expression immediately started after addition of 3-AT. Induction by a factor of 2.5 was reached after 4 h and did not change up for to 6 h. After 6 h of histidine starvation, however, an additional 6-fold increase with respect to the basal level, that lasted until 8 h after induction, was measured. The basal level of the lacZ-reporter gene in uninduced yeast cells carrying pGCN4m was as high as in a strain harboring wild-type GCN4 after 4 h of starvation. This is in agreement with a constant derepression of the translational control ofGCN4. Accordingly, the specific β-galactosidase activity was constant during 4 h after addition of 3-AT and only a single elevation step of the lacZ-reporter gene was observed. This increase of β-galactosidase activity started 6 h after starvation, reaching a maximal level of induction after 8 h. We examined the time course of the Gcn4 protein elevation of yeast cells after switch to amino acid starvation cultivation medium induced by 3-aminotriazole. GCN4 mRNA is already present in the cell under nonstarvation conditions, but only under starvation conditions does efficient translation occur (39Abastado J.-P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this report, we find that amino acid starvation induced by 3-AT results in a biphasic response of the cell. A first step of increased GCN4expression is caused by translational control and depends on the four uORFs of the GCN4 leader region. As a consequence, more Gcn4 protein is produced within 20 min after histidine starvation. In addition, GCN4 mRNA levels increase and subsequently a second elevation phase of Gcn4 protein levels can be observed 4–6 h after induction. Accordingly, expression of a Gcn4p-dependent CYC1::lacZreporter gene also responds in two phases. Cells with a nonfunctional translational control of GCN4 show only the second phase of response under the same conditions. The elevation of GCN4 transcript levels after induction of the general control system raises the question of whether this increase is due to changes in stability of the GCN4 mRNA or whether it is due to an increased transcription of GCN4. TheGCN4::lacZ fusion constructs suggest that histidine starvation rather affects transcription initiation ofGCN4 than the stability of the mRNA. It has been shown that the gene expression of the Gcn4p homologues cpcAp ofAspergillus niger and CPC1 protein of Neurospora crassa are regulated at a transcriptional level (40Wanke C. Eckert S. Albrecht G. van Hartingsveldt W. Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A.M.J.J. Braus G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Paluh J.L. Orbach M.J. Legerton T.L. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, transcriptional regulators of GCN4 are not known yet. InS. cerevisiae, premature translation termination promotes rapid degradation of numerous mRNAs (42Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the four uORFs preceding the GCN4 coding region at which translational initiation and reinitiation events occur would function in a manner analogous to nonsense codons, promoting rapid degradation of the mRNA (43Peltz S.W. He F. Welch E. Jacobson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, previous studies demonstrated that theGCN4 transcript is not degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway and reported a half-life of 16–18 min ofGCN4 mRNA (44Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Peltz S.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whereas it cannot be excluded, that there is regulated GCN4 mRNA degradation in yeast, we do not think that this is important under the conditions we have tested here. The DNA binding activity and the ability to activate transcription of target genes both correlate with the amount of Gcn4 protein in the cell. However, there are quantitative differences between the ratio of Gcn4p levels and of β-galactosidase activities of correspondingGCN4::lacZ fusion constructs during the amino acid starvation kinetic experiments. This is presumably due to differences in protein stability compared with the native Gcn4 protein and the chimeric protein encoded by theGCN4::lacZ fusion constructs. The half-life of β-galactosidase expressed in S. cerevisiae is over 20 h (45Bachmair A. Filey D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). It is also known that the half-lives of chimeric β-galactosidase fusion proteins can possibly range between 3 min and over 20 h, depending on the nature of the amino acids at the amino terminus of the protein (45Bachmair A. Filey D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The usedGCN4::lacZ fusion constructs include only 55 amino acids of the amino terminus of Gcn4p excluding the reported instability region of Gcn4p (17Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the chimeric protein encoded by theGCN4::lacZ fusion lacking the translational control accumulates also under nonstarvation conditions. In contrast, Gcn4 protein under nonstarvation conditions is highly unstable with a reported half-life of 5 min (17Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, stabilization of Gcn4 protein plays an additional role under certain circumstances (17Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The observed results also raise the question of how a 6-fold increase in Gcn4p levels in the cell is sufficient to elevate expression of at least 40 genes 2–5-fold. One possibility would be an improved DNA binding ability of Gcn4p under starvation conditions as found for the human oncoprotein c-Jun that displays a regulated DNA binding activity (46Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It was shown that the DNA-binding domains of c-Jun and Gcn4p are functionally homologous (47Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 50: 841-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of distinct sites near the DNA-binding domain inhibits DNA-binding and dephosphorylation correlates with increased transactivation activity of c-Jun (46Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gcn4 protein levels and its ability to bind DNA in vitro correlate in time and value, suggesting that there is no such post-translational regulation of Gcn4p. Therefore, we conclude that the DNA binding ability is not affected under the tested conditions. Another possibility could be a regulated nuclear localization of Gcn4p. Such a regulation is shown for the yAP-1 protein (48Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The corresponding YAP1 gene encodes another member of the leucine zipper family and recognizes a Gcn4p DNA-binding sequence motif (49Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Upon imposition of oxidative stress, a small increase in the DNA binding capacity of yAP-1 protein occurs (48Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, the major change is at the level of nuclear localization; upon induction the yAP-1 protein relocalizes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (48Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated whether a similar transport regulation mechanism will be found for Gcn4p. In summary, our results suggest the existence of an additional mechanism to control Gcn4p levels upon amino acid limitation in yeast. So far, translational control via the uORFs in GCN4 has been found to be the major mechanism to regulate GCN4 expression. This report shows that upon prolonged amino acid starvation Gcn4p levels can be increased by a mechanism independent of the uORFs. Whether this mechanism includes elements of the known general control system or consists of as yet novel factors remains to be elucidated in the future.

These channels share a common hydrophobicity profile of two putative transmembrane domains (M1 and M2) connected with a large hydrophilic loop and intracellular N and C termini (10North R.A. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar). There is 50–65% amino acid sequence similarity overall between pairs of P2XR. In particular, the sequences from the N termini to the second transmembrane domains are relatively conserved, whereas the C-terminal tails display the least sequence similarity to each other (11Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the variations in the C-terminal structure has not been elucidated. P2XR subtypes differ with respect to their ligand selectivity profiles, antagonist sensitivity, and desensitization rates (10North R.A. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar, 12Surprenant A. Buell G. North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Based on differences in the desensitization kinetics, these channels can be divided into two groups: rapidly desensitizing channels (P2X1R and P2X3R) and slow desensitizing channels (P2X2R, P2X6R, and P2X7R) (11Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). P2X4R expressed in oocytes exhibits strong desensitization, but when expressed in HEK293 cells this channel desensitizes slowly (7Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Hollmann M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two experimental approaches have been used to study the molecular mechanism underlying P2XR desensitization, the construction of chimeric channels between slowly and rapidly desensitizing subtypes and the co-expression of both types (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 15Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chimeric studies suggest that the responsible domains for desensitization are localized within the two transmembrane regions of P2X1R and P2X3R (15Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the expression plasmids for these two channel types was also found to yield a P2XR with altered desensitization and agonist selectivity properties, indicating that such channels are presumably heteropolymers (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Recently, a new view about P2XR desensitization has emerged. The P2X2R splice variant, termed P2X2–2R or P2X2bR (16Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Simon J. Kidd E.J. Smith F.M. Chessell I.P. Murrell-Lagnado R. Humphrey P.P.A. Barnard E.A. Mol.

Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar), lacks a stretch of the C-terminal amino acids of the P2X2R molecule (Val370-Gln438) and encodes a functional channel that desensitizes faster than the wild-type. This observation suggests the importance of the spliced segment for prolonged Ca2+ influx through wild-type channels. The P2X2–2R and several other splice variants were observed in neuronal and pituitary tissues (17Simon J. Kidd E.J. Smith F.M. Chessell I.P. Murrell-Lagnado R. Humphrey P.P.A. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In pituitary somatotrophs, co-expression of spliced and wild-type P2X2R was shown to provide an effective mechanism for controlled Ca2+ influx (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In this study, the structural elements in the P2X2R C terminus that are responsible for prolonged activation of wild-type channels were examined by generating diverse receptor mutants and monitoring [Ca2+]i in transfected single cells. For this purpose, several experimental approaches were employed. Initially, a series of C-terminal truncated mutants were produced to narrow the region(s) needed for the slow desensitization pattern of P2X2R. Subsequently, triple alanine replacement and single amino acid deletion mutants were constructed to precisely identify the amino acid sequence that is critical for long lasting Ca2+signaling by wild-type channels. Finally, spliced amino acids from the C terminus of the wild-type channel were gradually added to the splice channel to regain the slow desensitizing pattern of Ca2+signaling in response to prolonged agonist stimulation. The results indicate that a polypeptide region containing Pro373, Lys374, His375, and Pro376 residues is important for prolonged Ca2+ influx in agonist-occupied wild-type channels. A 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA fragment of the P2X2R, obtained from rat pituitary by reverse transcription-PCR (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar), was subcloned into pBluescript II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in itsXhoI/EcoRV site and used for PCR as a template to generate receptor mutants. For construction of C-terminal truncated receptors, in-frame premature stop codons were introduced in PCR primers at corresponding amino acid positions Ser431, Leu414, Pro392, and Arg371. For alanine-scanning mutagenesis, three contiguous amino acids were changed to alanine in the C-terminal portion starting from Arg371to Ile391. New restriction sites for PstI were engineered to identify alanine mutant clones. A single amino acid deletion from the wild-type sequence and gradual additions of amino acids, which were spliced out from the wild-type, to the variant C terminus, were also generated by PCR. All PCR fragments for construction of mutant receptors were sucloned into pBluescript II and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After confirming whole sequences of the PCR products, these mutations were cut withClaI and XbaI and transferred to theClaI/XbaI site of the P2X2R expression vector, pME/P2X2R (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar), to substitute corresponding sequences. Cell culture and transfection of the GT1–7 neurons were performed as described previously (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Briefly, GT1 neurons were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium and Ham's F12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. On the day of transfection, 3 μg of the plasmid DNA was mixed with 7 μl of LipofectAMINETM in 3 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and then applied to cells (106 cells/60-mm dish). After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium and cells were allowed to grow for 24 h. For single cell calcium recordings, transfected cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. For single cell [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with 2 μm fura-2/AM in phenol red- and ATP-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were subsequently washed with Krebs-Ringer solution containing 1.2 mm Ca2+ and kept for at least ½ h in this medium prior to measurements. All experiments were performed in cells bathed in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 1.2 mmCa2+ and 100 nm nifedipine at room temperature. Nifedipine was added to exclude the participation of non-inactivatingl-type Ca2+ channels, which are expressed in GT1–7 cells (19Krsmanovic L.Z. Stojilkovic S.S. Merelli F. Dufour S.M. Virmani M.A. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Coverslips with cells were mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor Digital Fluorescence Microscopy System (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). Cells were examined under a 40× oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340 and 380 nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was measured. The ratio of light intensities,F 340/F 380, which reflects changes in Ca2+ concentration, was simultaneously followed in several single cells. The statistical significance of mono- and multiexponential fits were assessed according to the “extra sum of squares” principle; p < 0.01 was considered significant (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The results for desensitization rate were expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t-test was used for statistical comparison among means where applicable. Differences in a p value less than 0.01 were considered significant. In all figures showing [Ca2+]i changes, the tracings are normalized with respect to the maximum in the amplitude (100%). The presence of multiple splice variants of P2X2R in various cell types has been reported by several groups (16Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Simon J. Kidd E.J. Smith F.M. Chessell I.P. Murrell-Lagnado R. Humphrey P.P.A. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). One of these transcripts, P2X2–2R, forms a functional channel when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, GT1–7, and HEK293 cells. In our study, the immortalized GT1–7 neurons were used as an expression system because of the following three reasons. First, these cells express neither P2Y calcium-mobilizing receptors nor P2X receptor channels, as documented by the inability of 100 μm ATP to rise [Ca2+]i in cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient as well as Ca2+-containing medium. Second, the pattern of single cell [Ca2+]i responses and the profiles of isolated Ca2+ currents sufficiently demonstrated a marked difference in the desensitization kinetics between wild-type and splice variant subunits (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Since the rates of desensitization for these channels were comparable in both Ca2+ current and [Ca2+]i measurements, here we employed only [Ca2+]i measurements. Finally, our preliminary experiments for RNA and protein levels confirmed that further splicing of RNA transcripts for the wild-type channel molecule does not occur in these neuronal cells, allowing channel subunit-specific characterization. The P2X2–2R lacks a stretch of C-terminal amino acids (Val370-Gln438), indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 1 A. Comparison between the wild-type and spliced channels suggested that they do not differ in terms of their activation properties, EC50 values to ATP, maximum current/Ca2+responses to ATP, or the recovery times from desensitization (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). They did, however, exhibit different rates of desensitization (Fig.1 B). The spliced channels P2X2–2R desensitized relatively rapidly and completely (within 2–3 min), whereas the wild-type channels desensitized slowly and incompletely (16Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Simon J. Kidd E.J. Smith F.M. Chessell I.P. Murrell-Lagnado R. Humphrey P.P.A. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, the presence of the Val370-Gln438 sequence in wild-type channels is critical for their slow desensitization. To elucidate the functional role of the C-terminal tail in control of the rate of desensitization, four truncated P2X2R were constructed and expressed in GT1–7 neurons (Fig. 1 A). Removal of the putative cytoplasmic tail up to Pro392resulted in mutant receptors that lost the last 81 amino acids of P2X2R and did not alter the pattern of [Ca2+]i responses to 100 μm ATP (Fig. 1 B, three central tracings). This argues against the potential importance of the proline-rich segment (20Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), observed only within the P2X2R subunits, in activation and desensitization of these channels. In contrast, removal of the polypeptide sequence to Arg371 resulted in desensitization rates that were indistinguishable from those observed in P2X2–2R (Fig. 1,two bottom tracings). The truncated channel also showed a significant reduction in the amplitude of Ca2+ response to 100 μm ATP ([Ca2+]i (ratio): P2X2R = 3.12 ± 0.24 (n = 47) versusP2X2R-Arg371 = 1.42 ± 0.18 (n = 18)), indicating that the activation properties of this truncated channel were also altered. Since the first 69 amino acids in this segment are missing in the spliced channels, these results also indicate that the C-terminal tail of the P2X2–2R can substitute for the Arg371-Ile391 segment but only in a transient activation of these channels. To localize the C-terminal region responsible for the desensitization properties of the wild-type channel, specific amino acid(s) in the Arg371-Ile391 segment were mutated, whereas the residual part of the C-terminal was retained. For this purpose, we used the alanine-scanning mutagenesis method and constructed seven mutant channels, in which three contiguous amino acids were substituted for triple alanine residues: RTP373/AAA, KHP376/AAA, SSR379/AAA, WPV382/AAA, TLA385/AAA, LVL388/AAA, and GQI391/AAA (Fig.2 A). All constructs were functional in terms of the portion of cells expressing channels and the amplitudes of [Ca2+]i in response to 100 μm ATP (not shown). The last five mutant channels (SSR379/AAA, WPV382/AAA, TLA385/AAA, LVL388/AAA, and GQI391/AAA) also showed no difference in the rate of desensitization when compared with wild-type channels. In contrast, RTP373/AAA and KHP376/AAA mutants had a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the rate of desensitization compared with wild-type channels (Fig. 2, Band C). Although the RTP373/AAA channel resulted in a faster decline in [Ca2+]i than the KHP376/AAA channel, neither rate of desensitization for these mutant channels fully reached that of the spliced channels (Fig.2, B and C). This result indicates that the critical amino acids for development of a slow desensitizing pattern of Ca2+ signaling by P2X2R are located within the C-terminal segment Arg371-Pro376 (Fig.2 A, gray area). When the amino acid sequences for the seven subunits of the P2XR family were aligned according to their hydrophobicities, the putative cytoplasmic C termini show very little similarity in terms of amino acid moiety and length (11Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the polypeptide sequence Arg371-Pro376 of P2X2R contains three conserved residues, Arg371, Pro373, and Lys374, among four members of slow desensitizing receptors, P2X2R, P2X5R, P2X6R, and P2X7R (Fig. 3 A). These residues are not present in P2X4R, which desensitizes slowly when expressed in HEK293 cells (21Evans R.J. Surprenant A. North R.A. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Lake Clifton, NJ1997: 43Google Scholar), but rapidly when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (13Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Hollmann M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3684-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 14Seguela P. Haghighi A. Soghomonian J. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 448-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, threonine at position 372 in the P2X2R tail is a potential phosphorylation site that can be modified by protein kinase C, (R/K)XX(T/S)X(R/K), or type II calmodulin-dependent kinase, (R/K)XX(T/S) (X represents any amino acid). To address the role of the conserved residues, as well as the Thr373 residue, in the desensitization pattern of the wild-type channel, mutant receptors with single amino acid deletions from the wild-type C-terminal were compared with the splicing variant P2X2–2R or wild-type receptor. Elimination of four individual residues in this segment indicated the importance of two amino acids, Pro373 and Lys374, in the desensitization pattern of wild-type channels. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, both mutants exhibited an enhanced rate of desensitization when compared with wild-type channels, but neither channel alone was able to mimic the pattern of desensitization of the spliced channel. On the other hand, deletions of Arg371 or Thr372 resulted in no detectable change in the desensitization rate. The functional properties of the P2X2R C-terminal were further analyzed by mutagenesis studies, in which amino acid residues spliced out from the wild-type tail were gradually added back to the splice site at the P2X2–2R C terminus (Fig.4 A). The common 34 amino acid end for P2X2R and P2X2–2R was also kept in these mutant receptors. In all mutants, the amplitudes of [Ca2+]i in response to 100 μm ATP were comparable with that of the wild-type channel. Additions of three amino acids in P2X2–2 + V-T372 to the splice site did not result in an apparent change in the desensitization rate. Additional insertions of four amino acids from the wild-type sequence resulted in a gradual decrease in the rate of desensitization when compared with that of the spliced channels (P2X2–2 + V-P373, P2X2–2 + V-K374, P2X2 + V-H375, and P2X2 + V-P376 in Fig. 4, B and C). These data indicate that insertion of the Pro373-Lys374-His375-Pro376sequence is required for sustained Ca2+ influx. Thus, it is likely that the conserved Pro373 and Lys374residues comprise a part of the functional region that is critical for development of the slow desensitization pattern of P2X2R. These results indicate that desensitization rates in [Ca2+]i responses following activation of wild-type, spliced, and mutant P2X2R channels correlate with the C-terminal structures of expressed channels. Earlier studies have shown comparable rates of desensitization for wild-type and spliced channels in isolated Ca2+ current and [Ca2+]i measurements (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar), as well as in total current measurements (16Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This does not exclude the need for current measurements through these non-selective cation channels and their mutants in future experiments. However, control of Ca2+influx through P2X2R channels is physiologically important because this ion represents an intracellular messenger that regulates a number of cellular functions, including plasma membrane excitability, hormone secretion, de novo protein synthesis, and apoptosis (22Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). In this respect, the wild-type channel induces a prolonged, high amplitude Ca2+ signal, similar to that observed in apoptotic cells (23Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Conversely, deletion of the Pro373-Lys374-His375-Pro376sequence as a consequence of alternative splicing generates a channel capable of limiting Ca2+ influx into the cells during prolonged agonist activation. Furthermore, the co-expression of wild-type and spliced channels provides an effective mechanism to sustain Ca2+ signaling but protects the cells from overloading with Ca2+ (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). For example, pituitary somatotrophs express both spliced and wild-type channel subunits, resulting in rapid but incomplete desensitization. This leads to the biphasic pattern of Ca2+ signaling, which is composed of an early spike phase and sustained plateau phase (18Koshimizu, T., Tomic, M., Van Goor, F., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (1998) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The probable heteromeric assembly of wild-type P2X2R with rapidly desensitizing P2X3R may also compose a channel with controlled cationic influx (24Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this mechanism is potentially available only for cells that express both subunits. In conclusion, the presence of specific residues in the C terminus of P2X2R, with two conserved amino acids contributing significantly to the development of a sustained Ca2+ influx through these channels, may indicate a common mechanism of desensitization for the P2XR family. The Lys375 residue is common to four slow desensitizing channels, P2X2R, P2X5R, P2X6R, and P2X7R, whereas Pro374 is only present in three of them, P2X2R, P2X6R, and P2X7R. On the other hand, the rapidly desensitizing P2X1R and P2X3R do not contain these two amino acids (11Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These residues are also not present in P2X4R, a channel that desensitizes rapidly when expressed in oocytes (13Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Hollmann M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3684-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 14Seguela P. Haghighi A. Soghomonian J. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 448-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The removal of the Pro373-Pro376 segment by splicing resulted in the rapidly desensitizing P2X2–2R (16Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Simon J. Kidd E.J. Smith F.M. Chessell I.P. Murrell-Lagnado R. Humphrey P.P.A. Barnard E.A. Mol.

Certainly, future experiments with insertion of this segment into rapidly desensitizing channels and its deletion from slow desensitizing P2XR will provide important insight into the functional regulation of P2XR by their C termini."
https://openalex.org/W2012895428,"UvrA is one of the key Escherichia coli proteins involved in removing DNA damage during the process of nucleotide excision repair. The relatively low concentrations (nanomolar) of the protein in the normal cells raise the potential questions about its stability in vivo under both normal and stress conditions. In vitro, UvrA at low concentrations is shown to be stabilized to heat inactivation by E. colimolecular chaperones DnaK or the combination of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. These chaperone proteins allow sub-nanomolar concentrations of UvrA to load UvrB through >10 cycles of incision. Guanidine hydrochloride-denatured UvrA was reactivated by DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE to as much as 50% of the native protein activity. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that DnaK bound denatured UvrA in the absence of ATP. UV survival studies of a DnaK-deficient strain indicated an 80-fold increased sensitivity to 100 J/m2 of ultraviolet light (254 nm) as compared with an isogenic wild-type strain. Global repair analysis indicated a reduction in the extent of pyrimidine dimer and 6–4 photoproduct removal in the DnaK-deficient cells. These results suggest that molecular chaperonins participate in nucleotide excision repair by maintaining repair proteins in their properly folded state.

These results suggest that molecular chaperonins participate in nucleotide excision repair by maintaining repair proteins in their properly folded state. The UvrA protein is an essential subunit of UvrABC endonuclease (1Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plays an important role in DNA damage recognition and nuclease assembly (2Zou Y. Lui T.-M. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Binding of UvrA to damaged DNA is specific for a local conformational change at the site of the damaged base (2Zou Y. Lui T.-M. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Van Houten B. Snowden A.

Landes Company Biomedical Publishers, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). The primary mechanistic function of UvrA in the UvrABC system is to interact with UvrB to form a heterotrimer (UvrA2B), which helps to locate the site of DNA damage. After dissociation from the UvrA2B-DNA complex, UvrA is believed to load more UvrB proteins onto the site of DNA damage (5Orren D.K. Selby C.P. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 780-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High concentrations of UvrA have been found to be inhibitory to the incision reaction in vitro (6Snowden A. Van Houten B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol.

Res. 1993; 294: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is due either to competition between UvrA2 and the UvrA2B complex for binding to the damaged DNA, a lack of UvrA2dissociation from the UvrA2B-DNA pre-incision complex, or to the formation of non-productive dead end complexes (which could be caused by partially denatured or improperly folded proteins). Within the cell, the relative concentrations and the interactions between UvrA and UvrB must be well controlled to allow UvrA to participate in multiple rounds of incision. One group of proteins which often help to facilitate proper protein-protein interactions are the heat shock or chaperone proteins. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein(s); BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene-diol epoxide, 7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropylthiogalactopyranoside; 6–4 PP, 6–4 photoproduct.(for reviews, see Refs. 10Gething M.J.

In these processes, heat shock proteins function in vivo as molecular chaperones to help identify and refold denatured or improperly folded proteins, preventing aggregation. The major heat shock protein families include Hsp104, Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60/GroEL, and the small Hsps (10Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3602) Google Scholar, 30Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, two heat shock protein families, DnaK (Hsp70) and GroEL (Hsp60), have been widely studied. In particular, DnaK is expressed at a high level, about 1% of the total cellular protein at 37 °C (31Pedersen S. Bloch P.L. Reeh S. Neidhardt F.C. Cell. 1978; 14: 179-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Such abundance, and this conservation throughout procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms, implies a generally important role for heat shock proteins functioning as molecular chaperonins in many biological processes within the cell. Here we report interactions of UvrA with heat shock proteins of the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE family. Our results indicate the following: 1) UvrA is heat-labile; 2) UvrA is stabilized by DnaK or the combination of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE under normal in vitro conditions; and 3) UvrA in the presence of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE undergoes multiple cycles of UvrB loading, leading to increased incision efficiency; 4) denatured UvrA can be refolded and reactivated by DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE; 5) a DnaK mutant strain shows decreased survival after UV and a lower extent of photoproduct removal. UvrA was purified fromE. coli strain MH1 UvrA containing the overproducing plasmid, pSST10 (graciously supplied by L. Grossman, Johns Hopkins University), in which the uvrA gene is under the control of the heat-inducible PL promoter. UvrB and UvrC were overproduced fromE. coli strain CH296 containing plasmids pUNC211 and pDR3274, respectively (graciously supplied by A. Sancar, University of North Carolina). All three proteins were purified to homogeneity as described previously (32Zou Y. Walker R. Bassett H. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All heat shock proteins used in this study were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies. The 50-base pair oligonucleotides containing a single BPDE adduct, (+)-cis-anti-BPDE, were prepared as described previously (2Zou Y. Lui T.-M. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated BPDE-11-mers (30 pmol) (generously supplied by Dr. Nick Geacintov, Department of Chemistry, New York University) were ligated with equal moles of 20-mer (5′-terminally labeled with 32P) and phosphorylated 19-mer in the presence of the complementary strand 50-mer and T4 DNA ligase in a 30-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 50 μg/ml BSA. The ligation was carried out at 16 °C for 12 h. After ligation, products were purified and then reannealed with the non-damaged 50-mer complementary strand and then purified on an 8% polyacrylamide native gel. The double-stranded character and homogeneity of the 50-base pair substrates were examined by a restriction assay (2Zou Y. Lui T.-M. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gel under denaturing conditions. UvrA (0.25 or 1.0 nm) was incubated in the presence or absence of DnaK or the combination of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE at 37 °C for discrete periods of time or at various concentrations, as indicated in the figure legends, in 10 μl of UvrABC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP). After heat inactivation, the 5′-terminally labeled BPDE-DNA substrate (2 nm) with UvrB (200 nm), UvrC (50 nm), and more ATP (1 mm) were mixed into the reaction to initialize the UvrABC-mediated incision of the adduct at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to 25 mm, followed by heating at 90 °C for 3 min. The incision products were then analyzed in a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel under denaturing conditions with TBE buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mmboric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). UvrA (0.25 or 1.0 nm), UvrB (200 nm), and UvrC (50 nm) were first mixed in the absence or presence of heat shock proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE 0.9/0.01/0.2 μm) in 60 μl of UvrABC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP). Then the 5′-terminally labeled BPDE-DNA substrate was added immediately to initiate the incision at 37 °C. After the indicated periods of incision, a 10-μl aliquot was withdrawn and heated at 90 °C for 3 min to stop the reaction. The incised products were analyzed in a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel under denaturing conditions. The E. coli strains used in this study are as follows: MC4100, wild-type cells; BB1553, a ΔdnaK52 sidB1 mutant; GW8306, BB1553 cells containing pJM41 plasmid encoding wild-type DnaK (pBR322-P lac dnaK +); and GW8304, BB1553 cells harboring the pBR322 plasmid (all strains were generously provided by G. C. Walker, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) (33Bukau B. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4027-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 51McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 764-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sidB1 mutation allows stable propagation of cells in which dnak has been deleted.SidB1 is a mutation in rpoH, the gene for ς32. The BB1553 cells have a similar growth rate to that of wild-type cells, MC4100 (33Bukau B. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4027-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MC4100 and BB1553 cells were grown in LB. GW8304 and GW8306 cells were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 60 μg/ml kanamycin, and 0.5 mm IPTG. Cells were grown to saturation overnight at 30 °C and then diluted by about 200-fold into the same medium, followed by continuous growth at the same temperature to an optical density of 0.4 at 600 nm. Cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended to the original density in 0.9% NaCl solution. Irradiation of the cell suspensions was performed with a germicidal lamp (254 nm) at 100 microwatts for various periods to damage the cells. The irradiated cells were then appropriately diluted with 0.9% NaCl solution on ice, plated on LB agar (for MC4100 and BB1553 cells) or LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 60 μg/ml kanamycin, and 0.5 mm IPTG (for GW8304 and GW8306 cells), and incubated at 30 °C in the dark. Plates containing 100–800 colonies were counted to calculate the survival. Cells were grown at 30 °C in Davis medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, and 1 μg/ml vitamin B1. Cultures were grown to mid log phase (approximately 3 × 108 cells/ml) as measured by A 600. Cells were collected by filtration on 0.45-mm Millipore filters, washed with prewarmed Davis medium, and resuspended in Davis medium. Cells were UV-irradiated in a glass Petri dish on a rotating platform under a germicidal lamp with a dose of 40 J/m2 ultraviolet-light (254 nm) and placed in a flask containing growth supplements. Samples of the culture were removed at various times and mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold NET (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA) buffer. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in TE, pH 8.0, and were lysed by addition of 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 100 mg/ml RNase A and incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Proteinase K (100 mg/ml) and Sarkosyl (0.5%) were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 2.5m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of 95% ethanol. Purified DNA was resuspended in TE, pH 8.0. The DNA was lightly sonicated using a Branson sonifier, and the concentration was determined by fluorometry using Hoechst 33258. The repair of cyclobutane dimers (CPD) and 6–4 photoproducts (6–4 PP) in each sonicated DNA sample was determined using an immunoassay. Following denaturation by boiling, 25 ng (CPD) or 250 ng (6–4PP) of each DNA sample was loaded in triplicate onto a Hybond N+membrane using a slot blot apparatus. The membrane was incubated for 2 h in the presence of mouse antibodies against either CPDs (TDM-2) or 6–4 PPs (64M-2) diluted 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline (antibodies were a generous gift of Dr. Toshio Mori). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5000 and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequent analysis on phosphor screens (Bio-Rad). UvrA protein (126 nm) was inactivated by incubation in 21 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl at 30 °C for 30 min. The denatured protein (0.5 μl) was then diluted 125-fold into the refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP), with or without the heat shock proteins DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (1.0/0.03/0.64 μm) and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for the periods indicated. After the incubation, aliquots of the refolding mixture were added with UvrB (200 nm), UvrC (50 nm), more ATP (1 mm), and the 5′-terminally labeled BPDE-DNA substrate (2 nm) to start the incision reactions. The incision was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min. The incised products were then analyzed in the polyacrylamide sequencing gel under denaturing conditions. UvrA (0.25–5 nm) was first incubated with 145 nm DnaK (StressGen Biotechnologies) at 37 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of IM buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm DTT). Murine monoclonal anti-DnaK (StressGen Biotechnologies) antibody (1 μg) was added to the mixture, which was then incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. After the incubation, the sample was mixed with 12 μg of swollen protein A-Sepharose 4B fast flow beads (Sigma) and continuously incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C for another hour. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were removed. The Immunobeads were washed with IM buffer at 4 °C three times. The beads were mixed with 20 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. The mixture was loaded onto an 8% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresed for separation. The gel was blotted to a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Hoefer electrotransfer unit in a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 10% MeOH. The membrane was then treated with rabbit anti-UvrA polyclonal following the ECL Western blotting procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to identify the UvrA protein bands. Models of the action mechanism of the UvrABC system indicate that UvrA is capable of loading multiple UvrB molecules at damaged sites (1Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas UvrA has been shown to turn over on randomly damaged plasmids (5Orren D.K. Selby C.P. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 780-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have been unable to demonstrate its turnover on defined DNA substrates containing a site-specific BPDE-N2-guanine adduct (2Zou Y. Lui T.-M. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since UvrB loading takes several minutes, we reasoned that UvrA at dilute concentrations might be heat-labile, and molecular chaperone proteins might help stabilize UvrA. Fig. 1 shows the thermal stability of UvrA at 37 °C in the absence and presence of all three heat shock proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE). The thermal stability of UvrA was assessed by the incision activity of UvrABC system on a DNA substrate containing a single site-specific BPDE adduct. To characterize UvrA specifically under conditions where other components were in excess and would not significantly affect the results, a limited concentration of UvrA was used in our experiments, relative to the DNA substrate and the UvrB and UvrC subunits. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of the heat shock proteins, UvrA quickly lost its activity at 37 °C, while the presence of the heat shock proteins greatly protected UvrA from inactivation. Since the lost enzymatic activity was not restored after subsequent incubation with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (data not shown), it appears that the heat leads to the irreversible aggregation of UvrA. The effects of heat shock proteins on the UvrA stabilization were further examined as shown in Fig. 2. UvrA was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of heat shock proteins, and UvrA stability was assessed by incision activity as before. In the absence of heat shock proteins, UvrA failed to withstand the physiological temperature of 37 °C for 30 min and lost its ability to support incision. Acetylated BSA provided a little, if any, stabilization of UvrA. In contrast, UvrA activity, as measured UvrABC incision efficiency, dramatically increased with increasing concentrations of the heat shock proteins (Fig. 2, a and b). These results suggest a specific interaction of the heat shock proteins with UvrA. Although DnaJ and GrpE work together to help DnaK-mediated refolding of polypeptides (12Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 34Banecki B. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6137-6143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we observed no significant differences in the protection of UvrA from denaturing when DnaJ and GrpE were added with DnaK. It appears that DnaK uses its binding/releasing/rebinding power, driven by ATP binding (35Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), to stabilize UvrA. The effects of DnaK on the thermal stability of UvrA were further confirmed by a gel mobility shift assay for the binding of UvrA to the BPDE-DNA substrate under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 c, heat shock proteins helped to stabilize binding of UvrA to the BPDE substrate. The effects of adding heat shock proteins during the incision are shown in Fig. 3. Although the excess of UvrB and UvrC preserves some UvrA activity in the absence of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, much higher incision efficiency has been achieved in the presence of the heat shock proteins, especially for the lower UvrA concentration. There is even a significant difference in the initial rates of incision. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, the majority of BPDE-DNA substrate molecules (20 pmol) has been incised even by 1.25 pmol of UvrA (in dimer) in 1 h, at a stoichiometric ratio of DNA/UvrA2 of 16:1. In this case, a single UvrA dimer molecule has loaded at least 10 UvrB molecules. From these experiments, it is clear that UvrA turned over efficiently during the incision. These results are consistent with a previous report (5Orren D.K. Selby C.P. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 780-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of those with higher concentrations of UvrA and a damage-containing plasmid but with the absence of heat shock proteins. One of the most important characteristics of heat shock proteins is their ability to refold denatured protein substrates into their native structures and to allow restoration of their enzymatic activities. To explore the relationship of UvrA with E. coli heat shock proteins of the Hsp70 family, we conducted UvrA reactivation experiments. To avoid aggregation among the unfolded polypeptides, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride was used instead of thermal denaturation. After the inactivation of UvrA, the denatured protein was diluted 1:125 into refolding buffer containing DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE to allow restoration of the activity. To determine the background activity, the denatured UvrA was also diluted into the same buffer without heat shock proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, the heat shock proteins were able to restore about 50% of the native incision activity of UvrA within 10 min. As a control, BSA or DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE in the absence of ATP showed no or little power to reactivate UvrA (Fig. 4 b). Individually, the member of the Hsp70 family showed some ability to restore UvrA activity, but the combination of all three provided the highest level of reactivation of unfolded UvrA. The reactivation of UvrA by DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE strongly suggests a direct interaction of the heat shock proteins with UvrA. We therefore investigated the potential binding between denatured UvrA and DnaK in an immunoprecipitation assay that has been widely used for study of protein-protein interactions (43Springer T.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). In this assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), native UvrA was heated at 37 °C in the presence of DnaK in a buffer containing no ATP. Then DnaK antibody was added and allowed to bind to DnaK as well as to any potential UvrA-DnaK complex. Treatment with Immunobeads, which recognize the antibody, followed by centrifugation, allows the separation of the bead-bound proteins from the proteins that are free in solution. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with UvrA antibody (αUvrA) on Western blots. As shown in Fig.5, the identified bands indicate that DnaK acting as molecular chaperone does bind to UvrA in this assay. This binding may act to prevent UvrA from denaturing and aggregating (Fig. 5). The results from the in vitro studies suggested a potential role for heat shock proteins in nucleotide excision repair in vivo. To help confirm this idea, we conducted in vivo experiments to study the UV sensitivity of DnaK-deficient cells as compared with wild-type cells. Fig. 6 demonstrates the survival of wild-type cells MC4100 and BB1553 mutant (ΔdnaK52 sidB1) (33Bukau B. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4027-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) versus UV dose. In comparison to wild-type cells, BB1553 cells displayed significantly more sensitivity to UV irradiation at various doses and were about 80-fold more sensitive at 100 J/m2. As a control, BB1553 mutant cells carrying the plasmid, pJM41, which encodes DnaK under an IPTG-induciblelac promoter showed similar UV resistance as wild-type cells (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that the dnaK deletion, but the sidB1 mutation, conferred UV sensitivity. Since both wild-type and mutant cells grew at the similar rate at 30 °C (33Bukau B. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4027-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), one of the possible explanations for these results is that the DnaK deletion mutant cells may have a limited capacity for nucleotide excision repair, due to the reduction of UvrA activity. This hypothesis was tested below. The increased UV sensitivity exhibited by BB1553 cells could result from a number of different factors including lack of DNA replication resumption or slower kinetics of DNA repair. In order to investigate the latter, BB1553 and MC4100 were irradiated with 40 J/m2 of ultraviolet light (254 nm), and the frequency of pyrimidine dimers and 6–4 photoproducts was determined by DNA slot blot analysis using specific monoclonal antibodies to each photoproduct. The results collected in Fig.7 indicate that BB1553 cells, DnaK-deficient, had slower rates of repair of 6–4 photoproducts and lower extents of repair for both types of DNA photoproducts. These results are entirely consistent with the in vitro results indicating DnaK is necessary for the turnover of UvrA and that without the action of DnaK in vivo there is a limited number of active UvrA molecules that would lead to lower extents of repair. UvrA is a critical protein in E. coli nucleotide excision repair because of its direct role in damage recognition and in guiding UvrB to the damaged site. In this report we sought to understand why UvrA could not act catalytically during incision reactions on defined substrates containing a site-specific lesion. In the course of these studies we found the following. 1) Heat shock proteins allowed UvrA to participate in multiple rounds of UvrB loading and to act catalytically in the incision reaction. 2) DnaK or the combination of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE helped to protect UvrA from thermal denaturation and irreversible inactivation. 3) DnaK interacted directly with denatured UvrA forming a protein-protein complex. 4) Denatured but not aggregated UvrA could be reactivated by DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE to up to ~50% of the native protein activity. 5) UV survival and repair kinetics in a DnaK-deficient cells indicate an important in vivo role for DnaK in nucleotide excision repair, presumably by its interaction with UvrA. The dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE genes ofE. coli were first identified by mapping mutations that were unable to support λ bacteriophage replication (44Yochem J. Uchida H. Sunshine M. Saito H. Georgopoulos C.P. Feiss M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis indicated that these genes encode heat shock proteins that are ubiquitous throughout nature (11Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 12Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). These proteins function as molecular chaperones to maintain proteins in the properly folded state. For example, Walker and co-workers (45Donnelly C.E. Walker G.C. J Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6117-6125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that GroE heat shock protein is absolutely required for SOS-induced mutagenesis, presumably through its stabilization of UmuC. Whereas earlier studies indicated that UV light and naladixic acid were able to induce DnaK and GroEL in an SOS-independent manner (46Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no enhanced survival functions have been attributed to the induction of these proteins. Experiments presented in Fig. 6 clearly show that a DnaK-deletion strain, BB1553, is significantly more UV-sensitive than an isogenic wild-type strain. Furthermore repair kinetics of 6–4 PP and CPD in these two strains (Fig. 7) indicate that loss of DnaK activity leads to a decrease in the overall extent of repair for both CPD and 6–4 PP and a slower rate of repair for 6–4 PP. These in vivo findings are entirely consistent with ourin vitro results that indicate that the addition of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE to UvrA leads to increased rate and extent of incision of a defined substrate containing a single BPDE-N 2 guanine adduct (Fig. 3). UvrA is extremely heat-labile when in dilute concentrations, with at½ of less than 5 min at 37 °C (Figs. 1 and 2). However, the addition of DnaK either singularly or with DnaJ and GrpE greatly stabilized UvrA to heat denaturation and led to multiple loadings of UvrB. The data presented in this work demonstrate that DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE directly interact as molecular chaperones with UvrA to keep UvrA in its native state. It is believed that exposed hydrophobic side chains of denatured proteins are the primary determinants for DnaK binding (47Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar,48Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The analysis of crystal structure of DnaK complexed with a peptide at its substrate-binding site has indicated that the binding of DnaK was centered to its substrate on hydrophobic residues that become completely buried in a deep pocket on DnaK (42Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Herdrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). This suggests that DnaK binds to unfolded proteins that expose hydrophobic residues on their surface. In our experiments, UvrA was denatured by heating at 37 °C, and UvrA may have aggregated in the absence of chaperones, resulting in irreversible loss of UvrA enzymatic activity. Incubation of the UvrA aggregate with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE failed to recover any UvrA activity (data not shown). In the presence of DnaK, non-native UvrA was protected from aggregation or misfolding most likely by the binding of DnaK to the UvrA. UvrA after denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride was reactivated up to about 50% of the original activity by DnaK or the combination of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE in the presence of ATP. The difference between the heat and guanidine hydrochloride treatments is that the former results in aggregation of UvrA and the latter leads to the formation of unfolded UvrA without aggregation. Our results indicated that although there were no significant differences between DnaK or the combination of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE in heat stabilization of UvrA, the combination of all three proteins was evidently more efficient in reactivating unfolded UvrA (Fig. 4). A similar observation was reported for the interactions of DnaK or DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE with RNA polymerase by Skowyra et al. (18Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and Ziemienowicz et al. (49Ziemienowicz A. Skowyra D. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25425-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in reactivation may be attributed to a higher efficiency for DnaK working together with coenzymes of DnaJ and GrpE. DnaJ has been reported to stimulate the ATP hydrolysis of DnaK to form ADP-DnaK intermediate that binds peptide substrate tightly (39Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 50Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Then GrpE dissociates the ADP from DnaK, resulting in the release of substrate (36Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 38Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In conclusion, data presented here clearly show that DnaK stabilizes UvrA from heat inactivation and allows UvrA to act catalytically duringin vitro incision reactions. Measurements of in vivo repair kinetics and UV survival of a DnaK-deficientE. coli strain clearly indicate a role for DnaK in nucleotide excision repair. Future studies will be directed toward understanding whether DnaK and other E. coli heat shock proteins can help promote the release of UvrA from the UvrAB-DNA complex and whether these chaperone proteins act on other components of the nucleotide excision repair system. It will be of interest to determine whether heat shock proteins help aid in the proper assembly/disassembly, and thus efficiency, of multi-subunit protein machines involved in eucaryotic nucleotide excision repair.

https://openalex.org/W2022878587,"Assembly of the six-chain T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex takes place by pairwise interactions. Thus, CD3-ε interacts with either CD3-γ or CD3-δ, and these dimers then associate with the TCR heterodimer (α·β or γ·δ) and the CD3-ζ homodimer to constitute a full complex. We have now mapped the site in CD3-ε responsible for the interaction with CD3-γ and CD3-δ by analysis of a series of deletional mutants encompassing the most conserved regions. We found that the highly conserved juxtamembrane domain is mainly responsible for the interaction. Thus, deletion of this 16-amino acid extracellular sequence resulted in the inhibition of up to 95% of the CD3-ε/γ interaction. A highly conserved sequence is also present in both CD3-γ and CD3-δ, suggesting that the domain in these two chains may reciprocally be involved in the interaction with CD3-ε. Indeed, an immobilized synthetic peptide corresponding to the CD3-γ sequence specifically associated to a bacterially expressed CD3-ε protein, suggesting the 16-amino acid domain is sufficient to promote CD3-ε/CD3-γ assembly. The conservation of the motif in the CD3 chains suggest that, in addition to CD3-ε/CD3-γ and CD3-ε/CD3-δ interactions, it may also mediate homotypic interactions. Indeed, it is shown that it mediates the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers and that the formation of homo- and heterodimers are mutually excluded. Finally, this domain contains a Cys-X-X-Cys sequence that resembles that of p56lck, which is responsible for the interaction with the cytoplasmic tails of CD4 and CD8. Since the replacement of the two cysteines (Cys97 and Cys100) in CD3-ε by alanines strongly inhibited pair formation, the existence of a Cys-X-X-Cys motif involved in protein-protein interactions is suggested.

The T cell antigen receptor complex (TCR-CD3) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol; IP, immunoprecipitation. is composed, in most mature T cells, of six subunits (TCR-α, TCR-β, CD3-γ, CD3-δ, CD3-ε, and CD3-ζ) that serve the dual function of peptide antigen/major histocompatibility complex recognition and signal transduction to the cytoplasm (for reviews, see Refs. 1Chan A.C. Irving B.A. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Malissen B. Schmitt-Verhulst H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Clevers H. AlarcoÖn B. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 629-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The TCR and CD3 components of the receptor have specialized roles in determining both functions; while antigen/major histocompatibility complex binding resides in the TCR-α·β heterodimer, the CD3 chains are able to interact with intracellular proteins involved in signal transduction. The expression of TCR-CD3 on the cell surface is regulated in mature T cells in such a way that when one subunit is absent the remaining complex is not expressed (for a review, see Ref.4Clevers H. AlarcoÖn B. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 629-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). However, the identity and the number of subunits that compose a minimal TCR-CD3 complex remains controversial. In addition to the existence of a TCR-γ·δ receptor that replaces the TCR-α·β, other alternative forms of the receptor have been found, first by identification of complexes containing an alternative splice form of CD3-ζ, CD3-η, and/or the γ-chain of the FcεRI (5Qian D. Sperling A.I. Lancki D.W. Tatsumi Y. Barrett T.A. Bluestone J.A. Fitch F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11875-11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Bauer A. McConkey D.J.

These two chains can form heterodimers with CD3-ζ and replace CD3-ζ partially or completely. Second, it has been suggested that the homologous chains CD3-γ and CD3-δ can also form alternative complexes and that, therefore, one can be expressed on the cell surface of T cells in the absence of the other (7AlarcoÖn B. Ley S.C. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A different TCR-CD3 complex has been revealed in immature thymocytes, where a surrogate TCR-α chain has been found associated to TCR-β and CD3 chains in thymocytes with prerearranged TCR-α (8Groettrup M. Ungwiss K. Azogui O. Palacios R. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. von Boehmer H. Cell. 1993; 75: 283-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Complexes of CD3 subunits not associated to TCR chains have also been found in certain thymomas (9Ley S.C. Tan K.N. Kubo R. Sy M.S. Terhorst C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, murine pro-T cells in RAG-1−/− mice also have been shown to contain TCR-independent CD3-γ·ε dimers on the cell surface that can be stimulated by in vivo administration of anti-CD3 antibodies to differentiate into pre-T cells (10Jacobs H. Vandeputte D. Tolkamp L. de Vries E. Borst J. Berns A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, γ·ε dimers and, to a lesser extent, δε dimers have been found associated to calnexin in SCID thymocytes and on early thymocytes from normal mice through the CD4+CD8+ stage (11Wiest D.L. Kearse K.P. Shores E.W. Singer A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Wiest D.L. Burgess W.H. McKean D. Kearse K.P. Singer A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Assembly of the TCR-CD3 complex has been suggested to take place by pairwise interactions that allow the formation of CD3 γ·ε, δ·ε, and ζ·ζ dimers as well as TCR-α·β (12Wiest D.L. Burgess W.H. McKean D. Kearse K.P. Singer A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The association between TCR and CD3 chains seems to depend largely on the interaction among transmembrane domains, where the basic amino acid residues of the TCR chains and the acidic residues of the CD3 chains are involved, perhaps forming salt bridges (13Hall C. Berkhout B. AlarcoÖn B. Sancho J. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Cosson P. Lankford S.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The importance of the basic and acidic residues of the transmembrane domains is highlighted by the conservation of the lysine residue in TCR-β and TCR-γ and especially by the conservation of the arginine and lysine residues and their positions in TCR-α and its equivalents (TCR-δ and pTα) (15Saint-Ruf C. Ungewiss K. Groettrup M. Bruno L. Fehling H.J. von Boehmer H. Science. 1994; 266: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain has also been shown to be important in CD3-ζ dimerization (16Rutledge T. Cosson P. Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, very little is known of the mechanisms that govern the assembly of the CD3-γ, -δ, and -ε chains. CD3-ε can interact with either CD3-γ or CD3-δ, but CD3-γ and CD3-δ do not interact directly. Interestingly, the removal of the acidic amino acids in the transmembrane domain of CD3-γ or CD3-δ results in the formation of CD3-γ·δ heterodimers (17Manolios N. Letourneur F. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have screened a collection of human CD3-ε deletional mutants for their ability to interact with CD3-γ and CD3-δ. We found that a region in the extracellular domain of CD3-ε, highly conserved in CD3-γ and CD3-δ, is responsible for CD3-γε and CD3-δε dimer formation as well as the formation of homodimers. The COS-7 African green monkey cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse monoclonal antibodies APA1/1 and APA1/2, specific for human CD3-ε and CD3-δ, respectively, were obtained from purified CD3 proteins isolated from human thymus (7AlarcoÖn B. Ley S.C. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The anti-CD3 antibody UCHT1 was generously donated by Dr. P. Beverley (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). HMT3.2 is a hamster monoclonal antibody reactive toward human CD3-γ and murine CD3-γ and CD3-δ (7AlarcoÖn B. Ley S.C. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that was generously given by Dr. R. Kubo (National Jewish Center, Denver, CO). The pSRα-γ, pSRα-δ, and pSRα-ε constructs were made as described (7AlarcoÖn B. Ley S.C. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Deletions 1–13 in CD3-ε were generated by loop-out mutagenesis as described previously (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. AlarcoÖn B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The CD3-ε mutant 14 was constructed after two PCR amplifications. The first amplification utilized primer 8 (XhoI restriction site) as the 5′-primer (CCCCCTCGAGATGCAGTCGGGCACT) and an internal oligonucleotide 126 (CGCTGCAGCGGCCGCAGCTTCAGATCCAGGATACTG) containing alanine substitutions as the 3′-primer. The second part of the molecule was amplified using a 5′-primer complementary to 126 (GCTGCGGCCGCTGCAGCGGATAAAAACATAGGCGGT) together with oligonucleotide 61 (containing a BamHI restriction site) as the 3′-primer (GGGGATCCTCAGATGCGTCTCTGATT). Primer 61 corresponds to the most carboxyl-terminal region. After hybridization of the previously amplified fragments, a second round of PCR was performed with the external primers 8 and 61. This fragment was cloned into theXhoI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pSRα. The double cysteine substitution in CD3-ε was made as above with the oligonucleotide 131 (CATCTCCATGGCGTTCTCAGCCACTCTTGC) and its complementary form as internal primers. CD3-γ deletion A was generated with the internal primers 123 (CACAAGTCAGTTCTTGATAG) and 124 (CTATCAAGAACTGACTTGTG) that incorporate the mutant alanines followed by amplification of the complete CD3-γ with oligonucleotide 73 (CCCCTCGAGGACATGGAACAGGGGAAG) as the 5′-primer and oligonucleotide 112 (GGGGATCCTCTGAGTCCTGAGTTCA) as the 3′-primer. Because CD3-γ cDNA has an internal XhoI site, it was cloned into the pSRα vector by partial digestion. All constructs described were sequenced by the fmol DNA Sequencing System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to exclude the possible introduction of unwanted mutations. COS cells were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. A total of 200 μl of the cell suspension was transferred to an electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and 5 μg of the plasmid mixture was added as well as 20 μg of PUC-19 plasmid DNA (Promega) as a carrier. Cells were electroporated at 200 V, 960 microfarads in a Bio-Rad gene pulser, diluted with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and plated on coverslips. COS cells were fixed, 24–48 h after transfection, with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, blocked and permeabilized with 1% bovine serum albumin plus 0.1% saponin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. Afterward, the coverslips were rinsed with PBS and incubated for an additional hour with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig or a goat anti-hamster Ig secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology). The coverslips were mounted with Mowiol, and cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Photographs were taken on Kodak T-Max 400 film. Metabolic labeling was carried out on transfected COS cells plated on 100-mm Petri dishes. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. Subsequently, 250 μCi of a [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added for 4 h. Afterward, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 1 μg/ml concentration each of leupeptin and aprotinin). In immunoprecipitation studies, 1% Nonidet P-40 or radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml concentration of leupeptin, aprotinin, and chemostatin) lysates were precleared three times by incubation for 1 h with nonimmune mouse serum coupled to protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The precleared supernatants were subsequently incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 2–4 μg of the specific antibodies coupled to protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. Then the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 13% polyacrylamide gels. Two-dimensional electrophoresis under nonreducing/reducing conditions was performed as described (7AlarcoÖn B. Ley S.C. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In deglycosylation studies, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended after the last wash in 60 μl of a 0.15 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.25% SDS. The samples were boiled for 2 min, and 1 milliunit of endo-β-acetylgycosaminidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to half of each sample. The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C and electrophoresed. Immunoprecipitated samples were run on 13% acrylamide gels and were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 10% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h and incubated with the desired antibody, diluted in washing solution (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20), for 1 h. The membranes were washed five times with PBS-Tween and incubated for another hour with a peroxidase-labeled species-specific anti-Ig antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted in PBS-Tween. Last, the membrane was washed five times with PBS-Tween, and protein bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry analysis was performed in a Computing Densitometer model 300A. A total of 1.4 mg of a 19-mer synthetic peptide (LQVYYRMCQNCIELNGSGK) that corresponds to amino acids 79–93 (LQVYYRMCQNCIELN) of the human mature CD3-γ protein were covalently coupled to a 1-ml HiTrap NHS-activated agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) through a 4-amino acid spacer (GSGK). A control column was prepared by coupling a similar amount of an irrelevant peptide (ERRRGKGHDGLYQGLSTATKDTYD) that corresponds to an intracellular sequence of CD3-ζ. The efficiency of coupling was estimated to be 80% in both cases by optical absorbance. To prepare the 35S-labeled extracellular domain of CD3-ε, a sequence encoding for amino acids 1–105 of the mature protein was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide GGCCTCGAGCATATGGATGGTAATGAGGAAATGGG as 5′-primer and oligonucleotide GGGGGATCCTATCACGACATCACATCCATCTC as 3′-primer. The PCR product was inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET3ax vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and the resulting construct was fully sequenced using the fmol DNA sequencing kit (Promega) in order to verify the lack of PCR-induced errors. The desired clone was transformed into the lysogenic Escherichia coli strain BL-21(DE3), and the correct expression of the recombinant peptide was tested by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of the induced protein with antibody SP34, which specifically recognizes the extracellular part of CD3-ε. Induction and extraction of the protein was carried as follows: an overnight culture of the clone was diluted 20-fold in M9 medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After 4 h, expression of the clone gene was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) in the presence of 50 μg/ml rifampicin (Sigma). Two hours later, bacteria were labeled with [35S]methionine (0.5 μCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 37 °C and subsequently collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) per 25 ml of culture. Afterward, 25 μl of 10% deoxicolic acid and 20 μl of 1 mg/ml DNAse I were added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with occasional shaking. Bacterial cell lysates were centrifuged to eliminate the cell debris, and the supernatant (1 ml per column) was injected and incubated for 45 min on ice. The columns were then rapidly rinsed with 10 column volumes of the extraction buffer, and the bound material was eluted with three column volumes of 50 mm triethylamine, pH 11.0. The eluates were rapidly neutralized, and 100 μl were counted in a β-scintillation counter. Equal volumes of both CD3-γ column and control column eluates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the peptide binding assay, 30 μg each of a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 89–105 of the human mature CD3-ε protein (YLYLRARVCENCMEMDV) and of the irrelevant ζ-peptide were125I-labeled by the chloramine T method (19McConahey P.J. Dixon F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The iodinated peptides were diluted to 1 × 106 cpm/ml in 1% Nonidet P-40 immunoprecipitation buffer, and 1 ml of each was injected into the CD3-γ and CD3-ζ columns. After a 45-min incubation on ice, the columns were rapidly rinsed with 10 column volumes of the immunoprecipitation buffer, and bound material was eluted with 5 column volumes of 50 mm triethylamine, pH 11.0. The eluates were then counted in a β-scintillation counter. Previously, we had determined that CD3-γ and CD3-δ compete for binding to CD3-ε, suggesting that both chains bind to the same site in CD3-ε (7AlarcoÖn B. Ley S.C. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine the CD3-γ and CD3-δ binding site in CD3-ε, a series of human CD3-ε deletional mutants (Fig. 1) were used in transfection studies, together with wild type CD3-γ and CD3-δ. Because these deletions affected the most conserved regions of the known CD3-ε proteins (20Gold D.P. Clevers H. AlarcoÖn B. Dunlap S. Novotny J. Williams A.F. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tunnacliffe A. Immunogenetics. 1993; 37: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and because human and murine CD3 chains are able to form interspecific hybrid complexes, it is believed that the deleted sequences should contain the binding site. To explore the ability of CD3-γ and CD3-δ to associate with the CD3-ε mutants, COS cells were cotransfected with either CD3-γ or CD3-δ and each one of the mutants. The transfected cells were then stained with UCHT1, an antibody previously shown to recognize the dimers of CD3-ε with CD3-γ or CD3-δ but not the isolated subunits (26SalmeroÖn A. SaÖnchez-Madrid F. Ursa M.A. Fresno M. AlarcoÖn B. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3047-3052PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 (panels A and B), the cells transfected with deletions 1, 5, 6, and 14 and either CD3-γ or CD3-δ were not stained with antibody UCHT1, although the individual transfected chains were recognized by subunit-specific antibodies APA1/1 (anti-ε), APA1/2 (anti-δ), and HMT3.2 (anti-γ). Other antibodies that recognize ε·γ and ε·δ dimers (e.g. Leu4, OKT3) were also unable to recognize cells cotransfected with either CD3-γ or CD3-δ and any one of the CD3-ε deletional mutants 1, 5, 6, and 14 (data not shown). All other deletion mutants were stained with UCHT1 when they were cotransfected with CD3-γ or CD3-δ, suggesting that they formed ε·γ and ε·δ complexes (data not shown). Even those deletional mutants that should have important conformational alterations, such as deletions 2 and 4, which lack the putative intrachain disulfide loop characteristic of the immunoglobulin fold, and deletion 13, which lacks the membrane anchor, were able to associate to CD3-γ and CD3-δ.Figure 2Immunofluorescence analysis of the association of CD3-ε with CD3-γ and CD3-δ. COS cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding for wild type or the indicated mutants of CD3-ε and either CD3-γ (A) or CD3-δ (B). Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed with antibodies APA1/1 (anti-CD3-ε), HMT3.2 (anti-CD3-γ), APA1/2 (anti-CD3-δ), and UCHT1 (specific for CD3-ε·γ and CD3-ε·δ dimers). Photographs were taken at a × 400 magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These experiments suggested that deletions 1, 5, 6, and 14 prevented the association of CD3-ε with CD3-γ and CD3-δ or, alternatively, that they altered the binding site for antibodies UCHT1, Leu 4, etc. In order to distinguish between both possibilities, an immunoprecipitation experiment with subunit-specific antibodies was performed. COS cells were transfected with different CD3-ε constructs, together with CD3-γ, and were metabolically labeled with a [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine mixture. For these experiments, a double deletional mutant of regions 5 and 6 was produced that, as expected, was not stained by conformation-dependent antibodies when cotransfected with either CD3-γ or CD3-δ (data not shown). Radioimmune precipitation buffer lysates from doubly transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies HMT3.2 and APA1/1 that recognize isolated CD3-γ and CD3-ε chains, respectively. Half of each immunoprecipitate was treated with endo-β-acetylglycosaminidase H to better distinguish between glycosylated CD3-γ and the nonglycosylated CD3-ε. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the immunoprecipitation with APA1/1 from cells cotransfected with CD3-γ and wild type CD3-ε resulted in the coprecipitation of CD3-γ, which characteristically runs as 25 kDa in untreated samples and as a 17-kDa protein when it is deglycosylated (dγ). Upon deglycosylation, the 23-kDa CD3-ε chain remained unmodified. Of note, the mobilities of CD3-ε mutants were frequently different from that of the wild type form, and their position is indicated witharrowheads in Fig. 3. Only two deletions, deletion 5 + 6 and deletion 9 seemed to affect binding to CD3-γ, since immunoprecipitation with APA1/1 did not coprecipitate any detectable CD3-γ. However, the reverse immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3-γ antibody HMT3.2 showed similar levels of deletion 9 and εwt, suggesting that, indeed, deletion 9 did not affect the association with CD3-γ (data not shown). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitation with APA1/1 had not shown any detectable CD3-ε, strongly suggesting that the sequence eliminated in deletion 9 constitutes the recognition site for APA1/1. Interestingly, deletion 5 + 6 was the only deletion that considerably affected the ε/γ interaction, as shown by immunoprecipitation with anti-ε and anti-γ antibodies (Fig. 3,A and B). Deletion mutants 1 and 14 were clearly coprecipitated by the anti-γ antibodies (Fig. 3 B), and conversely, CD3-γ was clearly coprecipitated by the anti-ε antibody in cells cotransfected with these mutants (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the only deletion that had a major effect on the interaction with CD3-γ corresponded to regions 5 + 6. Nevertheless, because region 6 contains two of a total of four methionines and two of a total of five cysteines, it is difficult to quantitate the amount of protein relative to the wild type control in the experiments shown in Fig. 3. In order to generate quantifiable results, the immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific anti-ε and anti-γ antibodies was followed by immunoblotting with the opposite antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, immunoprecipitation with anti-γ antibody (HMT3.2) resulted in less deletion 5 + 6 coprecipitated as compared with that of the wild type. To control the efficiency of transfection, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with the anti-γ antibody. Densitometric scans of the bands corresponding to CD3-ε and CD3-γ showed that the level of the coprecipitated deletion 5 + 6 mutant was one-third of that of the wild type, whereas deletions 1 and 14 had only a marginal effect. The immunoprecipitation with the anti-ε antibody followed by immunoblotting with the anti-γ antibody showed comparatively similar results, although the effects were more pronounced. CD3-γ was barely coprecipitated in cells transfected with deletion 5 + 6, although the levels of CD3-ε detected after reprobing the membrane with APA1/1 showed in all cases similar levels of transfected CD3-ε. A densitometric scan of the CD3-ε and CD3-γ bands revealed that deletions 1 and 14 inhibited the association to CD3-γ by 2–3-fold, whereas deletion 5 + 6 inhibited it by 20-fold. The fact that deletion 5 + 6 causes a 3-fold reduction in formation of CD3-ε·CD3-γ heterodimers when immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-γ antibody and a 20-fold reduction when immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-ε could be due to an excess of expression of one transfected product over the other. As a control for the specificity of the immunoprecipitations, COS cells were transfected with εwt and a CD4 chimera that is endoplasmic reticulum-retained (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. AlarcoÖn B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation with either anti-CD4 or anti-CD3-ε antibodies did not show any evidence of association (data not shown).Figure 4Quantitation of ε/γ interactions by Western blot analysis. Deletions 1, 5 + 6, and 14 were cotransfected with CD3-γ in COS cells. The samples were divided, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti CD3-γ, HMT3.2 (left) or anti CD3-ε, APA1/1 (right), followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibody. The quantity of CD3-γ and CD3-ε specifically immunoprecipitated in each case was estimated by reprobing the membranes with the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation. The ratios of coprecipitated proteins were analyzed by densitometry and are shown at the bottom as percentages of the coprecipitating chains obtained with wild type CD3-ε. The positions of CD3-γ, CD3-ε, and immunoglobulin light chain (L) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dietrich et al. (27Dietrich J. Neisig A. Hou X.

https://openalex.org/W1978918867,"We have investigated possible roles of RhoA and H2O2 in the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by phosphatidic acid (PA) in Rat-2 fibroblasts. PA induced a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in the presence or absence of EGTA. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) also increased [Ca2+]i, but the sustained Ca2+response was inhibited by EGTA. LPA stimulated the production of inositol phosphates, but PA did not. In the presence of EGTA, preincubation with LPA completely blocked the subsequent elevation of [Ca2+]i by PA, but not vice versa. PA stimulated the translocation of RhoA to the particulate fraction as did LPA. Scrape loading of C3 transferase inhibited the transient Ca2+ response to PA, but not to LPA, suggesting an essential role of RhoA in the elevation of [Ca2+]i by PA. H2O2 also induced a transient increase of [Ca2+]i as did PA. H2O2 scavengers, catalase andN-acetyl-l-cysteine, completely blocked the rise of [Ca2+]i stimulated by PA, but not by LPA. Furthermore, preincubation with PA blocked the subsequent Ca2+ response to H2O2, and the incubation with H2O2 also blocked the PA-induced rise of [Ca2+]i. Thus, it was suggested that PA stimulated Ca2+ release from PA-sensitive, but not inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive, Ca2+ stores by the activation of RhoA and intracellular H2O2.

It is well known that PA is converted into diacylglycerol by the action of PA phosphohydrolase (2Exton J.H. J. Biol.

It has also been reported that PA was involved in the activation of superoxide anion production by activating NADPH oxidase (13Bellavite P. Corsa F. Dusi S. Grzeskowiak M. Della-Bianca V. Rossi F. J.

Acta. 1997; 1344: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another important role of PA in cell signalings is the increase of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) (4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Yilly B.C. Verlaan I. BierMan A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It is known that [Ca2+]i is regulated by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and influx from extracellular sources (16Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar). PA has been known to increase [Ca2+]i by the activation of Ca2+efflux from internal stores (4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Yilly B.C. Verlaan I. BierMan A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), even though there have been reports suggesting the activation of Ca2+ influx by PA (18Putney Jr., J.W. Weiss S.J. van de Walle C.M. Haddas R.A. Nature. 1980; 284: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,19Salmon D.M. Honeyman T.W. Nature. 1980; 284: 344-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, there have been contradictory reports on the mechanisms by which PA triggers Ca2+ release from internal stores (4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Yilly B.C. Verlaan I. BierMan A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar,17Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In A431 cells, PA was shown to elevate [Ca2+]i by stimulating the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Yilly B.C. Verlaan I. BierMan A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Contrary to this report, PA could increase [Ca2+]i in the presence of heparin in Jurkat cells, suggesting that PA stimulated Ca2+ efflux from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-insensitive stores (17Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms by which PA increases [Ca2+]i are not still known. In this report, we present a new possible mechanism of [Ca2+]i increase in response to PA in Rat-2 fibroblasts. The roles of RhoA in the elevation of intracellular H2O2 and [Ca2+]i were studied by scrape loading of C3 transferase into the cells. C3 transferase is known to regulate the activity of RhoA by ADP-ribosylation in several cell functions, including stress fiber formation, focal adhesions, and cell motility (20Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The introduction of C3 transferase into the Rat-2 cells inhibited the increase of [Ca2+]i and intracellular H2O2 stimulated by PA. Furthermore, H2O2 scavengers, catalase andN-acetylcysteine (NAC), blocked the PA-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. These observations support the idea that PA increases [Ca2+]i by activating RhoA and the production of intracellular H2O2. LPA, NAC, EGTA, and catalase fromAspergillus niger were purchased from Sigma. PA (dioleoyl, C18:1, [cis]-9) was obtained from Sigma and further purified by using a solvent system of ethyl acetate/iso-octane/acetic acid/water (130:20:30:100, v/v) to remove any possible effect of LPA. Fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin, penicillin/streptomycin solution, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. H2O2 was obtained from Junsei (Tokyo, Japan).N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) phallacidin and fluo-3,AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemical agents were of analytical grade. Rat-2 fibroblasts, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1764), were cultured for 2 days at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (culture medium). Then, the cells were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml apotransferrin (Sigma), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (serum-free medium). F-actin was observed by the procedures of Jung et al. (22Jung H.I. Shin I. Park Y.M. Kang K.W. Ha K.-S. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 431-437PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Rat-2 cells were grown on round coverslips in a 12-well culture plate and serum-starved for 2 days. After stabilizing in fresh serum-free medium for 1 h, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml LPA or 10 μm purified PA for 30 min and fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (1.2 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 138 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min. Then, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DPBS for 15 min and stained with 0.165 μm ofN-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) phallacidin for 30 min at room temperature. Stained cells were mounted on slide glasses with Gelvatol and observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 410). Gelvatol was prepared by mixing 100 ml of 0.23% polyvinyl alcohol in DPBS with 50 ml of glycerol. Samples were excited by a 488 nm argon laser, and the images were filtered by a longpass 515 nm filter. Three-dimensional images were constructed from 5–10 serial images (each 1-μm thick) made by automatic optical sectioning. C3 transferase, prepared by the procedures of Leem et al. (23Leem S.-H. Shin I. Kweon S.-M. Kim S.I. Kim J.-H. Ha K.-S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 30: 337-341Google Scholar), was loaded into Rat-2 cells according to the modified procedures of Malcolm et al.(21Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rat-2 cells, grown on a 100-mm culture dish, were scraped in 1 ml of DPBS containing 200 ng of C3 transferase and resuspended in culture medium. Then, cell suspensions were transferred into a six-well culture plate and cultured for 1 day. The cultures were serum-starved by sequential incubation with culture medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and serum-free medium each for 1 day and then used for measurements of [Ca2+]i. The incorporation of C3 transferase was checked by immunostaining and co-incorporation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextrans. [Ca2+]iwas measured by the use of a laser scanning confocal microscope (22Jung H.I. Shin I. Park Y.M. Kang K.W. Ha K.-S. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 431-437PubMed Google Scholar). Cells, grown on coverslips and serum-starved for 2 days, were incubated with 4 μm fluo-3,AM in serum-free medium for 40 min and washed three times with serum-free medium. Each coverslip containing stained cells was mounted on a perfusion chamber (self-designed), subjected to a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 410), and then scanned every second with a 488 nm excitation argon laser and a 515 nm longpass emission filter. Agonists were added to the cells by using an automatic pumping system (self-designed). Sometimes, cells were pretreated with 500 units/ml A. niger catalase for 30 min or 20 mm NAC for 1 h. All images (about 200 images) from the scanning were processed to analyze changes of [Ca2+]i in a single cell level. The results were expressed as the relative fluorescence intensity. Rat-2 cells were cultured in six-well plates and then labeled with 4 μCi/wellmyo-[3H]inositol for 2 day in inositol-free medium during serum starvation. Following incubation with 20 mm LiCl for 10 min, cells were stimulated with 10 μm purified PA or 1 μg/ml LPA for 15 min. 3 ml of ice-cold methanol was added for 30 min on ice and then water-soluble layer was separated by the procedures of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar). The water-soluble upper layer was dried in a Speed Vac concentrator, re-dissolved in 1 ml of H2O, and then applied to 1 ml of AG 1-X8 resin (200–400 mesh, formate form). After washing the column with 10 ml of 5 mm Na2B4O7, 60 mm HCOONH4, total IPs were eluted from the column with 2 ml of 0.1 mm HCOOH, 1.0 mHCOONH4 (22Jung H.I. Shin I. Park Y.M. Kang K.W. Ha K.-S. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 431-437PubMed Google Scholar) and then counted using a scintillation counter. Cells were incubated with 10 μm PA or 1 μg/ml LPA for 30 min, scraped in DPBS, and harvested by microcentrifugation. The cells were then resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5) and disrupted by twenty passes through a 21.1-gauge needle on ice. The cytosolic fraction was separated from the particulate fraction by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h and precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 12% acrylamide, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes using a Novex wet transfer unit. The membranes were blocked overnight with TBS (DPBS containing 0.01% Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk. The blots were incubated for 2 h with anti-RhoA antibody in TBS and further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Then, the blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to study the mechanism by which PA induces the increase in [Ca2+]i, the level of [Ca2+]i was measured after treating cells with purified PA in Rat-2 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig.1 A, PA caused a rapid, but transient, increase in [Ca2+]i, consistent with previous reports (4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Yilly B.C. Verlaan I. BierMan A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ response was only slightly attenuated when external Ca2+ was eliminated by treating with EGTA, suggesting that PA increased [Ca2+]i by triggering Ca2+ efflux from internal stores rather than stimulating Ca2+ influx from extracellular source. LPA also increased [Ca2+]i, but EGTA inhibited sustained Ca2+ response to LPA, indicating that LPA elevated [Ca2+]i by triggering both Ca2+efflux from internal stores and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, EGTA completely blocked the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ produced by arachidonic acid (Fig. 1 C). Since there have been inconsistent reports on the involvement of IP3 in PA-induced increase of [Ca2+]i(4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Yilly B.C. Verlaan I. BierMan A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the amount of IPs was measured after treating Rat-2 cells with purified PA in the presence of 20 mm LiCl (Fig.2). The hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C is known to increase inositol phosphates in the presence of LiCl (16Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar, 25Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected from the previous reports (22Jung H.I. Shin I. Park Y.M. Kang K.W. Ha K.-S. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 431-437PubMed Google Scholar,26van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T.

J. 1992; 281: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), incubation with LPA increased IPs by about 4-fold over the control level. However, PA did not cause any changes in the amount of IPs. So PA appears to induce the increase of [Ca2+]i by triggering Ca2+ efflux from IP3-insensitive internal stores. Next, we have investigated whether LPA could trigger Ca2+release from PA-sensitive stores, since it has been reported that LPA increased the level of PA by stimulating phospholipase D in Rat-2 cells (23Leem S.-H. Shin I. Kweon S.-M. Kim S.I. Kim J.-H. Ha K.-S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 30: 337-341Google Scholar). The preincubation with PA in the presence of EGTA completely blocked the elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by the subsequent addition of PA (data not shown), indicating that the incubation with PA was able to deplete PA-sensitive Ca2+pool. LPA-sensitive Ca2+ pool was also depleted by the incubation with LPA (data not shown). So if LPA triggered Ca2+ efflux from PA-sensitive pool, the preincubation with LPA should block the elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by PA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the preincubation with LPA, in the presence of EGTA, completely blocked the increase of [Ca2+]i stimulated by PA. However, the depletion of PA-sensitive Ca2+ pool by the incubation with PA showed a small inhibitory effect on the subsequent Ca2+ response to LPA (Fig. 3 B). Thus, these results strongly suggested that LPA increased [Ca2+]i from IP3-sensitive pools and also from PA-sensitive (IP3-independent) Ca2+pool. Since it has been reported that PA stimulated stress fiber formation, which was inhibited by C3 transferase (8Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated the possibility that RhoA was also involved in the PA-induced increase of [Ca2+]i. First, we have tested possible activation of RhoA by PA by measuring the translocation of RhoA, since it is known that RhoA is redistributed from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction after being activated (21Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, most of RhoA was localized in the cytosolic fraction in unstimulated cells, and a fraction of RhoA was translocated to the membrane fraction in response to PA. As expected from a previous report (21Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), LPA also activated the translocation of RhoA to the membrane fraction. Next, the role of RhoA in the PA-induced increase of [Ca2+]i was investigated by scrape loading of C3 transferase into Rat-2 cells. It is known that C3 transferase inhibits the activity of RhoA by ADP-ribosylation at Asp41 (20Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The effect of incorporated C3 transferase on RhoA was shown by the inhibition of stress fiber formation in response to PA (Fig. 5 A). In the control cells, scraped without C3 transferase, PA stimulated stress fiber formation, which was completely inhibited in C3 transferase-loaded cells. C3 transferase also blocked the stress fiber formation induced by LPA (data not shown). The effect of C3 transferase on the elevation of [Ca2+]i by PA was shown in Fig. 5 B. C3 transferase inhibited the increase of [Ca2+]i stimulated by PA, suggesting an essential role of RhoA in the PA-stimulated increase of [Ca2+]i. However, the toxin had no significant effect on the elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to LPA, possibly because LPA could release Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive pool, even though PA-sensitive Ca2+ pool was blocked. Taken together, it was suggested that RhoA played an essential role in the PA-induced increase of [Ca2+]i.Figure 5Effects of C3 transferase on the stress fiber formation (A) and the level of [Ca2+]i (B). A, cells were scraped with buffer (panels a and b) or 200 ng of C3 transferase (panels c and d) and serum-starved for 2 days. The cells were then stimulated with control (panels a and c) or 10 μm PA (panels band d) for 30 min, and F-actin was stained and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope as described under “Materials and Methods.” The bar is 20 μm.B, cells were loaded with C3 transferase and stimulated with 10 μm PA or 1 μg/ml LPA. [Ca2+]iwas monitored using a laser scanning confocal microscope as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Results are expressed as percent of control response (unstimulated cells) ± S.D. from three separate determinations. Each determination is the mean of at least 10 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been reported that H2O2 stimulated the increase of [Ca2+]i in various cells (29Roveri A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. van Amsterdam F.T. Ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Hoyal C.R. Gozal E. Zhou H. Foldenauer K. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Volk T. Hensel M. Kox W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 171: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, we have observed that PA produced intracellular H2O2 by over 6-fold and the increase was blocked by C3 transferase in Rat-2 cells. 2I. Shin, S.-M. Kweon, Z.-W. Lee, S. I. Kim, C. O. Joe, J.-H. Kim, Y. M. Park, and K.-S. Ha, manuscript in preparation. So we have investigated any possible role of H2O2 in the PA-induced rise of [Ca2+]i. First, we measured the changes of [Ca2+]i after treating the cells with exogenous H2O2 (Fig.6 A). H2O2 induced a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i as did PA, consistent with previous reports (30Hoyal C.R. Gozal E. Zhou H. Foldenauer K. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Volk T. Hensel M. Kox W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 171: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The transient response of [Ca2+]i to H2O2 was not largely affected by the pretreatment with EGTA, indicating that H2O2 increased [Ca2+]ifrom the internal stores as did PA (Fig. 1). To confirm the role of H2O2 in the regulation of [Ca2+]i, the cells were preincubated with H2O2 scavengers, catalase and NAC, and then the changes of [Ca2+]i by PA were investigated (Fig.6, B and C). Catalase completely blocked the increase of [Ca2+]i stimulated by PA, but had no effect on the subsequent increase by LPA (Fig. 6 B). NAC also blocked the Ca2+ response to PA, but not to LPA (Fig.6 C). These results suggested that intracellular H2O2 may play a role in the PA-induced increase of [Ca2+]i. The role of H2O2 was further confirmed by serial incubations of Rat-2 cells with H2O2 and PA in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 7). The incubation with PA induced a transient increase of [Ca2+]i, but the subsequent incubation with H2O2 did not cause any changes in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7 A). Preincubation with H2O2 also blocked the Ca2+ response to PA (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that PA and H2O2 caused Ca2+ release from the same stores. However, the depletion of H2O2- or PA-sensitive Ca2+ stores did not block the subsequent response of [Ca2+]i to LPA (Figs. 3 Band 7 C). Thus, it was concluded that H2O2 increased [Ca2+]i by triggering Ca2+ efflux from PA-sensitive, but not from IP3-sensitive stores. In the present report we have shown that PA increased [Ca2+]i from PA-sensitive internal stores, and the transient Ca2+ response was dependent on RhoA and H2O2. PA induced a transient increase of [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the sustained Ca2+ increase by LPA was dependent on the extracellular Ca2+. PA stimulated the translocation of RhoA to the membrane fraction, and C3 transferase inhibited the PA-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. H2O2 scavengers, catalase and NAC, also blocked the rise of [Ca2+]i by PA. Furthermore, the depletion of PA-sensitive Ca2+ stores inhibited the Ca2+ response to H2O2 and vice versa. Now, it is likely that PA stimulates Ca2+ release from PA-sensitive stores, which is not dependent on IP3. In Jurkat T cells, the depletion of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores by incubation with an anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 (an IP3-generating drug), in the presence of EGTA, did not affect on the elevation of [Ca2+]i by the subsequent incubation of PA (17Sakano S. Takemura H. Yamada K. Imoto K. Kaneko M. Ohshika H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11148-11155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the same cells, heparin inhibited the rise in [Ca2+]i by IP3, but did not by PA, suggesting that PA increased [Ca2+]ifrom IP3–insensitive stores. It has been also reported that sphingosine 1-phosphate could produce PA by activating phospholipase D and also increased [Ca2+]i from internal stores by an IP3-independent mechanism in Swiss 3T3 cells (25Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23122-23128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous reports, our results showed that PA produced a transient increase of [Ca2+]i from PA-sensitive stores without the production of IP3 (Figs. 1 and 2). To our understanding, this is the first report that the rise of [Ca2+]i by PA was dependent on RhoA. PA activated the translocation of RhoA to the membrane fraction, and C3 transferase inhibited the transient Ca2+ response to PA (Fig. 4). It has been reported that C3 transferase induced in vivoADP-ribosylation in a dose-dependent manner in Rat-2 cells (23Leem S.-H. Shin I. Kweon S.-M. Kim S.I. Kim J.-H. Ha K.-S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 30: 337-341Google Scholar). Previously, there have been reports indicating possible roles of RhoA in the regulation of [Ca2+]i and smooth muscle contraction (33Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 34Kato N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8719-8722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In C3H 10 1/2 cells, microinjection of C3 transferase inhibited the increase of [Ca2+]i in response to thrombin and platelet-derived growth factor (33Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Ca2+ waves induced by IP3 were retarded by C3 transferase in Xenopus oocytes (34Kato N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that RhoA increased Ca2+ sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle contraction (35Hirata K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Seki H. Saida K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8719-8722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that RhoA plays an essential role in the regulation of [Ca2+]i. H2O2 is known to increase [Ca2+]i in various cells, including smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells (29Roveri A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. van Amsterdam F.T. Ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Hoyal C.R. Gozal E. Zhou H. Foldenauer K. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem.

In rat alveolar macrophages, H2O2 stimulated the release of Ca2+ from IP3-independent stores, which was essential for respiratory burst (30Hoyal C.R. Gozal E. Zhou H. Foldenauer K. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The role of H2O2 in the elevation of [Ca2+]i was also shown in endothelial cells (31Volk T. Hensel M. Kox W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 171: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Superoxide and H2O2 produced by the incubation with xanthine oxidase and xanthine at nontoxic doses induced a transient rise of [Ca2+]i, but the Ca2+ response was mainly induced by H2O2 rather than superoxide in these cells (31Volk T. Hensel M. Kox W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 171: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results also supported the previous reports. H2O2 caused a transient Ca2+increase in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. H2O2 scavengers, NAC and catalase, completely inhibited the rise of [Ca2+]i by PA. Furthermore, we have observed that PA increased the amount of intracellular H2O2 and the increase was blocked by C3 transferase.2 Considering an essential role of RhoA in the PA-stimulated increase of [Ca2+]i, it was concluded that PA increased [Ca2+]i by the activation of RhoA and the subsequent production of intracellular H2O2. Interestingly, our results suggested that LPA triggered Ca2+ release from PA-sensitive stores. We have previously observed that LPA produced PA by stimulating phospholipase D in Rat-2 cells (23Leem S.-H. Shin I. Kweon S.-M. Kim S.I. Kim J.-H. Ha K.-S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 30: 337-341Google Scholar). The depletion of PA-sensitive Ca2+ stores did not block the subsequent Ca2+ increase by LPA, but preincubation with LPA blocked the Ca2+ response to PA (Fig. 3), indicating that LPA triggered Ca2+ efflux from PA-sensitive stores. C3 transferase, which inhibited the elevation of [Ca2+]i by PA, had no inhibitory effect on the Ca2+ response to LPA (Fig. 5). In addition, H2O2 scavengers, catalase and NAC, inhibited the Ca2+ elevation by PA, but not by LPA (Fig. 6). PA activated the translocation of RhoA to the membrane fraction and the production of H2O2. The differential effects of C3 transferase and H2O2 scavengers on the Ca2+ response to PA and LPA were explained by the production of IPs by LPA (Fig. 2). Thus, it is likely that LPA increases [Ca2+]i from both PA- and IP3-sensitive stores. What is the possible role of the intracellular H2O2 and Ca2+ increased by PA? One possibility is to play a role in the actin polymerization stimulated by PA. It has been reported that Ca2+ may be involved in the actin polymerization by regulating the interaction of actin with Ca2+-dependent actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and villin (36Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In Rat-2 cells, PA stimulated RhoA and the elevation of intracellular H2O2 and [Ca2+]i. C3 transferase inhibited the production of H2O22 and stress fiber formation (Fig. 5) activated by PA. Catalase also inhibited PA-induced stress fiber formation (data not shown). H2O2increased [Ca2+]i (Figs. 6 and 7) and stimulated stress fiber formation as did PA (data not shown). So it was suggested that PA activated stress fiber formation by a sequential activation of RhoA and the increase of intracellular H2O2 and [Ca2+]i. However, H2O2alone produced fragmented F-actins in the Rat-2 cells loaded with C3 transferase, 3Z.-W. Lee and K.-S. Ha, unpublished observations. indicating that stress fiber formation may require additional kinases activated by RhoA, such as Rho kinase and protein kinase N (37Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K.

Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). So, RhoA may regulate PA-induced stress fiber formation by activating its two downstream components, H2O2/Ca2+and RhoA-activated kinases, even though it is necessary to elucidate their roles in the actin polymerization activated by PA."
https://openalex.org/W1970336036,"The hypothalamic hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plays a critical role in reproductive function by regulating the biosynthesis and secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins. Although it is known that GnRH induces luteinizing hormone β (LHβ) gene transcription, the mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be elucidated. We have shown previously that GH<sub>3</sub> cells transfected with the rat GnRH receptor cDNA (GGH<sub>3</sub>-1′ cells) support the expression of a cotransfected fusion gene composed of 797 base pairs of rat LHβ gene 5′-flanking sequence and the first 5 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region fused to a luciferase reporter (−797/+5LHβLUC) and respond to a GnRH agonist with a 10-fold stimulation of activity. Furthermore, we have shown that DNA sequences at −490/−352 confer GnRH responsiveness to the rat LHβ gene. We have now identified two putative binding sites for Sp1, a three-zinc-finger transcription factor, within this region. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DNase I footprinting, and methylation interference assays, we demonstrate that Sp1 can bind to these sites and that Sp1 is responsible for DNA-protein complexes formed using GGH<sub>3</sub>-1′ and αT3–1 nuclear extracts. Mutations of the Sp1 binding sites, which block binding of Sp1, blunt the stimulation of the LHβ gene promoter by GnRH. These data define GnRH-responsive elements in the LHβ 5′-flanking sequence and suggest that Sp1 plays an important role in conferring GnRH responsiveness to the LHβ subunit gene."

A number of toxicities are mediated by mechanisms collectively termed “oxidative stress.” Consequently, the study of oxidative stress has been the focus of considerable research in recent years. In oxidative stress mechanisms, reactive oxygen metabolites interact with cellular constituents, including DNA/RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and unsaturated lipids. In addition, cumulative oxidative damage has been implicated in a number of disease states, e.g. the aging process, cancer, and ischemia-reperfusion. The study of oxidative stress in mitochondria has shown that hydrogen peroxide is produced via the incomplete reduction of oxygen during oxidative phosphorylation (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar).

Oxidation of exogenous compounds by cytochromec has been shown to be dependent on hydrogen peroxide, but did not involve the hydroxyl radical (9Radi R. Thomson L. Rubbo H. Prodanov E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Other reports have shown that mitochondrial lipid peroxidation could be initiated by hydrogen peroxide and cytochrome c (12Radi R. Sims S. Cassina A. Turrens J.F. Free Radic. Biol.

It was postulated that hydrogen peroxide oxidized cytochrome c to a ferryl-radical intermediate (i.e. compound I-type species) that was responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of other biomolecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids.This interest in the role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of human disease has led to an increased need for techniques to measure free radicals and their reactions. Detection of free radicals is difficult because they are typically extremely reactive and, consequently, short-lived. Electron spin resonance (ESR) is the only analytical technique currently capable of directly measuring free radicals. One means of increasing the lifetime of a free radical is to react the radical with a trapping agent that will form a reaction product in which a more stable free radical is formed. This procedure is known as spin-trapping. The ESR spectrum of a spin-trapped free radical is typically simpler than that of the free radical but contains correspondingly less information. The combined technique of ESR and spin-trapping is highly selective and sensitive for the detection of free radicals. The spin-trapped radical adducts can build up to a higher steady-state concentration than the primary radical, which makes their detection easier.While several research groups have successfully applied ESR spin-trapping to the analysis of protein radicals (14Gunther, M. R., Kelman, D. J., Corbett, J. T., and Mason, R. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270,16075–81Google Scholar, 15Barr, D. P., Gunther, M. R., Deterding, L. J., Tomer, K. B., and Mason, R. P. (1996) J. Biol.

Thus, there is a need for techniques with increased specificity and sensitivity that would provide more information about the origin and localization of the protein radical. This additional information should also provide further insight into the mechanisms involved in oxidative damage.Our research groups have investigated the reaction between horse heart cytochrome c and other proteins and peptides using mass spectrometry (MS). 1The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; cyt c, cytochrome c; RSTP, renin substrate tetradecapeptide; DBNBS, 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid; ESI, electrospray ionization; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; CID, collision-induced decomposition.1The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; cyt c, cytochrome c; RSTP, renin substrate tetradecapeptide; DBNBS, 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid; ESI, electrospray ionization; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; CID, collision-induced decomposition. MS in combination with proteolysis can be very useful for protein and modified protein determination. In our initial report using ESR and the deuterated spin trap 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane-d 9, we suggested that an amino acid radical might be responsible for the oxidation of other biomolecules catalyzed by the cytochromec/H2O2 system (15Barr, D. P., Gunther, M. R., Deterding, L. J., Tomer, K. B., and Mason, R. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 15498–15503Google Scholar). In this report, we explore the possibility that an oxidatively induced free radical on horse heart cytochrome c can initiate free radical oxidation of other proteins that do not, by themselves, undergo free radical oxidation under identical reaction conditions.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, multiple DBNBS radical adducts of cytochromec were identified by ESI/MS following the reaction of cytochrome c with H2O2 and DBNBS. From previous ESR studies, protein-derived radical adducts have been observed not only for cytochrome c (15Barr, D. P., Gunther, M. R., Deterding, L. J., Tomer, K. B., and Mason, R. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 15498–15503Google Scholar), but other heme-containing proteins such as myoglobin (14Gunther, M. R., Kelman, D. J., Corbett, J. T., and Mason, R. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270,16075–81Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 (16Barr D.P. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. Mason R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We postulated that a radical formed on a solvent-exposed tyrosine or tryptophan may allow the oxidation of other biomolecules that are unable (possibly for steric reasons) to gain access to the heme iron (15Barr, D. P., Gunther, M. R., Deterding, L. J., Tomer, K. B., and Mason, R. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 15498–15503Google Scholar). In a recent report by Østdal et al. (22Østdal H. Skibsted L.H. Andersen H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), free radicals formed in the reaction of metmyoglobin and H2O2 in the presence of proteins were investigated using freeze quench and ESR spin-trapping. Although transfer of a protein radical species was detected, the location of the radical species was not determined. In this study, our interest is in determining whether cytochrome c-derived radicals can oxidize and initiate free radical reactions on other proteins, which, by themselves, do not undergo free radical formation, and if radical transfer occurs, to determine the location of the radical on the target peptide.We initially tested several peptides and proteins to determine if free radicals could be formed on the biomolecule of interest in the absence of the heme-containing protein, cytochrome c. The compounds were chosen based on the postulate that a tyrosine and/or tryptophan residue was required for radical transfer to occur. It should be noted that no DBNBS/thiyl radical adduct has been reported. Apparently, this radical adduct is unstable, and consequently any cysteine thiyl free radicals formed would most likely not be detected. The substrates were subjected to the identical reaction conditions as for the cytochromec/hydrogen peroxide/DBNBS reactions. In all cases studies, we were unable to detect a free radical adduct on any of the biomolecules in the absence of cytochrome c.When the reactions were repeated in the presence of equimolar concentration of the heme-containing protein cytochrome c, radical adduct formation was detected for all substrates that contained a tyrosine or tryptophan amino acid residue (Fig. 3). In the case of the peptide bradykinin, which does not contain a tyrosine or tryptophan residue, no DBNBS adducts could be detected. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the presence of a tyrosine or tryptophan amino acid residue facilitates the radical transfer reaction. In addition, the fact that cytochrome c is a prerequisite for adduct formation on the target molecule is unequivocal evidence that the radicals are initially formed on cytochrome c and are then transferred to the peptide/protein. The most plausible explanation for these observations is that, initially, oxidation of the heme occurs. The radical may then be transferred intramolecularly to a peripheral tyrosine or tryptophan on the cytochrome c followed by intermolecular transfer to the peptide or protein. Intramolecular electron transfers in peptides have been reported by Bobrowskiet al. (32Bobrowski K. Wierzchowski K.L. Holcman J. Ciurak M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 62: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Bobrowski K. Wierzchowski K.L. Holcman J. Ciurak M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1990; 57: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using pulse radiolysis.Location of the radical adduct on the peptide may provide insight to a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the transfer of free radicals. Both the in-source collision induced decomposition spectra and the tandem mass spectrum showed structurally informative fragment ions as to the location of the radical adduct on the peptides. For RWIILGLNK, the DBNBS adduct is located on the tryptophan, and for RSTP, it appears that one of the DBNBS adducts is located at tryptophan 4. The in-source CID spectra, however, are complicated, because fragmentations of all ions in the source are observed. Tandem mass spectrometry, on the other hand, allows for selection of a parent ion with the first mass spectrometer into a collision cell with detection of the fragment ions with the second mass spectrometer. In this type of experiment, only ions resulting from fragmentation of the selected parent ion are observed. The tandem mass spectrum of the doubly protonated molecular ion of the DBNBS adduct of RWIILGLNK (Fig. 4) shows a nearly complete series of both C-terminal ions (i.e.y2 to y7) and N-terminal ions (i.e.a1 and b4 to b8). The observation of these structurally informative fragment ions allows for definitive identification of the amino acid that has been modified by covalent addition of a DBNBS spin trap molecule. For the peptide RWIILGLNK, the DBNBS radical adduct can thus be unequivocally assigned to the tryptophan residue.It has been shown that antioxidants, both endogenous and exogenous, are a crucial defense mechanism against free radicals. The mechanisms of action, however, are poorly understood. Antioxidants can be categorized into two types: 1) those that inhibit radical initiation and 2) those that intercept free radicals. In this study we performed a series of experiments to address the effect of the presence of antioxidants in the reaction mixtures. The trapping of free radicals was monitored by MALDI/MS as varying concentrations of ascorbic acid were added to the cytochrome c/hydrogen peroxide reaction. At the lowest level of ascorbic acid, 500 μm, little if any change in the relative abundance of the radical adducts on cytochrome cwas observed (Fig. 5 A). With an increase in the ascorbic acid concentration to 1 and 5 mm, the relative abundance of the free radicals detected is greatly reduced (Fig. 5, B andC, respectively). These data conclusively showed that the antioxidant ascorbic acid can be used to inhibit formation of free radicals or promote reduction of cytochrome c free radicals. In contrast to ESR experiments, which cannot, in general, distinguish between ascorbate reduced-trapped radical adduct (ascorbate reduction of a nitroxide) and radical reduction (34Sentjurc M. Bacic G. Swartz H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Sentjurc M. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mass spectral data show that the relative abundance of the trapped radical is decreased. This indicates that the ascorbic acid can effectively compete for reaction with the radical and/or inhibits formation of the radical species.To determine the effect of the presence of the ascorbic acid in the reactions containing target peptides, cytochrome c free radicals are formed by treatment with H2O2. After a short incubation period, a premixed solution of the target peptide and varying concentrations of ascorbic acid were added. Following an additional 2-min incubation, DBNBS spin trap was added, and the MALDI spectra were acquired. At the 500 μm and 1 mm ascorbic acid levels, RWIILGLNK plus one DBNBS was detected (data not shown). At the 5 mm ascorbic acid level, however, no radical adduct of the peptide RWIILGLNK was observed (data not shown). From these series of experiments, we have shown that the presence of an antioxidant in the reaction mixture prevented the radicals from being transferred to other biomolecules once they were formed on cytochrome c.In summary, we have shown that mass spectrometry is an extremely useful technique for the analysis of protein-derived radical adducts and for the monitoring of free radical transfers to other biomolecules. Once the free radicals are generated on the heme-containing protein, horse heart cytochrome c, they can be transferred to other polypeptides. Our data suggest that, in order for the radical to be successfully transferred, the target peptide/protein must contain either a tyrosine or a tryptophan amino acid residue. In addition, in-source collision-induced decompositions and tandem mass spectrometry provide useful structural information as to the location of the radical adduct on the peptide. The tandem mass spectrum of the molecular ion of the DBNBS adduct of RWIILGLNK produced fragment ions revealing the location of the DBNBS adduct on the tryptophan amino acid. Finally, we have shown that the presence of an antioxidant either inhibits or reduces free radicals on cytochrome c and prevents free radical transfer to other peptides. A number of toxicities are mediated by mechanisms collectively termed “oxidative stress.” Consequently, the study of oxidative stress has been the focus of considerable research in recent years. In oxidative stress mechanisms, reactive oxygen metabolites interact with cellular constituents, including DNA/RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and unsaturated lipids. In addition, cumulative oxidative damage has been implicated in a number of disease states, e.g. the aging process, cancer, and ischemia-reperfusion. The study of oxidative stress in mitochondria has shown that hydrogen peroxide is produced via the incomplete reduction of oxygen during oxidative phosphorylation (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Although hydrogen peroxide levels are kept relatively low (10−9 to 10−7m) under normal physiological conditions (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar), under certain conditions, such as inflammation or ischemia-reperfusion (2Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Free Radic. Biol.

These excessive levels are thought to produce toxic effects, such as glutathione depletion, DNA and/or protein damage, and lipid peroxidation (3Janssen Y.M.W. Van Houten B. Borm P.J.A. Mossman B.T.

Both the in-source collision induced decomposition spectra and the tandem mass spectrum showed structurally informative fragment ions as to the location of the radical adduct on the peptides. For RWIILGLNK, the DBNBS adduct is located on the tryptophan, and for RSTP, it appears that one of the DBNBS adducts is located at tryptophan 4. The in-source CID spectra, however, are complicated, because fragmentations of all ions in the source are observed. Tandem mass spectrometry, on the other hand, allows for selection of a parent ion with the first mass spectrometer into a collision cell with detection of the fragment ions with the second mass spectrometer. In this type of experiment, only ions resulting from fragmentation of the selected parent ion are observed. The tandem mass spectrum of the doubly protonated molecular ion of the DBNBS adduct of RWIILGLNK (Fig. 4) shows a nearly complete series of both C-terminal ions (i.e.y2 to y7) and N-terminal ions (i.e.a1 and b4 to b8). The observation of these structurally informative fragment ions allows for definitive identification of the amino acid that has been modified by covalent addition of a DBNBS spin trap molecule. For the peptide RWIILGLNK, the DBNBS radical adduct can thus be unequivocally assigned to the tryptophan residue.It has been shown that antioxidants, both endogenous and exogenous, are a crucial defense mechanism against free radicals. The mechanisms of action, however, are poorly understood. Antioxidants can be categorized into two types: 1) those that inhibit radical initiation and 2) those that intercept free radicals. In this study we performed a series of experiments to address the effect of the presence of antioxidants in the reaction mixtures. The trapping of free radicals was monitored by MALDI/MS as varying concentrations of ascorbic acid were added to the cytochrome c/hydrogen peroxide reaction. At the lowest level of ascorbic acid, 500 μm, little if any change in the relative abundance of the radical adducts on cytochrome cwas observed (Fig. 5 A). With an increase in the ascorbic acid concentration to 1 and 5 mm, the relative abundance of the free radicals detected is greatly reduced (Fig. 5, B andC, respectively). These data conclusively showed that the antioxidant ascorbic acid can be used to inhibit formation of free radicals or promote reduction of cytochrome c free radicals. In contrast to ESR experiments, which cannot, in general, distinguish between ascorbate reduced-trapped radical adduct (ascorbate reduction of a nitroxide) and radical reduction (34Sentjurc M. Bacic G. Swartz H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Sentjurc M. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mass spectral data show that the relative abundance of the trapped radical is decreased. This indicates that the ascorbic acid can effectively compete for reaction with the radical and/or inhibits formation of the radical species.To determine the effect of the presence of the ascorbic acid in the reactions containing target peptides, cytochrome c free radicals are formed by treatment with H2O2. After a short incubation period, a premixed solution of the target peptide and varying concentrations of ascorbic acid were added. Following an additional 2-min incubation, DBNBS spin trap was added, and the MALDI spectra were acquired. At the 500 μm and 1 mm ascorbic acid levels, RWIILGLNK plus one DBNBS was detected (data not shown). At the 5 mm ascorbic acid level, however, no radical adduct of the peptide RWIILGLNK was observed (data not shown). From these series of experiments, we have shown that the presence of an antioxidant in the reaction mixture prevented the radicals from being transferred to other biomolecules once they were formed on cytochrome c.In summary, we have shown that mass spectrometry is an extremely useful technique for the analysis of protein-derived radical adducts and for the monitoring of free radical transfers to other biomolecules. Once the free radicals are generated on the heme-containing protein, horse heart cytochrome c, they can be transferred to other polypeptides. Our data suggest that, in order for the radical to be successfully transferred, the target peptide/protein must contain either a tyrosine or a tryptophan amino acid residue. In addition, in-source collision-induced decompositions and tandem mass spectrometry provide useful structural information as to the location of the radical adduct on the peptide. The tandem mass spectrum of the molecular ion of the DBNBS adduct of RWIILGLNK produced fragment ions revealing the location of the DBNBS adduct on the tryptophan amino acid. Finally, we have shown that the presence of an antioxidant either inhibits or reduces free radicals on cytochrome c and prevents free radical transfer to other peptides. In the present study, multiple DBNBS radical adducts of cytochromec were identified by ESI/MS following the reaction of cytochrome c with H2O2 and DBNBS. From previous ESR studies, protein-derived radical adducts have been observed not only for cytochrome c (15Barr, D. P., Gunther, M. R., Deterding, L. J., Tomer, K. B., and Mason, R. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 15498–15503Google Scholar), but other heme-containing proteins such as myoglobin (14Gunther, M. R., Kelman, D. J., Corbett, J. T., and Mason, R. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270,16075–81Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 (16Barr D.P. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. Mason R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We postulated that a radical formed on a solvent-exposed tyrosine or tryptophan may allow the oxidation of other biomolecules that are unable (possibly for steric reasons) to gain access to the heme iron (15Barr, D. P., Gunther, M. R., Deterding, L. J., Tomer, K. B., and Mason, R. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 15498–15503Google Scholar). In a recent report by Østdal et al. (22Østdal H. Skibsted L.H. Andersen H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), free radicals formed in the reaction of metmyoglobin and H2O2 in the presence of proteins were investigated using freeze quench and ESR spin-trapping. Although transfer of a protein radical species was detected, the location of the radical species was not determined. In this study, our interest is in determining whether cytochrome c-derived radicals can oxidize and initiate free radical reactions on other proteins, which, by themselves, do not undergo free radical formation, and if radical transfer occurs, to determine the location of the radical on the target peptide. We initially tested several peptides and proteins to determine if free radicals could be formed on the biomolecule of interest in the absence of the heme-containing protein, cytochrome c. The compounds were chosen based on the postulate that a tyrosine and/or tryptophan residue was required for radical transfer to occur. It should be noted that no DBNBS/thiyl radical adduct has been reported. Apparently, this radical adduct is unstable, and consequently any cysteine thiyl free radicals formed would most likely not be detected. The substrates were subjected to the identical reaction conditions as for the cytochromec/hydrogen peroxide/DBNBS reactions. In all cases studies, we were unable to detect a free radical adduct on any of the biomolecules in the absence of cytochrome c. When the reactions were repeated in the presence of equimolar concentration of the heme-containing protein cytochrome c, radical adduct formation was detected for all substrates that contained a tyrosine or tryptophan amino acid residue (Fig. 3). In the case of the peptide bradykinin, which does not contain a tyrosine or tryptophan residue, no DBNBS adducts could be detected. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the presence of a tyrosine or tryptophan amino acid residue facilitates the radical transfer reaction. In addition, the fact that cytochrome c is a prerequisite for adduct formation on the target molecule is unequivocal evidence that the radicals are initially formed on cytochrome c and are then transferred to the peptide/protein. The most plausible explanation for these observations is that, initially, oxidation of the heme occurs. The radical may then be transferred intramolecularly to a peripheral tyrosine or tryptophan on the cytochrome c followed by intermolecular transfer to the peptide or protein. Intramolecular electron transfers in peptides have been reported by Bobrowskiet al. (32Bobrowski K. Wierzchowski K.L. Holcman J. Ciurak M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 62: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Bobrowski K. Wierzchowski K.L. Holcman J. Ciurak M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1990; 57: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using pulse radiolysis. Location of the radical adduct on the peptide may provide insight to a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the transfer of free radicals. Both the in-source collision induced decomposition spectra and the tandem mass spectrum showed structurally informative fragment ions as to the location of the radical adduct on the peptides. For RWIILGLNK, the DBNBS adduct is located on the tryptophan, and for RSTP, it appears that one of the DBNBS adducts is located at tryptophan 4. The in-source CID spectra, however, are complicated, because fragmentations of all ions in the source are observed. Tandem mass spectrometry, on the other hand, allows for selection of a parent ion with the first mass spectrometer into a collision cell with detection of the fragment ions with the second mass spectrometer. In this type of experiment, only ions resulting from fragmentation of the selected parent ion are observed. The tandem mass spectrum of the doubly protonated molecular ion of the DBNBS adduct of RWIILGLNK (Fig. 4) shows a nearly complete series of both C-terminal ions (i.e.y2 to y7) and N-terminal ions (i.e.a1 and b4 to b8).

https://openalex.org/W2080270214,"Each globular domain of exported multiglobular proteins putatively undergoes chaperone surveillance in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. It is difficult to visualize how surveillance of multiple globular domains might be orchestrated and regulated. Aggrecan core protein has been used as a prototype for this problem by examining transfection of informative constructs into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The salient results are as follows: 1) aggrecan's N-terminal G1 domain is minimally secreted, and its flanking Golgi reporter sites are not decorated with glycsoaminoglycan chains; in contrast, its C-terminal G3 domain is readily secreted with flanking GAG chains, and G3 also facilitates G1 secretion; 2) G3 but not G1 can be intracellularly cross-linked to chaperone Hsp25; 3) G3 and Hsp25 remain noncovalently bound and are secreted together when G3 is situated N-terminal to its normal location; 4) exon 15, which encodes the center of G3's C-lectin subdomain, is necessary and sufficient for G3 secretion. A model is proposed in which Hsp25 piggybacks onto nascent G3 in the cytosol during a translocational pause and enters the ER lumen with G3, and once G3 properly folds, Hsp25 releases G3 and recycles to the nucleus while G3 continues to the Golgi stacks, providing passage for the entire core protein."

The importance of both the 3A and 3B coding regions has been documented previously by genetic tests, and their biochemical activities have been the subject of several recent investigations. In this study, we examined the previously reported stimulation of 3D-catalyzed RNA synthesis by 3AB. We show that 3AB does not stimulate RNA synthesis on templates that are stably base paired to a primer, indicating that 3AB does not stabilize or otherwise activate 3Dpol for chain elongation. Similarly, it does not alter the kinetic parameters or binding affinities of 3D for substrates. In the absence of a primer, or in the presence of a primer that does not form a stable hybrid with the template, 3AB increases the utilization of 3′-hydroxyl termini as sites for chain elongation by 3D, and thereby stimulates RNA synthesis. 3AB may interact with and stabilize these sites and/or may recruit 3Dpol to the site, resulting in stimulation of the initiation of elongation events. We propose that this activity is required for stabilizing weak interactions that occur during nucleotidyl-protein-primed initiation events in the viral RNA replication complex.

Poliovirus-infected cells contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that has been attributed to a virally encoded protein, now known as 3Dpol (1Lundquist R.E. Ehrenfeld E. Maizel J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4773-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2Flanegan J.B. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kitamura N.

Nature. 1981; 291: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A great deal of work over the past 25 years from many laboratories has been devoted to the purification and characterization of this enzyme, and several significant characteristics of 3Dpol and its biological activities have been determined. The poliovirus RNA polymerase is a 52-kDa protein that has been purified in large quantities to yield a protein with very few, if any, detectable contaminants (4Van Dyke T.A. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1980; 35: 732-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol.

Structure ( Lond. ). 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and establish the basic features common to all types of nucleic acid polymerases (DNA-directed as well as RNA-directed); these include “fingers,” “palm,” and “thumb” subdomains (8Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 9Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The enzyme is dependent on both a template and a primer for activity and is responsible for RNA chain elongation during poliovirus RNA replication in infected cells. Although the natural primer for RNA synthesis in poliovirus-infected cells remains to be definitively identified, synthetic primers are commonly used in the laboratory for assay and characterization of 3Dpol activity. It was proposed some years ago that structural elements in the RNA template may provide a mechanism for self-priming (10Tuschall D.M. Hiebert E. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 209-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, a more current model involves protein priming (11Toyoda H. Yang C.-F. Takeda N. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2816-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has no apparent template specificity by itself, and yet it is known that in an infected cell 3Dpol replicates only viral RNA.The genome-linked protein, VPg (3B), plays an essential role in viral RNA replication, as mutations in the 3B coding sequence may abrogate RNA synthesis (12Reuer Q. Kuhn R.J. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is found on the 5′-ends of all nascent RNA strands, including those not yet completed (13Pettersson R.F. Ambros V. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 357-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu M. Davidson N. Wimmer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4711-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Larsen G.R. Dorner A.J. Harris T.J.R. Wimmer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that attachment occurs at the time of or shortly after initiation of RNA synthesis. These observations led to the suggestion that VPg may serve as primer for initiation of RNA strand synthesis. Several polypeptides containing VPg sequences, including 3AB, have been detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-VPg antibodies (16Baron M.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1982; 28: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Hanecak R. Dorner L.F. Wimmer E.

Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These polypeptides are enriched in membrane fractions containing the viral RNA replication complexes isolated from infected cells. Using a partially purified 3Dpol preparation, a “host factor,” and a poliovirion RNA template, product RNA was digested with RNase, and residual material was immunoprecipitated with anti-VPg serum; polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of this material showed 49 and 14 kDa proteins, the latter presumably 3AB, associated with residual RNA (19Morrow C.D. Navab M. Peterson C. Hocko J. Dasgupta A. Virus Res. 1984; 1: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This important result suggested that 3D and other proteins resident in this 3D preparation were sufficient to catalyze the transfer of 3AB to nascent RNA. Mutation of 3A generated a temperature-sensitive virus characterized by decreased synthesis of viral minus and/or plus strands at a nonpermissive temperature (20Bernstein H.D. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2922-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Giachetti C. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2647-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether VPg (3B), 3AB, or some other precursor form serves as the donor of VPg to nascent RNA strands.Previous reports have shown that 3AB stimulated 3D activity 50–100-fold in a poly(A)-oligo(dT) template-primer system (22Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a heteropolymeric template and primer there was also substantial stimulation (approximately 10-fold) of product formed in the presence of 3AB. For unexplained reasons, the products were of varied sizes, both in the presence or absence of 3AB, including some quite large products greater than dimer length. With a poliovirion RNA template primed with oligo(dT), stimulation of 3D-catalyzed product formation by 3AB was 5–10-fold. In a different study, Plotch and Palant (24Plotch S.J. Palant O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7169-7179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used poliovirus minus strands in a primer-independent reaction with a high concentration of 3D; they reported that they observed about 75-fold stimulation of 3D activity by 3AB with no increase in the rate of chain elongation.In addition to measurements of 3AB effects on template-dependent RNA synthesis by 3Dpol, other reported 3AB activities include: (1Lundquist R.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14430-14438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly a mutation, K107E, in 3AB decreased RNA binding and RNA plus and minus strand synthesis in mutant virus-infected cells. (5Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26810-26818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).It is not known whether any or all of these activities observedin vitro reflect significant contributions to the RNA replication reaction in an infected cell. Indeed, a biochemical mechanism for protein priming of RNA strand elongation has not been defined. Several laboratories have reported the formation of uridylylated forms of 3B (VPg), both in vivo and in vitro, that could form weakly base paired hybrids with the 3′-terminal nucleotides of poliovirus plus and minus strand RNAs; and it is assumed that these nucleotidyl-proteins serve as primers for RNA synthesis. In this report we show that 3AB does not stimulate 3D-catalyzed reactions on templates that are stably base paired to a primer. In the absence of primer (or in the presence of a primer that does not form a stable hybrid with the template), 3AB allows more efficient utilization of 3′-hydroxyl termini that transiently form duplex regions. 3AB may interact with and stabilize these sites and/or may recruit the 3D polymerase to the site, resulting in stimulation of the initiation of elongation events. We suggest that this activity of 3AB allows initiation to occur on templates formed by weak interactions during nucleotidyl-protein-primed initiation events.DISCUSSIONUnderstanding of the essential components and reactions leading to the complete replication of poliovirus RNA is incomplete. In the absence of a defined system capable of achieving the complete replication reaction in vitro, several laboratories have conducted studies of activities of individual proteins and combinations of proteins known to be involved in RNA replication by genetic tests. In this way it is hoped that partial reactions can be defined that, when appropriately constituted together, will reveal the replication picture in toto.Evidence for the role of 3AB in poliovirus RNA replication stems from observation of the RNA-negative phenotype conferred by mutations in either the 3A or 3B coding regions, from biochemical observations of 3AB associated with intracellular replication complexes, and from the presence of 3B on incomplete nascent RNA strands. These data prompted several recent efforts to examine the effects of 3AB on various putative steps in the RNA replication reaction. For example, it was shown that 3AB interacts with RNA (26Harris K.S. Xiang W. Alexander L. Lane W.S. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14430-14438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of these observations to the viral RNA replication mechanism has yet to be determined.In this report, we have examined the stimulation of 3D-catalyzed RNA synthesis by 3AB in some detail. We conclude that 3AB does not stimulate 3D activity on a template that is stably base paired to a primer. Thus, 3AB has no inherent effect on 3D stability or catalysis. If no primer is available or if the primer is not stably base paired to the template, 3AB stimulates 3D activity significantly. We postulate that 3AB interacts with 3′-hydroxyl ends that are transiently base paired, resulting in stabilization of a hybrid region containing a site for elongation. Recruitment of 3D to the site by protein-protein interaction would result in increased elongation activity. As predicted, stimulation is greatest when 3D concentration is low, since 3AB-3D interactions would have a greater impact on localizing 3D to the initiation site than when 3D is in excess. The hypothesis that 3AB-3D interaction is responsible for the increased polymerase activity is consistent with our recent observations that 3AB can stimulate polymerase activity catalyzed by the closely related Coxsackievirus B3 RNA polymerase but has no effect on polymerase activity catalyzed by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase on the same template (data not shown).Templates with high degrees of internal structure frequently fail to form stable hybrids with primer sequences even after denaturation and renaturation in primer excess. We have examined “hybrids” intended for use as substrates in the 3D reactions in polyacrylamide/urea gels. Although the PV1-72 substrate, used extensively in our studies, produced very stable hybrids, we were unable to generate a stable hybrid using the entire 5′-terminal cloverleaf structure (37Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) spanning nt 1–108. Similarly, stable hybrids did not form from the 3′-end of the poliovirus genome with transcripts from nt 7332 through the poly(A) segment into vector sequences and a variety of primers spanning the poly(A) tail with heteronucleotides on either side.It is likely that heteropolymeric substrates used by others (23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Plotch S.J. Palant O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7169-7179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were reported to support significant stimulation of 3D activity by 3AB, were unstable hybrids, behaving in a fashion similar to the primer-independent reactions described here. In addition, poly(A)-oligo(dT) substrate produced a 50–100-fold stimulation of the reaction by 3AB (22Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This large stimulation may result from transient hybrid formation on a template with multiple potential start sites.The large products formed in 3D reactions supplemented with 3AB have been observed previously (23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that these products are synthesized from contaminating transcripts produced by SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases from a population of DNAs. To form functional hybrid substrates for 3D reactions without production of large products, transcripts must be gel-purified or cDNAs must be constructed of small size and these must be gel-purified prior to transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase. We have repeatedly found that DNA digested with restriction endonucleases, seemingly to completion by analytical gel analysis, does not produce a homogeneous population of transcripts. The large products are favored in 3D plus 3AB reactions since they are primer-independent and because radioactive incorporation into product is length-dependent. 3D alone does not amplify production of large products because transient hybrid structures that include the 3′-hydroxyl terminus are apparently not accessible to 3D at the concentration used in the absence of 3AB.The primary product synthesized by 3D alone on the PV1-72 substrate was a fill-in complementary to the longer 5′-overhang (Fig. 1 A, (1)). Addition of 3AB enriched for a slower mobility band, which represented fill-in complementary to the shorter 5′-overhang (Fig. 8, lanes 10 and 11; Fig. 1 A, (2)). There is some indication (Figs. 3 and 5) that both termini are not utilized simultaneously, perhaps merely due to the low statistical probability of one molecule being bound twice in a reaction where overall template utilization is extremely low.The biochemical roles for 3AB in the process of viral RNA replication in infected cells are yet undefined. Certainly its potential to serve as the VPg donor for RNA strand initiation is critical. Its association with intracellular membranes (16Baron M.H. Baltimore D.

Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) may anchor the replicating structures in the replication complex. Its ability to bind RNA, whether or not the interactions are sequence-specific, may facilitate positioning of 3AB on the replicating RNAs. The activity described in this report may result in stabilization of the weak hybrid formed between the template and a uridylylated form of 3AB or 3B. Finally, affinity for 3CD and stimulation of cleavage to generate 3D or direct binding and recruitment of 3D itself could help localize the polymerase and thereby increase chain initiation rates. There appear to be no contributions of 3AB once chain elongation is initiated. Further studies will be required to dissect the importance of individual 3AB activities in the overall RNA replication reaction. Poliovirus-infected cells contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that has been attributed to a virally encoded protein, now known as 3Dpol (1Lundquist R.E. Ehrenfeld E. Maizel J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4773-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2Flanegan J.B. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kitamura N.

Nature. 1981; 291: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A great deal of work over the past 25 years from many laboratories has been devoted to the purification and characterization of this enzyme, and several significant characteristics of 3Dpol and its biological activities have been determined. The poliovirus RNA polymerase is a 52-kDa protein that has been purified in large quantities to yield a protein with very few, if any, detectable contaminants (4Van Dyke T.A. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1980; 35: 732-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed x-ray structural studies of a major portion of the protein have been completed (7Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure ( Lond. ). 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and establish the basic features common to all types of nucleic acid polymerases (DNA-directed as well as RNA-directed); these include “fingers,” “palm,” and “thumb” subdomains (8Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 9Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The enzyme is dependent on both a template and a primer for activity and is responsible for RNA chain elongation during poliovirus RNA replication in infected cells. Although the natural primer for RNA synthesis in poliovirus-infected cells remains to be definitively identified, synthetic primers are commonly used in the laboratory for assay and characterization of 3Dpol activity. It was proposed some years ago that structural elements in the RNA template may provide a mechanism for self-priming (10Tuschall D.M. Hiebert E. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 209-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, a more current model involves protein priming (11Toyoda H. Yang C.-F. Takeda N. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2816-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has no apparent template specificity by itself, and yet it is known that in an infected cell 3Dpol replicates only viral RNA. The genome-linked protein, VPg (3B), plays an essential role in viral RNA replication, as mutations in the 3B coding sequence may abrogate RNA synthesis (12Reuer Q. Kuhn R.J. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is found on the 5′-ends of all nascent RNA strands, including those not yet completed (13Pettersson R.F. Ambros V. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 357-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu M. Davidson N. Wimmer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4711-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Larsen G.R. Dorner A.J. Harris T.J.R. Wimmer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that attachment occurs at the time of or shortly after initiation of RNA synthesis. These observations led to the suggestion that VPg may serve as primer for initiation of RNA strand synthesis. Several polypeptides containing VPg sequences, including 3AB, have been detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-VPg antibodies (16Baron M.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1982; 28: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Hanecak R. Dorner L.F. Wimmer E. Cell. 1982; 28: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Takegami T. Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Wimmer E. Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These polypeptides are enriched in membrane fractions containing the viral RNA replication complexes isolated from infected cells. Using a partially purified 3Dpol preparation, a “host factor,” and a poliovirion RNA template, product RNA was digested with RNase, and residual material was immunoprecipitated with anti-VPg serum; polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of this material showed 49 and 14 kDa proteins, the latter presumably 3AB, associated with residual RNA (19Morrow C.D. Navab M. Peterson C. Hocko J. Dasgupta A. Virus Res. 1984; 1: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This important result suggested that 3D and other proteins resident in this 3D preparation were sufficient to catalyze the transfer of 3AB to nascent RNA. Mutation of 3A generated a temperature-sensitive virus characterized by decreased synthesis of viral minus and/or plus strands at a nonpermissive temperature (20Bernstein H.D. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2922-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Giachetti C. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2647-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether VPg (3B), 3AB, or some other precursor form serves as the donor of VPg to nascent RNA strands. Previous reports have shown that 3AB stimulated 3D activity 50–100-fold in a poly(A)-oligo(dT) template-primer system (22Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a heteropolymeric template and primer there was also substantial stimulation (approximately 10-fold) of product formed in the presence of 3AB. For unexplained reasons, the products were of varied sizes, both in the presence or absence of 3AB, including some quite large products greater than dimer length. With a poliovirion RNA template primed with oligo(dT), stimulation of 3D-catalyzed product formation by 3AB was 5–10-fold. In a different study, Plotch and Palant (24Plotch S.J. Palant O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7169-7179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used poliovirus minus strands in a primer-independent reaction with a high concentration of 3D; they reported that they observed about 75-fold stimulation of 3D activity by 3AB with no increase in the rate of chain elongation. In addition to measurements of 3AB effects on template-dependent RNA synthesis by 3Dpol, other reported 3AB activities include: (1Lundquist R.E. Ehrenfeld E. Maizel J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4773-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) 3AB binds to 3CD and 3D (24Plotch S.J. Palant O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7169-7179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Molla A. Harris K.S.

Virol. 1980; 35: 732-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3AB binds to RNA in a sequence nonspecific manner (27Lama J. Sanz M.A. Rodriguez P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14430-14438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly a mutation, K107E, in 3AB decreased RNA binding and RNA plus and minus strand synthesis in mutant virus-infected cells. (5Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3AB associates with membranes as an integral membrane protein duringin vitro translation (28Towner J.S. Ho T.V. Semler B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26810-26818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is not known whether any or all of these activities observedin vitro reflect significant contributions to the RNA replication reaction in an infected cell. Indeed, a biochemical mechanism for protein priming of RNA strand elongation has not been defined. Several laboratories have reported the formation of uridylylated forms of 3B (VPg), both in vivo and in vitro, that could form weakly base paired hybrids with the 3′-terminal nucleotides of poliovirus plus and minus strand RNAs; and it is assumed that these nucleotidyl-proteins serve as primers for RNA synthesis. In this report we show that 3AB does not stimulate 3D-catalyzed reactions on templates that are stably base paired to a primer. In the absence of primer (or in the presence of a primer that does not form a stable hybrid with the template), 3AB allows more efficient utilization of 3′-hydroxyl termini that transiently form duplex regions. 3AB may interact with and stabilize these sites and/or may recruit the 3D polymerase to the site, resulting in stimulation of the initiation of elongation events. We suggest that this activity of 3AB allows initiation to occur on templates formed by weak interactions during nucleotidyl-protein-primed initiation events. DISCUSSIONUnderstanding of the essential components and reactions leading to the complete replication of poliovirus RNA is incomplete. In the absence of a defined system capable of achieving the complete replication reaction in vitro, several laboratories have conducted studies of activities of individual proteins and combinations of proteins known to be involved in RNA replication by genetic tests. In this way it is hoped that partial reactions can be defined that, when appropriately constituted together, will reveal the replication picture in toto.Evidence for the role of 3AB in poliovirus RNA replication stems from observation of the RNA-negative phenotype conferred by mutations in either the 3A or 3B coding regions, from biochemical observations of 3AB associated with intracellular replication complexes, and from the presence of 3B on incomplete nascent RNA strands. These data prompted several recent efforts to examine the effects of 3AB on various putative steps in the RNA replication reaction. For example, it was shown that 3AB interacts with RNA (26Harris K.S. Xiang W. Alexander L. Lane W.S. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3658-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several investigators have reported that 3AB stimulates 3D polymerase activity (22Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14430-14438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of these observations to the viral RNA replication mechanism has yet to be determined. In this report, we have examined the stimulation of 3D-catalyzed RNA synthesis by 3AB in some detail. We conclude that 3AB does not stimulate 3D activity on a template that is stably base paired to a primer. Thus, 3AB has no inherent effect on 3D stability or catalysis. If no primer is available or if the primer is not stably base paired to the template, 3AB stimulates 3D activity significantly. We postulate that 3AB interacts with 3′-hydroxyl ends that are transiently base paired, resulting in stabilization of a hybrid region containing a site for elongation. Recruitment of 3D to the site by protein-protein interaction would result in increased elongation activity. As predicted, stimulation is greatest when 3D concentration is low, since 3AB-3D interactions would have a greater impact on localizing 3D to the initiation site than when 3D is in excess. The hypothesis that 3AB-3D interaction is responsible for the increased polymerase activity is consistent with our recent observations that 3AB can stimulate polymerase activity catalyzed by the closely related Coxsackievirus B3 RNA polymerase but has no effect on polymerase activity catalyzed by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase on the same template (data not shown). Templates with high degrees of internal structure frequently fail to form stable hybrids with primer sequences even after denaturation and renaturation in primer excess. We have examined “hybrids” intended for use as substrates in the 3D reactions in polyacrylamide/urea gels. Although the PV1-72 substrate, used extensively in our studies, produced very stable hybrids, we were unable to generate a stable hybrid using the entire 5′-terminal cloverleaf structure (37Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 63: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) spanning nt 1–108. Similarly, stable hybrids did not form from the 3′-end of the poliovirus genome with transcripts from nt 7332 through the poly(A) segment into vector sequences and a variety of primers spanning the poly(A) tail with heteronucleotides on either side. It is likely that heteropolymeric substrates used by others (23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Plotch S.J. Palant O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7169-7179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were reported to support significant stimulation of 3D activity by 3AB, were unstable hybrids, behaving in a fashion similar to the primer-independent reactions described here. In addition, poly(A)-oligo(dT) substrate produced a 50–100-fold stimulation of the reaction by 3AB (22Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This large stimulation may result from transient hybrid formation on a template with multiple potential start sites. The large products formed in 3D reactions supplemented with 3AB have been observed previously (23Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that these products are synthesized from contaminating transcripts produced by SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases from a population of DNAs. To form functional hybrid substrates for 3D reactions without production of large products, transcripts must be gel-purified or cDNAs must be constructed of small size and these must be gel-purified prior to transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase. We have repeatedly found that DNA digested with restriction endonucleases, seemingly to completion by analytical gel analysis, does not produce a homogeneous population of transcripts. The large products are favored in 3D plus 3AB reactions since they are primer-independent and because radioactive incorporation into product is length-dependent. 3D alone does not amplify production of large products because transient hybrid structures that include the 3′-hydroxyl terminus are apparently not accessible to 3D at the concentration used in the absence of 3AB. The primary product synthesized by 3D alone on the PV1-72 substrate was a fill-in complementary to the longer 5′-overhang (Fig. 1 A, (1)). Addition of 3AB enriched for a slower mobility band, which represented fill-in complementary to the shorter 5′-overhang (Fig. 8, lanes 10 and 11; Fig. 1 A, (2)). There is some indication (Figs. 3 and 5) that both termini are not utilized simultaneously, perhaps merely due to the low statistical probability of one molecule being bound twice in a reaction where overall template utilization is extremely low. The biochemical roles for 3AB in the process of viral RNA replication in infected cells are yet undefined. Certainly its potential to serve as the VPg donor for RNA strand initiation is critical. Its association with intracellular membranes (16Baron M.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1982; 28: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Hanecak R.

Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) may anchor the replicating structures in the replication complex. Its ability to bind RNA, whether or not the interactions are sequence-specific, may facilitate positioning of 3AB on the replicating RNAs. The activity described in this report may result in stabilization of the weak hybrid formed between the template and a uridylylated form of 3AB or 3B. Finally, affinity for 3CD and stimulation of cleavage to generate 3D or direct binding and recruitment of 3D itself could help localize the polymerase and thereby increase chain initiation rates. There appear to be no contributions of 3AB once chain elongation is initiated. Further studies will be required to dissect the importance of individual 3AB activities in the overall RNA replication reaction.

Although protein regions associated with Na+i- and Ca2+i-dependent regulation are highly conserved among cloned Na+-Ca2+ exchangers, it is unknown whether or not the structure-function relationships characteristic of NCX1.1 apply to any other exchangers. Therefore, we studied structure-function relationships in a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger from Drosophila, CALX1.1, which is unique among characterized members of this family of proteins in that μm levels of Ca2+i inhibit exchange current. Wild-type and mutant CALX1.1 exchangers were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and characterized electrophysiologically using the giant excised patch technique. Mutations within the putative regulatory Ca2+i binding site of CALX1.1, like corresponding alterations in NCX1.1, led to reduced ability (i.e. D516V and D550I) or inability (i.e. G555P) of Ca2+i to inhibit Na+-Ca2+exchange activity. Similarly, mutations within the putative XIP region of CALX1.1, as in NCX1.1, led to two distinct phenotypes: acceleration (i.e. K306Q) and elimination (i.e. Δ310–313) of Na+i-dependent inactivation. These results indicate that the respective regulatory roles of the Ca2+i binding site and XIP region are conserved between CALX1.1 and NCX1.1, despite opposite responses to Ca2+i. We extended these findings using chimeric constructs of CALX1.1 and NCX1.1 to determine whether or not functional interconversion of Ca2+i regulatory phenotypes was feasible. With one chimera (i.e. CALX:NCX:CALX), substitution of a 193-amino acid segment, from the large intracellular loop of NCX1.1, for the corresponding 177-amino acid segment of CALX1.1 led to an exchanger that was stimulated by Ca2+i. This result indicates that the regulatory Ca2+i binding site of NCX1.1 retains function in a CALX1.1 parent transporter and that the substituted segment contains some of the amino acid sequence(s) required for transduction of the Ca2+i binding signal.

The identification of novel Na+-Ca2+exchange proteins has proceeded rapidly in the past 8 years. The family of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers includes transporters encoded by unique gene products (1Nicoll D.A.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, exchangers have been cloned from several species and tissue types, and the opportunity now exists for detailed comparative structure-function studies of this family of transport molecules (10Philipson K.D.

First identified in the squid giant axon (11Baker P.F. McNaughton P.A. J. Physiol. 1976; 259: 104-114Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12DiPolo R. J. Physiol. 1979; 73: 91-113Google Scholar), Ca2+i-dependent regulation is apparent as a stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange current in response to μm levels of Ca2+i(13Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The basis for this behavior, originally termed I2inactivation, is thought to involve entry of the exchanger protein into an I2 inactive state upon removal of Ca2+i (14Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A high affinity Ca2+i binding site has been identified for the canine cardiac exchanger, NCX1.1, which appears to be closely associated with the Ca2+i-dependent regulatory process. This site comprises a 138-amino acid segment of the large intracellular loop of NCX1.1; mutation of specific residues within this region can lead to reductions in both45Ca2+ binding affinity to fusion proteins (15Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the affinity for functional Ca2+i regulation as assessed electrophysiologically (16Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger also undergoes an inactivation process in response to the application of Na+i (13Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This mechanism, termed Na+i-dependent or I1inactivation, is analogous to ion channel gating and involves the exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP) 1The abbreviations used are: XIP, exchanger inhibitory peptide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: XIP, exchanger inhibitory peptide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. region at the N terminus of the large cytoplasmic loop of NCX1.1 (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This amino acid sequence, comprising residues 219–238, was originally identified based upon primary structural similarity with calmodulin binding sites (1Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Exogenous application of a peptide corresponding to this amino acid sequence (i.e. XIP) to the intracellular surface of excised membrane patches produces marked inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents (19Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Matsuoka S.

More recent studies have shown that mutations within the XIP region of NCX1.1 are associated with substantial alterations in the rate and extent of I1 inactivation (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), lending support to the notion that the XIP region of NCX1.1 is intimately involved in the mechanism of Na+i-dependent inactivation and that exogenous application of XIP may mimic this process. Both of the ionic regulatory mechanisms (i.e.I1 and I2) can be eliminated by limited proteolysis of membrane patches with α-chymotrypsin, apparently converting NCX1.1 into a fully active, deregulated exchanger (13Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).Although the role of I1 and I2 regulation in physiological Na+-Ca2+ exchange function remains poorly understood, both processes can be readily demonstrated in intact cellular preparations (21Matsuoka S. Hilgemann D.W. J. Physiol. 1994; 476: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Kimuro J. Noma A. Irisawa H. Nature. 1986; 319: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, substantial interaction between I1 and I2 regulation has been demonstrated in both structure-function studies and electrophysiological analyses (14Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen.

We have recently observed substantial differences in I1 and I2 regulation for alternatively spliced isoforms of CALX1 (23Omelchenko, A., Dyck, C., Hnatowich, M., Buchko, J., Nicoll, D. A., Philipson, K. D., and Hryshko, L. V. (1998) J. Gen. Physiol.3,in pressGoogle Scholar). The fact that alternative splicing has targeted these regulatory mechanisms at least suggests that they may play relevant physiological roles. However, it is unclear how I1 and I2 inactivation occur at the molecular level.To date, structure-function studies of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger have been restricted to NCX1.1 (16Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A.

Sci. 1996; 779: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and it is unknown whether or not these findings can be extended to other members of this family of transport proteins. Thus, we combined mutagenesis, chimeric exchanger construction, and electrophysiological measurements to investigate amino acid sequences involved in ionic regulatory mechanisms of CALX1.1, a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger fromDrosophila melanogaster (27Ruknudin A. Valdivia C. Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C257-C265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schwarz E. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The Drosophilaprotein was selected for study because it is unique among characterized exchangers in terms of its negative regulatory response to Ca2+i (29Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Targets for mutagenesis of CALX1.1 were selected at or near regions analogous to the regulatory Ca2+i binding site and XIP region of NCX1.1, and we found striking parallels in terms of altered ionic regulatory properties between the two exchangers. Our results indicate that CALX1.1 and NCX1.1 employ an equivalent site for binding of regulatory Ca2+i. Other regions of the CALX1.1 cytoplasmic loop were identified that completely alleviate Ca2+i regulation. Mutations within the XIP region alter the pattern of Na+i-dependent inactivation, similar to that observed for NCX1.1. Our results indicate that amino acid sequences subserving Na+i- and Ca2+i-dependent regulatory processes are conserved between CALX1.1 and NCX1.1, irrespective of the fact that these exchangers are regulated by Ca2+i in opposing fashions.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined ionic regulation of theDrosophila Na+-Ca2+ exchanger CALX1.1 using mutagenesis and electrophysiological techniques. Our results indicate that Ca2+i regulation in both NCX1.1 and CALX1.1 appears to employ the same regulatory Ca2+i binding site, even though these exchangers exhibit opposite patterns of Ca2+i regulation. In addition, we have examined mutations in the XIP region of CALX1.1 and obtained similar functional consequences to that observed in NCX1.1. These mutations produced the same spectrum of changes in Na+i-dependent inactivation, ranging from an acceleration to complete elimination. We have not attempted to be exhaustive in our comparisons of CALX1.1 and NCX1.1, but rather to ascertain the likelihood that identified functional domains are conserved. Our data are highly supportive of this conservation. Consequently, the unique Ca2+i regulatory phenotypes between these exchangers must reside in an as yet unidentified domain(s) of the transporters. From initial results with chimeric exchangers, we have been successful in imparting a positive Ca2+i regulatory phenotype to a CALX1.1 parent transporter by interchanging a portion of its cytoplasmic loop with the corresponding region from NCX1.1. Further delineation of this region should provide insight into the transduction of the Ca2+i binding signal.Ca2+i-dependent Regulation of CALX1.1Regulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents by Ca2+i has been described in all exchangers studied to date, including the unique exchanger subtypes NCX1 (16Matsuoka S.

Hryshko, unpublished observations. With the exception of CALX1 splice variants, low concentrations (i.e.μm range) of Ca2+i stimulate exchange current. CALX1.1 and CALX1.2 are unique in that exchange activity is decreased over the same range of Ca2+iconcentrations (23Omelchenko, A., Dyck, C., Hnatowich, M., Buchko, J., Nicoll, D. A., Philipson, K. D., and Hryshko, L. V. (1998) J. Gen. Physiol.3,in pressGoogle Scholar, 29Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the primary structure of the regulatory Ca2+i binding site identified in NCX1.1 is well-conserved among all exchangers, there have been no studies to determine whether or not this site performs a similar function in other exchangers. Thus, we selected for study an exchanger, CALX1.1, with a Ca2+i regulatory phenotype opposite to that of NCX1.1 for two main reasons. First, if the Ca2+ibinding site serves a similar functional role in both NCX1.1 and CALX1.1, we anticipated that its affinity could be predictably altered by mutagenesis. Second, we speculated that if the 138-amino acid Ca2+i binding domain of NCX1.1 contained some (or all) of the amino acid determinants directly responsible for transduction of the Ca2+i binding signal, then interchanging this region between CALX1.1 and NCX1.1 presented the greatest likelihood of observing phenotypic differences in the recipient exchanger.Our results show that NCX1.1-analogous mutations within the regulatory Ca2+i binding site of CALX1.1 lead to parallel changes in the ability of Ca2+i to regulate exchange activity. That is, mutation of corresponding amino acid residues (see Fig. 2) reduces the affinity for Ca2+i regulation, irrespective of whether the regulatory effect is stimulatory (i.e. NCX1.1) or inhibitory (i.e. CALX1.1). This result strongly suggests that the function of the Ca2+i binding site is similar in both exchangers. Considering the striking degree of amino acid sequence similarity between the acidic clusters within the putative Ca2+i binding sites of all exchanger subtypes and species variants shown in Fig. 2, and our present results showing a conserved functional role for exchangers sharing only ~50% overall sequence identity and opposite Ca2+i-dependent regulatory phenotypes, it seems plausible that the regulatory Ca2+ibinding site may serve the same function in other, if not all, Na+-Ca2+ exchangers.Na+i-dependent Regulation of CALX1.1We have shown that the XIP region serves a similar role in both CALX1.1 and NCX1.1 because analogous mutations produce similar phenotypes in both exchangers. With K306Q, corresponding to K225Q in NCX1.1 (see Fig. 4) (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), current decay into (Fig. 5) and recovery from (Fig. 6) the I1 inactive state was increased ~2-fold, mirrored by a slight increase in the extent of inactivation as indicated by a lower value of Fss, the fraction of steady-state to peak exchange current. According to the two-state model for I1 inactivation proposed by Hilgemann et al.(17Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the larger I1 recovery rate constant of K306Q compared with CALX1.1 provides a satisfactory account for the accelerated current decay rate observed with K306Q versusCALX1.1. The observation that Fss is reduced for K306Q also indicates that entry into the I1 inactive state has been accelerated. In contrast, the I1 inactivation process was apparently eliminated altogether in Δ310–313, a result identical to that obtained with the corresponding deletion mutant in NCX1.1, Δ229–232 (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and with α-chymotrypsin-digested (i.e.deregulated) CALX1.1 (Fig. 6). Although the degree of primary structural similarity within the XIP-like regions of the various exchangers assembled in Fig. 4 is clearly less than for the acidic clusters of the Ca2+i binding site (Fig. 2), it is sufficiently prominent to tentatively conclude that this region may also share a common function in the control of Na+i-dependent inactivation of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers in general. This possibility is supported by the observation that both CALX1.1 (29Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and NCX2 (2Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), like NCX1.1, are inhibited by XIP, which appears to mimic the I1 inactivation process.Ca2+i-insensitive and Chimeric ExchangersAlthough the function of the XIP region and Ca2+i binding site appears to be conserved between CALX1.1 and NCX1.1, we have no definitive explanation for the observed differences in Ca2+i-dependent regulatory phenotypes. However, we observed that analogous mutations can render both exchangers insensitive to Ca2+i(e.g. G555P in CALX1.1 and G503P in NCX1.1) (see Fig. 3) (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Matsuoka S. Levitsky D.O. Li Z. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Dhalla N.S. Singal P.K. Takeda N. Beamish R.E. Pathophysiology of Heart Failure. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1996: 331-342Google Scholar). One possibility is that Ca2+i binds to these exchangers but the transduction process has been disabled. Supporting this notion is a report by Levitsky et al. (15Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that a fusion protein containing the Ca2+ibinding site of NCX1.1, but bearing a G503P equivalent mutation, binds45Ca2+i indistinguishably from the wild-type sequence. Also consistent with this hypothesis is our result with the chimeric exchanger CALX:NCX:CALX. Here, interchange of the entire Ca2+i binding site and flanking sequences of NCX1.1 with the corresponding region of CALX1.1 led to a transporter that was stimulated by regulatory Ca2+i (see Fig.8). Thus, the Ca2+i binding function appears to have been retained, and a partial interconversion of phenotypes occurred. Although extrapolation of results from fusion and chimeric proteins to the wild-type exchanger must be made with caution, the above findings suggest that Ca2+i binding per se may be restricted to the acidic clusters within the larger Ca2+i binding domain, and that transduction of the Ca2+i binding signal may occur through sequences remote or distinct from this region. Our results with NCX:CALX:NCX neither support nor refute this notion, irrespective of the fact that the chimeric protein did acquire a novel phenotype (i.e.Ca2+i-insensitive). Although there is little evidence to indicate that Ca2+i binding and transduction domains are modular or discrete, our results are at least suggestive of this possibility. Furthermore, we can conclude that the primary structural alterations associated with these two chimeras are relatively benign with respect to the transport function and Na+i-dependent regulation of the parent molecule. Complete and “symmetric” reversal of Ca2+i-dependent regulatory phenotypes between CALX1.1 and NCX1.1 may be possible through additional studies of this type. The identification of novel Na+-Ca2+exchange proteins has proceeded rapidly in the past 8 years. The family of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers includes transporters encoded by unique gene products (1Nicoll D.A.

Moreover, exchangers have been cloned from several species and tissue types, and the opportunity now exists for detailed comparative structure-function studies of this family of transport molecules (10Philipson K.D.

Regulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity by several factors has been described, including Na+iand Ca2+i, with the latter being the most thoroughly studied at the molecular level. First identified in the squid giant axon (11Baker P.F. McNaughton P.A. J. Physiol. 1976; 259: 104-114Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12DiPolo R. J. Physiol. 1979; 73: 91-113Google Scholar), Ca2+i-dependent regulation is apparent as a stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange current in response to μm levels of Ca2+i(13Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The basis for this behavior, originally termed I2inactivation, is thought to involve entry of the exchanger protein into an I2 inactive state upon removal of Ca2+i (14Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A high affinity Ca2+i binding site has been identified for the canine cardiac exchanger, NCX1.1, which appears to be closely associated with the Ca2+i-dependent regulatory process. This site comprises a 138-amino acid segment of the large intracellular loop of NCX1.1; mutation of specific residues within this region can lead to reductions in both45Ca2+ binding affinity to fusion proteins (15Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the affinity for functional Ca2+i regulation as assessed electrophysiologically (16Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger also undergoes an inactivation process in response to the application of Na+i (13Hilgemann D.W.

Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This mechanism, termed Na+i-dependent or I1inactivation, is analogous to ion channel gating and involves the exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP) 1The abbreviations used are: XIP, exchanger inhibitory peptide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: XIP, exchanger inhibitory peptide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. region at the N terminus of the large cytoplasmic loop of NCX1.1 (18Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This amino acid sequence, comprising residues 219–238, was originally identified based upon primary structural similarity with calmodulin binding sites (1Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Exogenous application of a peptide corresponding to this amino acid sequence (i.e. XIP) to the intracellular surface of excised membrane patches produces marked inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents (19Li Z.

Purified proteins were analyzed for ATPase activity to assess the role of individual subunits in ATP hydrolysis. His-tagged p40 contained low ATPase activity, but tagged p37 and p36 did not.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The function of RF-C as a PCNA clamp loader is dependent on its interaction with ATP, which apparently occurs in a complex way. First, ATP stimulates the binding of RF-C to DNA (10Lee S.-H.

DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 525-543Google Scholar). All human and yeast subunits show extensive amino acid sequence homology (16Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). One feature of this homology is that each RF-C subunit contains a sequence motif characteristic for NTP-binding/hydrolyzing proteins that consists of two separate units: GXXGXGKT followed by DE(A/V)D (Ref. 23Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and references therein). Such a redundancy of NTP binding sites in the five-subunit RF-C complex would be consistent with several models for ATP hydrolysis by RF-C: 1) only one subunit is the putative ATPase, and the other subunits play no role in the binding/hydrolysis of ATP despite the characteristic sequence motifs; 2) each subunit is an ATPase and acts independently of the other subunits; 3) none of the subunits is able to hydrolyze ATP unless a functional subcomplex is assembled; and 4) one subunit is a minimal ATPase, but interaction of two or more subunits is required for ATP hydrolysis and the specific activity of the ATPase depends on the protein complexity. Recombinant RF-C has been successfully expressed using several approaches. Yeast RF-C has been overexpressed in yeast by using plasmids encoding all five RF-C subunits under the control of inducible promoters (13Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Human RF-C has been reconstituted using an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system (24Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The p40·p37·p36 complex was unable to load PCNA onto DNA but did unload PCNA clamp from singly nicked circular DNA, although 1000-fold less efficiently than the five-subunit RF-C. The three-subunit complex was able to bind primed DNA and PCNA, but again more weakly than the five-subunit complex (27Cai J. Gibbs E. Uhlmann F. Philips B. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Using recombinant human RF-C expressed in the baculovirus system, we have further investigated the role of individual RF-C subunits in ATP hydrolysis. The in vitro DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of various RF-C subunits and RF-C subcomplexes has been analyzed. The ability of five-subunit RF-C complexes assembled with subunits bearing mutations in the ATP-binding motifs to stimulate pol δ holoenzyme DNA synthesis has also been characterized.

Growth and maintenance of Sf9 and High Five insect cells (ITC Biotechnology GmbH) in adherent cultures, preparation of recombinant baculoviruses, and infection of the cells were performed as described (26Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Infected cells were incubated for 48 h prior to harvesting the recombinant proteins. 7.6 × 107 cells infected by the corresponding baculoviruses were lysed in 3 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml concentration each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) containing 0.1m NaCl. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was passed over 0.8 ml of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in lysis buffer, and the column was then washed with 1 ml of the same buffer. The flow through and wash were combined and gently mixed with 50 μl of Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times in batch with 0.5 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmimidazole-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), and proteins were eluted with 200 μl of buffer C (300 mmimidazole-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.3 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). To prepare p40-his·p38·p37·p36 and p40-his·p37·p36 complexes, 3 × 108 insect cells infected by corresponding viruses were lysed in 10 ml of buffer A, 0.1 m NaCl. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with 200 μl of Ni-NTA resin. The suspension was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resin was pelleted by centrifugation, packed into a column, and washed with 4 ml of buffer B. The proteins were eluted from the resin with 2 ml of buffer C. The eluate was diluted 5-fold with buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of NaCl from 0 to 350 mm in buffer Q and collected in 0.4-ml fractions. p40·p37-his·p36 and p40·p37·p36-his were expressed using the corresponding viruses and purified analogously to p40-his·p37·p36. Regardless of which of the three subunits was His-tagged, the trimeric complex eluted from the Mono Q column in the same fractions (fractions 33 and 34). To prepare the p38·p37·p36-his complex, 1.5 × 108insect cells infected by v38, v37, and v36-his were lysed in 5 ml of buffer A, 0.1 m NaCl, and proteins were bound to 100 μl of Ni-NTA resin. The resin was washed three times in batch with 1 ml of buffer B, and proteins were eluted with 150 μl of buffer C. 4.2 × 108 insect cells infected with viruses encoding all five RF-C subunits (v140, v40-his, v38, v37, and v36-his) were lysed in 12 ml of buffer A, 0.35 m NaCl. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction bound to 300 μl of Ni-NTA resin. The suspension was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resin was pelleted by centrifugation, packed into a column, and washed with 4 ml of buffer B. The proteins were eluted from the resin with 2 ml of buffer C. The eluate was diluted with an equal volume of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mmDTT). MgCl2 and ATP were added to final concentrations of 10 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The solution was mixed with 200 μl of PCNA-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was then packed into a column and washed with 4 ml of buffer D containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP and 300 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted with buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 400 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA. Reaction mixtures (final volume of 25 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; 1 mm DTT; 10 mm MgCl2; 1 mm ATP; a 50 μm concentration each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 20 μm [α-32P]dCTP (500 cpm/pmol); 100 ng of primed ssDNA; 100 ng of PCNA; 1.2 μg ofEscherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein; 0.25 units of pol δ; and RF-C as indicated in the figures. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and acid-insoluble material was analyzed by scintillation counting. One unit of RF-C activity was defined as the incorporation of 1 nmol of total dNMP into singly primed ssDNA in the presence of pol δ, PCNA, and E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein in 30 min at 37 °C. For product length analysis, the reactions were terminated by treating them with proteinase K (60 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS and 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol, and the products analyzed on an alkaline 1.5% agarose gel as described (29Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Müller F. Hübscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5003-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (final volume of 10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol), 200 ng of M13(mp19) ssDNA, and protein to be tested. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and reactions were terminated with 10 μl of ice-cold 50 mm EDTA. 2 μl of reaction mixtures were spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate, which was developed in 1 m LiCl, 0.5 m formic acid. The amounts of [γ-32P]-ATP hydrolyzed to [32P]orthophosphate were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined in the linear range of reaction time and protein concentration dependence. To test the stability of the three- and four-subunit RF-C subcomplexes under the conditions employed to measure the ATPase activity, 10–20 μg of Mono Q-purified p40-his·p37·p36 or p40-his·p38·p37·p36 complexes were bound to 25 μl of Ni-NTA resin. Beads were washed with 1 ml of buffer E (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 300 mm NaCl and then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer E and divided into two equal parts. Supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the beads were resuspended in 200 μl of ATPase reaction mixture (DTT was omitted; ATP was nonradioactive). The suspensions were incubated for 10 min on ice or at 37 °C with periodical gentle agitation. Then the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 0 or 37 °C, respectively, the supernatant was quickly aspirated, and the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of elution buffer C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. To test the stability of the five-subunit RF-C, 3.8 × 107 insect cells were infected by the corresponding baculoviruses, and expressed proteins were bound to 25 μl of Ni-NTA resin. The beads were washed with buffer B, resuspended in buffer E, and divided into two equal parts. The resin with bound proteins was incubated for 10 min at 0 or 37 °C with 200 μl of mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 4 μg/ml PCNA. Then the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 0 or 37 °C, respectively, the supernatant was aspirated, and the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of elution buffer C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The lower half of the gel was stained with Coomassie to visualize small RF-C subunits. The upper half of the gel was blotted to nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody against p140 (monoclonal antibody 19). Western blot analysis was performed as described (26Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by densitometric scanning of Coomassie-stained protein bands in denaturing polyacrylamide gels using Image Store 7500 (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc.). As protein standards, known amounts of bovine serum albumin were loaded onto the same gel. We have recently analyzed the pathway of assembly of RF-C from individual subunits and proposed that in the last step, the large subunit p140 binds to a preformed complex of four small subunits (26Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Characterization of this four-subunit complex showed that it lacked most of the properties of RF-C. It was inactive in the PCNA loading and pol δ DNA synthesis reactions. Like the three-subunit complex p40·p37·p36 (27Cai J. Gibbs E. Uhlmann F. Philips B. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18974-18981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the four-subunit complex interacted very weakly with DNA and PCNA (data not shown). The results suggest that p140 is required for stable interaction of RF-C with DNA and PCNA. Like the three-subunit complex (27Cai J. Gibbs E. Uhlmann F. Philips B. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18974-18981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the four-subunit complex was found to possess DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (see below). To learn which RF-C subunits contribute to this activity, we tested the ATPase activities of individual RF-C subunits and various subcomplexes purified from baculovirus infected insect cells (26Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To analyze the DNA-dependence of the ATPase activity, heteropolymeric M13 ssDNA was chosen, since the latter was found to be the most effective cofactor for ATPase activity of natural RF-C (8Podust V.N. Georgaki A. Strack B. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged small RF-C subunits p40-his, p37-his, and p36-his can be expressed as soluble proteins and purified in ample amounts (26Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). As a control to distinguish the putative ATPase activity of expressed RF-C subunits from possible host protein contaminants, the same amount of cells used to prepare individual RF-C subunits was infected with control virus, and cellular extract was purified according to the protocol for p40-his, p37-his, and p36-his (Fig. 1 A, control preparation lane). Analysis of individual subunit preparations for ATPase activity showed that only p40-his displayed very weak ATPase activity (0.017 mol ATP hydrolyzed per mol of p40-his in 1 min), and this activity was not dependent on ssDNA (TableI).Table IComparison of ATPase activities of RF-C subunits and their complexesProtein complexATP hydrolysis without DNAATP hydrolysis with DNADNA stimulation of ATP hydrolysisDNA-stimulated ATPase activity in comparison with p40-hismol/min/molmol/min/molp36-hisNT1-aNT, not tested.ND1-bND, not detected."

We produced small site-directed changes in the S3 stalk segment of the Ca2+ ATPase and found that mutation of five amino acids to the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase residues increases by 3 orders of magnitude the TG concentration required for inhibition of Ca2+ ATPase and coupled Ca2+transport. A single mutation in the S3 stalk segment (Gly257 → Ile) is sufficient to increase by 1 order of magnitude the TG concentration required to produce 50% inhibition. By comparison, mutations yielding a nine-amino acid homology in the M3 transmembrane segment, or a 25-amino acid homology in the S4 stalk segment, do not affect the ATPase sensitivity to TG. We suggest that specific binding of TG to the S3 stalk segment, in addition to stacking of the TG ring structure at the membrane interface, determines the high affinity of the ATPase for the inhibitor.

These effects suggest a global effect of TG on the enzyme, as also indicated by its influence on formation of ordered ATPase arrays (11Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Hence, clarification of the TG binding domain would contribute to the understanding of structural and mechanistic features in the enzyme. A useful approach, in this regard, is to study the TG sensitivity of chimeric proteins consisting of defined parts of SERCA and Na+,K+-ATPase, because TG interacts specifically with the former and not with the latter. Previous studies with large chimeric exchanges, however, produced strong inhibition of catalytic turnover and transport. Nevertheless, Ca2+-dependent formation of phosphorylated intermediate was preserved, and a reduced sensitivity of this parameter to TG was obtained upon chimerization of the entire S3-M3 (stalk and membrane-bound) region (13Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TG sensitivity was not altered significantly if other large regions were exchanged (13Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P.

We describe here the construction and functional characterization of more discrete chimeric changes, involving stepwise mutations of one and up to several amino acids in the S3 or S4 stalk segments of the SERCA, to match the corresponding residues of the Na+,K+-ATPase. A similar strategy was previously used in studies of ouabain binding by the Na+,K+-ATPase, taking advantage of ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive isoforms of the enzyme (16Lingrel J.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into pUC19 vector for site-directed mutagenesis. For this purpose, the cassette delimited byBssHII and Bsu36I restriction sites (579 bp including S3 and M3 coding sequences), and the cassette delimited byBamHI and Bsu36I (318 bp including M4 and S4 coding sequences), were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide “flanking” primers. Furthermore, complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides of 23–35 bp length were synthesized for each individual mutation. These primers were utilized to hybridize DNA sequences internal to the flanking primers and were used for PCR mutagenesis by the overlap extension method as described by Ho et al. (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping fragments containing the mismatched base(s) of the targeted sequence were amplified in separate PCR reactions. The PCR mixtures contained 1 μm each of flanking and mutagenic primers, 800 μm dNTPs, 20 ng of SERCA-1 cDNA, 2.5 units of Pfu (Pyrococcus furiosus) DNA polymerase, and Pfu buffer (Stratagene, Menasha, WI) in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 3% low melting agarose gel (FMC, Rockland, ME), and the appropriate M r band was excised and melted at 72 °C for 5 min. The eluted fragments were fused, and the entire cassette was amplified using both flanking primers. The mutant cassette was then exchanged with the corresponding cassette of wild-type cDNA in pUC19 vector, and sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Additive chimeric mutations were introduced by sequential PCR mutagenesis using mutant DNA as template. Finally, the mutated cDNA was subcloned into COS-1 expression vector pCDL-SRα296 (20Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for transfection and overexpression of protein under control of the SV40 promoter. COS-1 cell cultures and transfections were carried out as described by Sumbilla et al. (15Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Fang Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol.

The microsomal fraction of transfected COS-1 cells was obtained by differential centrifugation of homogenized cells (15Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Fang Y.

Immunodetection of expressed ATPase in the microsomal fraction was obtained by Western blotting, using the CaF-5C3 monoclonal antibody to SERCA-1 (17Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was measured by following the uptake of radioactive calcium tracer by microsomal vesicles. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, variable concentrations of TG, 5 μg of microsomal protein/ml, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and 3 mm ATP. The reaction was started (37 °C) by the addition of oxalate and ATP, and was terminated at sequential times by vacuum filtration (0.45-μm Millipore filters). The filters containing the calcium loaded vesicles were washed with 2 mmLaCl3 and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and were then processed for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. The observed rates of Ca2+ transport were corrected to reflect the level of expressed ATPase in each microsomal preparation, as revealed by immunoreactivity and with reference to microsomes obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type SERCA-1 cDNA. ATPase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm sodium azide, 20 μg of microsomal protein/ml, 3 μm ionophore A23187, 3 mm ATP, and 0–1000 nm TG. Ca2+-independent ATPase activity was assayed in the presence of 2 mm EGTA and no added Ca2+. The reaction was started (37 °C) by the addition of ATP, and samples were taken at serial times for determination of Pi by the method of Lanzetta et al. (21Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinsch P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent activity was calculated by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase from the total ATPase and was corrected to account for the level of expressed protein in each microsomal preparation as revealed by immunoreactivity, and with reference to microsomes obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type SERCA-1 cDNA. The chimerization scheme for analysis of the S3 stalk segment is shown in TableI. In part A (top and bottom lines), nine amino acids of the SERCA S3 segment and of the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase segment are aligned according to Norregaard et al. (1Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the intervening lines, it is then shown how eight amino acids of the Ca2+ ATPase sequence were stepwise mutated to complement the conserved Phe256, and yield a nine-amino acid chimeric sequence identical to that of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Seven mutants were derived from this stepwise procedure and processed for transgenic expression in COS-1 cells.Table IMutation schemes for the S3 (A) and M3 (B) segmentsA.Sequence no.254255256257258259260261262Ca2+ATPaseAspGluPheGlyGluGlnLeuSerLysMutant S3,2GluHisPheMutant S3,3GluHisPheIleMutant S3,4GluHisPheIleHisMutant S3,5GluHisPheIleHisLeuMutant S3,6GluHisPheIleHisLeuIleMutant S3,7GluHisPheIleHisLeuIleThrMutant S3,8GluHisPheIleHisLeuIleThrGlyNa+,K+-ATPaseGluHisPheIleHisLeuIleThrGlyB.Sequence no.269270271272273274275276277Ca2+ATPaseValAlaValTrpLeuIleAsnIleGlyMutant M3–5SerPhePheSerIleNa+,K+-ATPaseValSerPhePheIleLeuSerIleIleThe native sequences of the S3 (stalk) and M3 (transmembrane) segments of SERCA-1 (17Karin N.J.

Five mutations were produced to yield a nine-amino acid chimeric sequence (including four residues of native homology). Another chimerization scheme was directed to the Ca2+ATPase S4 segment, and involved mutation of five amino acids to complement 16 homologous amino acids and four conservative replacements in the native sequence, yielding a 25-residue chimeric sequence that is homologous to the corresponding segment of the Na+,K+-ATPase (TableII).Table IIMutation scheme for the S4 segmentSequence no.321322323324325326327328329330331332333Ca2+ATPaseLeuGlyThrArgArgMetAlaLysLysAsnAlaIleValMutant S4,5ThrAlaCysNa+,K+-ATPaseLeuThrAlaLysArgMetAlaArgLysAsnCysLeuValSequence no.334335336337338339340341342343344345346Ca2+ATPaseArgSerLeuProSerValGluThrLeuGlyCysThrSerMutant S4,5AlaSerNa+,K+-ATPaseLysAsnLeuGluAlaValGluThrLeuGlySerThrSerThe native sequence of the S4 (stalk) segments of SERCA-1 (17Karin N.J.

In addition to the chimeric exchanges described above, more discrete mutations were produced in the S3 segment (as explained in TableIII and in the text below) to test the effects of limited perturbations in this region.Table IIIEffects of single mutations on SERCA-1, and alternative mutations on the S3,5 chimeraOriginal cDNAMutationK InmWT0.18 ± 0.03WTGly257 → Ile2.22 ± 0.70WTGln259 → Leu0.40 ± 0.10S3,5200 ± 50S3,5Gly257 → Ala0.22 ± 0.07Gln259 → AsnS3,5Gly257 → Ala1.50 ± 0.25Gln259 → GlySingle mutations of the WT SERCA-1 to the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase residues, as well as single or double mutations in the S3,5 chimera (to more conservative replacements as compared to the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase residues) were produced, and their effects on the sensitivity of the enzyme to TG were studied as shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

The K Ivalues are the numbers used to fit the inhibition curves (three experiments per each mutant), and correspond to the TG producing 50% inhibition. Approximately 10% of the COS-1 cells transfected under our conditions overexpress and target the Ca2+ ATPase to the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown byin situ microscopic visualization following immunofluorescent staining (18Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, Western blot analysis of microsomal fractions obtained from the harvested cells revealed similar levels of expression for the wild-type ATPase and ATPase mutants (Fig. 1). Minor variations of expression levels were generally related to the efficiency of transfection rather than the presence of mutations. At any rate, the expression levels were quantitated by densitometry of Western blots, and the resulting values were used to correct the functional parameters to be described below, with reference to the wild-type enzyme. As originally reported by Maruyama and MacLennan (22Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), microsomal vesicles obtained from transfected COS-1 cells sustain ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and related ATPase activity. These are specific and useful functional signals, which, as shown in Fig.2, proceed at constant rates for several minutes. Ca2+ uptake is a highly specific functional parameter, which is totally inhibited by TG (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, the observed ATPase activity includes Ca2+-independent and TG-insensitive components that must be subtracted from the total in order to obtain the specific Ca2+-dependent and TG-sensitive ATPase activity (Fig. 2 B). When we compare the Ca2+ transport activities of wild-type and mutant proteins (Fig. 3), we find that the transport rates are unaffected by mutations of up to four amino acids in the S3 segment (mutants S3,2 and S3,3; Fig. 3), but undergo a progressive reduction as the number of mutated amino acids in the S3 segment is increased (mutants S3,4 to S3,8; Fig. 3). On the other hand, the nine-amino acid chimeric homology with the Na+,K+-ATPase in M3 (M3,5) and the 25-amino acid homology in S4 (S4,5), produce only 60% and 30% reduction of the transport rates, respectively (see Fig. 3). Similar effects of mutations were observed on the ATPase hydrolytic rates (data not shown). We then tested the TG concentration sensitivity of wild-type enzyme and of mutants retaining at least 50% activity. It is shown in Fig. 4 A that the K I for Ca2+ transport inhibition by TG is gradually shifted by 3 orders of magnitude to higher concentrations (1.7 × 10−10m to 1.25 × 10−7m) as the number of mutated amino acids in the M3 segment is increased to five or six, to yield a six- or seven-amino acid homologous segment between Ca2+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. Similar results were observed for Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity (Fig.4 B). Because in the work of Norregaard et al. (1Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ATPase sensitivity to TG was lost following an extensive chimeric replacement involving the entire S3-M3 segment, we produced a nine-amino acid chimeric exchange within the M3 transmembrane segment, to be compared with the analogous chimeric exchange produced in the S3 stalk segment. We found that the chimeric exchange in the M3 segment produced approximately 60% transport inhibition (Fig. 3), but had no effect on the ATPase sensitivity to TG (Fig.5). To test the specificity of mutations in the S3 segment with regard to TG sensitivity, we then studied a five-amino acid chimeric mutation in the S4 segment of the ATPase (S4,5 in Table II). It should be pointed out that the segment chosen for our studies contains already 16 homologous, and four conservatively replaced, amino acids, when compared with the corresponding segment of the Na+,K+-ATPase (Table II). Therefore, mutation of five heterologous amino acids results in a 21-amino acid chimeric segment. It is of interest that this S4 mutant produces only 30% inhibition of function (Fig. 4), and its TG sensitivity is identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5). Considering that a five-amino acid mutation in the S3 stalk segment reduces the ATPase sensitivity to TG by 3 orders of magnitude, we then produced more discrete mutations to test the effects of limited perturbations in this region. We found that a single mutation of Gly257 to the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase residue (Ile) is sufficient, by itself, to reduce the ATPase sensitivity to TG by 1 order of magnitude (Table III). The important role of Gly257 is also revealed by the significant reversal of TG sensitivity reduction observed when the Gly257 → Ile mutation in the S3,5 chimera is changed to the more conservative Gly257 → Ala mutation. Additional reversal to WT behavior is produced by a further change involving the Gln259 → Leu mutation to the more conservative Gly259 → Asn mutation (Table III). This further reversal is not obtained if Glu259 is mutated to Gly (Table III). TG produces global inhibition (i.e. phosphoenzyme formation, hydrolytic activity, and Ca2+ transport) of ATPase, whereas no inhibition is produced by TG on the Na+,K+-ATPase (5Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This specificity has motivated chimeric studies to obtain information on the TG binding site, assuming that replacement of a critical SERCA sequence with the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase sequence would interfere with inhibition. Large chimeric exchanges produce nearly total inhibition of hydrolytic activity and Ca2+ transport. Nevertheless, formation of Ca2+-dependent phosphoenzyme is retained by such chimeric proteins and, based on phosphoenzyme measurements, it was shown that large chimeric exchanges in the cytosolic SERCA region do not interfere with inhibition by TG (15Sumbilla C.

In contrast, chimeric exchange of a 30-amino acid (Leu253–Val283) S3-M3 segment (1Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reduces the inhibitory effect of TG concentrations as high as 2 μm TG (Fig. 6 and TableIV).Table IVCharacteristics of the enzyme and chimeric constructs shown in Fig. 6ProteinCa2+uptakeATP hydrolysisTG affinityCa2+-ATPase++Very high A−−Very high (EP) B−−Very low (EP) C++Very low D++Very high E++Very highNa+,K+-ATPaseNA+None FLocation of azido-TG photolabelCharacterization of chimera A was obtained from Sumbilla et al.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11865-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we produced small chimeric changes by stepwise site-directed mutations in the S3 stalk segment and studied the so-derived SERCA mutants with regard to their ability to sustain Ca2+ transport and hydrolytic activity, and their sensitivity to TG. Mutations of up to six amino acids in the S3 stalk segment yield an enzyme retaining ample Ca2+ transport and ATPase activities for studies of inhibition by TG. We then found that small chimeric mutations of the S3 segment (Fig. 6 and Table IV) produce a marked reduction of the ATPase sensitivity to TG. Single mutation of Gly257 → Ile is, by itself, very effective. It should be noted that, given higher TG concentrations, the full inhibitory effect is obtained in all cases. This indicates that chimeric mutations in the S3 segment reduce the ATPase affinity for TG, but do not interfere with the inhibitory mechanism. It is of interest that the SERCA S4 segment includes already, in its native structure, a very high and unique degree of structural homology with the Na+,K+-ATPase as well as other cation ATPases. Such a localized homology suggests that this segment may serve as a common structural device for long range functional linkage of the catalytic site in the extramembranous region, and the cation binding site in the membrane-bound region (18Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Garnett C. Sumbilla C. Fernandez Belda F. Chen L. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11019-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On the other hand, such a high degree of homology between the TG-sensitive SERCA and other TG-insensitive ATPases suggests that S4 segment is not involved in the enzyme interaction with TG. In fact, we found that a five-amino acid mutation, which (due to additional native homology) yields a 25-amino acid segment identical to that of the Na+,K+-ATPase, does not interfere at all with the concentration dependence of TG inhibition (Figs. 5 and 6). Therefore, the lack of effect of larger chimeric mutations in the S4 segment underlines the topological specificity of the rather limited S3 chimeric mutations that interfere with ATPase sensitivity to TG. Mutations in the transmembrane M3 segment are also ineffective. Our experiments demonstrate that the S3 stalk segment is specifically involved in determining the ATPase sensitivity to TG and suggest that the S3 segment is involved in TG binding. That the reduced sensitivity may be due to long range effects of the S3 mutations is unlikely, because extensive chimeric exchanges in other regions (Fig. 6 and TableIV) do not affect the ATPase sensitivity to TG (1Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Fang Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that specific interaction of TG with the S3 segment, in addition to stacking of the TG ring structure at the membrane interface (24Hua S. Malak H. Lakowicz J.R. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5137-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), determines the high affinity of the inhibitor for the ATPase."

The presence of a Ste20-like severin kinase inDictyostelium suggests a direct signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of actin-binding proteins. The dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton in motile cells are mainly regulated by actin-binding proteins which either interfere directly with the polymerization kinetics of actin or alter the viscoelasticity of the filamentous network (for reviews, see Refs.1–3). Severin from Dictyostelium discoideum, a model for amoeboid cell motility, belongs to the class of F-actin fragmenting and capping proteins whose members are structurally and functionally related (4Matsudaira P. Janmey P. Cell. 1988; 54: 139-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This class includes among others the vertebrate proteins gelsolin (5Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1979; 281: 581-586Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar), villin (6Bretscher A. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2677-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). F-actin fragmenting proteins are especially well suited for causing quick rearrangements in the filamentous actin network. At micromolar Ca2+ levels they sever actin filaments by rupturing the noncovalent bonds between actin subunits in a filament. This leads to a rapid increase of short filaments together with a dramatic decrease in viscosity. After having severed the actin filaments, the proteins remain bound at the barbed end of the filaments and thereby prevent filament elongation. It is assumed that this results in solation of the viscous cytoplasm with a large number of short but capped filaments. For several members of this family it has been shown in vitro that uncapping is caused by polyphosphoinositides. In vivo this could then lead to free barbed ends ready for rapid elongation (9Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that actin fragmenting proteins might be targets in signaling cascades to the cytoskeleton. Gelsolin has been implicated in the phosphoinositide-mediated F-actin uncapping of human platelets following stimulation of thrombin receptors (10Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts of gelsolin null mice have excessive actin stress fibers and migrate more slowly than wild type fibroblasts (11Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), while overexpression of gelsolin in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to an increase in motility (12Cunningham C.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+ and polyphosphoinositides, phosphorylation seems to play an important role in regulating proteins from this family as well (13Onoda K. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4106-4112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, except for a fragmin kinase (14De Corte V. Gettemans J. De Ville Y. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5472-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) no other kinase has been described in detail so far. The intracellular responses to external signals are very often mediated by kinase cascades. The best studied kinase cascade activated by external signals is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; GCK, germinal center kinase; SOK, STE20/oxidant stress response kinase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid; Krs, kinase responsive to stress; BLAST, basic local alignment search tool; MIHCK, myosin I heavy chain kinase; Rab8ip, rab8 interacting protein; MST, mammalian sterile 20-like; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); aa, amino acid(s). system. Its core comprises a module of three kinases in which the most distal MAPK is activated by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) which itself is activated by a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). MAPK modules are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and in recent years it has become clear that in every cell several pathways, responsive to different external stimuli, exist in parallel (15Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 16Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 17Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The protein kinase PAK1 from rat brain was identified based upon its ability to interact with the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. The binding of active Rac1/Cdc42 stimulated autophosphorylation and activity of PAK1. The sequence of PAK1 was found to be closely related to Ste20p, a key regulator in the mating pheromone response pathway inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, that acts via activation of a MAPK cascade (18Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 20Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The growing family of related kinases is referred to as either the PAK or Ste20-like kinase family. Although their in vivo role has not yet been clearly defined, PAK family members are considered to be promising candidates for the mediation of both Cdc42/Rac-induced effects, cytoskeletal reorganization, and transcriptional activation via a MAPK cascade (21Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell. Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Based on primary structure and mode of regulation, the PAK family can be subdivided into two main branches. Close relatives of PAK1 and Ste20p (true PAKs) are characterized by a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain of variable length that contains a p21-binding domain (23Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and, in some cases, a pleckstrin homology domain as well. Members of the second branch of the PAK family, the so-called GCK subfamily, have their catalytic domain positioned at the N terminus followed by a C-terminal regulatory region (21Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell. Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a severin kinase fromDictyostelium, whose 62-kDa subunit is most closely related to human SOK-1, a member of the GCK subfamily of Ste20-like kinases. Cells of D. discoideumstrain AX2 were cultivated axenically at 21 °C in 5-liter Erlenmeyer flasks up to a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, harvested without starvation, and homogenized by nitrogen excavitation in a Parr bomb essentially as described (24Schleicher M. Gerisch G. Isenberg G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors in the homogenization buffer (25Scheel J. Ziegelbauer K. Kupke T. Humbel B.M. Noegel A.A. Gerisch G. Schleicher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2832-2839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Usually 50 to 80 g of cells (wet weight) from 12 liters of culture were used for protein purification. The 100,000 × g supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0 and loaded onto a DEAE cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) anion exchange column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with TEDABP, pH 8.0 (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing the column with at least 2 column volumes of TEDABP, protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in TEDABP (400 ml). Under these conditions severin kinase eluted early in the gradient between 40 and 80 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 A). All the following purification steps were performed with columns connected to the BioLogic FPLC system (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). The active fractions were pooled, the pH carefully adjusted to 6.5, and loaded onto a S-Sepharose column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with MEDABP, pH 6.5 (10 mm MES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing, the column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl (60 ml) in MEDABP (Fig. 1 B). Severin kinase eluted between 160 and 290 mm NaCl. The corresponding fractions were pooled, dialyzed against TEDABP, loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) equilibrated in the same buffer and bound protein eluted with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl (40 ml) in TEDABP (Fig. 1 C). The active fractions (250–320 mm NaCl) were pooled and solid ammonium sulfate was added to 50% saturation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of IEDANBP, pH 7.6 (10 mm imidazole, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and loaded onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) equilibrated in the same buffer. Severin kinase eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa (Fig. 1 D). Active fractions were either used for biochemical characterization or for determination of peptide sequences. Using this purification scheme we obtained about 10 μg of the 62-kDa polypeptide from 50 g of cells (wet weight). During all purification steps the elution of severin kinase activity was assayed by phosphorylation assays with either severin, the 1:1 actin-severin complex, or DS211C as a substrate (26Eichinger L. Schleicher M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4779-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For size calibration of the Superose 12 column the following proteins were used: ferritin (450 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), chymotrypsin (25 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa; Fig. 1 D, inset). Rabbit actin was prepared from skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (27Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S300.D. discoideum severin and actin were purified as described (28Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The concentration of actin was measured as described (29Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). All other protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Recombinant regulatory domain of severin kinase was purified from M15[pREP4] cells that had been transformed with the expression plasmid pQE32 containing the corresponding coding region. Cells were grown at 37 °C, induced at an OD580 nm of 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h, harvested, opened by ultrasonication as described (28Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and insoluble material was pelleted (20 min, 30,000 × g). The resulting pellet was stepwise re-extracted, once with TEDABP, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and five times with TEDABP, pH 8.0, containing 6 m urea (TEDABUP). The latter five supernatants were combined and applied onto a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with TEDABUP and then with TEDABUP containing 20 mm imidazole. The regulatory domain was eluted with TEDABUP containing 200 mmimidazole. Regulatory domain purified in this way was slowly dialyzed against TEDABP, pH 8.0, and concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon GmbH, Witten, Germany). Two rabbits were immunized with the recombinant protein according to established procedures. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the regulatory domain were used for immunoprecipitation of severin kinase from either a partially purified fraction (severin kinase pool after the Mono Q column) or from a crude fraction after opening theDictyostelium cells (100,000 × gsupernatant). Kinase containing fractions (700 μl) were incubated overnight at 6 °C with 50 μl of polyclonal antibody 5196 or polyclonal antibody 5197 in a total volume of 1 ml with a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 in phophate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mmNa2HPO4, 30 mmKH2PO4), pH 8.0. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out in the absence of either polyclonal antibody or severin kinase. Protein-A Sepharose beads (25 μl) were added, the suspensions shaken for 1 h, and centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were removed, the pellets washed three times with 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of TEDABP, pH 8.0, and aliquots (20 μl) used in a phosphorylation assay with either severin or severin in the actin-severin complex as a substrate. The remaining beads were boiled after addition of 20 μl of 3 × SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Severin kinase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm ATP (2–5 μCi of [32P]ATP), 0.01% NaN3, and 1–4 μm substrate. The reaction was initiated by addition of either the substrate or the kinase to the reaction mixture and carried out at 30 °C. Severin (2–4 μm final concentration), DS211C (2–4 μm), or the 1:1 actin-severin complex (1–2 μm each) were used as substrates. The actin-severin complex was allowed to form in G-buffer, followed by the addition of EGTA (1 mm final concentration) resulting in the EGTA stable 1:1 complex (26Eichinger L. Schleicher M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4779-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Determination of the substrate dependence of severin kinase was carried out with different substrates at a final concentration of 2 μm. For testing the Ca2+dependence of the phosphorylation reaction, the mixture contained, in addition, 2 mm Ca2+, and in the assays with Mn2+-ATP, 10 mm MnCl2 instead of MgCl2. The pH dependence was tested by the addition of 1/10 volume of the following buffers to the reaction mixture: 500 mm MES, pH 6.0 and 6.5, 500 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 500 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5. Activation by autophosphorylation was tested by preincubating severin kinase with unlabeled ATP for 0, 5, or 20 min in the absence of substrate, then substrate was added and the reaction allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. If not stated otherwise phosphorylation was terminated after 30 min by the addition of 20 μl of 3 × concentrated SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on minislab gels (110 × 83 × 0.5 mm) using the buffer system of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was terminated before the running front reached the lower buffer chamber and the gel was cut just above the running front to remove the lower gel strip which contains most of the non-incorporated radioactive ATP. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and, after drying of the gels, labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR films. For quantitation of incorporated phosphate, bands were scanned densitometrically and intensities evaluated with the program NIH Image 1.61. Tryptic fragments of the 62-kDa subunit of severin kinase were resolved by reversed-phase chromatography and subjected to Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer according to Eckerskorn et al. (32Eckerskorn C. Mewes W. Goretzki H. Lottspeich F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Four peptide sequences, K5 (EQQQQQQPTPV), K8 (PVAVQEQQQTP), K10 (GSFGEV), and K18 (TVAATTAPATTPASNAPT), were obtained and used to construct degenerate PCR primers. PCR was performed with genomic DNA of the AX2 strain as a template (denaturation: 94 °C, 60 s; annealing: 54 °C, 60 s; elongation: 72 °C, 60 s; 25 cycles) with primers K8N (5′-CGCGAATTCCCAGTHGCHGTHCAAGA-3′) and K18C (5′-CGCGGATCCGCTGGDGTDGTDGCWGG-3′) and resulted in amplification of a 250-base pair genomic fragment. The translated open reading frame of this fragment contained K5 as well as the appropriate amino acids downstream of K8N and K18C. All primers contained 5′-overhang sequences suitable for digestion with restriction enzymes; for degenerate positions the following abbreviations are used: H = [A,T,C]; D = [G,A,T]; W = [A,T]. The 0.25-kb fragment generated was labeled with [α-32P]dATP and employed to screen a λgt11 cDNA library (33Lacombe M.-L. Podgorski G.J. Franke J. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16811-16817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described (34Do¨ring V. Schleicher M. Noegel A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17509-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From one positive clone the cDNA insert was amplified by PCR using primers of the λgt11 flanking regions, cloned into pUC19 vector (35Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11461) Google Scholar), and sequenced with the chain termination dideoxy method (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar) using uni and reverse primers, as well as sequence specific oligonucleotide primers. The isolated cDNA had a size of about 1.2 kb and contained the 3′ end, but lacked the 5′ end of the gene. A 5′ 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment of this clone was used to screen a random primed λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA) which yielded another positive clone with an insert of about 1.3 kb harboring the ATG start codon preceded by two in-frame stop codons but lacking the 3′ end of the gene. The two cDNA clones had about 1-kb sequence in common and internal restriction sites were used to combine the two clones to yield the full-length cDNA in pUC19. In order to exclude possible errors resulting from PCR amplification of the λgt11 cDNA clones, we confirmed both sequences at least once with independently amplified and cloned PCR products. Standard techniques were used for cloning, transformation, and screening (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Searches for similarities to other protein sequences were done with the program BLAST (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70619) Google Scholar) using the combined non-redundant entries of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, Swiss-Prot, PIR, and GenBank at the NCBI. The sequence was analyzed by using the UWGCG (University of Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group; Madison, WI) and PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package, version 3.5c by Joseph Felsenstein, University of Washington) program packages. Northern analysis followed established procedures (39Noegel A. Welker D.L. Metz B.A. Williams K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the regulatory domain (aa 277–478) was amplified by PCR (denaturation 94 °C, 60 s; annealing 60 °C, 60 s; elongation 72 °C, 60 s; 25 cycles) with primers Sevkin-Ntreg (5′-CGCGGATCCATATGAGAAGACAAAAATGGTTACAAT-3′) and Sevkin-Ct (5′-GCGAAGCTT TTATCTTTTAAGGGTTTCAATG-3′). Primer sequences corresponding to the coding sequence of severin kinase are shown in italic and restriction sites in the 5′ overhang sequence for cloning in bold. The resulting PCR product was cloned into theBamHI, HindIII sites of the pQE32 expression vector (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The complete expression construct was sequenced to exclude possible errors resulting from the PCR. To identify protein kinases from D. discoideumthat phosphorylate cytoskeletal proteins, we screened DEAE column fractions of soluble homogenates for kinase activities by adding actin, severin, or a 1:1 complex of both proteins as a substrate. We detected an activity that phosphorylated the actin-fragmenting protein severin either on its own or in a complex with actin. This severin kinase activity was further purified by additional chromatographic steps including gradient elution from S-Sepharose or Mono Q, and gel filtration on Superose 12 (Fig. 1). In the final Superose 12 gel filtration step the kinase eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of about 300 kDa (Fig.1 D, inset, Superose 12). These active fractions contained a polypeptide of about 62 kDa which (i) coeluted with kinase activity, (ii) was strongly phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and (iii) shifted almost completely to a higher molecular mass in SDS-PAGE after preincubation with unlabeled Mg2+-ATP (Fig.2 A). The low percentage gel (7.5% acrylamide) used in this experiment resolved the rather broad 62-kDa signal shown in Fig. 1 into at least three distinct bands (Fig.2 A, lane 3) which suggests multiple autophosphorylation of the 62-kDa protein. It is not yet clear whether native severin kinase is composed of only the 62-kDa subunit or whether it constitutes a heteromer. Autophosphorylation of the 62-kDa polypeptide exactly followed severin kinase activity during all purification steps and was therefore likely to represent the severin kinase (Fig. 1). In addition, polyclonal antibodies directed against the regulatory domain specifically precipitated the 62-kDa polypeptide from either a partially purified severin kinase fraction or from the soluble fraction after opening the Dictyostelium cells. In phosphorylation assays, the 62-kDa polypeptide in the immunoprecipitate as well as added severin either on its own or in complex with actin were strongly phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3). Phosphorylation of severin in the actin-severin complex was more pronounced than phosphorylation of severin alone. Results obtained with a second independently generated antiserum were very similar. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out in the absence of either polyclonal antibody or severin kinase fraction as described above. In the absence of antibodies (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) or severin kinase (data not shown) there was no phosphorylation of severin. These results clearly demonstrate that the 62-kDa polypeptide is essential for severin kinase activity. We used the peak fractions from the gel filtration column, the last purification step, to biochemically characterize severin kinase and to obtain sequences from tryptic peptides. Fig.3 shows the time dependence (A), the activation by autophosphorylation (B), and the pH dependence (C) of severin kinase as measured by phosphorylation of domains 2 and 3 of severin (DS211C; see below). During early time points, there was an almost exponential increase of incorporation of phosphate into the substrate which could be attributed to self-activation of the kinase and excess of substrate (Fig.3 A). Autophosphorylation for 5 min increased the activity of severin kinase more than 3-fold and a nearly 6-fold increase in activity was observed after 20 min of in vitroautophosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). The activity of severin kinase decreased rapidly at pH values below pH 7.0, while pH values above 7.5 decreased its activity only moderately (Fig. 3 C). Routinely, phosphorylation assays were carried out for 30 min at pH 7.5 and 30 °C. The substrate specificity of severin kinase has been tested with domain 1 (DS151), domain 2 (DS111M), and domains 2 and 3 (DS211C) of severin (26Eichinger L. Schleicher M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4779-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the 1:1 actin-severin complex, and with theDictyostelium actin-binding proteins α-actinin, ABP120 gelation factor, and hisactophilin. Besides severin, on its own as well as in the 1:1 complex with actin, only DS151 (residues 1–151 of severin) and DS211C (residues 152–362 of severin) turned out to be substrates of severin kinase (data not shown). In particular DS211C was very strongly phosphorylated being an even better substrate than native severin. Since DS151 and DS211C have no overlapping amino acids, severin kinase must either phosphorylate native severin at two or more sites, or alternatively, there must be a cryptic phosphorylation site in the constructs that is not accessible in the native molecule. Severin phosphorylation appeared to be regulated also at the substrate level as incorporation of phosphate was strongly reduced in the presence of Ca2+. The activity of severin kinase itself was not affected under these conditions because its autophosphorylation and also phosphorylation of DS211C remained nearly unaltered in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4). The addition of Ca2+ triggers a conformational change in severin (28Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that might render either the target amino acid or the complete protein inaccessible for severin kinase. Since severin kinase accepted also Mn2+-ATP as phosphate donor we tested the Ca2+ dependence of the phosphorylation reaction under these conditions as well. A similar Ca2+ dependence of severin phosphorylation was found with Mn2+-ATP, autophosphorylation of severin kinase, and phosphorylation of DS211C, however, overall phosphorylation was not as pronounced as with Mg2+-ATP (Fig. 4). We used degenerate primers deduced from tryptic peptide sequences of the 62-kDa protein to clone a 250-base pair genomic fragment, and after screening two different cDNA libraries we isolated two overlapping clones which represented the full-length cDNA. The complete cDNA has a size of 1.54 kb and encodes a polypeptide of 478 amino acids with a total molecular mass of 52,615 Da. The nucleotides preceding the start codon are characteristic of Dictyostelium genes and there are two in-frame stop codons upstream of it, indicating that the cloned cDNA harbors the complete coding region. Northern blot analysis of growth phaseDictyostelium cells showed one mRNA band with a size of approximately 1.7 kb (data not shown). The difference between the apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa in SDS-PAGE and the calculated molecular mass of approximately 53 kDa co"

This lectin-like protein is devoid of monosaccharide binding properties and belongs to the phytohemagglutinin protein family. The x-ray structure determination at 1.9-Å resolution of native arcelin-1 dimers, which correspond to the functional state of the protein in solution, was solved using multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.208. The three glycosylation sites on each monomer are all covalently modified. One of these oligosaccharide chains provides interactions with protein atoms at the dimer interface, and another one may act by preventing the formation of higher oligomeric species in the arcelin variants. The dimeric structure and the severe alteration of the monosaccharide binding site in arcelin-1 correlate with the hemagglutinating properties of the protein, which are unaffected by simple sugars and sugar derivatives. Sequence analysis and structure comparisons of arcelin-1 with the other insecticidal proteins from kidney beans, arcelin-5, and α-amylase inhibitor and with legume lectins, yield insights into the molecular basis of the different biological functions of these proteins.

Insecticides are widely used to protect crop plants against their natural predators. Nevertheless, the extensive use of these compounds has given rise to widespread concern about insect resistance and soil pollution. This has prompted active investigation into new protective strategies, and the development of genetically engineered crops expressing insecticidal proteins appears attractive (1Boulter D.

The seeds of the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) contain proteins encoded by four tightly linked genes (2Chrispeels M.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), generally referred to as the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) 1The abbreviations used are: PHA, phytohemagglutinin; α-AI, α-amylase inhibitor; ConA,Canavalia ensiformis concanavalin A; EcorL, Erythrina corallodendron lectin; Gal, galactose; Glc, glucose; GS4,Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin IV; LoLI, Lathyrus ochrus isolectin I; Man, mannose; GalNAc,N-acetylgalactosamine; GlcNAc,N-acetylglucosamine; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; MIR, multiple isomorphous replacement; r.m.s., root mean square.family of bean proteins. Two of these polypeptides (E and L) lead to all possible combinations of the tetrameric assembly of the PHA lectins (E4, E3L, E2L2, L3E, and L4). The products of the two other genes, α-amylase inhibitor (α-AI) and arcelin, which were named lectin-like proteins, display insecticidal properties (3Shade R.E. Schroeder H.E. Pueyo J.J. Tabe L.M. Murdock L.L. Higgins T.J.V. Chrispeels M.J. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 793-796Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Osborn T.C. Alexander D.C. Sun S.S.M. Cardona C. Bliss F.A. Science. 1988; 240: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The PHA family belongs to the superfamily of legume lectins, in which the protein subunits are equivalent in size, display significant sequence homology, and have a common β-sandwich fold. However, these closely related proteins differ in their glycosylation patterns, quaternary structure organization, and sugar-binding specificities (Table I). Several types of dimers and tetramers have been characterized in the legume lectins, and there seems to be no apparent relationship between sugar-binding properties, oligomerization, and glycosylation states. Mono- or disaccharides bind to legume lectins at a well defined site on each subunit. Sugar recognition involves common structural and sequence environments. They include a conserved core that provides binding energy irrespective of specificity, a peptide shell around this core which defines monosaccharide specificity, and an outer hypervariable region that may be responsible for interaction with oligosaccharides (20Young N.M. Oomen R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Adar R. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignment, α-AI and arcelins contain substitutions and/or deletions of essential amino acid residues involved in this molecular recognition (Fig. 1), which likely explains why these proteins do not bind simple sugars (19Fabre C.

Arcelin exists as six electrophoretic variants, and the most promising ones conferring insect resistance are arcelin-1 and arcelin-5 (27Kornegay J. Cardona C. Posso C. Crop Sci. 1993; 33: 589-594Crossref Google Scholar). The insecticidal properties of these glycoproteins, which are lethal to the larvae of bruchids, appear different to that of α-AI because arcelin displays no inhibitory properties toward α-amylase (19Fabre C. Causse H. Mourey L. Koninkx J. Riviére M. Hendriks H. Puzo G. Samama J.P. Rougé P. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These larvae invade and damage the seeds of economically important crops such as soybean (Glycine max), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), kidney bean, pea (Pisum sativum), and lentil (Lens culinaris). This suggests that the seeds of transgenic crops harboring these proteins might be protected from attack by insect pests. One of the requirements to be fulfilled for any broad development of these genetically engineered plants is a detailed analysis of the functional properties of arcelins. Solution-state characterization, crystallization of the native arcelin-1 dimer from kidney beans, and preliminary x-ray analysis were described previously (28Mourey L. Pédelacq J.D. Fabre C. Causse H. Rougé P. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1997; 29: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the three-dimensional structure of the protein refined to 1.9 Å resolution and discuss the structural features related to its biochemical properties. Crystals of arcelin-1 belong to the orthorhombic space groupP21212 with cell parameters a = 85.6 Å, b = 92.6 Å, and c = 67.3 Å and diffract to 1.9-Å resolution (28Mourey L. Pédelacq J.D. Fabre C. Causse H. Rougé P. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1997; 29: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two monomers of arcelin-1 were found in the asymmetric unit using molecular replacement and one monomer of LoLI as search model (28Mourey L. Pédelacq J.D. Fabre C. Causse H. Rougé P. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1997; 29: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The noncrystallographic symmetry operation, which relates the two monomers, is defined by the direction cosines (0.00098,1.00000,0.00141) of the noncrystallographic axis going through the point of coordinates (46.98, 64.07, 50.46) and a κ angle value of 179.95°. A xenon derivative of arcelin-1 was prepared using the pressurization device and method of Schiltz et al. (29Schiltz M. Prangé T. Fourme R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 950-960Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The crystal was equilibrated under a xenon pressure at 15 × 105 pascal for 1 h before data collection. The intensities were collected at 4 °C on a 30-cm Mar imaging plate on beam line DW32 at the LURE synchrotron using a wavelength of 0.975 Å. The anomalous contribution for xenon is small at this wavelength (29Schiltz M. Prangé T. Fourme R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 950-960Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and no attempt was made to collect anomalous data. Diffraction data of a platinum derivative, prepared by soaking crystals in 5 mmK2PtCl4 for 21 h, were measured on a Rigaku RAXIS-II imaging plate system equipped with Yale mirror optics (Molecular Structure Corporation) mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 x-ray generator. Data processing was carried out with the MOSFLM package (30Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography,26, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). Unless stated, data reduction and all subsequent crystallographic computations were carried out using the programs from the CCP4 suite (31Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The two heavy atom derivatives were analyzed from difference Patterson maps. Refinement of the heavy atom parameters and phase calculations at 3.1-Å resolution were carried out with MLPHARE (CCP4 suite). The initial multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phases were improved by solvent flipping (32Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging using the program DM (33Cowtan, K. (1994) Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography,31, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). Molecular envelopes for symmetry averaging were constructed from the molecular replacement model (28Mourey L. Pédelacq J.D. Fabre C. Causse H. Rougé P. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1997; 29: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the program MAMA (34Kleywegt, G. J., and Jones, T. A. (1993) Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography,28, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). Model building and manual corrections were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 Extreme, using Alberta/Caltech TOM, based on FRODO (35Jones T.A. Sayre D. Computational Crystallography. Oxford University Press, New York1982: 303-317Google Scholar). Structure refinement was performed using the program X-PLOR, Version 3.1 (36Brünger A.T. X-PLOR,Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), including the low resolution data and applying a bulk solvent correction. A randomly selected data set (2130 reflections) was excluded from refinement and used for analysis of the free R factor (37Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). In each refinement cycle, simulated annealing from 3000 to 300 K, followed by conventional energy minimization, and individual B factors refinement were applied. The initial model, built in the modified MIR map, was refined to 2.5-Å resolution, with strict application of the NCS for the two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The resolution was then extended to 1.9 Å, and after two additional cycles of refinement, the NCS constraints were released. Solvent molecules were added as neutral oxygen atoms when they appeared as positive peaks above 4.0 ς in the (F obs − F calc) exp(iαcalc) map and displayed acceptable hydrogen-bonding geometry. Hereafter, the simulated annealing step was performed from 500 to 300 K. A bulk solvent model constructed using Babinet's principle (38Driessen H. Haneef M.I.J. Harris G.W. Howlin B. Khan G. Moss D.S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1989; 22: 510-516Crossref Google Scholar) and an overall anisotropic Bcorrection, combined to positional refinement, were applied in the last refinement cycles. The Protein Data Bank entries 2CNA, 1FAT, 1IOA, 1LEC, 1LTE, and 1LOE and 1LOB of the Brookhaven National Laboratory were used for the comparison of arcelin-1 with ConA (5Reeke Jr., G.N. Becker J.W.

Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Proteins. 1990; 8: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), respectively. The matrices applied to superimpose these protein structures were derived from the least-squares minimization of the positions of the 89 Cα atoms which belong to the two major conserved β-strands present in all of these proteins. Heavy atom derivatives were readily obtained and the structure was therefore solved using the multiple isomorphous replacement and density modification methods. The coordinates of two xenon atoms bound to the protein were deduced from the Harker sections of the difference Patterson map. Their positions are related by the 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. A lower signal was given by the platinum derivative. The statistics of heavy atom derivatives data and phasing are summarized in Table II. The figure of merit, in the resolution range 15–3.1 Å, was 0.32 (0.43 for centric reflections). The electron density, in the initial NCS averaged map, was well defined for 171 residues and 128 side chains, including the Cys144-Cys180 disulfide bridge. After refinement to 2.5 Å, applying strict NCS constraints, 221 residues and 207 side chains were assigned, and the R factor dropped from 0.35 (R free = 0.39) to 0.25 (R free = 0.28). Further refinement steps involved successively (i) the extension of resolution to 1.9 Å, (ii) the release of the noncrystallographic symmetry, and (iii) the introduction of the N-glycosylation moieties and of solvent atoms.Table IIStatistics of diffraction data and phasingData setXeK2PtCl4Resolution range (Å)31.4–3.111.0–3.5Total observations27,88315,511Unique reflections8,7736,260Completeness (%)87.5 (87.4)2-aThe numbers given in parentheses denote the respective values of the highest resolution shell.86.0 (93.3)2-aThe numbers given in parentheses denote the respective values of the highest resolution shell.R merge2-bR merge =jbc∑h∑i‖〈I(h)〉−Ii(h)‖/∑h∑iIi(h),wherejbcIijbc(h)is the intensityof the ith observation of reflection h with average intensity 〈I(h)〉.0.102 (0.127)2-aThe numbers given in parentheses denote the respective values of the highest resolution shell.0.110 (0.126)2-aThe numbers given in parentheses denote the respective values of the highest resolution shell.Phasing power2-cPhasing power =∑n‖FH‖jbc2/∑n‖E‖jbc2jbc1/2,withjbc∑n‖E‖jbc2=∑n{‖FobsPH‖−‖FcalcPH‖}jbc2andn is the number of reflections for the derivative. ‖F H‖ is the calculated scattered amplitude of the heavy atom structure; given for acentric and centric reflections, successively.1.54/1.200.84/0.69R cullis2-dR Cullis =jbc∑h‖‖FPH±FP‖−FH‖/∑h‖FPH±FP‖for centric reflections(number given in parentheses).0.67 (801)0.87 (791)2-a The numbers given in parentheses denote the respective values of the highest resolution shell.2-b R merge =jbc∑h∑i‖〈I(h)〉−Ii(h)‖/∑h∑iIi(h),wherejbcIijbc(h)is the intensityof the ith observation of reflection h with average intensity 〈I(h)〉.2-c Phasing power =∑n‖FH‖jbc2/∑n‖E‖jbc2jbc1/2,withjbc∑n‖E‖jbc2=∑n{‖FobsPH‖−‖FcalcPH‖}jbc2andn is the number of reflections for the derivative. ‖F H‖ is the calculated scattered amplitude of the heavy atom structure; given for acentric and centric reflections, successively.2-d R Cullis =jbc∑h‖‖FPH±FP‖−FH‖/∑h‖FPH±FP‖for centric reflections(number given in parentheses). Open table in a new tab The final model contains 226 residues in each monomer, and consists of 3516 non-hydrogen protein atoms, 112 carbohydrate atoms, 2 sulfate groups, and 230 water molecules. Weak electron density was observed in the region 56–62 and for a few solvent-accessible side chains. Alternate side chain conformations could be postulated for residue Asn110 from both subunits. The final crystallographicR factor is 0.208 (R free = 0.242) for 41,590 reflections between 33.71 and 1.9 Å (0.198 and 0.229, respectively, for 35,782 reflections with F > 3ς(F)). The average B factors are 20.9 Å2 for protein atoms (18.0 Å2 and 24.1 Å2 for main chains and side chains, respectively), 38.6 Å2 for sugar atoms, and 32.8 Å2 for solvent atoms. The quality of the stereochemistry was assessed using the program PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All residues are in the allowed region of a Ramachandran plot (89.3% are in the most favored region). The r.m.s. deviations on bond lengths and bond angles are 0.007 Å and 1.55°, respectively. The upper estimate of the error in the atomic positions from a Luzzati plot (41Luzzati P.V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) lies between 0.15 and 0.25 Å. The architecture of the arcelin-1 monomer corresponds to the legume lectin fold and displays the jellyroll Greek key β-barrel motif (Fig. 2). Secondary structure assignment (42Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) indicated that 130 residues (57.5%) contribute to the formation of two major and of one minor antiparallel β-sheets. The first major sheet consists of six strands: S1 (Ala4-Val8), S6 (Asn61-Lys76), S11 (Glu152-Asp161), S12 (Asn165-Tyr173), S13 (Glu178-Val186), and S15 (Thr211-Ile226), and was named sheet I or back sheet in concanavalin A (43Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4910-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This sheet is flat, and the two longest and adjacent strands (S6 and S15) display a significant curvature at residues 70 and 217, respectively. It is packed against the second major seven-stranded curved sheet: S2 (Asn15-Asp21), S5 (Ser42-Ser49), S7 (Ala82-Val92), S8 (Thr117-Thr124), S9 (Asn127-Asn134), S10 (Ala140-Cys144), and S14 (Asp194-Gly205), called sheet II or front sheet. The minor β-sheet (S3, Thr23-Ser25; and S4, His29-Leu32) is inserted between S2 and S5 of sheet II and stabilizes the curved part of S15 from sheet I. The number of residues in helical conformation is small. They belong to one short α-helix (Pro187-Val192) and to seven 310 helical turns (residues 12–14, 57–60, 99–103, 112–116, 146–150, 162–164, and 207–210). The remaining 63 amino acids (27.9%) are engaged in loops and turns. The tertiary structure seems stabilized, at one edge of sheets I and II, by the peptide stretch (Ile52-Asp56) that displays hydrogen bonds with strands S6 and S14 and, at the other edge, by a disulfide bridge between residues 144 and 180 from S10 and S13, respectively (Fig. 2). The conformation of the disulfide bridge corresponds to the right-handed spiral with positive χ2and χ3 values (44Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar) and a distance between Cα atoms of 5.7 Å. Legume lectins are known to be poor in sulfur-containing amino acids (45Sharon N. Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the cysteine residues at positions 144 and 180 are conserved among arcelin variants 1, 2, and 5 from P. vulgaris, and the disulfide bridge reported herein has also been observed in the crystal structure of monomeric arcelin-5 (18Hamelryck T.W. Poortmans F. Goossens A. Angenon G. Van Montagu M. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32796-32802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, only Cys144 is conserved in arcelin-4, and the single cysteine residue of arcelin from Phaseolus acutifolius is found in a different position. Only the first 226 amino acids out of the 244 residues deduced from the cDNA sequence of the mature protein (4Osborn T.C. Alexander D.C. Sun S.S.M. Cardona C. Bliss F.A. Science. 1988; 240: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have defined electron density. The last amino acid in each of the two arcelin-1 monomers in the asymmetric unit is at the C-terminal end of strand S15, an observation which holds for arcelin-5, α-AI1, and several legume lectins (Fig. 1). This might be due to chain flexibility or to truncation of the C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain, which has been shown to occur during the post-translational modifications of lectins in the ripening seeds (46Young N.M. Watson D.C. Yaguchi M. Adar R. Arango R. Rodriguez-Arango E. Sharon N. Blay P.K.S. Thibault P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In arcelin-1, both events seem possible since (i) differential processing might explain the heterogeneity observed by IEF-PAGE on the protein sample used in this study (19Fabre C. Causse H. Mourey L.

J. 1998; 329: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and (ii) weak density for additional residues consistently appeared for one monomer during refinement. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit are related by a 2-fold molecular axis. The back β-sheets from both monomers associate to create an extended 12-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that spans the dimer (Fig. 3). Eight hydrogen bonds are exchanged between the main chain atoms from the adjacent S1 strands. Several polar and hydrophobic contacts also contribute to the interface between monomers. These involve the side chains of residues 1–5, 7–10, 12, 14–15, 48–51, and 195, water molecules, and the sugar moieties attached to Asn12 (see below). This dimer likely corresponds to the single molecular species found in solution and characterized by biochemical methods and small angle x-ray scattering measurements (19Fabre C. Causse H. Mourey L.

The change in solvent-accessible surface area (ΔASA) amounts to 2150 Å2 upon dimer formation and involves 10% of the calculated ASA for each monomer. These values are slightly below the average values for homodimers (47Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar, 48Tsai C.-J.

However, the arcelin-1 dimer was unaffected by 5 m urea and only partially dissociated by addition of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, according to gel filtration analysis (19Fabre C. Causse H.

Pyruvate oxidase (POX) 1The abbreviations used are: POX, pyruvate oxidase; ThDP, thiamine diphosphate; 5-dFAD, 5-carba-5-deaza-FAD; DCPIP, 2,6- dichlorophenolindophenol.1The abbreviations used are: POX, pyruvate oxidase; ThDP, thiamine diphosphate; 5-dFAD, 5-carba-5-deaza-FAD; DCPIP, 2,6- dichlorophenolindophenol. fromLactobacillus plantarum (EC 1.2.3.3) is a homotetramer. Each subunit (mass, 65.5 kDa) binds one FAD and one thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+. In the presence of oxygen and phosphate, the POX holoenzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate (1Sedewitz B. Schleifer K.H. Go¨tz F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 273-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sedewitz B. Schleifer K.H. Go¨tz F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 462-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Go¨tz F. Sedewitz B. Bisswanger H. Ullrich J. Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamine-Diphosphate Enzymes. 1991: 286-293Google Scholar) according to the equation CH3-COCOO−+O2 + HPO4−2 + 2H+ → CO2 + H2O2 + CH3-COOPO3H−. In the presence of Mn2+, both coenzymes FAD and ThDP can form binary complexes with the apoenzyme that are enzymatically inactive in the native overall oxidation reaction (4Risse B. Stempfer G. Rudolph R. Mo¨llering H. Jaenicke R. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The important catalytic steps in the POX reaction are: step 1, deprotonation of C2-H of ThDP, the initial step shared by all ThDP dependent enzymes; step 2, binding of pyruvate to the C2 atom of enzyme-bound ThDP; step 3, decarboxylation of pyruvate to hydroxyethyl-ThDP; step 4, oxidation of hydroxyethyl-ThDP by FAD; and step 5, reoxidation of reduced FAD by oxygen. To study the role of both coenzymes in POX catalysis, we have used four different approaches that selectively investigate some of the individual steps enumerated above: (a) In the initial reaction (step 1), the deprotonation of the C2-atom of the ThDP in POX holoenzyme as well as in the binary ThDP complex was studied using 1H NMR by following the C2-H/D exchange (5Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). (b) DCPIP is known to accept electrons from hydroxyethyl-ThDP in other ThDP-dependent enzymes (6Holzer H. Goedde H.W. Biochem. Z. 1957; 329: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar, 7Atanassova, M. (1984) Mechanistische und Kinetische Untersuchungen zur Oxidativen Decarboxylierung von Hefe Pyruvatdecarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) mittels 2,6-Dichlorphenolindophenol. Ph. D. Thesis, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-WittenbergGoogle Scholar). Here it was used as an artificial acceptor to assess the mode of electron transfer to O2. Two alternative donor loci have to be considered, the ThDP adduct itself or FADH2, to which redox equivalents could be transferred from ThDP. We have also used this assay with POX in which normal FAD was substituted with the analogue 5-deaza FAD (5-dFAD), which is essentially incapable of carrying out rapid redox reactions and in particular does not react with O2. This system was expected to provide information about steps 4 and 5 above. (c) Formation of the final product H2O2 was followed directly using the peroxidase assay (8Risse, B. (1992) Pyruvat Oxidase aus Lanctobacillus plantarm. Quartärstruktur, Kofaktorbindung und StabilisiÖerende Punktmutationen Ph. D. Thesis, Universität RegensburgGoogle Scholar). (d) The latter method was correlated by direct measurements of the O2 tension. In addition the different activity assays were used to investigate the recombination of FAD with the binary apo-ThDP complex. 5-dFAD was synthesized from 5-deazariboflavin (9Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using the purified FAD-synthetase complex of Brevibacterium ammoniagenes (10Manstein D.J. Pai E. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6807-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). FAD was from Boehringer Mannheim, and ThDP and bovine liver catalase (2000 units/mg) (EC 1.11.1.6) were from Sigma. Nitrogen 4.0 was from Messer-Griesheim. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and from Merck or Boehringer Mannheim. Quartz double distilled water was used throughout. Highly purified pyruvate oxidase (10 units/mg) from L. plantarum (EC 1.2.3.3) was a generous gift from Boehringer Mannheim. 10 mg of lyophilized enzyme were saturated with 100 μm FAD and 1 mm ThDP/Mn2+ in 1 ml of 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, 20% glycerol, pH 6.0, for 3 h at 20 °C. Subsequently the enzyme solution was dialyzed against 2 × 200 ml of 0.2 m potassium phosphate, 20% glycerol, pH 6.0, for 12 h at 4 °C. The absorption ratio of ε278/250 was 2.0 ± 0.1. Apoenzyme was prepared according to a modified method first established by Strittmatter (11Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2329-2335Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 12Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) and Sedewitz et al. (1Sedewitz B. Schleifer K.H. Go¨tz F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 273-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized POX (5 mg) was dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.2 mpotassium phosphate buffer, 20% glycerol, pH 6.0. Subsequently 0.2 ml of 3 m sodium bromide was added, and the solution was gently shaken at 0 °C for 2 min. 1.6 ml of a 50% saturated ammonium sulfate solution adjusted to pH 3.0 with sulfuric acid were added dropwise under gentle stirring at 0 °C. The precipitated apoenzyme was sedimented by 15 min of centrifugation at 40000 ×g at 4 °C. The yellow supernatant, which contained FAD and ThDP, was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of 0.2 m potassium phosphate, 20% glycerol, pH 6.0. The ammonium sulfate precipitation step was repeated to completely remove the enzyme-bound coenzymes. The resuspended cofactor-free apoenzyme (1 ml) was dialyzed four times for 4 h against 250 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C. Traces of insoluble material were separated by centrifugation at 20000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clear solution was stored at 4 °C. The absorption ratio of ε278/250 was 3.3 ± 0.1. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. For the holoenzyme extinction coefficients of ε278 = 1.65 cm2/mg or of ε460 = 0.235 cm2/mg were used. Concentration of the apoenzyme was calculated using an extinction coefficient of ε278 = 1.07 cm2/mg (4Risse B. Stempfer G. Rudolph R. Mo¨llering H. Jaenicke R. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The kinetics of H/D exchange of the C2-H of ThDP were measured by 1H NMR as described recently (5Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The exchange reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of a sample solution containing 10 mg/ml apo-ThDP-POX, holoenzyme or 1 mm ThDP alone in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with D2O in a quenched flow apparatus (model RQF-3, Kin Tek Althouse) at 4 °C. The given pH values are the respective pH meter readings. Incubation times were varied between 2 and 2000 ms. Experiments with longer times were performed by manual mixing. The exchange reactions were stopped by addition of a final concentration of 0.1 m hydrochloric acid and 5% trichloroacetic acid. This procedure also rapidly and completely denatures and precipitates the protein and releases the cofactors ThDP and FAD. After separation of the denatured protein by centrifugation, the 1H NMR spectra of the supernatant containing ThDP and FAD were recorded in a 5-mm NMR tube on a Bruker ARX 500-MHz NMR spectrometer. As shown in Fig.1, the signals used for quantification of the H/D exchange at C2 of ThDP do not interfere with the signals of FAD. To obtain the exchange rate, the relative decay in integral intensity of the C2-H signal at 9.68 ppm was fitted to a pseudo first order reaction (Fig. 2). The signal of the C6′ proton at 8.01 ppm was used as a nonexchanging internal standard.Figure 2Kinetics of H/D exchange of ThDP C2-H in the binary apo-ThDP complex of POX. Sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at 4 °C was used. The decay in integral intensity of the C2-H signal was fitted to a single exponential reaction (•). The average of duplicates is shown. The error bars show the deviation between two independent measurements. The relative amount of exchange was calculated according to the following equation: % exchange = (A2t − A2∞) ×100/(A6′ − A2∞), where A2t is the integral of the signal of the C2-H proton at the time t, A2∞ is the integral after complete exchange (50% of the integral area), and A6′ is that of the C6′ proton that was used as a standard for the integral area for 1 proton because it is not exchanged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduction of DCPIP can be followed by a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. The assay buffer contained 40 mm pyruvate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 10% glycerol, pH 6.0. Activity measurements were usually performed at 25 °C but at were performed at 10 °C for the recombination experiments. POX activity was calculated using ε600 = 17.7 cm2/μmol. Conditions were as in the DCPIP assay. Formation of 4-(p-benzochinone-monoimino)-phenazone from the reaction of H2O2 with 4-aminoantipyrine (2 mm) and 2,4-dichlorophenolsulfonic acid (7 mm) in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (4 units/ml) is followed spectrophotometrically at 546 nm (8Risse, B. (1992) Pyruvat Oxidase aus Lanctobacillus plantarm. Quartärstruktur, Kofaktorbindung und StabilisiÖerende Punktmutationen Ph. D. Thesis, Universität RegensburgGoogle Scholar). For the calculation of the specific POX activity ε546 = 16.5 cm2/μmol was used. Conditions were as in the DCPIP assay. Oxygen tension was measured with a temperature-controlled O2 electrode (Rank Brothers, Cambridge, UK). The reaction was started by addition of POX. To follow recombination of FAD with the binary apo-ThDP complex, 1 μm apoenzyme was preincubated with 1 mmThDP/Mn2+ in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, 20% glycerol, pH 6.0, for 1 h at 10 °C, and subsequently 100 μm FAD was added. At the indicated times, samples were withdrawn to determine the activity either with the DCPIP or the H2O2 or the O2 detecting assays. For the incubations at both 25 and 10 °C, the assay temperature was 10 °C. The assay mixtures were purged with nitrogen 4.0 for various times. The residual oxygen concentration was measured with an oxygen electrode from Metra Meβ− und Frequenztechnik (Radebeul, Germany). This was achieved by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The reaction was carried out with a small excess of DCPIP (1 mm) with respect to pyruvate (0.75 mm). The POX concentration in the incubation mixture was 1 mg/ml. Reaction products were separated from protein by centrifugation with Amicon Microcon-10 filters for 15 min at 7000 × g at 4 °C.1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ARX 500 NMR Spectrometer. To suppress the water signal, water presaturation was used. UV-visible absorption was recorded with a Kontron Uvicon-941 double beam spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectroscopy with a Hitachi F-3010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The formation of all reaction intermediates in the POX reaction, detectable by different activity assays, requires the deprotonation of the C2-H of ThDP. This is the initial and key reaction for all ThDP-dependent enzymes. The low rate of this reaction in the free coenzyme ThDP was measured by H/D exchange and would not allow catalysis to proceed at the observed rate of the enzyme reaction (TableI). In the POX holoenzyme this reaction is accelerated by 4 orders of magnitude compared with that of free ThDP (Table I). This exchange rate reflects not only the deprotonation rate at the C2-H of ThDP but also the required exchange of the base with the solvent. Therefore the observed rate could be slower but never faster than the microscopic deprotonation rate for the C2-H proton. The value of the exchange rate, however, exceeds the catalytic rate for this enzyme (k cat = 2 s−1 at 4 °C). In the binary apo-ThDP complex this exchange rate is very low (TableI). Interestingly, the second substrate phosphate further increases the rate of the H/D exchange in the holoenzyme ≈16-fold compared with that measured in a phosphate-free buffer (Table I).Table IPseudo first order rate constants for C2-H/D exchange in free and enzyme-bound ThDP at pH 6.0 and 4 °CSampleRate constantkcats−1s−1Free ThDP in 50 mm phosphate9.5 × 10−4POX holoenzyme in 50 mm phosphate3142POX holoenzyme in phosphate-free solution20POX holoenzyme recombined with 5-dFAD in 50 mm phosphate8Apo-ThDP complex in 50 mm phosphate10−2 Open table in a new tab The binary apo-ThDP complex binds 5-dFAD, an analogue of FAD that is unreactive toward O2 but that is isoelectronic with the latter. The process is accompanied by a biphasic decrease of the fluorescence emission of the 5-deaza-isoalloxazine (phase 1, ≈70% of the total amplitude with k 1 = 0.018 s−1, and phase 2, ≈30% with k 2 = 0.0025 s−1, Fig. 3 A). It should be noted that the recombination of native FAD proceeds with essentially the same rate constants (≈67% withk 1 = 0.022 s−1 and ≈33% withk 2 = 0.0025 s−1) using the fluorescence decrease of FAD as a probe (Fig. 3 A). Binding of 5-dFAD can also be monitored by following the increase of activity in the DCPIP assay that accompanies it (Fig. 3 B). The rate of this process (k = 0.0022 s−1) is essentially the same as that obtained for the slow phase of the fluorescence changes. This suggests that 5-dFAD binds by the same mode as native FAD, and this is also corroborated by the activity measurements detailed below. When bound to the binary apo-ThDP complex, 5-dFAD accelerates the H/D exchange at the C2-H of ThDP beyond the overall catalytic rate (Table I). DCPIP can act as an artificial electron acceptor in ThDP-dependent enzymes (6Holzer H. Goedde H.W. Biochem. Z. 1957; 329: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar,7Atanassova, M. (1984) Mechanistische und Kinetische Untersuchungen zur Oxidativen Decarboxylierung von Hefe Pyruvatdecarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) mittels 2,6-Dichlorphenolindophenol. Ph. D.

Biochem. 1979; 100: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and, e.g. in pyruvate decarboxylase from yeast (EC4.1.1.1.), it reacts specifically with the α-carbanion of hydroxyethyl-ThDP (6Holzer H. Goedde H.W. Biochem. Z. 1957; 329: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar, 7Atanassova, M. (1984) Mechanistische und Kinetische Untersuchungen zur Oxidativen Decarboxylierung von Hefe Pyruvatdecarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) mittels 2,6-Dichlorphenolindophenol. Ph. D. Thesis, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-WittenbergGoogle Scholar). In the POX reaction, DCPIP acts as an artificial electron acceptor too. Importantly, the product is acetyl phosphate, i.e. the same as obtained in the native reaction. This was shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which gave a signal for the product at the chemical shift observed for acetylphosphate (2.1 ppm). We have thus employed DCPIP to assess the question of whether this intermediate is oxidized in the POX catalysis as well. In the presence of saturating pyruvate (40 mm) and phosphate (42 mm) and an O2 concentration of 0.25 mm, the reaction with DCPIP has a K mvalue of ≈20 μm. Because a nonspecific inactivation by the reaction of DCPIP with sulfhydryl groups was observed with other enzymes (7Atanassova, M. (1984) Mechanistische und Kinetische Untersuchungen zur Oxidativen Decarboxylierung von Hefe Pyruvatdecarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) mittels 2,6-Dichlorphenolindophenol. Ph. D.

Chim. Acta. 1970; 51: 47-53Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in order to verify whether this would apply also in the present case, 0.25 μm POX was incubated in the absence and presence of 40 μm DCPIP for 1 h, and subsequently the activity was measured. No effect of the preincubation was observed, and thus a nonspecific inactivation by DCPIP can be excluded for POX. In a phosphate-free solution (same pH value and ionic strength, complete DCPIP assay mixture) DCPIP was not reduced by POX. The binary apo-ThDP complex similarly is inactive in the absence and presence of phosphate. Solely in the presence of enzyme-bound ThDP, Mg2+, FAD, and phosphate, DCPIP is reduced efficiently in the POX reaction. Notably, the k cat andK m values obtained in the DCPIP assay are about 2-fold increased compared with those measured in the H2O2 assay (TableII).Table IIComparison of Km and kcat obtained for POX with the DCPIP assay and the H2O2 detecting assay, respectively (pH 6.0 and 25 °C)DCPIP assayH2O2 detecting assayk cat(s−1)17.99.6K m pyruvate (mm)1.60.4K m phosphate (mm)4.52.3K m O2(mm)0.07K m DCPIP (mm)0.020K m values were determined at saturating concentrations of the other substrates. Open table in a new tab K m values were determined at saturating concentrations of the other substrates. In POX catalysis either FADH2 or hydroxyethy-ThDP could serve as electron donors for DCPIP. The final product H2O2 could also oxidize DCPIP, either directly or via mediation by POX. In the absence of POX, the rate of DCPIP (red) oxidation by H2O2 is 2.7 ×10−4m−1 s−1 and thus too slow to affect the process. Variation of O2 concentration in the range 25–250 μm and the presence of catalase (0–3.5 μm; Fig. 4) have no effect on the rate constant of the DCPIP assay. We thus conclude that H2O2-dependent DCPIP oxidation does not influence the rate constants measured in this assay. However, the H2O2 peroxidase assay shows the expected O2 and catalase dependence (Fig. 4). The binding of FAD to the binary POX-ThDP complex was investigated at different temperatures using the assays described under “Materials and Methods.” At 25 °C the three methods revealed essentially the same result (Fig.5 B). The data points could be fitted to a monophasic, pseudo first order process withk = 0.016 s−1 (100 μm FAD). Unexpectedly, at 10 °C the kinetics of recombination with FAD differ significantly depending on the type of assays used (Fig.5 A). The rate estimated using the DCPIP method can be described by a pseudo first order process with k = 0.0017 s−1 and is much faster than those obtained by the H2O2 or O2 detecting assays. The rate derived from the decrease of [O2] also can be approximated by a first order process; it is, however, slower by approximately 1 order of magnitude (k = 0.0001 s−1). The release of H2O2 as detected with the peroxidase assay exhibits a pronounced lag phase extending for up to 1000 s and subsequently proceeds at a rate similar to that observed with the oxygen electrode. The ternary complex of 5-dFAD, ThDP, and POX is completely inactive in the H2O2 detecting assay but active in the test using DCPIP. The dependence of the rate in the latter assay from DCPIP concentration follows a saturation behavior with aK m of ≈24 μm. At saturating substrate concentrations, the 5-dFAD-POX has 0.4% the activity of native enzyme (Fig. 6). The possibility that this 0.4% activity results from traces of unremoved FAD can be ruled out because apoenzyme did not show any residual activity. Furthermore, the procedure for the synthesis of 5-dFAD (9Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Manstein D.J. Pai E. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6807-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) excludes production of any normal FAD. 5-dFAD containing holo-POX was completely inactive in the H2O2 assay. Incubation of the 5-dFAD containing POX with FAD has no effect on the observed rate in the DCPIP assay. Similarly, incubation of native POX with 5-dFAD does not affect the POX activity. This indicates that no dissociation/exchange of both FAD and 5-dFAD from the ternary complex occurs. The essential steps constituting the cycle catalyzed by POX fromL. plantarum are shown in SchemeFS1. Deprotonation of the ThDP-C2-H is mandatory for the nucleophilic attack of the coenzyme ThDP C2− on the pyruvate carbonyl, which leads to formation of the enzyme-bound intermediate hydroxyethyl-ThDP. The rate of this deprotonation for free ThDP and in the binary apo-ThDP complex is too slow by about 3 orders of magnitude to account for the POX reaction to proceed at its observed overall catalytic rate of 2 s−1 at 4 °C (Table I). In native holoenzyme, i.e. in the ternary complex POX-FAD-ThDP, the rate of C2-H deprotonation has a higher value than k cat, but in the presence of phosphate a further 16-fold increase of the C2-H dissociation rate can be observed (Table I). H+ abstraction does not appear to be mediated by a direct interaction of the FAD with C2-H of the enzyme-bound ThDP but rather by interactions with functional groups of the protein, which are operative only in the POX-FAD-ThDP ternary complex. In the crystal structure the distance of the closest FAD atom to C2-H is 11 Å (16Mueller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,17Mueller Y.A.

However, based on the structural homology of the ThDP binding site to other ThDP enzymes, we assume that Glu59 is the residue that mediates this activation in POX. In POX the crucial interaction could be that of the ThDP-N1′ with the conserved Glu59 (16Mueller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,17Mueller Y.A.

This would be analogous to what is observed with pyruvate decarboxylase and transketolase where the same type of interaction occurs (5Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This interpretation is consistent with the observation that in the ternary complex with 5-dFAD the rate of the H/D exchange at C2-H is accelerated by 3 orders of magnitude compared with the binary apo-ThDP complex (Table I). The substantial increase in rate observed in the presence of phosphate cannot be interpreted in molecular terms at the present time and might be due to a variety of effects. The next important steps in catalysis are the formation of the pyruvate-ThDP adduct, which is followed by its decarboxylation to form the hydroxyethyl-ThDP as shown in Scheme FS1. DCPIP can react specifically and rapidly with the latter intermediate. In POX, DCPIP reduction requires both coenzymes and the cosubstrate phosphate. Therefore, the redox partner for DCPIP in the POX reaction could be either FADH2 or hydroxyethyl-ThDP. Because no competition between DCPIP and O2 was observed (Fig. 4) and because thek cat value for the DCPIP assay is 2-fold increased compared with that determined with the H2O2 detecting assay (Table II), we conclude that different steps in catalysis are observed with the DCPIP and the H2O2 detecting assays and that DCPIP does not react competitively with FADH2. It has been discussed (17Mueller Y.A. Schumacher G. Rudolph R. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that the distance between the cofactors ThDP and FAD exclude a direct electron transfer from the C2α of hydroxyethyl-ThDP to N5 of the isoalloxazine (16Mueller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). More likely, oxidation occurs via transfer of two single electrons to the isoalloxazine (16Mueller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We conclude that DCPIP reacts with the enzyme-bound intermediate hydroxyethyl-ThDP. The occurrence of further intermediates during the electron transfer to FAD clearly cannot be excluded; an intermediate could be inferred from the requirement of FAD for the DCPIP reduction. Further evidence for the proposed mode of reaction of DCPIP arises from the experiments with 5-dFAD. This analogue cannot transfer electrons to O2. As expected, the 5-dFAD containing holoenzyme is inactive in the H2O2 detecting assay but reduces DCPIP (Fig. 6). The observation that in the presence of 5-dFAD, only 0.4% activity is observed in the DCPIP assay, although the H/D exchange for the ThDP C2-hydrogen is fast, points to a strong deceleration of a later step in the formation of hydroxyethyl ThDP in the presence of this FAD analogue. As pointed out under “Results,” it can be ruled out that traces of native FAD are responsible for the residual activity. In the absence of phosphate no DCPIP activity is observed. Although phosphate stimulates the C2-H exchange of the enzyme-bound ThDP (Table I), this effect cannot be responsible for the essential function of phosphate. It is likely that phosphate is a cosubstrate in the formation of the product acetyl phosphate in the DCPIP reaction. The differences among the kinetics of FAD recombination with the binary apo-ThDP complex at 10 °C using the different assays (Fig. 5) suggest that the final catalytically competent complex is formed via at least one intermediate form. This is assumed to be a holoenzyme in which formation of hydroxyethyl-ThDP but not transfer of electrons to O2 is possible. At 25 °C the lag phase in the recombination kinetics is not observable. This is compatible with the occurrence of a second step with a high activation energy during FAD binding. The possibility that the peroxidase reaction in the H2O2 detecting assay is rate-limiting at low temperatures can be ruled out, because all measurements of the FAD recombination process at 10 and 25 °C were performed at 10 °C. The crystal structure for POX (16Mueller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) shows that the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD is surrounded by six aromatic amino acids. Along the N10-N5-axis, the planar structure of the isoalloxazine ring is bent by 15 ° along the side chain of valine 265, which increases the redox potential of FADH2 (17Mueller Y.A. Schumacher G. Rudolph R. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We suggest a model in which FAD binds in a two-step mechanism. The first leads to an intermediate that is competent exclusively in the formation of hydroxyethyl-ThDP. For this step FAD can be substituted by 5-dFAD. The nature of the second, temperature-sensitive step is still elusive at present. It could represent structural changes of the FAD binding site followed by the distortion of the planar structure of the isoalloxazine ring. FADH2, exclusively bound in this final conformation, is capable of performing the natural reaction, the reduction of O2 to H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W2095694802,"pp120, a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, does not undergo ligand-stimulated phosphorylation by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor. However, replacement of the C-terminal domain of the IGF-1 receptor beta-subunit with the corresponding segment of the insulin receptor restored pp120 phosphorylation by the chimeric receptor. Since pp120 stimulates receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis when it is phosphorylated, we examined whether pp120 regulates IGF-1 receptor endocytosis in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. pp120 failed to alter IGF-1 receptor endocytosis via either wild-type or chimeric IGF-1 receptors. Thus, the effect of pp120 on hormone endocytosis is specific to insulin, and the C-terminal domain of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor does not regulate the effect of pp120 on insulin endocytosis. Mutation of Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor abolished the effect of pp120 to stimulate receptor endocytosis, without affecting pp120 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. These findings suggest that pp120 interacts with two separate domains of the insulin receptor as follows: a C-terminal domain required for pp120 phosphorylation and a juxtamembrane domain required for internalization. We propose that the interaction of pp120 with the juxtamembrane domain is indirect and requires one or more substrates that bind to Tyr960 in the insulin receptor."

In this work, we have searched the COOH terminus of MAL for sorting determinants responsible for targeting to GEMs. This has allowed the identification of the sequence Leu-Ile-Arg-Trp (LIRW) as necessary for the access of MAL to GEMs. This motif requires at least one additional amino acid at its COOH end for full effectiveness. The arginine within the LIRW motif is the most crucial residue for targeting to GEMs, tryptophan replacement affects targeting to a lesser extent, and the leucine-isoleucine pair tolerates substitution by valine, but not by alanine, without effect on targeting. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the LIRW tetrapeptide is required for access to GEMs early after MAL biosynthesis. Interestingly, the loss of the capacity of the MAL protein to be incorporated into GEMs correlated with the loss of its response to brefeldin A treatment.

Internal GEMs have been proposed to play a role in polarized transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and glycolipids to the apical surface in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (5Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 6Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). According to this model, glycolipid self-association into GEM microdomains or “rafts” provides the biophysical basis for the recruiting of lipids and proteins. In addition, the existence of a specialized protein machinery to make the GEM rafts operative as a route of transport has been proposed (6Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). One approach to dissect the protein machinery involved in the GEM-mediated pathway of transport in MDCK cells has been the immunoisolation of the transport vesicles (7Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Characterization of the proteins present in the GEM fraction from apical vesicles has revealed the identity of four of these proteins: caveolin (caveolin-1, VIP21) (8Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P.

Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An interesting point is to know how the protein machinery is targeted to GEMs. The human MAL gene was initially identified during a search for genes differentially expressed during T cell development (13Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Despite its restricted pattern of expression (13Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alonso M.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the MAL protein has been identified in myelin-forming cells (4Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5753-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in both polarized MDCK (12Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and thyroid epithelial cells (16MartıÖn-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TheMAL gene encodes a nonglycosylated integral membrane protein of 17 kDa containing multiple hydrophobic segments (13Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to most integral membrane proteins, MAL displays a high solubility in organic solvents used to extract cell lipids (17Rancanño C. Rubio T. Correas I. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This unusual lipid-like physical-chemical property allowed the assignment of MAL to the proteolipid group of proteins (18Schlesinger M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, MAL shares with a very restricted group of integral membrane proteins the distinctive biochemical feature of residence in GEMs (4Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K.

J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This property, together with its distribution in vesicular structures (19MillaÖn J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancanño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the co-isolation of MAL in vesicles containing apically destined proteins in MDCK cells (12Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the distribution of endogenous MAL at the apical zone of polarized epithelial thyroid cells (16MartıÖn-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), are all consistent with a role for MAL as a protein component of the machinery for GEM-mediated apical transport. Ectopic expression of MAL in insect Sf21 cells induces de novo formation of vesicular structures (20Puertollano R. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18311-18315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MAL-induced vesicles are different from the caveolae-like vesicles induced by caveolin expression using the same expression system (20Puertollano R. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18311-18315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results, together with those showing MAL and caveolin in different GEM microdomains in MDCK cells (21MillaÖn J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), have been interpreted as that MAL and caveolin might be responsible for the generation of different vesicular carriers likely involved in distinct GEM-mediated pathways (20Puertollano R. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18311-18315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These two pathways might work simultaneously in cells expressing both MAL and caveolin (MDCK cells), or separately in cells expressing either only MAL (T lymphocytes and oligodendrocytes) or caveolin (fibroblasts) (21MillaÖn J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the ability of MAL to access to GEMs relies on amino acid sorting determinants present in its carboxyl terminus, we have generated and studied the distribution of a panel of MAL mutants. This approach has allowed the identification of a LIRW tetrapeptide required for the specific incorporation of MAL into GEMs and for its localization in brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicles. The LIRW sequence requires an additional amino acid at its carboxyl terminus for full effectiveness. In addition to the sorting information provided by the LIRW motif, targeting to GEMs seems to rely on the peculiar physical-chemical properties of the MAL molecule. This is the first report showing the requirement for a juxtamembrane peptide motif in the sorting of an integral membrane protein to GEMs. The mouse hybridomas producing monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the 9E10 c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEED) (22Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar) or to human CD4 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to transferrin were from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). BFA, nocodazole, Triton X-100, and iron-saturated human transferrin were from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Pierce. Fluorescein- and Texas Red-conjugated antibodies were from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). The insertion of the 9E10 c-Myc epitope between the first and the second amino acid of MAL was carried out by amplification of the λMA5 insert (13Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with a polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotide primers N (5′-GGG CCC AGA TCT CAT ATG GAG CAG AAG CTG ATC TCC GAG GAA GAC CTG GCC CCC GCA GCG GCG ACG-3′) and C (5′-CCC GGG AGA TCT TTA TTA TGA AGA CTT CCA TCT-3′) (Isogen Bioscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). These primers contain sequences which anneal to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the MAL-coding sequence, respectively. In addition, primer N contains sequences encoding the 9E10 c-Myc epitope, and both primers N and C contain oneBglII site at their 5′ end. After amplification under standard conditions (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), the product was digested withBglII and cloned into the unique BamHI site of the pSRα expression vector (24Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations at the COOH terminus of MAL by deletion, addition, or substitution of amino acids were performed in a similar way by the polymerase chain reaction using primer N and, in each case, a specific oligonucleotide primer carrying both the appropriate modifications and a sequence complementary to the 3′ end of the MAL coding sequence. After digestion of aBglII target sequence present in each oligonucleotide primer, the amplification product was cloned into pSRα. The cDNA corresponding to the 16-kDa proteolipid of the bovine V-ATPase (25Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was tagged at the NH2 terminus with a sequence encoding the 9E10 c-Myc epitope by amplification of the corresponding cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. N. Nelson, Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Nutley, NJ) with appropriate primers. For DNA constructs expressing CD4 we used primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the CD4 coding sequences and CD4 cDNA (26Maddon P.J. Littman D.R. Godfrey M. Maddon D.E. Chess L. Axel R. Cell. 1985; 42: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) as template (a kind gift from Dr. P. J. Maddon, Columbia University, New York). The constructs expressing chimeric proteins modified at their carboxyl terminus with MAL sequences were done by amplification with appropriate oligonucleotide primer pairs. The sequence of the inserted product was verified in all of the constructs to eliminate the possibility of amplification errors. Human epithelial A498 cells (ATCC HB44) and COS-7 cells were grown on Petri dishes or glass coverslips, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Transfections in the A498 cell line were carried out by using Lipofectin reagent following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Selection of stable transfectants was carried out by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate for at least 4 weeks after transfection. Drug-resistant cell clones were trypsinized in situ with the aid of cloning rings. The clones were screened by immunofluorescence analysis, and those resulting positive for the expression of the indicated protein were maintained in drug-free medium. More than 90% of the cells from the selected clones retained expression of the exogenous protein after several months in this medium. Transfection of COS-7 cells was done by electroporation using the ECM 600 electroporation instrument (BTX, San Diego, CA). GEMs were isolated by standard procedures (27Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes were rinsed with PBS and lysed for 20 min in 1 ml of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman, the dishes were rinsed with 1 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C, and the lysate was homogenized by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle. The lysate was finally brought to 40% sucrose in a final volume of 4 ml and placed at the bottom of an 8-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Fractions of 1 ml were harvested from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Density was determined by measuring the refractive index of the fractions. For the estimation of the oligomerization state of recombinant MAL, samples were loaded at the top of a 5–40% linear sucrose gradient (4.3 ml) prepared in 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl buffer plus 60 mm octyl glucoside (28Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 10 h in an SW60 rotor (Beckman Instruments), the gradient was fractionated from the top. Aliquots from the different fractions were subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using 9E10 mAb. Molecular mass standards (Sigma) were as follows: carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), α-amylase (200 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa). For immunoblot analysis, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 15% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS, membranes were incubated with mAb 9E10 culture supernatant at 1:2. After several washings, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:5,000, washed extensively, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Quantitative analyses were done with the 300A computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For metabolic labeling, cells were starved in culture medium lacking methionine and cysteine for 30 min and incubated with 1 mCi of a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 10 min at 37 °C. After this period, the medium was removed and replaced with standard culture medium. To be used in immunoprecipitation studies, antibodies were prebound overnight at 4 °C to protein G-Sepharose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with an irrelevant control antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose and centrifuged, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. To detect 35S-labeling, dried gels were finally exposed to Fujifilm imaging plates. Epithelial A498 cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed, and treated with 10 mm glycine for 10 min to quench the aldehyde groups. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, rinsed, and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min. Coverslips were then incubated with the primary antibody 1 h, rinsed several times, and incubated for one additional hour with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody. For double-label immunofluorescence analysis the procedure was repeated again with the second primary and secondary antibodies. After extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides. The cells were photographed with a Zeiss Axioskop photomicroscope using Kodak T-Max 400 film. Primary antibodies included mouse mAb 9E10 (IgG1), used as a culture supernatant, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to transferrin used at 1:20,000. Secondary antibodies included Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies used at 1:1,000, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies absorbed against mouse IgG used at 1:100. Controls to assess the specificity and the lack of cross-labeling included incubations with an irrelevant primary mAb or omission of either of the primary antibodies. The last nine amino acids (FSLIRWKSS) from the COOH terminus of the MAL protein contain sequences that resemble distinct signals involved in protein sorting. Thus, the FSLI sequence is reminiscent of tyrosine-based amino acid motifs involved in endocytosis or basolateral sorting (29Sandoval I.V. Bakke O.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To explore whether any of these four motifs or other novel sequence in the same region is involved in the specific targeting of MAL to GEMs, we have generated a panel of deletional, insertional, and replacement mutants at the COOH terminus of MAL. In all of the cases, the MAL protein was tagged at its NH2 terminus with the 9E10 c-Myc epitope (22Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). Since this tag does not interfere the targeting of MAL to GEMs (16MartıÖn-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21MillaÖn J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), from now on we will refer the tagged MAL protein lacking any further modification as MAL. As all the mutations were concentrated in the last nine amino acids, mutants were named by the amino acid sequence in that region. The different MAL proteins were stably expressed in transfected human epithelial A498 cells selected by prolonged treatment with the aminoglycoside G418. Triton X-100 extracts from clones of the different transfectants were subjected to centrifugation to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients following an established protocol (27Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). After fractionation from the bottom of the tube, aliquots from the different fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc mAb 9E10. Using this protocol, fractions 1–4 correspond to cytosolic proteins and solubilized membranes, whereas fractions 5–12 consist of the buoyant material containing GEMs resistant to detergent solubilization. As a control we first checked that GEMs containing the same pattern of endogenous cellular proteins were obtained from both untransfected and transfected cells, indicating that GEMs preexist in the cell and they are neither formed nor destroyed by expression of the different MAL proteins (not shown). For simplicity, the different profiles obtained were classified into four distinct categories: (+++++), (++), (+) and (−) corresponding to ≥90, 20–40, 5–20, or ≤5% of the MAL protein incorporated into GEM fractions, respectively. In none of the mutants, the incorporation of MAL into GEMs was between 50 and 90%. Representative profiles for the four categories are presented in Fig.1. The first group of mutants analyzed contained alterations in the length of the COOH-terminal tail of MAL by either amino acid deletion or addition (Table I, group I). In agreement with previous reports (19MillaÖn J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Rancanño C. Alonso M.A. Biochem.

The results with the deletional mutants discussed above indicated that the last two serines in the MAL molecule are dispensable for the incorporation of MAL into GEMs, and suggest a role for lysine −3 and tryptophan −4 in the targeting of MAL to GEMs. To address whether the lysine and tryptophan residues are themselves forming part of a motif required for MAL residency in GEMs or are just playing a role as spacers to place an unidentified distance-dependent signal in optimal position, we analyzed MAL mutants with substitutions in amino acids −3 to −5 (Table I, group II). Substitution of lysine −3 by serine (MAL-FSLIRWSSS) did not affect the presence of MAL in GEMs, suggesting that lysine −3 is not required for MAL targeting. The replacement of tryptophan −4 by serine (MAL-FSLIRSKSS) caused a significative drop on the level of MAL in the GEM fractions. Finally, substitution of arginine −5 by serine (MAL-FSLISWKSS) greatly affected the targeting of MAL to GEMs. The third group of mutants were generated to analyze the influence of the FSLI- and LI sequences on the targeting of MAL (Table I, group III). In this panel of mutants the last two serines were deleted as they were dispensable for the access of MAL to GEMs. Whereas en bloc substitution of FSLI by alanine (MAL-AAAARWK) impaired the ability of MAL to reside in GEMs, the replacement of FS by two alanines (MAL-AALIRWK) did not show any effect. Consistently, replacement of the LI dipeptide by alanine (MAL-FSAARWK) greatly diminished the presence of MAL in the GEM fractions. Individual substitutions in the LI dipeptide by alanine (MAL-FSAIRWK and MAL-FSLARWK) showed that both leucine and isoleucine were similarly required. The LI pair was substitu"

The studied bisantrene/amsacrine (m-AMSA) hybrid and bisantrene isomers were able to poison DNA topoisomerase II with an intermediate activity between those of bisantrene and m-AMSA. Moving the side chain from the central to a lateral ring (from C-9 to C-1/C-4) only slightly modified the drug DNA affinity, whereas it dramatically affected local base preferences of poison-stimulated DNA cleavage. In contrast, switching the planar aromatic systems of bisantrene andm-AMSA did not substantially alter the sequence specificity of drug action. A computer-assisted steric and electrostatic alignment analysis of the test compounds was in agreement with the experimental data, since a common pharmacophore was shared by bisantrene,m-AMSA, and 9-substituted analogs, whereas the 1-substituted isomer showed a radically changed pharmacophoric structure. Thus, the relative space occupancy and electron distribution of putative DNA binding (aromatic rings) and enzyme binding (side chains) moieties are fundamental in directing the specific action of topoisomerase II poisons and in determining the poison pharmacophore.

The elucidation of structural determinants of the sequence-specific recognition of DNA by small molecules is fundamental for a rational design of gene-specific DNA binders that are effective in the therapy of human diseases. Several DNA-interactive compounds are known that may bind to the double helix in a site-selective manner; however, the degree and mechanisms of the specificity are very different among them (1Palumbo M.

A wide variety of antitumor drugs, with and without the ability to bind to naked DNA, have been shown to poison DNA topoisomerases with a high sequence selectivity (2Capranico G. Binaschi M.

Anticancer agents able to poison the mammalian enzymes stabilize a key intermediate of the catalytic reaction wherein DNA strands are broken and covalently linked to the protein. Thus, the poisoning action results in increased DNA cleavage levels in living cells that eventually trigger a cell death process.Classical topoisomerase poisons stimulate DNA cleavage in a sequence-selective manner, yielding drug-specific cleavage intensity patterns in agarose as well as sequencing gels (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents.

Each pattern reflects the recognition of specific features of the enzyme-DNA covalent complex that are likely dictated by the nucleotide sequence at the site of cleavage. In fact, while preferred bases distant from the cleaved bond are similar regardless of the class of the poison used (enzyme-specific preferences), preferred nucleotides close to the 5′- or 3′-termini (positions +1 or −1, respectively) are poison-specific, examples being an adenine at +1 form-AMSA 1The abbreviations used are: m-AMSA, amsacrine, 4-[9-acridinylamino]-N-[methanesulfonyl]-m-anisidine; IHA, dihydro-1H-imi-dazol2-yl hydrazone; SEA, steric and electrostatic analysis; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: m-AMSA, amsacrine, 4-[9-acridinylamino]-N-[methanesulfonyl]-m-anisidine; IHA, dihydro-1H-imi-dazol2-yl hydrazone; SEA, steric and electrostatic analysis; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. and bisantrene, a cytosine at −1 for teniposide (VM-26) and mitoxantrone, an adenine at −1 for doxorubicin, and a thymine at +2 for streptonigrin (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar). Poison localization in the ternary complex has been directly shown using a photoactivable m-AMSA analog (13Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the compound was found to be covalently linked to DNA bases at the +1 and −1 positions, only when T4 topoisomerase II was present in the reaction mixture. Analogous results have been obtained in the case of camptothecin and topoisomerase I (14Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, several independent results demonstrate that poison receptors are localized at the protein/DNA interface at the site of DNA cleavage.Early studies suggested that topoisomerase II poisons may fit into a “loose” pharmacophore, constituted by a planar ring system with DNA intercalation or intercalation-like properties, and one or two protruding side chains, possibly interfering with the protein side of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex (16Macdonald T.L. Lehnert E.K. Loper J.T. Chow K.-C. Ross W.E. Potmesil M. Kohn K.W. DNA Topoisomerases in Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 199-214Google Scholar). The lack of structural restrictions on this pharmacophore can be ascribed mainly to the receptor heterogeneity that is determined by different nucleic acid sequences at the enzyme-active site. An approach to the characterization of the drug receptor site has been based on molecular modeling analyses of topoisomerase II poisons along with the determination of their sequence-specific DNA cleaving activity (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The relative positions of planar ring systems and side chains of many clinically useful antitumor topoisomerase II poisons have been suggested to determine the site of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, only compounds sharing defined steric and electronic features can trap the enzyme at the same DNA sites. In particular, bisantrene and m-AMSA have the same base preference for DNA cleavage stimulation, and despite the different chemical structures, they were shown to be characterized by very similar electronic and steric properties, suggesting a common fit into the receptor site (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Therefore, in order to challenge the idea that the drug shape and electron density determine the sequence specificity of the poison action, bisantrene analogs and an m-AMSA-bisantrene hybrid (Fig. 1) were synthesized and characterized for their DNA binding properties, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, base sequence preferences, and conformational and electronic features. The studied compounds were formally derived from the exchange of putative pharmacophoric domains of m-AMSA and bisantrene or were structural isomers of bisantrene (Fig. 1). In full agreement with the original hypothesis, our combined experimental and theoretical work demonstrates that alterations of the shape and electron density of the drug molecule markedly affect the sequence-specific interaction of the poison with topoisomerase II-DNA complexes. This might be useful in providing a physicochemical map of poison receptors.DISCUSSIONThe present investigation on IHA congeners, the design of which was prompted by earlier molecular modeling studies (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), definitely demonstrates that, in a homogeneous series of compounds, alterations of the shape and electron density of the drug molecule markedly affect the sequence-specific poison interaction with topoisomerase II-DNA complexes. Thus, this result strongly supports the idea that the relative position of putative DNA- and enzyme-binding domains plays a key role in determining the sequence position specificity of topoisomerase II poisons (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar).The NOE results presented in Fig. 6 A confirm the possibility of free rotation of the side chain groups with reference to the planar anthracene moiety. Hence, a number of conformations characterized by similar energies are available for the molecule to interact at the receptor site. This is confirmed by the theoretical ab initio analysis, giving small energy gaps between stable conformations, the limiting situations being represented by a completely planar arrangement or a perpendicular arrangement of the imidazolyl hydrazine group versus the anthracene group. The SEA analysis comparing the complete range of stable conformations of 9-IHA with the complete set of stable conformations of 1-IHA was not able to find a satisfactory alignment within the two sets of conformers. This confirms that 1-IHA and 9-IHA correspond to distinct pharmacophores. This is further emphasized by the fact that the observed changes in electrostatic potential are not a consequence of the drug conformation but a result of the 9 → 1 shift of the side chain group (Fig. 6 B).Our data establish that one side chain of bisantrene is sufficient to grant poisoning activity to the compound since 9-IHA could stimulate even higher levels of topoisomerase II DNA cleavage than bisantrene, although the DNA affinity was maximum when two dihydroimidazolyl chains were present. Indeed, the binding affinity dropped about 20-fold by removing one chain and 30-fold further when replacing the bisantrene chain with the m-AMSA side group. On the other hand, the substitution of the anthracene ring with the acridine planar moiety in aza-9-IHA did not appreciably alter the binding properties. This indicates that the aza substitution at the central ring does not play an important role in the energy balance of DNA-drug complex formation. Only a slight decrease is observed when shifting the chain from position 9 to position 1; hence, the location of side groups in the IHA/amsacrine family does not significantly affect DNA affinity.The effect of poison substituents on DNA cleavage levels cannot be determined by a simple comparison of cleavage efficiencies. In fact, as mentioned above, DNA binding constants of the studied compounds were markedly different, and it is well known that a strong interaction with free DNA by intercalating agents can fully prevent enzyme binding to the nucleic acid and therefore enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 6Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Cleavage levels stimulated by bisantrene were low, whereas they were prominent when using the weak binder m-AMSA; IHA congeners had intermediate effects, consistent with their intermediateK i values. Since the relative efficiencies in DNA cleavage stimulation were inversely correlated to nucleic acid binding constants for this series of compounds, the extent of cleavage stimulation could be mostly determined by the DNA binding affinity. Indeed, cleavage suppressive effects shown by 1,4-IHA well paralleled its very high DNA binding activity, which even prevented drug dissociation from the complex. The only compounds having essentially the same affinity for DNA were 9-IHA and aza-9-IHA. In this case, it is safe to conclude that the C → N bioisosteric substitution at the central ring was primarily responsible for the reduced cleavage activity. In agreement with this result, a double C → N bioisosteric substitution in anthracenediones (including mitoxantrone) has been shown to abolish topoisomerase poisoning activity (29De Isabella P. Palumbo M. Sissi C. Capranico G. Carenini N. Menta E. Oliva A. Spinelli S. Krapcho A.P. Giuliani F.C. Zunino F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 30-38PubMed Google Scholar).The statistical analysis documented that an adenine(+1) requirement for cleavage stimulation is shared by bisantrene, m-AMSA, 9-IHA, and the hybrid drug, aza-9-IHA (data not shown). Hence, these agents likely belong to a very similar pharmacophore class and interact similarly in the ternary DNA-poison-topoisomerase II complex. In total agreement with this hypothesis, the above drugs were characterized by a similar electron density and spatial relation of drug moieties as determined by the SEA analysis of drug conformations obtained byab initio theoretical calculations. In the case of 1-IHA, which had the side chain shifted to a lateral ring, radical changes were instead observed; the compound was still able to poison topoisomerase II; however, cleavage was no longer preferentially stimulated at m-AMSA sites. Therefore, we may conclude that 1-IHA cannot share the same pharmacophore as the other congeners of the bisantrene/m-AMSA family. Consistently, the molecular modeling analysis showed that 1-IHA and 9-IHA were rather different molecules, since a similarity parameter of 0.54 indicated that the two compounds were not more alike than any two of the vast majority of chemically unrelated DNA-interacting agents.At this time, we do not have direct evidence of the relative position of the 9- and 1-IHA structures within the DNA-enzyme covalent complex; nevertheless, we can reasonably argue that the 9-IHA derivatives are present at the enzyme/DNA interface specifically interacting with the adenine at the cleavage site in a fashion similar to bisantrene and m-AMSA (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A simple isomerization in the IHA structure causes dramatic modifications in the sequence specificity of poison-stimulated topoisomerase II DNA cleavage. Thus, the present results strongly support the hypothesis that only compounds sharing defined steric and electronic features can trap the enzyme at the same DNA sites, suggesting a similar fit into the receptor site (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken individually, the chemical identity of the functional groups of 1- and 9-IHA would allow the same stabilizing interactions to occur with the receptor site. However, the different reciprocal location of ring system and side chain impairs the contextual onset of the key contacts with the protein and nucleic acid partners in the covalent topoisomerase II-DNA complex. This strengthens the concept of a cooperation between (at least) two pharmacophoric domains in eliciting specific target recognition and, hence, in affecting drug activity.In conclusion, molecular modeling of poison molecules, and possibly poison-receptor interactions, may be powerful tools in drug discovery when combined with experimental molecular analyses of topoisomerase-dependent DNA cleaving effects. The complete definition of the diverse pharmacophores of topoisomerase II poisons will certainly be of value for the design of new agents more effective in the treatment of human cancers. The elucidation of structural determinants of the sequence-specific recognition of DNA by small molecules is fundamental for a rational design of gene-specific DNA binders that are effective in the therapy of human diseases. Several DNA-interactive compounds are known that may bind to the double helix in a site-selective manner; however, the degree and mechanisms of the specificity are very different among them (1Palumbo M.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes deputed to resolve topological problems that arise during various nuclear processes including transcription, recombination, and chromosome partitioning at cell division (8Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar, 9Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Osheroff N.

Type II enzymes make transient double-stranded breaks into one segment of DNA and pass an intact duplex through the broken DNA, before resealing the break (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar, 9Watt P.M.

BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Anticancer agents able to poison the mammalian enzymes stabilize a key intermediate of the catalytic reaction wherein DNA strands are broken and covalently linked to the protein. Thus, the poisoning action results in increased DNA cleavage levels in living cells that eventually trigger a cell death process. Classical topoisomerase poisons stimulate DNA cleavage in a sequence-selective manner, yielding drug-specific cleavage intensity patterns in agarose as well as sequencing gels (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents.

Biol. 1991; 222: 909-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each pattern reflects the recognition of specific features of the enzyme-DNA covalent complex that are likely dictated by the nucleotide sequence at the site of cleavage. In fact, while preferred bases distant from the cleaved bond are similar regardless of the class of the poison used (enzyme-specific preferences), preferred nucleotides close to the 5′- or 3′-termini (positions +1 or −1, respectively) are poison-specific, examples being an adenine at +1 form-AMSA 1The abbreviations used are: m-AMSA, amsacrine, 4-[9-acridinylamino]-N-[methanesulfonyl]-m-anisidine; IHA, dihydro-1H-imi-dazol2-yl hydrazone; SEA, steric and electrostatic analysis; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: m-AMSA, amsacrine, 4-[9-acridinylamino]-N-[methanesulfonyl]-m-anisidine; IHA, dihydro-1H-imi-dazol2-yl hydrazone; SEA, steric and electrostatic analysis; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. and bisantrene, a cytosine at −1 for teniposide (VM-26) and mitoxantrone, an adenine at −1 for doxorubicin, and a thymine at +2 for streptonigrin (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar). Poison localization in the ternary complex has been directly shown using a photoactivable m-AMSA analog (13Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the compound was found to be covalently linked to DNA bases at the +1 and −1 positions, only when T4 topoisomerase II was present in the reaction mixture. Analogous results have been obtained in the case of camptothecin and topoisomerase I (14Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, several independent results demonstrate that poison receptors are localized at the protein/DNA interface at the site of DNA cleavage. Early studies suggested that topoisomerase II poisons may fit into a “loose” pharmacophore, constituted by a planar ring system with DNA intercalation or intercalation-like properties, and one or two protruding side chains, possibly interfering with the protein side of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex (16Macdonald T.L. Lehnert E.K. Loper J.T. Chow K.-C. Ross W.E. Potmesil M. Kohn K.W. DNA Topoisomerases in Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 199-214Google Scholar). The lack of structural restrictions on this pharmacophore can be ascribed mainly to the receptor heterogeneity that is determined by different nucleic acid sequences at the enzyme-active site. An approach to the characterization of the drug receptor site has been based on molecular modeling analyses of topoisomerase II poisons along with the determination of their sequence-specific DNA cleaving activity (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The relative positions of planar ring systems and side chains of many clinically useful antitumor topoisomerase II poisons have been suggested to determine the site of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, only compounds sharing defined steric and electronic features can trap the enzyme at the same DNA sites. In particular, bisantrene and m-AMSA have the same base preference for DNA cleavage stimulation, and despite the different chemical structures, they were shown to be characterized by very similar electronic and steric properties, suggesting a common fit into the receptor site (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to challenge the idea that the drug shape and electron density determine the sequence specificity of the poison action, bisantrene analogs and an m-AMSA-bisantrene hybrid (Fig. 1) were synthesized and characterized for their DNA binding properties, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, base sequence preferences, and conformational and electronic features. The studied compounds were formally derived from the exchange of putative pharmacophoric domains of m-AMSA and bisantrene or were structural isomers of bisantrene (Fig. 1). In full agreement with the original hypothesis, our combined experimental and theoretical work demonstrates that alterations of the shape and electron density of the drug molecule markedly affect the sequence-specific interaction of the poison with topoisomerase II-DNA complexes. This might be useful in providing a physicochemical map of poison receptors. DISCUSSIONThe present investigation on IHA congeners, the design of which was prompted by earlier molecular modeling studies (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), definitely demonstrates that, in a homogeneous series of compounds, alterations of the shape and electron density of the drug molecule markedly affect the sequence-specific poison interaction with topoisomerase II-DNA complexes. Thus, this result strongly supports the idea that the relative position of putative DNA- and enzyme-binding domains plays a key role in determining the sequence position specificity of topoisomerase II poisons (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar).The NOE results presented in Fig. 6 A confirm the possibility of free rotation of the side chain groups with reference to the planar anthracene moiety. Hence, a number of conformations characterized by similar energies are available for the molecule to interact at the receptor site. This is confirmed by the theoretical ab initio analysis, giving small energy gaps between stable conformations, the limiting situations being represented by a completely planar arrangement or a perpendicular arrangement of the imidazolyl hydrazine group versus the anthracene group. The SEA analysis comparing the complete range of stable conformations of 9-IHA with the complete set of stable conformations of 1-IHA was not able to find a satisfactory alignment within the two sets of conformers. This confirms that 1-IHA and 9-IHA correspond to distinct pharmacophores. This is further emphasized by the fact that the observed changes in electrostatic potential are not a consequence of the drug conformation but a result of the 9 → 1 shift of the side chain group (Fig. 6 B).Our data establish that one side chain of bisantrene is sufficient to grant poisoning activity to the compound since 9-IHA could stimulate even higher levels of topoisomerase II DNA cleavage than bisantrene, although the DNA affinity was maximum when two dihydroimidazolyl chains were present. Indeed, the binding affinity dropped about 20-fold by removing one chain and 30-fold further when replacing the bisantrene chain with the m-AMSA side group. On the other hand, the substitution of the anthracene ring with the acridine planar moiety in aza-9-IHA did not appreciably alter the binding properties. This indicates that the aza substitution at the central ring does not play an important role in the energy balance of DNA-drug complex formation. Only a slight decrease is observed when shifting the chain from position 9 to position 1; hence, the location of side groups in the IHA/amsacrine family does not significantly affect DNA affinity.The effect of poison substituents on DNA cleavage levels cannot be determined by a simple comparison of cleavage efficiencies. In fact, as mentioned above, DNA binding constants of the studied compounds were markedly different, and it is well known that a strong interaction with free DNA by intercalating agents can fully prevent enzyme binding to the nucleic acid and therefore enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 6Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Cleavage levels stimulated by bisantrene were low, whereas they were prominent when using the weak binder m-AMSA; IHA congeners had intermediate effects, consistent with their intermediateK i values. Since the relative efficiencies in DNA cleavage stimulation were inversely correlated to nucleic acid binding constants for this series of compounds, the extent of cleavage stimulation could be mostly determined by the DNA binding affinity. Indeed, cleavage suppressive effects shown by 1,4-IHA well paralleled its very high DNA binding activity, which even prevented drug dissociation from the complex. The only compounds having essentially the same affinity for DNA were 9-IHA and aza-9-IHA. In this case, it is safe to conclude that the C → N bioisosteric substitution at the central ring was primarily responsible for the reduced cleavage activity. In agreement with this result, a double C → N bioisosteric substitution in anthracenediones (including mitoxantrone) has been shown to abolish topoisomerase poisoning activity (29De Isabella P. Palumbo M. Sissi C. Capranico G. Carenini N. Menta E. Oliva A. Spinelli S. Krapcho A.P. Giuliani F.C. Zunino F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 30-38PubMed Google Scholar).The statistical analysis documented that an adenine(+1) requirement for cleavage stimulation is shared by bisantrene, m-AMSA, 9-IHA, and the hybrid drug, aza-9-IHA (data not shown). Hence, these agents likely belong to a very similar pharmacophore class and interact similarly in the ternary DNA-poison-topoisomerase II complex. In total agreement with this hypothesis, the above drugs were characterized by a similar electron density and spatial relation of drug moieties as determined by the SEA analysis of drug conformations obtained byab initio theoretical calculations. In the case of 1-IHA, which had the side chain shifted to a lateral ring, radical changes were instead observed; the compound was still able to poison topoisomerase II; however, cleavage was no longer preferentially stimulated at m-AMSA sites. Therefore, we may conclude that 1-IHA cannot share the same pharmacophore as the other congeners of the bisantrene/m-AMSA family. Consistently, the molecular modeling analysis showed that 1-IHA and 9-IHA were rather different molecules, since a similarity parameter of 0.54 indicated that the two compounds were not more alike than any two of the vast majority of chemically unrelated DNA-interacting agents.At this time, we do not have direct evidence of the relative position of the 9- and 1-IHA structures within the DNA-enzyme covalent complex; nevertheless, we can reasonably argue that the 9-IHA derivatives are present at the enzyme/DNA interface specifically interacting with the adenine at the cleavage site in a fashion similar to bisantrene and m-AMSA (2Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 303-346PubMed Google Scholar, 17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A simple isomerization in the IHA structure causes dramatic modifications in the sequence specificity of poison-stimulated topoisomerase II DNA cleavage. Thus, the present results strongly support the hypothesis that only compounds sharing defined steric and electronic features can trap the enzyme at the same DNA sites, suggesting a similar fit into the receptor site (17Capranico G. Palumbo M. Tinelli S. Mabilia M. Pozzan A. Zunino F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken individually, the chemical identity of the functional groups of 1- and 9-IHA would allow the same stabilizing interactions to occur with the receptor site. However, the different reciprocal location of ring system and side chain impairs the contextual onset of the key contacts with the protein and nucleic acid partners in the covalent topoisomerase II-DNA complex. This strengthens the concept of a cooperation between (at least) two pharmacophoric domains in eliciting specific target recognition and, hence, in affecting drug activity.In conclusion, molecular modeling of poison molecules, and possibly poison-receptor interactions, may be powerful tools in drug discovery when combined with experimental molecular analyses of topoisomerase-dependent DNA cleaving effects. The complete definition of the diverse pharmacophores of topoisomerase II poisons will certainly be of value for the design of new agents more effective in the treatment of human cancers.

A metal binding site on hemoglobin appears to promote covalent bond formation between the β globin subunits upon addition of oxone 1The abbreviations used are: oxone, potassium peroxymonosulfate; rHb, recombinant hemoglobin; LC-MS, liquid chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in the presence of nickel. This reaction also results in a substantial yield of a modification that we have identified as oxidative deamination of the β globin amino terminus, generating in its place an α-ketoamide. Results from our studies indicate that the β globin His-2 is required for redox active nickel complexation, oxidative deamination, and intramolecular cross-linking. Expression of recombinant hemoglobin in Escherichia coli has been previously reported (15Looker D. Abbott-Brown D. Cozart P. Durfee S. Hoffman S. Mathews A.J. Miller-Roehrich J. Shoemaker S.

Recombinant human hemoglobin rHb69 was genetically engineered with the replacement of the wild type valine residues at all NH2 termini with methionine, and a fusion of two α globins with a single glycine amino acid linker. All other recombinant hemoglobins were β globin variants of rHb69 and were expressed in the same Escherichia coli background. In the expression system used, the initiating methionine residue is quantitatively removed by endogenous E. coli methionyl-aminopeptidase when the second amino acid expressed was alanine but was fully retained when the second residue was histidine or leucine (17Hirel P.H.

All mutants used in this study had an identical di-α globin and the differences between them occurred only in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments of the β globin, which are listed in Table I. Directed mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction was used to create the β globin mutants with amino acid substitutions after the initiating methionine codon. Separate oligonucleotides were used to introduce these changes to the β subunit by amplification from a rHb69 β globin gene template, and subsequent cloning of the polymerase chain reaction fragments into a high copy number vector for expression (18Weickert M.J. Pagratis M. Curry S.R. Blackmore R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4313-4320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Candidates were screened by restriction digestion and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All recombinant hemoglobins were purified from E. coli expression strains by a procedure previously reported (19Plomer, J., Ryland, J. R., Matthews, M. H., Traylor, D. W., Milne, E. E., Durfee, S.

The hemoglobins were sparged with carbon monoxide and buffer exchanged into 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.3, by Sephadex G25 chromatography. Final primary sequence of each mutant was confirmed by both automated Edman sequencing and LC-MS analysis.Table IEffect of amino acid sequences on oxidative deamination and cross-linking of the β globinsrHb variantsβ globin protein sequence (positions)DeaminationCross-link−112143144145146rHb69MetHis…HisLysTyrHis++rHb68MetLeu…HisLysTyrHisrHb67metAlaHis…HisLysTyrHis+++rHb66metAlaAla…HisLysTyrHisrHb96MetHis…HisLysHisHis++rHb95metAlaHis…AlaAlaTyrHis+++rHb97metAlaHis…HisAlaAlaHis++rHb98metAlaHis…HisAlaTyrHis+++rHb80metAlaHis…HisLysTyr+++rHb81metAlaHis…His++rHb82metAlaHis…+ Open table in a new tab Cross-linking reactions were carried out in 1.6-ml Eppendorf tubes in a total volume of 100 μl in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.3, with final hemoglobin concentration of 0.4 mm, and a final nickel chloride (Aldrich) concentration of 0.8 mm. Hemoglobin solutions were retreated with carbon monoxide by a brief head space sparge, after which a 16 mm solution of oxone (from Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, was added to a final concentration of 1.6 mm, and the tubes were placed on ice for 1 h under an argon head space. Reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Where noted, quenched reactions were treated with reductant by addition of 10 μl of 1 m DTT (Bio-Rad) or 10 μl of 1 msodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma) both in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.2. The reactions with DTT and sodium cyanoborohydride were placed under argon at room temperature for 10 min or 2 h, respectively, prior to precipitation of the globins with acidified acetone (20Witkowska H.E. Bitsch F. Shackleton C.H. Hemoglobin. 1993; 17: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recombinant hemoglobin was diluted to 2 mg/ml in HPLC grade water. Where specified, heme was removed from globins by precipitation with 20 volumes of cold 0.6% HCl in acetone and resolubilized in 2% (v/v) formic acid to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Approximately 100 μg of protein was injected onto an HP 1090IIM using a Zorbax 300SB-C3 HPLC analytical column (0.46 × 25-cm) at 40 °C. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min. Gradient conditions were as follows: isocratic 35% solvent B for 5 min, then the percentage of solvent B was increased to 49% over 45 min. Eluant was monitored at 215, 280, and 400 nm. In some cases the eluant was also monitored for detection of di-tyrosine by the method of Heinecke et al. (21Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) using a Hewlett-Packard 1046A programmable fluorescence detector employing excitation and emission wavelengths of 325 and 410 nm, respectively. Hemoglobin from native state reactions (approximately 15 mg/ml) were diluted 1:5 with water and then 1:1 with NOVEXTM SDS sample buffer. Where noted, the reducing (2×) sample buffer contained 100 mm DTT. Sample lanes were loaded with 30 μl/well. Lyophilized reversed phase HPLC globin fractions were resolubilized in 1× reducing sample buffer containing 50 mm DTT and placed for 10 min at 70 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed using NOVEX 228 4–20% Tris/glycine gels per manufacturer's instructions. Protein loads were about 20 μg/well. Hemoglobins, including those taken directly from reactions, were diluted to 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8. Injection volumes of 50 μl were analyzed using a Pharmacia Superose 12 HR column (1 × 30-cm) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8. Chromatography was performed using an HP1090M (Hewlett-Packard) HPLC and monitored at 280 and 400 nm. Electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using a Finnigan MAT LCQ 228 interfaced with an HP1090M as described previously (22Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tryptic mapping was performed using Poroszyme trypsin cartridges (22Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Separation was performed using a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (0.46 × 25-cm). The eluant was monitored at 215, 280, and 400 nm. Pepsin mapping was performed using immobilized enzyme from Pierce. Dried globins were resolubilized to approximately 2 mg/ml in 2% formic acid, and enzyme suspension was added to approximately 1:4 v/v. Digests were incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 2 h after which the immobilized enzyme was removed by microcentrifugation. 50 μl of the reaction supernatant was injected for reversed phase HPLC chromatography using a Vydac C18 column. Separation conditions were as follows: isocratic 1% B for 5 min, then buffer B was linearly increased to 70% B over 69 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in water and buffer B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile. The eluant was monitored at 215, 280, and 400 nm. The stoichiometry of Ni(II)-rHb binding in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, 25 °C, rHb (4 μm) was determined by titrating with Ni(II)SO4 (Sigma). The absorbance change at 240 nm was monitored using a Shimadzu-2101 UV-visible spectrophotometer and plotted as normalized change versus the ratio of Ni(II):Hb. Using a modified procedure of Levine et al. (23Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), the reaction mixture for derivatization of lyophilized reversed phase HPLC separated peptides was prepared as follows: a room temperature saturated solution of DNP (Aldrich) was prepared fresh in neat methanol and centrifuged briefly at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with deionized water and centrifuged again. The DNP supernatant was added to substrate using 50 μl/100 μg of peptide. Concentrated HCl was then added at 1 μl per 50 μl, and the reaction mixture placed at room temperature for 1 h. Reactions were diluted 1:1 with 2% formic acid in water prior to reversed phase HPLC-MS analysis. In the case of reactions with native state hemoglobin, the DNP supernatant was mixed 1:1 with the EDTA-quenched hemoglobin/nickel/oxone reaction mixtures and the combined mixture was placed at room temperature for 1 h. Hemoglobin was then precipitated with acidified acetone prior to peptide mapping (22Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sequence of proteins and peptides was determined by automated Edman degradation chemistry using a Porton 2090 gas phase sequencer. Beckman peptide supports were used as recommended by the manufacturer. PTH-amino acids were identified by reversed phase chromatography on a modified Hewlett-Packard 1090L HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard AminoQuant column. Protein and peptides were subjected to gas phase hydrolysis at 165 °C for 1 h in the presence of HCl containing 1% phenol, using a Savant AP100 AminoPrep hydrolyzer. Amino acids were analyzed using precolumn derivatization with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate as described previously (24Apostol I. Levine J. Lippincott J. Leach J. Hess E.

The reaction of carbon monoxide liganded human hemoglobin A0, Ni(II), and oxone at pH 8.2, produced a substantial amount of dimerized globins as measured by denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1,lanes 2 and 3). Addition of Ni(II) only showed no change from the control. Following treatment with DTT, the reacted hemoglobin still contained a similar amount of dimeric globin species, which were not observed in the DTT-treated control reaction (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, nondenaturing size exclusion chromatography of the Ni(II)/oxone-treated hemoglobin showed less than 2% in total content of higher molecular weight species (i.e. greater than 64 kDa), indicating that relatively little intermolecular protein cross-linking was caused by the reaction (data not shown). Spectrophotometric analysis of hemoglobin following the reaction with Ni(II)/oxone did not indicate an increase in methemoglobin content. CD spectroscopy revealed small but significant changes in molar ellipticity in the Soret region with an isoelliptic point at 430 nm (data not shown). These results suggest that the reaction of human hemoglobin and oxone in the presence of Ni(II) produces mainly intramolecular cross-linking of the protein, which is not disulfide mediated. Interestingly, the hemes remain ferrous throughout the cross-linking reaction. The changes detected in the Soret region of the CD spectrum suggest some change in protein structure, possibly indicative of changes in chain-chain interactions or other structural perturbations influencing aromatic residues surrounding the heme pockets (25Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 262-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Woody R. Caughey W.S. Biochemical and Clinical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities. Academic Press, Inc., New York1978: 279-298Crossref Google Scholar). These minor spectral changes did not reflect the dramatic change in oxygen affinity observed for hemoglobin A0 following the reaction with Ni(II)/oxone. Oxygen affinity increased with p50 dropping from 10.0 to 4.1 torr, and cooperativity (Hill n max) decreased from 2.8 to 1.0.Figure 5MS/MS fragmentation spectra of peptides eluting at approximately 34.5 and 41 min, respectively, during HPLC separation of tryptic digest as shown in Fig. 3. LCQ fragmentation energy was 22%. Only B and Y type fragmentation ions are annotated. Peak at 34.5 min is the nominal β1 tryptic peptide. Data shows that the peak at 41 min is structurally related to the β1 peptide with a 1-Da mass loss located at the N terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The recombinant hemoglobin rHb67 is structurally distinct from human hemoglobin A0 in that the wild type NH2-terminal valine of β globin is substituted by alanine. Additionally, the α globins of rHb67 are genetically fused by a single glycine amino acid linker and the wild type NH2-terminal valine of the first α globin domain is substituted by methionine. The reversed phase HPLC chromatograms of both human hemoglobin A0, and the recombinant hemoglobin rHb67, before and following the reaction with Ni(II) and oxone, are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the genetic fusion of the α globins in rHb67 affords considerably increased separation between elution of the two globin types. This allows for discrete separation of a new peak formed in the reaction, which elutes between them. Area integration of the chromatogram indicates approximately 50% of the β globin in rHb67 was converted to this form, as shown in Fig. 2. This peak was not resolved from oxidized α globin peaks in the case of (reacted) human hemoglobin A0. Fluorescence monitoring of this new peak by the method of Heinecke et al. (21Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) yielded no evidence of di-tyrosine formation. When 50 mm EDTA was included in the reaction with Ni(II)/oxone, this modified globin peak was not observed (data not shown). The reversed phase HPLC fraction containing the modified globin peak formed in the reaction of rHb67 was collected and lyophilized. No evidence of 2-oxohistidine (27Lewisch S.A. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was found. Peptide mapping of this fraction with trypsin yielded predominantly β globin tryptic peptides, along with a small level of di-α globin peptides (Fig.3). The same lyophilized fraction was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and showed greater than 80% of the protein migrated as a 32-kDa protein, apparently as a dimeric β globin (Fig. 4).Figure 4Reducing SDS-PAGE of HPLC reversed phase separated globin fractions of rHb67 before and after reaction with Ni(II)/oxone as seen in Fig. 2. Lane 1, protein size markers; lane 2, β globin before reaction; lane 3, oxidized β globin after reaction; lane 4, dimeric β globin after reaction; lane 5, di-α globin before reaction; lane 6, oxidized di-α globin after reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Consistent with the results seen with human hemoglobinA 0, the reaction of rHb67 also did not result in appreciable formation of multimeric hemoglobin (<2%), as evidenced by native state size exclusion chromatography. In addition, the reaction of recombinant hemoglobin in the presence of Ni(II)/oxone did not cause any significant change in the visible absorbance spectrum. These results indicate that the reaction of rHb67 and oxone in the presence of nickel(II) produces intramolecularly cross-linked β globin, most of which does not appear to be disulfide bond mediated, and that just as in the case of human hemoglobin A0, these cross-links can be formed without appreciable oxidation of the ferrous hemes. The monomeric and dimeric β globin fractions separated by reversed phase HPLC from Ni(II)/oxone-reacted rHb67 were analyzed by peptide mapping using an in-line immobilized trypsin cartridge method (22Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and monitored by UV and LCQTMmass spectrometry. β globin purified from unreacted rHb67 by reversed phase HPLC was also analyzed as a control. The peptide maps of these three fractions are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that both fractions from hemoglobin reacted with Ni(II)/oxone show distinct differences compared with β globin from the control sample. Since the control hemoglobin map was well characterized (22Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), LC-MS mass analysis allowed us to readily identify most of the major difference peptides produced in the reaction. These difference peaks included oxidized methionine and cysteine containing peptides that exhibited mass gains of 16 and 48 Da, respectively. These mass gains are consistent with oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide and cysteine to cysteic acid, and these peptide assignments were confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation. Such side chain oxidations could be expected for the sulfur-containing amino acids of a protein exposed to these concentrations of the chemical oxidant oxone (28Trost B.M. Curran D.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981; 22: 1278-1290Google Scholar). More surprising was the finding that the level of NH2-terminal β globin tryptic peptide β1 (Ala1-Lys8), eluting at 34.6 min, was markedly decreased in the monomeric and dimeric β globin fractions from Ni(II)/oxone-treated hemoglobin. In both cases a new, asymmetric peak appeared. This new peak eluted at approximately 41 min, and displayed a mass exactly 1 Da less than the nominal β1 peptide. MS/MS spectra of this new peak showed striking commonality of fragment masses with the nominal β1 peptide (Fig. 3). The 1-Da mass loss consistently mapped to the B2 ion. Since the mass of the B1 ion was outside the range of the LCQTM spectrometer in these MS/MS experiments, further mapping of the 1-Da mass loss was not possible. This peptide was found to be blocked to automated Edman protein sequencing. Amino acid analysis of this peptide yielded the predicted amino acid composition of the nominal β1 peptide, except for the NH2-terminal alanine, which was not recovered. Reaction of this new peptide with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine analyzed by LC-MS yielded evidence of formation of an adduct (two stereoisomers) with characteristic absorbance at 400 nm and mass of 1102 Da, consistent with hydrazone formation, indicating the presence a free carbonyl group. No reactivity with DNP was seen with the nominal β1 peptide. Cyanoborohydride treatment of the oxidized peptide (41 min peak in trypsin map, Fig. 3) was seen to yield a doublet of peptides, both exhibiting a mass increase of exactly 2 Da, (i.e. 1 Da more than the nominal β1 peptide). These findings suggested that the β globin NH2 terminus had undergone an oxidative deamination in which the NH2-terminal amino group was replaced with a free carbonyl group. Reduction with cyanoborohydride created chirality at the α carbon of the former NH2-terminal alanine producing two diastereomeric alcohols. Ni(II)/oxone reacted rHb67 hemoglobin treated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine prior to globin precipitation and trypsin mapping also yielded two peaks, which were absent in the control sample (Fig. 6). Masses of both isoforms were identical and consistent with stereoisomeric hydrazone adducts to deaminated β1 peptide. No evidence for oxidative deamination produced by the reaction at any other site on the hemoglobin was found. Surprisingly, although baseline “noise” appeared to be increased, the map of dimeric β globin did not display any significant difference peaks that would correspond to identifiable peptide cross-links connecting the two globins. We also noted a marked decrease in the yield of the COOH-terminal peptides β15 (Val133-Lys144) and β15,16 (Val133-His146) in the dimeric β globin fraction, along with the loss of the β1 peptide. The LC-MS data from trypsin maps of Ni(II)/oxone-oxidized human hemoglobin A0 also showed a loss of the β1 (Val1-Lys8) tryptic peptide and a corresponding increase of oxidatively deaminated peptide. However, there was no indication that the yield of nominal α1 (Val1-Lys7) peptide of α globin was diminished in the reaction. An extensive query for a peptide(s) exhibiting 1-Da loss from the nominal α1 peptide failed to yield any evidence of oxidative deamination of the α globin NH2terminus. Since valine is the NH2-terminal residue for both the α and β globin chains of Ao human hemoglobin, we wondered if a primary sequence difference between α and β globin was conferring susceptibility to NH2-terminal deamination of valine specifically to the β globin.αglobinV­LSPADK…βglobinVHLTPEEK…SEQUENCE1One potentially significant difference between α and β globins was the presence of histidine at position 2 of β globin. Histidine is known to form transition metal coordination sites in proteins (29Zhao Y.J. Sulkowski E. Porath J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the oxidative deamination of the β globin amino terminus appeared to require Ni(II). We postulated that this histidine might be required for deamination of the adjacent amino acid on the β chain. To test this, we constructed and expressed a recombinant hemoglobin mutant designated rHb66, which was identical to rHb67 except that the histidine at position 2 of the β globin was substituted with alanine. rHb66 and rHb67 were identically prepared and reacted with oxone in the presence of nickel(II). Trypsin maps of the two reactions revealed that the β globin of rHb66 was not oxidatively deaminated by the reaction (Fig.7), nor was any cross-linking of the β globins in reacted rHb66 observed by reversed phase HPLC (Fig.8). These results appeared to confirm that the histidine at position 2 of β globin is a key component of both the nickel-dependent oxidative deamination and intramolecular β globin cross-linking.Figure 8C3 reversed phase HPLC separation of globins from four different variants of recombinant hemoglobin.

https://openalex.org/W1992794155,"Many retroviruses, including bovine leukemia virus (BLV), contain a highly conserved region located about 40 amino acids downstream from the fusion peptide within the sequence of the external domain of the transmembrane (TM) protein. This region is notably thought to be involved in the presentation of the NH2-terminal peptide to allow cell fusion. By using hydrophobic cluster analysis and by analogy with the influenza A hemagglutinin structures, the core of the TM structure including this particular region was predicted to consist, in the BLV and other retroviral envelope proteins, of an α-helix followed by a loop region, both docked against a subsequent α-helix that forms a triple-stranded coiled coil. The loop region could undergo, as in hemagglutinin, a major refolding into an α-helix integrating the coiled coil structure and putting the fusion peptide to one tip of the molecule. Based on this model, we have identified amino acids that may be essential to the BLV TM structure, and a series of mutations were introduced in the BLV env gene of an infectious molecular clone. A first series of mutations was designed to disturb the coiled coil structure (substitutions with proline residues), whereas others would maintain the general TM structure. When expressed by Semliki Forest virus recombinants, all the mutated envelope proteins were stable and efficiently synthesized in baby hamster kidney cells. Both proline-substituted and conservative mutants were strongly affected in their capacity to fuse to CC81 indicator cells. In addition, it appeared that the integrity of the TM coiled coil structure is essential for envelope protein multimerization, as analyzed by metrizamide gradient centrifugation. Finally, to gain insight into the role of this coiled coil in the infectious potential of BLV in vivo, the mutated TM genes were introduced in an infectious and pathogenic molecular clone and injected into sheep. It appeared that only the conservative mutations (A60V and A64S) allowed maintenance of viral infectivity in vivo. Since these mutations destroyed the ability to induce syncytia, we conclude that efficient fusion capacity of the recombinant envelopes is not a prerequisite for the infectious potential of BLV in vivo. Viral propagation of these mutants was strongly affected in some of the infected sheep. However, the proviral loads within half of the infected animals (2 out of 2 for A60V and 1 out of 4 for A64S) were close to the wild-type levels. In these sheep, it thus appears that the A60V and A64S mutants propagate efficiently despite being unable to induce syncytia in cell culture.

The infectivity of enveloped viruses is thought to be mediated by surface glycoproteins that are responsible for the recognition of the target cell and for the fusion of both viral and cellular membranes (1Varmus H.E.

Both subunits are first synthesized as a single glycosylated polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved into the mature SU and TM proteins. In the case of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), the envelope gene is first translated as a 72-kDa precursor product (see Refs. 2Burny, A., and Mammerickx, M.

This glycoprotein is then cleaved by a cellular protease into two mature products, an SU protein of 51 kDa (gp51) and a TM protein of 30 kDa (gp30). Both the gp51 and gp30 subunits are required for viral infectivity since deletions within the env gene do not yield replication-competent virus in vivo (4Willems L. Kettmann R. Dequiedt F. Portetelle D. Vonéche V. Cornil I. Kerkhofs P. Burny A. Mammerickx M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4078-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since theenv gene sequence is highly conserved among different strains, it has been generally assumed that the BLV envelope is the result of high molecular constraints that appeared during evolution (5Mamoun R.Z. Morisson M. Rebeyrotte M. Busetta B. Couez D. Kettmann R. Hospital M. Guillemain B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether these observations assign a key role for the envelope gene in the biological properties of the BLV virus. Previous work has devoted a series of functions to this BLV gp30 protein. In addition to the TM domain of the TM protein, two other regions are involved in essential mechanisms mediated by the envelope protein. First, a hydrophobic peptide located at the amino-terminal end is essential for virus-mediated cell fusion. This so-called fusion peptide destabilizes the cellular membrane probably through an oblique insertion within the lipid bilayer (6Vonéche V. Portetelle D. Kettmann R. Willems L. Limbach K. Paoletti E. Ruysschaert J.M. Burny A. Brasseur R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3810-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Macosko J.C. Kim C.H. Shin Y.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fusion peptides are particularly rich in small amino acids such as alanine and glycine which could play a key role in their conformational mobility, helping them to destabilize lipid bilayers (8Callebaut I. Tasso A. Brasseur R. Burny A. Portetelle D. Mornon J.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A second domain located in the cytoplasmic tail of the BLV TM protein appears to exert an essential role in signal transduction. Indeed, its carboxyl-terminal extremity contains two YXXL sequences that share similarities with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs or ITAM (9Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 10Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These motifs are able to transduce signals through the cell membrane when they are fused to the CD8 molecule and triggered by an anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (11Alber G. Kin K.W. Weiser P. Riesterer C. Carsetti R. Reth M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 333-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Beaufils P. Choquet D. Mamoun R.Z. Malissen B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5105-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These ITAM sequences appear to be required for viral replication in vivo since their mutation affects either infectivity or efficient propagation in the sheep animal model (13Willems L. Gatot J.S. Mammerickx M. Portetelle D. Burny A. Kerkhofs P. Kettmann R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another region of the BLV TM protein, located about 40 amino acids downstream from the fusion peptide, is also of interest because it shares strong similarities with the immunosuppressive CKS17 peptide that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of lymphocytes in culture (14Cianciolo G.J. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Snyderman R. Science. 1985; 230: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This peptide is present in a wide variety of retroviral envelope proteins and exhibits similar immunosuppressive functions in different systems (15Denner J. Persin C. Vogel T. Haustein D. Norley S. Kurth R. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1996; 12: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Ruegg C.L. Monell C.R. Strand M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3257-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Haraguchi S. Good R.A. Noorbibi K.D. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 595-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At the beginning of this study, the only available three-dimensional model of an envelope glycoprotein that mediates fusion was the hemagglutinin protein (HA) of the influenza A virus (18Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Like retroviral envelopes, HA is proteotically processed in a receptor-binding subunit (HA1) and a membrane-spanning subunit (HA2) that contains at its NH2 terminus a fusion peptide. The HA complex is organized as a trimer of HA1 in interaction with HA2. In its latent form (designated BHA), the trimeric HA2 chains are major components of a mainly α-helical stem domain (19Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 20Weis W.I. Brunger A.T. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 737-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). From amino to carboxyl termini, HA2 is composed of an α-helix (A) located next to the fusion peptide followed by a loop region (B), both being docked against a long helix (C and D) forming in the trimeric structure a triple-stranded α-helical coiled coil (Fig.1, left). At the low pH of endosomes, a major structural change occurs at both ends of the HA2 chain giving rise to a structure called TBHA (21Bullough P.A. Hugson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,right). The loop region, which was maintained in a non-helical conformation as a result of extensive interactions with HA1, is reorganized into an α-helix incorporating the coiled coil structure and inducing the ejection of the fusion peptide over a distance of at least 150 Å in a “spring-loaded” manner. This refolding of the loop into a helix is thought to be involved in the presentation of the NH2-terminal peptide to allow cell fusion with the target cell membrane. Another conformational change is also observed in the middle of the coiled coil structure where seven residues refold to form a bend allowing the helix D and three short β-strands to “jack-knife” back and pack against helix C. Despite striking functional similarities, HA2 and retroviral TM proteins share very low levels of sequence identity (far below the so-called “twilight” level of 25–30%) and are not alignable with classical methods (22Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, regions having high helical propensity and 4–3 heptad repeats characteristic of coiled coil structures have been observed in retroviral TM proteins like in HA2 (23Gallaher W.R. Ball J.M. Garry R.F. Griffin M.C. Montelaro R.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1989; 5: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 24Chambers P. Pringle C.R. Easton A.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 3075-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Delwart E.L. Mosialos G. Gilmore T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting a common general scaffold for all the fusogenic TM proteins including a trimeric organization (26Callebaut I. Portetelle D. Burny A. Mornon J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These predictions were further supported by the recent experimental trimeric structure of a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal extremity of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) TM protein (27Fass D. Harisson S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), as well as very recently by those of two interacting peptides of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) TM protein (28Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar, 29Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Both structures are strikingly similar to that of the fusogenic TBHA2 structure (29Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). As no direct experimental structure of latent forms of retroviral TM protein has yet been determined, it remains to be proven that retroviral TM proteins also use a spring-loaded mechanism with SU proteins acting as clamps that hold the NH2-terminal regions of TM proteins in a non-coiled coil conformation. Since retrovirus-induced cell fusion is pH-independent, another dynamic must explain the process of refolding, perhaps with the help of additional viral or cellular factor(s) (1Varmus H.E. Swanstrom R. Weiss R. Teich T. Varmus H.E. Coffin J. RNA Tumor Viruses, Molecular Biology of Tumor Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 369-512Google Scholar). Based on the BHA and TBHA2 structures as well as on multiple alignments of retroviral TM proteins, a model of the BLV gp30 was constructed. In order to assess further the importance of this structure in the biological properties of the BLV, a series of mutations were introduced in the BLV TM protein, and their effects were analyzed in vitro by metrizamide centrifugation and in cells for syncytia induction. We have chosen to work on the BLV TM protein because this system also allows the final evaluation of the behavior of recombinant proviruses in vivo. Alignment of the retroviral and hemagglutinin TM proteins was performed using the hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) method (22Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 30Lemesle-Varloot L. Henrissat B. Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Morgat A. Mornon J.P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 31Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In contrast to other methods that work only on the maximization of sequence similarities, HCA is based on the analysis of hydrophobic amino acid clusters throughout the molecules. Indeed, hydrophobic amino acids are not distributed randomly along the protein sequences but are grouped into clusters that represent the internal faces of regular secondary structures (32Woodcock S. Mornon J.P. Henrissat B. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Successive correspondences of hydrophobic clusters along a structural domain are the signature of similar three-dimensional folding patterns. In related proteins, a precise alignment can then be deduced by proceeding outward from the hydrophobic clusters to linker regions where gaps are allowed. Three-dimensional manipulations were performed with the MANOSK program (33Cherfils J. Vaney M.C. Morize I. Surcouf E. Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 155-160Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), run on an Evans and Sutherland terminal PS390. Crystallographic data were taken from the Protein Data Bank (34Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8177) Google Scholar). Plasmids pBLVIX (which contains the wild-type virus pBLV344), pBLVY186D, pBLVY197D, pBLVY(186 + 197)D, and pBLVS1L + A4L (previously called pBLV6073, pBLV6106, pBLV6073 + 6106, and pBLVCV1, respectively) were described elsewhere (4Willems L. Kettmann R. Dequiedt F. Portetelle D. Vonéche V. Cornil I. Kerkhofs P. Burny A. Mammerickx M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4078-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Willems L. Gatot J.S. Mammerickx M. Portetelle D. Burny A. Kerkhofs P. Kettmann R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the other recombinant proviruses, mutations were introduced into the env sequence cloned into plasmid pCMVenv that contains the envelope gene of the wild-type 344 provirus (13Willems L. Gatot J.S. Mammerickx M. Portetelle D. Burny A. Kerkhofs P. Kettmann R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations were performed by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-step PCR procedure essentially as described previously (4Willems L. Kettmann R. Dequiedt F. Portetelle D. Vonéche V. Cornil I. Kerkhofs P. Burny A. Mammerickx M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4078-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the following sense (S) and complementary (C) oligonucleotides that contain the selected mutations were used as follows: 5695S (5′-GCTTAATGTGCCCTCTGTGGTC-3′), 5695C (5′-GACCACAGAGGGCACATTAAGC-3′), Val5695S (5′-GCTTAATGTGGTCTCTGTGGTC-3′), Val5695CPlus (5′-CGGTTCTGGGCGACCACAGAGACCACATTAAGC-3′), 5707S (5′-CTCTGTGGTCCCCCAGAACCGA-3′), 5707C (5′-TCGGTTCTGGGGGACCACAGAG-3′), Ser5707S (5′-CTCTGTGGTCTCCCAGAACCGA-3′), Ser5707CPlus (5′-CTAGCCCCCGTCGGTTCTGGGAGACCACAGAG-3′), 5731S (5′-GGGGCTAGATTTGTTGTACATC-3′), 5731C (5′-GATGTACAACAAATCTAGCCCC-3′), 5764S (5′-TCAAAGCCTAGCTCCCACGATC-3′), and 5764C (5′-GATCGTGGGAGCTAGGCTTTGA-3′). A first round of PCR reactions allowed the amplification of two fragments encompassing the env gene as follows: a 5′-end insert (using the T7 primer and one of the complementary oligonucleotides) and a 3′-end fragment (using the SP6 primer and the corresponding sense oligonucleotide). After PCR, the two inserts were migrated on an agarose gel, purified using the Sephaglas Bandprep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and amplified in a second round of PCR using the SP6 and T7 oligonucleotides. The resulting DNAs that contain the entire env gene sequence were then digested with theHindIII and XbaI restriction endonucleases and introduced into the corresponding sites of the pGem7 plasmid (Promega). In order to verify the presence of the desired substitution and the absence of Taq DNA polymerase errors, the mutated fragments were then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination procedure using a set of primers located along the env gene (T7 sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After their verification, the mutatedenv sequences were cloned in theNcoI-XbaI sites of plasmid pBLVIX to generate pBLVA60P, -A60V, -A64P, -A64S, -W72L, and -C83A. Restriction analysis and nucleotide sequencing were performed to verify the integrity of the resulting constructs. These plasmids were then purified by centrifugation on cesium chloride gradient as described by Sambrook (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.41-1.48Google Scholar). To express the envelope proteins in the Semliki Forest virus system, the recombinant envelope genes were first cloned into the pSFV3 vector (36Liljestro¨m P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). To locate the env initiation codon next to the promoter, about 270 nucleotides had to be eliminated upstream from the 5′-end of the envelope gene. Therefore, the wild-type envelope gene was PCR-amplified with an oligonucleotide that contains aBamHI restriction site (5′-AAAATGGATCCCAAAGAACGACGGTCCCG-3′, sense, 3′-position 4637 according to Ref. 37Rice N. Stephens R. Gilden R. Burny A. Mammerickx M. Enzootic Bovine Leukosis and Bovine Leukemia Virus. Martinus Nijhoff Publishing, Boston1987: 115-144Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide DREX4 (5′-CCCCAACCAACAACACTTGCTT-3′, antisense, 3′-position 7039 according to Ref. 37Rice N. Stephens R. Gilden R. Burny A. Mammerickx M. Enzootic Bovine Leukosis and Bovine Leukemia Virus. Martinus Nijhoff Publishing, Boston1987: 115-144Google Scholar). The PCR amplification product was then digested by the BamHI restriction endonuclease and inserted in the corresponding site of the pSFV3 vector, yielding plasmid pSFVenvWT. To construct the plasmids that express the mutated envelopes (pSFVenvA60P, pSFVenvA60V, pSFVenvA64P, pSFVenvA64S, pSFVenvW72L, pSFVenvC83A, pSFVenvY186D, pSFVenvY197D, and pSFVenvY(186 + 197)D), theNcoI-BamHI env fragments (at positions 4925–6997 following the numeration of Rice et al. (37Rice N. Stephens R. Gilden R. Burny A. Mammerickx M. Enzootic Bovine Leukosis and Bovine Leukemia Virus. Martinus Nijhoff Publishing, Boston1987: 115-144Google Scholar)) were isolated from the recombinant proviruses and inserted in the corresponding sites of pSFVenvWT. To construct pSFVenvWTa and pSFVenvS1L + A4L, the 2072-base pair NcoI-SmaIenv fragment of the pSFVenvWT vector (at positions 4925 and in the plasmid linker) was replaced by anNcoI-PvuII insert from plasmids pBLVS1L + A4L or pSP64-ENV (6Vonéche V. Portetelle D. Kettmann R. Willems L. Limbach K. Paoletti E. Ruysschaert J.M. Burny A. Brasseur R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3810-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). General procedures about the Semliki Forest virus expression system were described elsewhere (36Liljestro¨m P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In brief, pSFV3 plasmids containing the wild-type or recombinant envelope genes were linearized with the SpeI restriction endonuclease and used as templates for in vitro transcription. The RNAs were synthesized at 37 °C for 1 h in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 1.5 μg of linearized plasmid, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each ATP, CTP, and UTP, 500 μm GTP, 30 units of SP6 RNA polymerase, 60 units of RNasin (Promega), and 1 mm m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The efficiency of transcription was evaluated by migration of a 2-μl aliquot on a 1% agarose gel. After precipitation with isopropyl alcohol, equal amounts of RNA were resuspended in 20 μl of ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) and electroporated into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Therefore, BHK cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm NaH2PO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), and resuspended at 107 cells per ml in ice-cold PBS. The purified RNAs were then electroporated into four million BHK cells by two consecutive pulses (830 V, 40 microfarads, maximum resistance) using a Cellject electroporation system (Eurogentec). After transfection, the cells were immediately diluted in 15 ml of G-minimum Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) complemented with 10% heat-inactivated serum and cultivated at 37 °C for 48–60 h. To visualize the multinucleated cells, we used a colorimetric assay based on the use of β-galactosidase protein. Therefore, RNAs were transcribed in vitro from plasmid pSFVLacZ that expresses the lacZgene (36Liljestro¨m P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). These RNAs were mixed with the transcripts from each wild-type and mutant pSFVenv plasmids at a 1 to 4 ratio and transfected into 5 × 105 BHK cells. After electroporation, the BHK cells were cultivated in G-minimum Eagle's medium for 4 h to allow their attachment to the dishes. Then they were co-cultivated for 20 h with 2 million CC81 indicator cells to evaluate their fusion capacity. After culture, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. After an additional wash with PBS, the β-galactosidase activity was revealed by incubation of the cells in the presence of a reaction mixture containing 1 mg per ml of 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside, 5 mmpotassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS. Syncytia containing more than four nuclei were counted under the light microscope in 10 different fields at a 10-fold magnification. The wild-type and recombinant envelope proteins were expressed by the Semliki Forest virus expression system in BHK cells. After 48 h of culture, the cells were harvested and lysed by freezing them once at −80 °C. The cell lysates were then layered on a linear 5–40% gradient of metrizamide (Sigma) in TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.3)) and centrifuged overnight at 4 °C in a TH641 rotor (Sorvall) at 13,000 rpm. Eighteen 600-μl fractions were collected from the gradient, and the proteins were precipitated by the addition of 300 μl of polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) 30% (w/v), 0.4 m NaCl. After centrifugation, the proteins were resuspended in PBS, migrated onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel, and analyzed by Western blot to reveal the presence of gp51 and gp30. The Western blot procedures were performed essentially as described by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim chemiluminescence Western blotting kit) using a serum from a BLV-infected sheep (sheep 38) and an anti-bovine immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody (4G7) coupled to peroxidase. The recombinant pBLV plasmids were transfected into sheep as described previously (38Willems L. Portetelle D. Kerkhofs P. Chen G. Burny A. Mammerickx M. Kettmann R. Virology. 1992; 189: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In short, sheep were injected intradermally with 100 μg of plasmid DNA mixed with 200 μg ofN-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Boehringer Mannheim) in 1 ml of Hepes-buffered saline (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)). The sheep were maintained under controlled conditions at the National Institute for Veterinary Research (Uccle, Belgium), where natural transmission between sheep has never been observed. Sera were collected weekly and analyzed for BLV sero-positivity by immunodiffusion and indirect gp51 ELISA (39Portetelle D. Mammerickx M. Burny A. J. Virol. Methods. 1989; 23: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To evaluate the proviral loads, blood samples (500 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of freshly prepared lysis buffer (0.32m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100). The samples were centrifuged for 20 s, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer by vortexing. This step was repeated twice. The samples"

In innervated muscle fiber, AChR genes are transcriptionally repressed outside of the synapse, while after denervation they become reexpressed throughout the fiber. The myogenic determination factors (MDFs) of the MyoD family have been shown to play a central role in this innervation-dependent regulation. In the chicken AChR α-subunit gene promoter, two E-boxes that bind MDFs are necessary to achieve the enhancement of transcription following muscle denervation. However, the deletion of promoter sequences located upstream to these E-boxes greatly impairs the response to denervation (Bessereau, J. L., Stratford- Perricaudet, L. D., Piette, J., Le Poupon, C. and Changeux, J. P. (1994)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 1304–1308). Here we identified two additional cis-regulatory elements of the α-subunit gene promoter that cooperate with the E-boxes in the denervation response. One region binds the Sp1 and Sp3 zinc finger transcription factors. The second region binds at least three distinct factors, among which we identified an upstream stimulatory factor, a b-ZIP-HLH transcription factor. We propose that among MDF-responsive muscle promoters, a specific combination between myogenic and nonmyogenic factors specify innervation-dependentversus innervation-independent promoters.

In skeletal muscle, action potential frequency affects the properties of the extrasynaptic membrane and controls the repertoire of contractile proteins expressed in the fiber. This provides a relatively simple system to analyze the cascade of events that couple regulation of gene expression to electrical activity in excitable cells. One of the best characterized examples of electrical activity-dependent regulation in muscle is the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; MDF, myogenic determination factor; nt, nucleotide; bp, base pair; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ASA, α-skeletal actin.1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; MDF, myogenic determination factor; nt, nucleotide; bp, base pair; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ASA, α-skeletal actin. AChR is a heteropentameric transmembrane protein made up of four different types of subunits (α2βγ/εδ), which are encoded by distinct genes (reviewed in Refs. 1Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol.

In innervated muscle, AChRs are almost exclusively detected at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, which represents less than 0.1% of the total surface of the muscle fiber in mammals. Silencing electrical activity either by surgical denervation or by chemical blockade of neurotransmission causes a dramatic increase of AChR expression in the extrasynaptic regions of the muscle fibers. Electrical stimulation of denervated muscle represses the de novo expression of extrasynaptic AChRs, demonstrating that electrical activity is the first signal responsible for the down-regulation of AChR expression outside of the synapse (reviewed in Refs. 1Duclert A.

Development. 1992; 115: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) subunit genes have been shown to contain electrical activity-responsive sequences. By using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of point-mutated fragments of the α-subunit promoter in vitro and in vivo, we have shown that the E-box DNA motifs (CANNTG) that bind the myogenic differentiation factors (MDFs) of the MyoD family are necessary for activity-dependent regulation of the α-subunit promoter (8Bessereau J.L. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Piette J. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1304-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A similar E-box requirement for the denervation response of AChR promoters has been demonstrated for the δ-subunit promoter either in transgenic mice (13Tang J.C. Jo S.A. Burden S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar) or by using naked DNA injection (14Walke W. Xiao G.Z. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).MDFs (that include MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF4) are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that are critical for muscle-specific expression of several genes including AChR subunit-encoding genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MyoD and myogenin expression has been shown to be regulated by electrical activity. Denervation of adult muscle strongly enhances MyoD and myogenin mRNA levels, while exogenous stimulation of denervated muscle reverses this increase (15Duclert A. Piette J. Changeux J.P. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Eftimie R. Brenner H.R. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17Witzemann V. Sakmann B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Results obtained in primary cultures of muscle cells also suggest that electrical activity stimulates a serine/threonine kinase that, in turn, down-regulates myogenin transactivation potency by phosphorylation of the protein (18Mendelzon D. Changeux J.P. Nghiem H.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2568-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Together with the identification of E-boxes as target elements of the activity-dependent regulation of AChR gene transcription, these results support the hypothesis that electrical activity modulates MDF transactivation potency at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and in turn controls AChR gene transcription.The question remains, however, why only a subset of the muscle genes that contain MDF-responsive E-boxes are regulated by electrical activity. We have shown previously that the EB and EP E-boxes that are located in the proximal part of the chicken AChR α-subunit promoter (see Fig. 2) are necessary but not sufficient for activity-dependent transcription (8Bessereau J.L. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Piette J. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1304-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similar results have been recently reported with the proximal E-box of the rat δ-subunit promoter (14Walke W. Xiao G.Z. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, in addition to MDFs, other trans-acting factors that bind AChR promoters are involved in electrical activity-dependent transcription of AChR genes. In order to identify these factors, we have mapped thecis-regulatory sequences that cooperate with E-boxes in the α-subunit promoter. We have identified two regions in the distal part of the α-subunit promoter that are necessary but not sufficient to achieve the transcriptional enhancement of the α-subunit promoter after denervation. One region binds Sp1-related transcription factors. The other one is recognized by several nuclear proteins including “upstream stimulatory factor” (USF) transcription factors. Functional implications of these results are discussed.DISCUSSIONOur results show that different classes of cis-acting elements are involved in innervation-dependent regulation of the AChR α-subunit gene. In addition to the previously characterized EB and EP boxes that are the target of MDFs, we have characterized two new cis-acting elements of the chicken AChR α-subunit promoter that bind proteins that are not muscle cell-specific: Sp1, Sp3, USF and at least two other not yet identified factors. Both E-box and non E-box elements are necessary albeit not sufficient to fully enhance AChR α-subunit gene transcription in denervated muscle.Interaction between Myogenic Determination Factors and Sp1-related Transcription FactorsDeletion analysis of the α-subunit promoter led to the identification of a new binding site for Sp1-proteins. Point mutation of this site alters the denervation response in the context of adenoviral vectors. Interestingly, an Sp1-like sequence of the rat AChR δ-subunit promoter has recently been shown to participate in the denervation-elicited activation of the δ-subunit expression (14Walke W. Xiao G.Z. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The organization of the α-subunit promoter is slightly different from that of the δ-subunit promoter since it contains a second Sp1 binding site in its very proximal part, downstream to the MDF binding sites (35Piette J. Klarsfeld A. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Bessereau J.L. Mendelzon D. Le Poupon C. Fiszman C. Changeux J.P. Piette J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two proximal and distal Sp1 sites are, however, not redundant since an α-subunit promoter fragment that retains intact the 5′ Sp1 site is expressed in denervated muscle at lower level after deletion or disruption of the 3′ Sp1 binding site. This could reflect that MDFs requires at least two Sp1 sites to activate the α-subunit promoter in denervated muscle. However, in this promoter as well as other genes like cardiac α-actin (36Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and troponin I (37Lin H. Yutzey K.E. Konieczny S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), only one site is sufficient for MDFs to activate transcription at high level in transfected muscle cells. In the AChR α-subunit promoter, the two Sp1 sites could have distinct functions. It is tempting to speculate that the proximal site that is located close to the initiation site helps mostly in recruiting components of the basal machinery (38Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) while the distal one cooperates with MDFs by different molecular mechanisms.Interestingly, both sites bind a set of proteins with antagonistic properties. The proximal site overlaps a GC-stretch that recognizes the so-called GBF factor (19Bessereau J.L. Mendelzon D. Le Poupon C. Fiszman C. Changeux J.P. Piette J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When GBF is bound on its site, it subsequently prevents in vitro the binding of Sp1. In vivo, GBF is expressed in muscle as well as in non muscle cells and represses the residual transcription activity of the α-subunit promoter observed in non-muscle cells. The distal site that we characterized in this study binds two related proteins: Sp1, the first protein of the family to be cloned, and Sp3 that has been cloned by recognition screening (25Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and by low-stringency screening using the Sp1 zinc finger encoding region as a probe (26Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Sp3 contains modular activation and repression domains (39Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 40Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and is able to repress Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation (41Majello B. De L.P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Therefore, Sp3 is considered as an inhibitory member of the Sp1 transcription factor family, even though recent evidences suggest that Sp3 can also act as a weak activator depending on the promoter and cellular context (40Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Depending on the ratio between Sp1 and Sp3, an Sp1 binding site can therefore act as a positive as well as a negative cis-acting regulatory element. Preliminary results suggest that the Sp1/Sp3 ratio increases during muscle differentiation, in parallel with the activation of the AChR α-subunit gene expression (data not shown). It will be of particular interest to analyze in detail the expression of these factors in vivo during development and after denervation.Contribution of USF to the Expression of AChR GenesAR-160 is the second cis-regulatory element that we have shown to participate in the denervation-elicited enhancement of the α-subunit promoter activity. It binds at least three different factors which exhibit distinct DNA-binding properties. Mutating the left part of AR-160 specifically disrupts the binding of the faster migrating complex in gel shift assays while mutation of the right part, namelymutU, prevents the formation of the two upper complexes I and II. Since the EB oligonucleotide only competes for the formation of complex II, the factors involved in complexes I and II have distinct but most probably overlapping DNA-binding sites. To evaluate the respective requirement of these different factors for denervation response, we have introduced mutU andmutT in the 850-bp promoter fragment of the α-subunit promoter. Both mutations decrease the transcription rate of the promoter in denervated muscle to similar extents. This suggests that either complex I or II and complex III both participate in the denervation response. However, the binding sites of these different factors are close or even overlapping, and a mutation that disrupts a binding site most probably modifies the flanking regions of the neighboring binding site. Since it is well known that there is not always a direct correlation between in vitro binding experiments and in vivo transactivation by a specific factor (see for example Ref. 42Huang J. Blackwell T.K. Kedes L. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3893-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the possibility cannot be ruled out that only one of the factors that bind AR-160 is critically involved in the denervation response. In keeping with this possibility, we have shown that the enhancer fragment of the mouse AChR α-subunit promoter contains a motif that shares striking homology with AR-160 (10/12 identical bases). This region only binds complexes I and II, suggesting that these factors could be privileged actors of the denervation response.We have identified the proteins that generate complex II as the USF transcription factors. In AR-160, USF binds an E-box, namely EU, that differs from the previously characterized EB and EP E-boxes of the chicken α-promoter, since EU neither binds nor responds to MDFs. However, we showed that USF also binds the MDF-responsive E-boxes of the chicken α-subunit promoter as well as the proximal E-box of the enhancer of the mouse α-subunit promoter (this work). 2J.-L. Bessereau, V. Laudenbach, C. Le Poupon, and J.-P. Changeux, unpublished data. According to the pattern of migration of previously published gel shift assays (43Simon A.M. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is also probable that USF binds the proximal E-box of the mouse δ-subunit promoter (USF most probably corresponds to the binding activity referred to as “3” in the work of Simon and Burden (43Simon A.M. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). What is the significance of USF binding to various AChR subunit promoters? By transfection experiments in fibroblasts, we have observed that the multimerization of EU in front of a minimal promoter only activates slightly the transcription rate from this promoter, while in the same conditions EB has no effect. Either some other factor(s) interfere with the binding of USF on these sites or, more probably, USF is unable to activate transcription through these E-boxes in vivo. A similar discrepancy between the binding of USF to promoter elements and the lack of transactivation of the promoter by USF has been reported with other genes including L-type pyruvate kinase (44Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (45Carter R.S. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the IgH enhancer, USF has even been demonstrated to play the role of a repressor by preventing the binding of the basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper TFE3 factor, which is the relevant activator of the IgH promoter (45Carter R.S. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In keeping with these data, USF factors could similarly interfere with the binding of MDFs on AChR subunit promoters and contribute to the down-regulation of AChR expression in innervated muscle when MDF levels decrease. The same kind of antagonistic interactions could occur at the level of AR-160 between USF and the factor I that we are now actively trying to characterize.Role of MDFs in the Denervation ResponseThecis-acting elements that bind ubiquitous factors, as well as the previously characterized MDF binding sites EB and EP, are all necessary albeit not sufficient to fully achieve the enhancement of the α-subunit promoter transcription rate, which takes place after denervation. Similar results have been reported in the case of the AChR δ-subunit promoter, where an Sp1-like site and an SV40 core element are involved in the denervation response (14Walke W. Xiao G.Z. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to the proximal E-box (13Tang J.C. Jo S.A. Burden S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar). The question remains whether all of the transcription factors that bind these elements are equivalent mediators of the innervation-dependent regulation of AChR gene expression or whether some of them are limiting components of this regulation.Interestingly, the α-subunit promoter has been studied in various systems and, under certain experimental conditions, the promoter region upstream of the −110 position seems dispensable for the denervation response. In the DNA injection experiments performed in this study, the 110-bp promoter fragment was still responsive to denervation although less active than a longer fragment. However, we used cardiotoxin-treated regenerating muscles that were not fully differentiated at the time of denervation. The high levels of expression of myogenic factors which are observed in regenerating muscles could possibly render the interaction of MDFs with other factors less critical for the activation of the AChR α-promoter. Moreover, expressing nuclei most probably contained a very high number of plasmid copies (23Duclert A. Savatier N. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which are known to perturb some transcriptional regulations. Therefore, this result must be interpreted cautiously. The α-subunit promoter has also been analyzed in transgenic mice (5Klarsfeld A. Bessereau J.L. Salmon A.M. Triller A. Babinet C. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 46Merlie J.P. Mudd J. Cheng T.C. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2461-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Shortening the promoter fragment from 850 to 110 bp causes a drastic drop in the overall activity of the promoter and a 5–20-fold reduction of the denervation response, although a bp −111 promoter fragment remains denervation-responsive in the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscles (46Merlie J.P. Mudd J. Cheng T.C. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2461-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, a large number of transgene copies are inserted at the same locus in the chromatin (more than 100 copies in the case of the mice described by Merlie and Kornhauser (4Merlie J.P. Kornhauser J.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1295-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Since E-boxes can act synergistically, positive interactions between E-boxes located in different transgene copies could substitute for the interactions between myogenic and nonmyogenic factor binding elements that are required for full denervation response in the context of adenovirus vectors and possibly in the endogenous promoter. Finally, although the adenovirus vector used in this study has been designed to be as neutral as possible (8Bessereau J.L. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Piette J. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1304-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is not possible to definitely rule out the possibility that in a particular context some adenoviral sequence interacts with the promoter under study. The variation in the results depending on the experimental strategy shows the importance of using different methodologies to analyze a promoter, especially in vivo. However, all these data consistently support the hypothesis that the proximal MDF responsive E-boxes are central in the regulation of the AChR α-subunit promoter by electrical activity and that they interact with the regulatory elements that we have characterized in this study.Promoter context plays a critical role in the ability of E-boxes to mediate MDF transactivation. For example, a defined E-box motif is unable to transduce MyoD transactivation in the cardiac α-actin promoter, while the same sequence will be extremely potent in the muscle creatine kinase promoter (42Huang J. Blackwell T.K. Kedes L. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3893-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In AChR promoters, positive and negative interactions have been demonstrated (i) between E-box and non-E-box cis-acting elements and (ii) between distincttrans-acting factors for binding to the same site. We propose that these layers of interactions help specify innervation-dependent versus innervation-independent promoters in muscle. Modulations of MDF transactivation potency that are caused by muscle innervation will be amplified by a specific network of interactions at the level of AChR gene promoters, while in innervation-independent genes these variations will be neutralized by the contribution of other transcription factors. Such networks help us to understand how a limited number of factors can achieve the independent tuning of several genes in response to subtle changes of the physiological status of the cell. In skeletal muscle, action potential frequency affects the properties of the extrasynaptic membrane and controls the repertoire of contractile proteins expressed in the fiber. This provides a relatively simple system to analyze the cascade of events that couple regulation of gene expression to electrical activity in excitable cells. One of the best characterized examples of electrical activity-dependent regulation in muscle is the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; MDF, myogenic determination factor; nt, nucleotide; bp, base pair; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ASA, α-skeletal actin.1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; MDF, myogenic determination factor; nt, nucleotide; bp, base pair; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ASA, α-skeletal actin. AChR is a heteropentameric transmembrane protein made up of four different types of subunits (α2βγ/εδ), which are encoded by distinct genes (reviewed in Refs. 1Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 2Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar).

Muscle activity controls AChR gene expression primarily at the transcriptional level. The use of transgenic mice demonstrated that promoter fragments of the AChR α- and δ-subunit genes confer denervation-responsive expression to a reporter gene (4Merlie J.P. Kornhauser J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2028314572,"Two anionic residues in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, Asp-152 in the α-subunit and Asp-174 in the γ-subunit or the corresponding Asp-180 in the δ-subunit, are presumed to reside near the two agonist binding sites at the αγ and αδ subunit interfaces of the receptor and have been implicated in electrostatic attraction of cationic ligands. Through site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of state changes in the receptor elicited by agonists, we have distinguished the roles of anionic residues in conferring ligand specificity and ligand-induced state changes. αAsp-152 affects agonist and antagonist affinity similarly, whereas γAsp-174 and δAsp-180 primarily affect agonist affinity. Combining charge neutralization on the α subunit with that on the γ and δ subunits shows an additivity in free energy changes for carbamylcholine and d-tubocurarine, suggesting independent contributions of these residues to stabilizing the bound ligands. Since both aromatic and anionic residues stabilize cationic ligands, we substituted tyrosines (Y) for the aspartyl residues. While the substitution, αD152Y, reduced the affinities for agonists and antagonists, the γD174Y/δD180Y mutations reduced the affinity for agonist binding, but surprisingly enhanced the affinity for d-tubocurarine. To ascertain whether selective changes in agonist binding stem from the capacity of agonists to form the desensitized state of the receptor, carbamylcholine binding was measured in the presence of an allosteric inhibitor, proadifen. Mutant nAChRs carrying αD152Q or γD174N/δD180N show similar reductions in dissociation constants for the desensitized compared with activable receptor state and a similar proadifen concentration dependence. Hence, these mutations influence ligand recognition rather than the capacity of the receptor to desensitize. By contrast, the αD200Q mutation diminishes the ratio of dissociation constants for two states and requires higher proadifen concentrations to induce desensitization. Thus, the contributions of αAsp-152, γ/δAsp-174/180, and αAsp-200 in stabilizing ligand binding can be distinguished by the interactions between agonists and allosteric inhibitors. Two anionic residues in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, Asp-152 in the α-subunit and Asp-174 in the γ-subunit or the corresponding Asp-180 in the δ-subunit, are presumed to reside near the two agonist binding sites at the αγ and αδ subunit interfaces of the receptor and have been implicated in electrostatic attraction of cationic ligands.

While the substitution, αD152Y, reduced the affinities for agonists and antagonists, the γD174Y/δD180Y mutations reduced the affinity for agonist binding, but surprisingly enhanced the affinity for d-tubocurarine. To ascertain whether selective changes in agonist binding stem from the capacity of agonists to form the desensitized state of the receptor, carbamylcholine binding was measured in the presence of an allosteric inhibitor, proadifen. Mutant nAChRs carrying αD152Q or γD174N/δD180N show similar reductions in dissociation constants for the desensitized compared with activable receptor state and a similar proadifen concentration dependence. Hence, these mutations influence ligand recognition rather than the capacity of the receptor to desensitize. By contrast, the αD200Q mutation diminishes the ratio of dissociation constants for two states and requires higher proadifen concentrations to induce desensitization. Thus, the contributions of αAsp-152, γ/δAsp-174/180, and αAsp-200 in stabilizing ligand binding can be distinguished by the interactions between agonists and allosteric inhibitors. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 1The abbreviation used is: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.1The abbreviation used is: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. in muscle is a pentamer composed of four homologous subunits present in a stoichiometry α2βγδ and arranged to surround a central channel (1Unwin N.

Simultaneous occupation of agonist at the two binding sites that reside at the interfaces of the αγ and αδ subunits activates the nAChR by increasing the probability of channel opening. Continued exposure to agonist shifts the receptor into the desensitized state characterized by a greater than two orders of magnitude increase in agonist affinity and by a closed channel. The extracellular domain in each subunit is formed principally from the amino-terminal 210 amino acids; this domain is followed by four transmembrane spanning regions. Since only a small segment between membrane spans 2 and 3, and the very carboxyl terminus of ~8 residues reside at the extracellular face, residues within the amino-terminal 210 amino acids should largely contribute to the agonist binding site. Three segments of the α-subunit, residues surrounding Tyr-93, the regions between residues 149 and 153 and between residues 180 to 200, have been shown by chemical labeling and site-directed mutagenesis to contribute to agonist binding (2Karlin A.

Four segments on the opposing subunit interface of the γ and δ subunits (identified by residues 34, 55–59, 111–119, and 172–174 on the γ subunit and corresponding residues on the δ subunit) present surfaces which also appear to contribute to ligand binding (5Cohen J.B.

Long range electrostatic attractive forces and stabilization of paired charges through Coulombic interactions have long been known to control binding of charged ligands to proteins. More recently, the importance of interaction between quaternary ammonium moieties and aromatic side chains became evident through studies of model binding sites (14Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar) and crystallographic studies of proteins that associate with quaternary ammonium ligands (15Segal D.M. Padlan E.A. Cohen G.H.

Residue proximity revealed from cross-linking and the reduction in agonist affinity associated with charge removal point to γAsp-174 and δAsp-180 as critical residues. Our search for anionic residues in α-subunit identified αAsp-152 to be at the αγ and αδ subunit interfaces, where it affects the binding of agonists and competitive alkaloid antagonists as well as subunit assembly (20Sugiyama N. Boyd A.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26575-26581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since αAsp-152 and γAsp-174/δAsp-180 are critical to ligand binding, yet differentially affect agonist and antagonist binding, herein we examine the role of these residues in conferring specificity and affecting state changes in the receptor. These residues are compared with other anionic residues critically positioned in the extracellular region of the receptor. Carbamylcholine, suberyldicholine, decamethonium, and d-tubocurarine were purchased from Sigma. Dimethyl-d-tubocurarine was obtained from Lilly.125I-α-Bungarotoxin (specific activity ~16 μCi/μg) was a product of NEN Life Science Products. cDNAs encoding mouse nAChR subunits were subcloned into a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector, pRBG4. Single-stranded cDNAs were prepared as described previously (20Sugiyama N. Boyd A.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26575-26581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All mutations were introduced using single-stranded templates. After the mutagenesis reaction, restriction fragments containing the mutated site were subcloned into the original pBRG4 plasmid. Confirmation of the mutations and the absence of spontaneous mutations in the polymerase generated segment were established by dideoxy sequencing. cDNAs encoding the wild type and mutant subunits were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells using Ca3(PO4)2 in the ratios of α (15 μg)/β (7.5 μg)/γ (7.5 μg)/δ (7.5 μg) and α (15 μg)/β (7.5 μg)/γ or δ (15 μg). Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA, 2–3 days after transfection. They were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in potassium-Ringer's buffer, and divided into aliquots for binding assays. Specified concentrations of agonists, antagonists, and proadifen were added to the samples 20 min prior to initiating the rate of association assay with 125I-α-bungarotoxin. Dissociation constants of the ligands were determined from their competition with the initial rate of 125I-α-bungarotoxin association (21Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Candidate anionic residues were selected in three segments of the extracellular domain of the α subunit known to affect ligand binding (TableIA). In segment A (amino acids 88–99), aspartate 99 was mutated to asparagine. In segment B (amino acids 144–154), aspartate 152 was mutated to glutamine. Glutamine substitution precludes insertion of a glycosylation signal. In segment C (amino acids 180–200), two anionic residues glutamate 180 and aspartate 200 were mutated into asparagine and glutamine, respectively.Table IA, Aligned amino acid sequences of three main ligand binding segments in the α subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and B, four segments conferring ligand specificity found in the γ/δ subunits Segment A (position 88–99) Segment B (144–154) Segment C (180–200)A.

Both the αD152Q and αD200Q mutations shift the binding curves to more than 10-fold higher agonist concentrations, whereas αD99N and αE180N mutations produce only slight shifts in concentration dependence and a loss of positive cooperativity for the agonists (TableII). For the antagonistd-tubocurarine, the αD152Q mutation produces a reduction of affinity similar to that seen for the agonist (Fig. 1 B) (20Sugiyama N. Boyd A.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26575-26581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the αD200Q mutation showed only a small influence on d-tubocurarine binding (Fig. 1 B, Table II). This was also true for the αD99N and αE180N mutations.Table IIThe influence of anionic residue mutations in the α, γ, and δ subunits on carbamylcholine and d-tubocurarine dissociation constantsCompositionCarbamylcholined-TubocurarineK equilHill slopeK equilmt/K equilwtΔΔGK d1K d1mt/K d1wtΔΔG1K d2K d2mt/K d2wtΔΔG2μmkcal/molnmkcal/molnmkcal/molα2βγδ wt161.3411000 αD99N221.11.4−0.19160.390.566900.690.22 αD152Q2601.316−1.7190037−2.12200022−1.8 αD152Y6901.144−2.2280068−2.54100041−2.2 αE180N141.00.900.063461.1−0.05711001.1−0.057 αD200Q4700.9130−2.053013.0−1.55300.530.38 γD174N/δD180N19000.89120−2.82105.2−0.9827002.7−0.59 αD152Q/γD174N/δD180N340000.882100−4.67500190−3.18000080−2.60 γD174Y/δD180Y13000.7681−2.6190.410.463300.330.66α2βγ2 wt3.31.050 γD174N2800.7585−2.63406.7−1.1α2βδ2 wt0.740.51780 δD180N550.5474−2.611001.3−0.15Dissociation constants were calculated from competition with the initial rate of the 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding.

ΔΔG is a change of free energy of binding associated with the mutations. γAsp-174 and δAsp-180 are situated in the most carboxyl-terminal position of the four segments in the γ and δ subunits known to contribute to ligand binding (Table IB). After cotransfection of α, β, γ, and δ subunits carrying the γD174N/δD180N mutations, the binding curve for the agonist carbamylcholine shifts over two orders of magnitude to higher concentration (Fig. 1 C), whereas less than a 10-fold shift is seen for the antagonist d-tubocurarine (Fig.1 D). To distinguish between the two binding sites, subunits containing γD174N or δD180N were expressed as pentamers of either α2βγ2 or α2βδ2 subunit composition on the cell surface by transfection of the requisite three cDNAs; these subunit arrangements possess apparently equivalent subunit interfaces for binding (α2βγ2 with two α-γ sites, α2βδ2 with two α-δ sites). A reduction in agonist affinity that is greater than those for antagonists is again evident with these unnatural subunit compositions (Fig. 2). The loss of cooperativity on agonist binding for α2βδ2 pentameric receptor was also evident in previous studies (23Martin M.D. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10742-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and likely reflects the diminished capacity of this subunit combination to elicit state transitions in response to agonists. Binding ofd-tubocurarine is largely unaltered by these mutations with the α2βγ2 and α2βδ2 subunit combinations. As expected for a pentamer containing two equivalent sites, the respective Hill coefficients also approach 1.0. The bis-quaternary agonist, suberyldicholine, shows a reduction in affinity similar to carbamylcholine for the charge neutralization mutations in the α and the γ/δ subunits, 10-fold for the αD152Q mutation and about 100-fold for the γD174N or the δD180N mutation (Table III). Thus, mono- and bis-quaternary agonists are not differentially affected by these mutations. For bis-quaternary antagonist, dimethyld-tubocurarine, the αD152Q mutation showed over a 10-fold reduction in affinity, whereas the γD174N or the δD180N mutation showed only a 3–4-fold reduction; values similar tod-tubocurarine, which contains single cationic tertiary and quaternary moieties. For the bis-quaternary partial agonist, decamethonium, the loss of affinity with the mutations falls betweend-tubocurarine and suberyldicholine, but somewhat closer to the antagonist (Table III).Table IIIThe effect of mutations, αD152Q, γD174N/δD180N, and γD174Y/δD180Y on the dissociation constants of a bisquaternary agonist, partial agonist, and antagonistSuberyldicholineDecamethoniumDimethyl-d-tubocurarineK equilHill slopeK equilmt/K equilwtK equilHill slopeK equilmt/K equilwtK d1K d1mt/K d1wtK d2K d2mt/K d2wt2-amt, mutant; wt, wild type.μmμmμmμmWild type0.941.2170.860.307.1αD152Q151.4162900.8117196413019γD174N/δD180N1200.941301200.797.01.24.1243.5γD174Y/δD180YND2-bND, not determined.NDND510.713.00.120.393.30.47Dissociation constants were calculated as Table I.

Receptors were expressed as α2βγδ on the cell surface. Upon expression of receptor containing charge neutralization mutations on both the α and the γ/δ subunits, the change of free energy (ΔΔG), between the double subunit mutant combining αD152Q with γD174N/δD180N and wild-type receptor for carbamylcholine is in close accord with the sum of ΔΔG calculated from separate mutations on the individual subunits contained in the pentameric receptor (Fig. 1 C; Table II). For d-tubocurarine, ΔΔG between the wild-type receptor and the receptor with combined α and γ/δ substitutions is also in close accord with the sum of ΔΔG values calculated for two respective receptors with individual substitutions in the two subunits (Fig. 1 D; TableII). These results suggest that the charged residues, αD152Q and γD174N/δD180N, confer independent, noninteracting electrostatic contributions to the binding site. The selectivity of the γD174N/δD180N mutations for agonist, but not antagonist, affinity might be a consequence of these residue positions affecting the characteristic state transitions associated with the binding of agonists, but not antagonists. When agonists are allowed to equilibrate the receptor, the overall equilibrium constant (K equil) reflects binding to at least three discrete receptor states: activable, active (open channel), and desensitized. The last state exhibits the highest affinity for agonists, and allosteric ligands such as local anesthetics promote a shift in the equilibria between states so that the receptor resides primarily in the desensitized state (24Weber M. Changeux J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 15-34PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8106-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taylor P. Brown R.D.

At saturation with local anesthetics, such as proadifen (27Boyd N.D Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the apparent dissociation constant for carbamylcholine is equivalent to that for the desensitized state (K R′). We examined the possibility that a diminished capacity for desensitization was responsible for the apparent reduction of agonist affinity associated with the charge neutralization on the receptor. Fig. 3 shows binding profiles for the agonist carbamylcholine at various concentrations of a local anesthetic, proadifen. Upon increasing the concentration of proadifen, the binding curves shift to toward lower concentrations of carbamylcholine. The degree of enhancement of affinity by proadifen can be monitored from the shift in the family of carbamylcholine binding curves. In both wild type and two mutant receptors (αD152Q and γD174N/δD180N), 10 μm proadifen is nearly sufficient for saturation (Fig. 3, panels A–C). Similar degrees of shift of carbamylcholine affinity in the presence and absence of proadifen are observed for the wild type (K equil /K R′ = 120), αD152Q (K equil /K R′ = 88) and γD174N/δD180N (K equil /K R′= 130) mutant receptors (Fig. 4). Therefore, the αD152Q and the γD174N/δD180N mutants retain their capacity for desensitization or conversion to a high affinity state, and the large influence of the charge neutralization mutation on agonist binding does not arise from a compromised capacity of the mutant receptor to desensitize. Furthermore, the concentration dependence for proadifen in effecting the increase in carbamylcholine affinity for the αD152Q and the γD174N/δD180N mutant receptors are superimposable with that found for wild-type receptor (Fig. 4,panels A–C). A previous study of the permeability response of the mouse nAChR expressed from mRNAs encoding the individual subunits when injected into Xenopus oocytes showed a only minor influence of αD200N on the concentration dependence for activation and functional antagonism (8O' Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study shows a larger influence of this mutation on carbamylcholine binding at equilibrium, over one order of magnitude reduction in affinity (Fig. 1). d-Tubocurarine affinity is less affected by this mutation (Fig. 1). Exposure of the ligand to the receptor prior to assay allows all of the receptor states to equilibrate in the binding measurement, whereas the concentration dependence of the permeability response does not reflect the fraction of receptor in the desensitized state. Therefore, transitions to the desensitized states may explain the difference between the two studies. For the αD200Q mutant, the ratio of dissociation constants (K equil /K R′ = 22) (Figs. 3and Fig. 4, panel D) is significantly reduced compared with wild-type and the other receptor mutations with charge neutralization in the α or γ/δ subunits. The proadifen concentration dependence also increases where half-maximal conversion occurs at 61 μm, a value more than 10-fold higher than for wild type (Figs. 3 D and 4 D). These data indicate that the capacity for desensitization and for conversion to the high affinity state contributes to the overall dissociation constant measured at equilibrium and may well account for the interesting differences seen for this mutant between the previous measurements of permeability (8O' Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and our binding studies. Since both anionic and aromatic residues are known to stabilize complexes of quaternary ligands and their binding sites, we determined whether substitutions of tyrosine for the charged residues would still result in a binding site that accommodates the bound agonist and antagonist. Although capacity for surface expression of receptor with the αD152Y mutation is about 30% of that of its αD152Q mutation, ligand binding affinities for carbamylcholine andd-tubocurarine are similar to those seen with αD152Q (Fig.5). The γD174Y/δD180Y mutation also results in a loss of affinity for carbamylcholine, but leads to an enhanced affinity for d-tubocurarine (Fig. 5; Table II). This increase in affinity is also seen for structurally related bisquaternary antagonist, dimethyl d-tubocurarine (TableIII). The profile of binding curves for carbamylcholine in the presence of proadifen differs between the γD174Y/δD180Y and γD174N/δD180N (Fig. 3, panels E and C). Proadifen at 1 μm does not affect carbamylcholine binding and only at 10 μm gives a shift in the binding profile comparable to that found for wild type and the γ/δD174/D180N mutant receptors at 1 μm proadifen. The proadifen concentration which gives a half-maximal shift in carbamylcholine affinities is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the wild-type receptor (Fig.3, A and E). Moreover, the magnitude of proadifen elicited shift in carbamylcholine binding to higher affinity for the γD174Y/δD180Y mutant is approximately 4 times smaller than that found for wild-type receptor. The forces involved in stabilization of quaternary ammonium complexes with macromolecules have been studied for nearly a half-century and reveal both hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to their stabilization (31Pressman D.

Electrostatic forces have been quantified by ionic strength masking of rates of association enhanced by electrostatic attraction or slowed by repulsion. Apart from long range forces generated from an electrostatic dipole in the binding site, charge may serve to stabilize particular orientations of the bound ligand or to entrap the ligand in the target site (16Sussman J.L.

The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that potentially interact with the methyltransferase in a cellular processing pathway. Two cDNAs, both encoding calmodulin, were isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library using the human methyltransferase as the bait. Enzymatic assays with purified components revealed a complex set of interactions between the methyltransferase and calmodulin. Calmodulin weakly stimulated protein carboxylmethyltransferase activityin vitro at concentrations of the two proteins reflecting their representation in mammalian brain. Calmodulin stimulation of methyltransferase was observed in both the presence and absence of calcium, although the effect was greater in the presence of calcium. Native calmodulin was not a substrate for the carboxylmethyltransferase, but deamidated variants of calmodulin act as substrates for the methyltransferase, with calculatedK m values of 3.6 and 8.6 μm for calcium-liganded and unliganded calmodulin, respectively. Both the effector and substrate interactions of calmodulin with the protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase likely contributed to the positive results obtained with the two-hybrid system.

Experimental support for a structural repair function for PCMT has been obtained in purified systems using isoaspartyl peptides as substrates for the PCMT (14McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2595-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. Glass D.B. Aswad D.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The esterified isoaspartyl peptides formed by PCMT hydrolyze into both aspartyl peptides and isoaspartyl peptides, the latter of which can be remethylated by the PCMT. The nearly quantitative conversion of isoaspartyl to aspartyl forms of the peptides has been interpreted as evidence for a repair function, although the process lacks the efficiency characteristic of enzymatic processes, and no isoaspartyl residues are converted into asparaginyl residues, the likely origin of most isoaspartyl sites in cellular proteins (2Aswad D.W. Johnson B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 155-158Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because of the structural complexity of protein substrates for the PCMT, very little information is available regarding the fate of isoaspartyl residues in protein substrates. Deamidation of some proteins, including calmodulin (11Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the bacterial HPr phosphocarrier protein (17Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generates isoaspartyl forms that act as substrates for the PCMT. Methylation of these isomerized calmodulin and HPr variants results in the partial restoration of enzymatic activity, suggesting that PCMT may play a role in functional repair of damaged proteins. In the case of the HPr protein, the increase in enzymatic activity following methylation has been shown to be accompanied by the conversion of the affected isoaspartyl residues to aspartyl residues but not to the original asparaginyl residues (17Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that PCMT-catalyzed methylation is insufficient in itself to effect full structural or functional repair of substrate molecules, raising the possibility that additional cellular components could interact with PCMT in a protein repair pathway in vivo. Due to the chemical instability of protein methyl esters generated by PCMT, it has not been possible to follow the fate of modified proteins subsequent to their methylation in vivo or to identify additional cellular activities that participate in potential processing/repair pathways. Because of these limitations, we sought an alternative approach to further elucidate the role of PCMT in the cellular processing of altered proteins. In an effort to identify proteins that interact with PCMT, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. A brain library was chosen for these studies because of the high concentration of the PCMT in brain (18Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and because of the severe neurological defects observed in mice lacking the PCMT (19Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system is a highly sensitive method for detecting protein-protein interactions that has been successfully used to detect weak interactions undetectable by other physical methods such as immunoprecipitation (20Aelst L.V. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6213-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar,21Li B. Fields S. FASEB J. 1997; 7: 957-963Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We describe here the isolation of two cDNAs, both encoding full-length CaM, that specifically interact with human PCMT. The significance of the interaction has been confirmed by enzymatic measurements of the CaM dependence of carboxyl methylation reactions. The stimulation of PCMT activity by CaM is distinct from the substrate activity of deamidated CaM, highlighting the complexity of PCMT-CaM interactions. The value of the yeast two-hybrid system for identifying weak interactions and the physiological significance of the PCMT-CaM interactions are discussed. Molecular manipulations were conducted according to standard protocols (22Ausembel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) encoding the acidic isozyme of human PCMT (hPCMT) was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Clarke (Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at Los Angeles, CA). The parent shuttle vectors for the yeast two-hybrid analysis, the human fetal brain cDNA library, and the nonspecific bait constructs were kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Roger Brent (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) (25Golemis E. Brent R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The bait construct consists of a polymerase chain reaction-generated EcoRI/SalI fragment of hPCMT cDNA ligated into theEcoRI/SalI sites of the 2 μm HIS 3 plasmid pEG202 (26Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein consists of the DNA binding domain of LexA fused to hPCMT under the control of the constitutive promoter ADH1. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing using standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The library was constructed using the 2 μm TRP1 pJG4–5 plasmid (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), in which cDNA sequences are fused to the B42 “acid patch” activation domain (28Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and expression of the fusion proteins is controlled by the inducible GAL1 promoter. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATα, ura3, trp1, his3, lexAop-LEU2) was used for all two-hybrid analyses (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). EGY48 contains six LexA binding sites replacing the upstream activating sequence of the LEU2 gene. EGY48 was sequentially transformed with the pSH18–34 lacZ reporter and pEG202-hPCMT bait plasmids to generate a Leu− selection strain for library screening. Therefore, growth on leucine-deficient media serves as an indication of an interaction between the LexA-PCMT bait protein and a B42 fusion prey protein, and this interaction can be confirmed using the lacZ reporter gene. E. coliSURE-2 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for plasmid manipulation in bacteria. Yeast interaction trap selections (Fig. 1) were performed essentially as described (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 29Finlay R. Brent R. Glover D. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning—Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1996: 169-203Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were generated using a modified lithium acetate transformation protocol (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar) and grown at 30 °C using the appropriate synthetic media (29Finlay R. Brent R. Glover D. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning—Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1996: 169-203Google Scholar). Yeast EGY48 cells already harboring the pEG202-hPCMT plasmid and a pSH18–34 lacZ reporter plasmid were transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library. The transformation mix was plated on synthetic complete medium containing glucose (2%) and lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan. All tranformants were pooled and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot was grown in synthetic liquid medium containing galactose (2%) and raffinose (1%) and lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan for 4 h to induce expression of the library cDNAs. The transformation efficiency was 105 transformants/μg of library DNA. Approximately 2 × 107 transformants were plated onto synthetic complete medium that included galactose (2%) and raffinose (1%) and lacked uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine to select for colonies that express cDNA-encoded proteins that interact with the PCMT bait protein. After 3 days, colonies were replica-plated to fresh plates of the same medium. After an additional 2 days, colonies were transferred to synthetic medium containing glucose (2%) and lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan to switch off synthesis of activation-tagged cDNA-encoded protein and allow residual galactose-induced mRNA and protein to decline to uninduced (basal) levels. After 2 days, colonies were replica-plated onto four new selection plates to test for galactose-dependent lacZ expression and Leu protrophy. Primary positives were replica plated to fresh plates of the same medium. Secondary positives were identified and collected for further analysis. The cDNA plasmids were rescued and reintroduced into the original selection strain and into four related strains expressing nonspecific LexA fusion proteins to test for the specificity of the interaction. Specific interactors were defined as those interacting with the PCMT-LexA fusion protein but not with Max-, Drosophila Bicoid-, Cdk 1-, and Cdi 1-LexA fusion proteins. Specific interactor cDNAs were identified by DNA sequencing using standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain N4830–1 containing full-length chicken CaM cDNA in plasmid pCaMpL was grown overnight at 30 °C, diluted to an A 600of 0.4–0.5 with prewarmed medium, and the culture was grown at 41 °C for 2 h to induce synthesis of CaM. Purification of rCaM was performed as described previously (31Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deamidated rCaM was prepared by incubating solutions containing ~100 μmrCaM in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA at 37 °C for 2 weeks (11Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control (native CaM) was stored in the same buffer at −70 °C. Electrophoretic analysis of the native and deamidated preparations by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that 78% of the CaM was converted by this procedure to the more slowly migrating electrophoretic variants previously shown to contain isoaspartyl residues at numerous positions in the protein (33Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PCMT assays were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5. The more acidic isozyme of PCMT was purified from calf brain as described by Aswad and Deight (34Aswad D.W. Deight E.A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 1702-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and used in all experiments. Assay mixtures (25 μl) contained final concentrations of 0.44 mm ovalbumin, 22 nmPCMT, 2.5 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) adjusted to a final specific activity of 1 Ci/mmol with nonradioactiveS-adenosyl-l-methionine (Sigma). Protein carboxyl [3H]methyl esters were quantified as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material converted to [3H]methanol by base treatment, as described previously (35Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14050-14056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments in which calcium or EGTA was included, PCMT was preincubated with calcium or EGTA for 30 min on ice. Each assay was done in triplicate and included a negative control lacking substrate, representing the assay background. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins in human brain that could bind to hPCMT (Fig.1). In these experiments, a physical association between hPCMT fused to LexA and a second protein fused to the B42 transcription activation domain was detected by the transcription of two reporter genes, LEU2 andlacZ, that contain upstream LexA binding sites (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 29Finlay R. Brent R. Glover D. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning—Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1996: 169-203Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 107 transformants were screened, and of these, 36 clones showed galactose-dependent Leu protrophy and lacZ expression on X-gal indicator plates following secondary screening. To determine whether the cDNA-encoded proteins specifically interacted with the LexA-hPCMT, library plasmids were rescued from these 36 clones (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar) and used to transform the original selection strain as well as several negative control strains expressing Max-, Drosophila Bicoid-, Cdk 1-, or Cdi 1-LexA fusion proteins as bait. Three clones encoding proteins that specifically interacted with the LexA-hPCMT were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed that two of the clones contained full-length coding sequences for human CaM and that the third clone contained a CpG-rich sequence of human genomic DNA. The remaining 33 clones were judged to have nonspecifically interacted with the hPCMT bait because they also interacted with multiple fusion proteins encoded by the negative control strains. CaM, a ubiquitous and abundant protein in eucaryotic cells, is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes controlled by calcium-dependent signaling pathways (36Wolff D.J. Brostrom C.O. Greengard P. Robison G.A. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. Raven Press, New York1979: 27-85Google Scholar). CaM has been implicated in the calcium-dependent activation of a large number of enzymes (for a review, see Ref. 37James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), including myosin light chain kinase (38Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Guerriero Jr., V. Bagchi I.C. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2542-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (39Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the CaM-dependent kinases (40Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and nitric oxide synthetase (41Schmidt H.H. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Fostermann U. Murad F. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the absence of calcium, CaM also binds to a number of cellular proteins, including the abundant neuroprotein neuromodulin (42Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7544-7549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is associated with neuronal growth and neurite extension, and the 110-kDa myosin from intestinal microvilli (43Conzelman K.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 105: 313-324Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are no previous reports of PCMT activation by CaM, although the distribution of the two proteins in mammalian tissues is similar (18Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Wolff D.J. Brostrom C.O. Greengard P. Robison G.A. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. Raven Press, New York1979: 27-85Google Scholar) and CaM serves as a physiological substrate for PCMT (45Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Brunauer L.S. Clarke S. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 47Runte L.

Calmodulin methylation in intact cells is markedly substoichiometric, however, presumably reflecting the fact that only a subpopulation of cellular CaM molecules would contain isoaspartyl residues that can serve as methyl acceptors. Because deamidated CaM would be expected to represent only a small subpopulation of the CaM molecules overexpressed in yeast cells, we determined whether native CaM could also interact with PCMT by measuring the effect native rCaM on PCMT-catalyzed methylation of ovalbumin (Fig. 2). The concentration of native rCaM used in these experiments was 0.5 μm, a value near its physiological concentration (36Wolff D.J. Brostrom C.O. Greengard P. Robison G.A. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. Raven Press, New York1979: 27-85Google Scholar) and also within the range of expression for library proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system (25Golemis E. Brent R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Under the conditions in our assay, rCaM shows no methyl-accepting activity in either the presence or absence of calcium (data not shown; see also Ref. 50Johnson B.A. Freitag N.E. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10913-10916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, CaM stimulated ovalbumin methylation catalyzed by the PCMT in both the absence and presence of calcium. In the presence of 3 mm EGTA, CaM stimulated PCMT by approximately 19%. A larger stimulation of approximately 42% was observed in the presence of 3 mm calcium. In control experiments without CaM, PCMT activity was unaffected by both the presence and the absence of calcium (data not shown). Together, the results demonstrate a small but reproducible stimulation of PCMT activity by CaM, which is further enhanced in the presence of calcium. To determine the CaM concentration required to achieve maximum stimulation of PCMT activity, the initial velocity of ovalbumin methylation catalyzed by PCMT was determined over a wide concentration range of calcium-liganded CaM (Table I). The concentration of PCMT in assays was held constant at 22 nm. In the presence of 0.1 μm rCaM (representing a 4–5 molar excess over the PCMT), PCMT activity was stimulated by approximately 30% over the value measured in the absence of CaM. Near maximal stimulation was observed at 0.5 μmCaM, rising to a value of approximately 50% at 10 μmrCaM. The affinity of the PCMT for CaM, defined as the concentration of CaM resulting in half-maximal stimulation of PCMT activity, can be estimated from these data to lie within the range of 0.1 to 0.5 μm. These results indicate that CaM stimulates PCMT-catalyzed methylation in a concentration-dependent manner when both proteins are present at physiological concentrations but that significant molar excesses of CaM are required for maximal stimulation of PCMT activity.Table ICalmodulin stimulation of PCMT-catalyzed methylationCaM concentrationInitial velocity1-aThe initial velocity of ovalbumin methylation catalyzed by bovine brain PCMT was measured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of CaM.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Aswad D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in vitro. Therefore, it is expected that most of the CaM expressed in yeast cells is in the native form, but the sensitivity of the two-hybrid system does not seem to preclude detection of PCMT interactions with a minor subpopulation of CaM molecules that could be present in yeast. To evaluate this possibility, kinetic parameters were determined for the methylation of deamidated CaM catalyzed by the PCMT. Deamidated rCaM was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3). Densitometric analysis of the gel indicated that the deamidated CaM variants represented approximately 78% of total protein, similar to results obtained in previous studies (11Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the kinetic data obtained using deamidated rCaM as the substrate for the PCMT in both the presence and absence of calcium. Both calcium-liganded and unliganded CaM serve as substrates for the enzyme, although the unliganded CaM serves as the better substrate of the two forms. Kinetic analysis of the incorporation data using standard Michaelis-Menten assumptions results in calculated K m values of 3.6 and 8.6 μm for unliganded CaM and calcium-liganded CaM, respectively. The maximum velocity of the PCMT with the two forms is also significantly greater with unliganded deamidated CaM as substrate. The calculated V max values are 15,000 and 10,100 pmol methyl esters formed/min-mg of enzyme for the unliganded and calcium-liganded forms of the deamidated CaM, respectively. The specificity constant (V max/K m) calculated from these data is 3.5 higher for the unliganded form than the calcium-liganded form, suggesting that unliganded CaM is the preferred substrate for the enzyme.Figure 4Carboxyl methylation of deamidated CaM catalyzed by the PCMT. Initial rates of methylation using various concentrations of deamidated CaM as substrate were measured in the presence of 3 mm calcium (•) and in the presence of 3 mm EGTA (○) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions were carried out for 15 min, during which the rate of incorporation was constant. Each value represents the mean of triplicate determinations corrected for a background value obtained without substrate. The incorporation curve represents the results of a nonlinear regression of the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Calculated values using calcium-liganded substrate indicate aK m value of 8.6 μm and aV max value of 10,000 methyl groups transferred/min-mg of protein. Values calculated for unliganded CaM include a K m value of 3.6 μm and aV max value of 15,000 methyl groups transferred/min-mg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins from brain that interact with the PCMT in vivo. This approach, which is capable of detecting very weak interactions, has identified CaM as a specific interactor. The significance of the PCMT-CaM interaction was evaluated by measuring CaM activity as both an activator and as a substrate for PCMT in vitro. These results indicate that the interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid system is complex and may represent more than a single kind of interaction between these proteins. Measurements of PCMT activity in the presence and absence of CaM (Fig.2) indicate that CaM weakly stimulates PCMT catalytic activity. Stimulation was observed in both the absence and presence of calcium, although the effect was more pronounced with calcium. The magnitude of the stimulation produced by CaM, however, was much less dramatic than those commonly observed for CaM-dependent activations and is unusual in its very slight calcium selectivity. CaM interacts with most effector proteins in a strongly calcium-dependent manner (36Wolff D.J. Brostrom C.O. Greengard P. Robison G.A. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. Raven Press, New York1979: 27-85Google Scholar, 38Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Guerriero Jr., V. Bagchi I.C. Means A.R. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and with a smaller number in a calcium-independent manner. Calcium-independent interactions have been described for the abundant neuroprotein neuromodulin (42Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7544-7549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 110-kDa myosin from intestinal microvilli (43Conzelman K.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 105: 313-324Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, the calcium-independent interactions of CaM with proteins are characterized by lower affinity interactions, with K d values on the micromolar level, compared with the nanomolar affinities characteristic of calcium-dependent interactions (52Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some calcium-independent interactions can be weakly affected by the presence of calcium. Neuromodulin, for example, binds CaM with an affinity of 0.23 μm in the absence of calcium and with an affinity of 1 μm in the presence of calcium (42Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7544-7549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This affinity of neuromodulin (also known as GAP-43) for CaM is sufficiently strong to allow detection in the yeast two-hybrid system, as recently reported (53Chao S. Benowitz L.I. Krainc D. Irwin N. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). From the data presented in Fig. 2 and Table I, it appears that the interaction of PCMT with CaM is similar to the previously described calcium-independent interactions, although the PCMT sequence does not contain a putative consensus binding site for Ca-independent interactions of CaM (52Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Although the effect of CaM on PCMT catalytic activity is not large, it is most likely physiologically significant. Both CaM and PCMT are widely distributed in eucaryotes and are present in all tissue types of vertebrates (18Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Wolff D.J. Brostrom C.O. Greengard P. Robison G.A. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. Raven Press, New York1979: 27-85Google Scholar). Particularly high concentrations of both proteins are found in brain, including neuron-enriched regions of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The assays used here have been adjusted to reflect the concentrations and molar ratios of the two proteins in brain tissue. The results from these assays suggest that CaM weakly activates PCMT in vivo and that this stimulation is marginally affected by alterations in cellular calcium. This small but reproducible stimulation observed in vitro may underestimate the true significance of the interaction, however, if CaM and PCMT interact as components of larger protein complexes in vivo. These proteins could, for example, be involved in a processing pathway downstream of PCMT for the removal or repair of damaged proteins in the cell. The effector interaction of CaM with PCMT is clearly distinct from the substrate interaction of deamidated CaM with PCMT. Previous experiments have shown that prolonged incubation of purified CaM in the absence of calcium at physiological temperature and pH is accompanied by large increases in its methyl-accepting activity (11Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This methyl-accepting activity has been mapped to multiple isoaspartyl sites in the calcium binding loops and in flexible regions near the N terminus and at positions 78 and/or 80 (33Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 54Ota I.M. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 54-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar sites are methylated in biosynthetically labeled CaM purified from intact erythrocytes (49Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that novel variants produced in vitro reflect naturally occurring variants of CaM. Because the concentration of calcium in cell cytosol is typically in the submicromolar range, most cellular CaM would be expected to be present in the unliganded form that more readily deamidates than calcium-liganded CaM. In vivo, these deamidated forms represent only a small fraction of the total CaM in intact cells, as evidenced by the extremely low stoichiometries of CaM methylation observed in isotopic tracer studies. In Xenopus oocytes, for example, carboxyl methylated CaM represents 0.02% of the total oocyte CaM (45Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, carboxyl methylated CaM is estimated to represent 0.03% of human erythrocyte CaM (46Brunauer L.S. Clarke S. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The large discrepancy between the proportion of methyl-accepting CaM in vivo and in vitro is consistent with the active metabolism of deamidated CaM in living cells. Likewise, we would expect that deamidated CaM variants would represent only a minor fraction of the CaM-fusion proteins overexpressed in yeast cells used for the two-hybrid system. It should be noted, however, that yeast is one of the few cell types in which it has proven difficult to detect PCMT activity (6Kagan R.M. McFadden H.J. McFadden P.N. O'Connor C. Clarke S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117B: 379-385Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and sequences homologous to conserved PCMT regions have not been identified in searches of the yeast genome data base. 2S. Clarke, personal communication. It is not clear whether yeast cells possess an alternative pathway for processing isoaspartyl residues that appear in proteins, which would prevent the accumulation of isoaspartyl-containing proteins. To determine whether the small subpopulation of yeast CaM expected to exist in the deamidated form might contribute to the interaction(s) detected in the two-hybrid system, we have determined the kinetic parameters describing both calcium-liganded and unliganded deamidated CaM as substrates for the PCMT. As shown in Fig. 4, both forms of deamidated CaM can serve as substrates, but the unliganded form has a significantly higher affinity for the PCMT. A similar effect has been observed for a deamidated form of calbindin D9k, an intracellular calcium-binding protein that contains an isoaspartyl residue in one of its two calcium binding sites (56Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19396-19406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of calcium, this protein exhibits a 10-fold increase in affinity for PCMT. These increases in methyl-accepting activity observed with CaM and calbindin upon calcium removal most likely reflect conformational changes in the protein that expose isoaspartyl residues to the PCMT, including isoaspartyl residues that complex to calcium in the calcium binding sites (33Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From the data presented here, it appears that CaM may well interact with the PCMT as both an activator and as a substrate in the yeast two-hybrid system, depending on the distribution of the overexpressed CaM between native and deamidated forms. In the two-hybrid system, most fusion proteins are typically expressed at levels within the range of 50 nm to 1 μm, and the cDNA-encoded proteins are present at nuclear concentrations of approximately 1 μm (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 29Finlay R. Brent R. Glover D. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning—Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1996: 169-203Google Scholar). Given the likelihood that deamidated variants represent only a small fraction of CaM-fusion proteins produced in yeast cells and the higher affinity of PCMT for native (Table I) than for deamidated (Fig. 4) CaM, it is probable that the stimulatory interactions of native CaM with PCMT are principally responsible for our positive results with the two-hybrid system. At the high expression levels achieved in yeast cells, however, substrate interactions of deamidated CaM and PCMT could also contribute to the results, confirming CaM as a significant physiological methyl-acceptor (45Desrosiers R.R.
