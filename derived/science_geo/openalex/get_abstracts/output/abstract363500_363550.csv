https://openalex.org/W1999110283,"Visual working memory provides an essential link between perception and higher cognitive functions, allowing for the active maintenance of information about stimuli no longer in view. Research suggests that sustained activity in higher-order prefrontal, parietal, inferotemporal and lateral occipital areas supports visual maintenance, and may account for the limited capacity of working memory to hold up to 3-4 items. Because higher-order areas lack the visual selectivity of early sensory areas, it has remained unclear how observers can remember specific visual features, such as the precise orientation of a grating, with minimal decay in performance over delays of many seconds. One proposal is that sensory areas serve to maintain fine-tuned feature information, but early visual areas show little to no sustained activity over prolonged delays. Here we show that orientations held in working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in the human visual cortex, even when overall levels of activity are low. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification methods, we found that activity patterns in visual areas V1-V4 could predict which of two oriented gratings was held in memory with mean accuracy levels upwards of 80%, even in participants whose activity fell to baseline levels after a prolonged delay. These orientation-selective activity patterns were sustained throughout the delay period, evident in individual visual areas, and similar to the responses evoked by unattended, task-irrelevant gratings. Our results demonstrate that early visual areas can retain specific information about visual features held in working memory, over periods of many seconds when no physical stimulus is present."
https://openalex.org/W2045855955,"Naturally occurring axonal pruning and neuronal cell death help to sculpt neuronal connections during development, but their mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Here we report that β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21) activate a widespread caspase-dependent self-destruction program. DR6 is broadly expressed by developing neurons, and is required for normal cell body death and axonal pruning both in vivo and after trophic-factor deprivation in vitro. Unlike neuronal cell body apoptosis, which requires caspase 3, we show that axonal degeneration requires caspase 6, which is activated in a punctate pattern that parallels the pattern of axonal fragmentation. DR6 is activated locally by an inactive surface ligand(s) that is released in an active form after trophic-factor deprivation, and we identify APP as a DR6 ligand. Trophic-factor deprivation triggers the shedding of surface APP in a β-secretase (BACE)-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function studies support a model in which a cleaved amino-terminal fragment of APP (N-APP) binds DR6 and triggers degeneration. Genetic support is provided by a common neuromuscular junction phenotype in mutant mice. Our results indicate that APP and DR6 are components of a neuronal self-destruction pathway, and suggest that an extracellular fragment of APP, acting via DR6 and caspase 6, contributes to Alzheimer’s disease. During embryonic development, nerve cells are made in excess numbers, and many of these neurons and their long extensions (axons) are then culled in a phase of natural degeneration. Nikolaev et al. now identify the apoptosis-inducing protein DR6 (death receptor 6) as a regulator of this process, acting by binding to APP (β-amyloid precursor protein), a transmembrane protein of unknown function that has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease through human genetics. Unlike classical neuronal apoptosis, which requires caspase 3, DR6/APP-induced degeneration requires caspase 6 activation. This work suggests that an extracellular fragment of APP, acting via DR6 and caspase 6, may contribute to neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2127157242,"The complement system is an essential component of the innate and acquired immune system, and consists of a series of proteolytic cascades that are initiated by the presence of microorganisms. In health, activation of complement is precisely controlled through membrane-bound and soluble plasma-regulatory proteins including complement factor H (fH; ref. 2), a 155 kDa protein composed of 20 domains (termed complement control protein repeats). Many pathogens have evolved the ability to avoid immune-killing by recruiting host complement regulators and several pathogens have adapted to avoid complement-mediated killing by sequestering fH to their surface. Here we present the structure of a complement regulator in complex with its pathogen surface-protein ligand. This reveals how the important human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis subverts immune responses by mimicking the host, using protein instead of charged-carbohydrate chemistry to recruit the host complement regulator, fH. The structure also indicates the molecular basis of the host-specificity of the interaction between fH and the meningococcus, and informs attempts to develop novel therapeutics and vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W2089560257,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most versatile experimental methods in chemistry, physics and biology, providing insight into the structure and dynamics of matter at the molecular scale. Its imaging variant-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-is widely used to examine the anatomy, physiology and metabolism of the human body. NMR signal detection is traditionally based on Faraday induction in one or multiple radio-frequency resonators that are brought into close proximity with the sample. Alternative principles involving structured-material flux guides, superconducting quantum interference devices, atomic magnetometers, Hall probes or magnetoresistive elements have been explored. However, a common feature of all NMR implementations until now is that they rely on close coupling between the detector and the object under investigation. Here we show that NMR can also be excited and detected by long-range interaction, relying on travelling radio-frequency waves sent and received by an antenna. One benefit of this approach is more uniform coverage of samples that are larger than the wavelength of the NMR signal-an important current issue in MRI of humans at very high magnetic fields. By allowing a significant distance between the probe and the sample, travelling-wave interaction also introduces new possibilities in the design of NMR experiments and systems."
https://openalex.org/W2007639643,"With the discovery of STIM1 and Orai1 and gating of both TRPC and Orai1 channels by STIM1, a central question is the role of each of the channels in the native store-operated Ca(2+) influx (SOCs). Here, we used a strategy of knockdown of Orai1 and of TRPC1 alone and in combination and rescue by small interfering RNA-protected mutants (sm) of smOrai1 and smTRPC1 to demonstrate that in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, rescue of SOCs required co-transfection of low levels of both smOrai1 and smTRPC1. The pore mutant Orai1(E106Q) failed to rescue the SOCs in the presence or absence of TRPC1 and, surprisingly, the pore mutant TRPC1(F562A) failed to rescue the SOCs in the presence or absence of Orai1. TRPC1 is gated by electrostatic interaction between TRPC1(D639D,D640D) with STIM1(K684K, K685K). Strikingly, the channel-dead TRPC1(D639K,D640K) that can be rescued only by the STIM1(K684E,K685E) mutant could restore SOCs only when expressed with Orai1 and STIM1(K684E,K685E). Accordingly, we found a mutual requirement of Orai1 and TRPC1 for their interaction with the native STIM1 in HEK cells. By contrast, SOC and the CRAC current in Jurkat cells were inhibited by knockdown of Orai1 but were not influenced by knockdown on TRPC1 or TRPC3. These findings define the molecular makeup of the native SOCs in HEK cells and the role of a STIM1-Orai1-TRPC1 complex in SOC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2080242404,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily ligands control a diverse set of cellular processes by activating type I and type II serine-threonine receptor kinases. Canonical TGFβ signaling is mediated via the TβRI/ALK5 type I receptor that phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 in their SXS motif to facilitate their activation and subsequent role in transcriptional regulation. Canonical bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling is mediated via the ALK1/2/3/6 type I receptors that phosphorylate Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 in their SXS motif. However, studies in endothelial cells have shown that TGFβ can also lead to the phosphorylation of Smad1, dependent on ALK1 receptor activity. Here we present data showing that TGFβ can significantly induce Smad1 phosphorylation in several non-endothelial cell lineages. Additionally, by using chemical inhibitors specific for the TGFβ/activin/nodal (ALK4/5/7) and BMP (ALK1/2/3/6) type I receptors, we show that in some cell types TGFβ induces Smad1 phosphorylation independently of the BMP type I receptors. Thus, TGFβ-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation appears to occur via different receptor complexes in a cell type-specific manner.

The heteromeric receptor complex usually comprises two type II receptors and two type I receptors, and the receptors are classified based on their structural and functional properties. Type II receptors are constitutively active, and they phosphorylate type I receptors on serine/threonine residues in the GS domain in response to ligand binding. Activated type I receptors then phosphorylate specific downstream receptor-activated Smad (R-Smads) proteins in their distal C-terminal SXS motif, activating them to transduce the signal to the nucleus (1Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 2Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). There are five mammalian type II receptors: TβRII, ActR-II, ActR-IIB, BMPR-II, AMHR-II, and seven type I receptors, which are referred to as activin receptor-like kinases (ALK) 1–7 (1Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 3Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Of the ALKs, ALK5 is thought to be specific for TGFβ ligands, and ALK4 and ALK7 are thought to mediate signaling via nodal and activins (2Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In canonical signaling, the activated ALK4/ALK5/ALK7 phosphorylate downstream R-Smads 2 and 3. The remaining ALKs, ALK1/2/3/6, phosphorylate R-Smads 1, 5, and 8 following specific activation by bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) (2Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Once activated, R-Smads undergo heterooligomeric complex formation with Smad4, named the common Smad due to its role in all branches of TGFβ superfamily signaling, and this complex accumulates in the nucleus to regulate gene transcription in conjunction with a variety of transcriptional cofactors (1Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 2Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The specificity of different ALKs for different Smad proteins is based on the L45 loop and phosphorylated GS motif in the specific type I receptor, and the L3 loop in the MH2 domain of the relevant R-Smad (4Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massague J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The L45 loops of ALK4/5/7 that phosphorylate Smad2/3 are completely conserved, but they differ by four amino acids from the L45 sequences in ALK3 and ALK6, and by seven amino acids from the L45 loops of ALK1 and ALK2 (4Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Feng X.-H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The L45 loop of the ALK interacts directly with the L3 loop in the MH2 domain of the relevant R-Smad (4Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massague J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that TGFβ induces Smad2/3 phosphorylation, several studies have shown that TGFβ can also induce Smad1/5 phosphorylation in endothelial cells (7Goumans M.J.

Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The current model proposes that the type I receptor ALK1 is necessary for this phosphorylation event, in addition to ALK5 activity and the TGFβ transmembrane accessory receptor Endoglin (7Goumans M.J.

Similarly, in dermal fibroblasts TGFβ can induce Smad1 phosphorylation dependent on both ALK5 and ALK1 activity, although this also appears to require activation of the ERK1/2 pathway for a sustained response (10Pannu J. Nakerakanti S. Smith E. ten Dijke P. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10405-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that TGFβ can also stimulate Smad1/5 phosphorylation in HaCaT keratinocytes dependent on ALK5 activity, and this is also thought to depend on a canonical activator of Smad1, most likely ALK2 (11Bharathy S. Xie W. Yingling J.M. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, although there have been several reports that TGFβ can induce Smad1 phosphorylation, revealing cross-talk between the TGFβ ligand and the BMP R-Smads, this phosphorylation event is largely thought to be dependent on the activity of a BMP type I receptor. During our studies we observed TGFβ-induced Smad1 in several cell lines for which this has previously not been reported, including C2C12 mouse mesenchymal stem cells and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Significantly, we found that in these cell lines TGFβ leads to Smad1 phosphorylation independently of ALK1/2/3/6, exclusively relying on the ALK4/5/7 subset as a type I receptor. This is in line with a study published while our manuscript was in revision, which revealed ALK5-mediated TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in mammary epithelial cells (12Liu I.M. Schilling S.H. Knouse K.A. Choy L. Derynck R. Wang X.F. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our data provide firm evidence that TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation can occur independently of involvement of one of its canonical BMP type I receptors. Cell Culture and Treatment-C2C12 mouse mesenchymal cells, HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells, and COS monkey kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Wild-type and Smad3 null mouse embryo fibroblast cells (13Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) were cultured in minimal essential medium, 15% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and human HaCaT keratinocyte cells were cultured in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. The ALK4/5/7-specific inhibitor SB431542 (Calbiochem) (14Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) was dissolved as a 1 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. The ALK2/3/6-specific inhibitor dorsomorphin (DM) was described previously (15Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were simultaneously treated with ligand (TGFβ or BMP) and 5 μm SB431542 or 5 μm DM for 1.5 h prior to harvest. Treatments were carried out in reduced serum media (0.2% fetal bovine serum) with TGFβ1 (R&D Systems) added to a final concentration of 2 ng/ml, and BMP2 (R&D Systems) to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml, unless otherwise specified. Expression Plasmids and Transfection-FLAG-Smads and His-tagged constitutively active ALK5 (caALK5; also called TβRI(T202D) for rat) have been previously described (16Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). HA-tagged caALK5 was generated by subcloning His-caALK5. HA-tagged constitutively active ALK1 (HA-caALK1) was a gift from Dr. Peter ten Dijke. HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), HepG2 cells using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), and C2C12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). C2C12 cells were also nucleofected using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector™ as described below. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation-For direct Western blotting of whole cell lysates, cells were harvested in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation for the detection of exogenous Smad phosphorylation, and caALK5-Smad interactions, was performed essentially as described previously (17Wrighton K.H. Willis D. Long J. Liu F. Lin X. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38365-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using anti-Smad and anti-phospho-Smad antibodies. Specifically, total Smad levels were assessed by using anti-Smad1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-Smad2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or anti-Smad5 (Santa-Cruz) antibodies. Smad SXS motif phosphorylation was assessed by using anti-P-Smad1 (Cell Signaling), anti-P-Smad2 (Cell Signaling) antibodies, or anti-P-Smad3 sera (a kind gift from Dr. Ed Leof, Mayo Clinic). Epitope-tagged proteins were detected using anti-HA (Mouse 1.1; Babco), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-His (Serotec), and anti-GST antibodies (Babco). Equal protein loading was confirmed where appropriate using anti-β-actin (Sigma). RNA Interference-Nucleofection was used to examine the effect of siRNA-mediated Smad1 knockdown on TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1. C2C12 cells were nucleofected with siControl or siSmad1 (RNA: CCG GAA GGG ACU ACC UCA UGU GAU U) (Invitrogen; Stealth™ siRNA) using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector™ with solution V and program B-032 (Amaxa Inc.). After 48 h, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of TGFβ or BMP for 1 h prior to harvest for Western blotting. Transcription Reporter Assays-To assess the effect of Smad1 knockdown on TGFβ-induced transcription, C2C12 cells were nucleofected with siControl or siSmad1 as described above. After 24 h cells were transfected with the reporter 3TP-lux, which contains TGFβ-responsive elements of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and collagenase promoters (18Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Following a further 24-h incubation, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of TGFβ for 9.5 h prior to harvest for luciferase assay, as previously described (17Wrighton K.H. Willis D. Long J. Liu F. Lin X. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38365-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and Western blotting. To assess the ability of DM to inhibit ALK1 kinase activity, COS cells grown to 50% confluence were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding an Id1 promoter luciferase reporter (kindly provided by Dr. Peter ten Dijke, Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands) (19Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and the constitutively active form of BMP type I receptor ALK1 (caALK1), using FuGENE HD (Roche). Transfection with pRL-TK Renilla luciferase (Promega) was used to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated with DM (0–8 μm) or vehicle starting 1 h after transfection. Cell extracts were harvested after 24 h, and relative promoter activity quantitated by the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). In Vitro Kinase Assays-Assays were performed largely as previously described (12Liu I.M. Schilling S.H. Knouse K.A. Choy L. Derynck R. Wang X.F. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In brief, His-caALK5 was immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cells after lysis in FLAG lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride and Na3VO4)). His-caALK5 bound protein-A beads were washed three times in wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and twice in kinase buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.1 mm calcium chloride). Precipitated His-caALK was subsequently incubated for 45 min at ambient temperature with GST-Smad1 or GST-Smad3 (a gift from Dr. Xiao-Fan Wang, Duke University), in kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP. Products were analyzed by Western blotting. TGFβ Stimulates Smad1 Phosphorylation in a Variety of Cell Lines-During routine studies in our laboratory, we observed that TGFβ may induce Smad1 phosphorylation in various cell types, in-line with several previous reports that it can do so in endothelial cells (7Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Lebrin F. Larsson J. Mummery C. Karlsson S. ten Dijke P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 8Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), dermal fibroblasts (10Pannu J. Nakerakanti S. Smith E. ten Dijke P. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10405-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and HaCaT keratinocytes (11Bharathy S. Xie W. Yingling J.M. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In an effort to examine this in more detail, we treated several cell lines in the presence or absence of TGFβ for 1 h, in parallel with BMP as a control for Smad1 phosphorylation, and harvested cells for Western blot analysis of total Smad and phospho-Smad proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, we detected a protein species migrating at the size of phospho-Smad1 in response to both TGFβ and BMP treatment in C2C12 (Fig. 1A), HepG2 (Fig. 1B), and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (Fig. 1C). This band was detected using an anti-phospho-Smad1 antibody, as well as an anti-phospho-Smad3 sera, which can recognize both phospho-Smad3 and phospho-Smad1. These data suggest that TGFβ might induce Smad1 phosphorylation, as well as the anticipated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, in the cell lines tested. TGFβ-induced Smad1 Phosphorylation Is Time-dependent-We next examined the kinetics of TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation as compared with those of TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation. C2C12 cells were treated with TGFβ over a time course of up to 180 min, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Smad3 phosphorylation was observed after just 15 min of TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 2A, lane 2), with the level increasing until around the 105-min time point. The TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation level began to decline at around 120 min (Fig. 2A, lane 9), although a significant amount remained for the duration of the time course. In contrast, TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was not detected until 45 min post-treatment (Fig. 2A, lane 4), and no significant level was detected after the 75-min time point (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Thus, TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation is transient and first occurs at a later time than TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, which is sustained over the treatment time course. BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells occurred earlier than TGFβ-induced Smad1, after just 15 min stimulation (Fig. 2B, lane 2), and was also more sustained only decreasing to a low level after around 120 min (Fig. 2B, lane 9). We observed a similar response in MEFs where TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was only apparent between 30 and 75 min post-TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 2C), as compared with TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, which remained robust from 15 to 180 min (Fig. 2C). BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation peaked at just 15 min BMP treatment in MEFs, remaining fairly high for the duration of the time course (Fig. 2D). Thus in C2C12 cells and MEFs, TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation peaks at a later time than both TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, and is apparently more transient in nature. We next assessed the concentration of TGFβ required to stimulate Smad1 and Smad3 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. Smad3 phosphorylation was induced by 0.25 ng/ml TGFβ, with levels reaching their maximum at 0.5 ng/ml (Fig. 3). However, significant Smad1 phosphorylation was not observed until treatment with 0.5 ng/ml TGFβ, with levels reaching their maximum at 1 ng/ml (Fig. 3). Thus, TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation requires a higher concentration of TGFβ than TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. Taken together these kinetic data suggest that, due to the different timing, duration length, and minimal TGFβ concentration required for TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, it may play a distinct role in TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad2/3 and BMP-induced phospho-Smad1 in cells. Genetic Depletion of Smads Confirms Smad1 Is Phosphorylated in Response to TGFβ-We next sought to confirm that the suspected phospho-Smad1 band detected by anti-phospho-Smad3 and anti-phospho-Smad1 antibodies in response to TGFβ does indeed correspond to phospho-Smad1. As this protein species can be detected by the anti-phospho-Smad3 antibody, we first utilized Smad3-null MEFs (13Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) to rule out that this protein corresponds to a modified version of Smad3. Wild-type and Smad3-null MEFs were cultured in the presence or absence of TGFβ or BMP for 1 h prior to harvest for Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, TGFβ induced Smad3 phosphorylation, Smad2 phosphorylation, and the suspected Smad1 phosphorylation in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4, lane 2), as we previously observed for this cell line. Although no TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation was observed in Smad3-null MEFs, in line with the complete loss of total Smad3 protein, Smad2 phosphorylation and the proposed TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1 protein species remained robust in response to TGFβ treatment (Fig. 4, lane 5). These data completely rule out that the additional phospho-species detected in response to TGFβ simply corresponds to a modification of Smad3, further suggesting that this protein species is phospho-Smad1. We next sought to determine whether the TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1 band is eliminated in cells depleted of total Smad1 protein. To do this, we nucleofected C2C12 cells with siRNA against Smad1, and cultured cells in the absence or presence of TGFβ or BMP for 1 h prior to harvest for Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, TGFβ treatment was able to induce phospho-Smad2, phospho-Smad3, and phospho-Smad1 in siControl nucleofected cells (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Expression of siSmad1 resulted in a reduction in Smad1 protein expression by almost 100%. Importantly, although phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3 were still detected in siSmad1-expressing cells in response to TGFβ, the additional phospho-species we have routinely observed is lost in C2C12 cells depleted of Smad1 protein (Fig. 5A, lane 5). Furthermore, BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation is also significantly reduced in cells expressing siSmad1 (Fig. 5A, lane 6). These data confirm that TGFβ induces Smad1 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells, as detected by both our anti-phospho-Smad1 and anti-phospho-Smad3 antibodies, and suggest that these antibodies are most likely detecting TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in the other cell lines we have tested. We wondered what effect Smad1 depletion would have on TGFβ-induced transcription. To assess this, C2C12 cells were nucleofected with siRNA against Smad1, or siControl, and cultured for 24 h prior to transfection with the TGFβ-responsive 3TP-lux luciferase reporter, which is widely used to assess TGFβ signaling requirements (18Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cell lysates confirmed efficient depletion of Smad1 (∼90%) and a corresponding loss of Smad1 phosphorylation in response to TGFβ (Fig. 5B). Treatment of siControl cells with TGFβ resulted in a high degree of TGFβ-induced transcription, as expected (Fig. 5B). Significantly, depletion of Smad1 reduced the level of TGFβ-induced transcription by ∼2.5-fold as compared with siControl cells. This suggests that, at least in C2C12 cells, Smad1 may be involved in TGFβ-induced transcription in addition to the anticipated Smad2/3 proteins. TGFβ-induced Smad1 Phosphorylation Is Independent of BMP Type I Receptors in Some Cell Lines-Previous reports of TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts suggest a model where both the BMP type I receptor ALK1, and the TGFβ type I receptor ALK5, are required for this phenomenon (7Goumans M.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10405-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In HaCaT cells it is proposed that ALK5, and most likely the BMP type I receptor ALK2, are required for TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (11Bharathy S. Xie W. Yingling J.M. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To help determine the ALK requirements of TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in the cell lines under our investigation, we planned to take advantage of the established and specific ALK inhibitors SB431542 (against ALK4/5/7) (14Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) and DM (against ALK2/3/6) (15Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). However, as ALK1 is a key candidate for involvement in TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, and the ability of DM to inhibit ALK1 is unclear, 3P. Yu, unpublished data. we first sought to determine whether DM could also inhibit ALK1 kinase activity. We tested the ability of 5 and 10 μm DM to block Smad1 phosphorylation induced by caALK1. C2C12 cells were transfected with caALK1 and cultured in the presence or absence of DM for 1.5 h prior to harvest. As shown in Fig. 6A, caALK1-induced endogenous Smad1 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells (lane 2). This likely reflects caALK1 activity as no TGFβ or BMP was added to stimulate the activity of additional receptors. Significantly, caALK1-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was completely abolished in cells treated with just 5 μm DM (Fig. 6A, lane 3), suggesting DM can inhibit ALK1 activity in C2C12 cells. We performed a similar experiment in HepG2 cells co-transfected with caALK1 and Smad1. The caALK1 was able to induce phosphorylation of exogenous Smad1 (Fig. 6B, lane 2) and this was also inhibited by culture of cells in 5 μm DM (Fig. 6B, lane 3), further suggesting DM can effectively inhibit ALK1 kinase activity. We also found DM could inhibit caALK1-induced endogenous Smad1 phosphorylation in HEK293T cells (Fig. 6C, lane 3). We next assessed the ability of caALK1 to induce transcription from BRE-luc, an Id1 promoter luciferase reporter gene dependent on BMP R-Smad activation, in the presence of increasing concentrations of DM. As shown in Fig. 6D, transcriptional activity was increased ∼2.7-fold over baseline on transfection with HA-caALK1, and culture in just 2 μm DM reduced caALK1-induced BRE-luc activity by ∼80% (Fig. 6D). Together the data in Fig. 6 suggest 5 μm DM is more than capable of inhibiting ALK1 receptor activity, as well as the anticipated ALK2/3/6 receptor activity (15Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), in certain cell lines. Next, to assess the involvement of different ALKs in TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in the cell lines under our investigation, we cultured cells for 1.5 h in the presence of TGFβ or BMP in combination with the established and specific ALK inhibitor SB431542 (against ALK4/5/7) (14Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) or DM, which we propose can inhibit ALK1/2/3/6 in certain cell lines (15Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). We first assessed C2C12 cells and found that TGFβ induced Smad3 and Smad1 phosphorylation at fairly similar levels (Fig. 7A, lane 2), as we have consistently been able to observe. Furthermore, inhibition of ALK4/5/7 using SB431542 resulted in a complete loss of TGFβ-induced Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A, lane 3), suggesting that these TGFβ-induced phosphorylation events are dependent on ALK4/5/7 kinase activity. However, in contrast, co-culture with SB431542 treatment had no effect on BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, confirming that there is no dependence on ALK4/5/7 activity for this event (Fig. 7A, lane 6). Most significantly, inhibition of ALK1/2/3/6 by DM did not alter the traditional TGFβ-induced Smad2 or Smad3 phosphorylation, or the TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A, lane 4), suggesting that all three of these TGFβ-induced phosphorylation events are independent of BMP type I receptor ALKs. The same DM treatment, however, was able to fully abolish BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 7A, compare lanes 4 and 7), demonstrating that DM is fully active at the concentration and treatment times used in this experiment. These data suggest that BMP type I receptors may not be needed for TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in all cell lines. To investigate if this phenomenon is specific to C2C12 cells, or also holds true for other cells, we performed a similar experiment using the specific ALK inhibitors with three other cell lines. We observed that SB431542 also abolished TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7B, lane 3) as effectively as it abolished Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. However, as for C2C12 cells, DM did not abolish TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B, lane 4), although it was fully able to abolish BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B, lanes 7). In MEFs, SB431542 could completely abolish TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7C, lane 3). DM was able to partially reduce TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, although it had no effect on TGFβ-induced Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7C, lane 4). Again, in these cells DM was able to abolish BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7C, lane 7). Interestingly, in HaCaT keratinocytes both SB431542 and DM were able to completely abolish TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7D, lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that ALK1/2/3/6 may play a role in TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in MEFs and HaCaT cells. ALK5 Can Phosphorylate Smad1-As ALK5 is thought to be specific for Smad2/3 phosphorylation, we investigated whether ALK5 could also initiate Smad1 phosphorylation. HEK293T cells were transfected with caALK5 and FLAG-Smad1 and FLAG-Smad3, and Smad SXS phosphorylation was assessed following immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Smad proteins. We observed phosphorylation of Smad1 (lane 2) and the positive control Smad3 (lane 4) in the presence of caALK5 (Fig. 8A). These phosphorylation events should be a direct reflection of caALK5 activity as no TGFβ or BMP was added to stimulate the activity of additional receptors. Thus, this suggests ALK5 may have the intrinsic ability to phosphorylate Smad1 in addition to the anticipated Smad2 and Smad3 in vivo. We also assessed the ability of caALK5 to initiate phosphorylation of recombinant GST-Smad1 in an in vitro kinase assay. His-caALK5 was precipitated from HEK293T cells, and incubated with GST-Smad1 or GST-Smad3 in the presence of ATP. Western blot analysis of assay products revealed strong phosphorylation of both GST-Smad1 and GST-Smad3 on incubation with caALK5 (Fig. 8B, lanes 2 and 4). To further confirm that the in vitro phosphorylation observed was due to His-caALK5 kinase activity, and not an additional factor in the His-immunoprecipitation product, we performed a similar assay in the presence or absence of the ALK4/5/7 kinase inhibitor SB431542. Precipitated His-caALK5 was again able to initiate phosphorylation of both GST-Smad1 and GST-Smad3 (Fig. 8C, lanes 1 and 3). However, phosphorylation was completely abolished in the presence of SB431542 (Fig. 8C, lanes 2 and 4). Taken together, the data in Fig. 8 provide firm evidence that ALK5 is able to phosphorylate Smad1, in addition to the anticipated Smad3. Finally, if ALK5 can directly phosphorylate Smad1, we predicted that these proteins would interact. To test this hypothesis, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with HA-caALK5 and FLAG-Smad1 or FLAG-Smad3, and lysates subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation. The positive control FLAG-Smad3 was able to co-precipitate HA-caALK5, in line with its role as a canonical ALK5 phosphorylation target (Fig. 8D, lane 5). Importantly, FLAG-Smad1 was also able to co-precipitate HA-caALK5 (Fig. 8D, lane 3), suggesting these proteins indeed interact and providing further evidence that Smad1 may also be an ALK5 phosphorylation target. In short, our data suggest that TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation does not always require a functional BMP type I receptor, although ALK1/2/3/6 activity is clearly necessary for this phenomenon to occur in some cell lines. Thus, the mechanism of TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation may be largely cell line specific. The receptors for TGFβ superfamily ligands and the specific Smads downstream of these have been identified and well characterized, and a canonical scheme for signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus in response to the various ligands has been established. However, unexpected signaling outcomes, or even opposing biological outcomes to TGFβ signaling pathways in the same cells, suggest that the signaling model is not quite as simple as first thought. For example, in addition to the canonical TβRII/ALK5-mediated Smad2/3 phosphorylation, TβRII can form a complex with ALK1 in endothelial cells, dependent on ALK5 kinase activity and Endoglin, to result in Smad1/5 phosphorylation in response to TGFβ (7Goumans M.J.

Valdimarsdottir G. Thorikay M. Mummery C. Arthur H.M. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4018-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In this case, activation of canonical TGFβ signaling inhibits proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, whereas TGFβ-mediated Smad1/5 phosphorylation stimulates proliferation and migration (7Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Lebrin F. Larsson J. Mummery C. Karlsson S. ten Dijke P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). It has even been proposed that ALK1 activation in response to TGFβ signaling may inhibit ALK5/Smad signaling (7Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Lebrin F. Larsson J. Mummery C. Karlsson S. ten Dijke P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), perhaps as an indirect effect of high Endoglin levels that favor TGFβ/ALK1 signaling and not TGFβ/ALK5 signaling (9Lebrin F. Goumans M.J. Jonker L. Carvalho R.L. Valdimarsdottir G. Thorikay M. Mummery C. Arthur H.M. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4018-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation has also been observed in HaCaT keratinocytes (11Bharathy S. Xie W. Yingling J.M. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In keeping with the endothelial cell model, this signaling is thought to require a BMP type I receptor, in addition to ALK5 kinase activity, with ALK2 being the most likely candidate because HaCaT cells were found not to express ALK1 (11Bharathy S. Xie W. Yingling J.M. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was in preparation, it was also shown that TGFβ can induce Smad1 phosphorylation in a number of epithelial cells and fibroblasts via ALK5 and ALK2 and/or ALK3 (20Daly A.C. Randall R.A. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6889-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which again suggests a dependence on a BMP type I receptor for TGFβ ligand to BMP-Smad cross-activation. We have identified TGFβ-induced Smad1 in different cell lines to those tested by any of these groups. Additionally, our data suggest that TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation can occur independently of BMP type I receptors in some cell lines (Fig. 7). Specifically, culture of cells in the presence of the ALK inhibitor DM, which we show can inhibit ALK1 kinase activity (Fig. 6) in addition to its published ability to inhibit ALK2/3/6, was unable to reduce the level of TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in C2C12 and HepG2 cells. However, this was completely abolished by the ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 (Figs. 7, A and B, and 9). This differs to data obtained in the study by Daly et al. (20Daly A.C. Randall R.A. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6889-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), where both SB431542 and DM could abolish TGFβ-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation in EpH4 mouse mammary gland epithelial cells. Importantly, DM was able to inhibit BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in HepG2 and C2C12 cells (Fig. 7, A and B), as well as TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in HaCaT cells (Fig. 7D) in agreement with the idea that HaCaT cells rely on ALK2/3/6 for this phenomenon (11Bharathy S. Xie W. Yingling J.M. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Daly A.C. Randall R.A. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6889-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, DM was active and fully capable of inhibiting ALK1/2/3/6 under the conditions employed in our study. While our manuscript was under revision, Liu et al. (12Liu I.M. Schilling S.H. Knouse K.A. Choy L. Derynck R. Wang X.F. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) reported that TGFβ could induce Smad1 phosphorylation in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line 4T1. This phosphorylation event was strictly dependent on ALK5 kinase activity, and the authors rule out involvement of BMP receptors using short hairpin RNA. Our data resulting from the use of ALK inhibitors in Fig. 7 further support the idea that TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation is independent of BMP receptors in some cells. Critically, ALK5-mediated direct phosphorylation of Smad1 was demonstrated by in vitro kinase assays in both studies (Fig. 8) (12Liu I.M. Schilling S.H. Knouse K.A. Choy L. Derynck R. Wang X.F. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is intriguing as to how ALK4/5/7, presumably specifically ALK5 as this is thought to be responsible for TGFβ-induced signaling, may lead to the phosphorylation of Smad1 independently of BMP-specific type I receptors. Specificity of type I receptors for the canonical Smad is usually based on their L45 loop and phosphorylated GS motif, and on the L3 loop in the MH2 domain of the partner Smad (4Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massague J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Feng X.-H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that ALK5 can directly contact Smad1 despite the assumed incompatible L45–L3 pairing (Fig. 8D). Furthermore, constitutively active ALK5 could initiate exogenous Smad1 phosphorylation in HEK293T cells (Fig. 8A) and GST-Smad1 phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 8, B and C). It is important to point out that most of the early studies made their conclusions on receptor-Smad specificity based on functional assays carried out in rather limited cell lines, such as Mv1Lu and COS1 cells. Thus, it is conceivable that a cell-specific intermediate factor may also be involved in the cross-activation of Smad1 by ALK5. In C2C12 cells, TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation could be completely abolished using siSmad1 (Fig. 5). As siSmad1 had no effect on the protein level of closely related Smad5 (Fig. 5), this suggests our phospho-antibodies specifically recognize TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1. However, it cannot be ruled out that Smad5 is also phosphorylated by TGFβ signaling in the cells we investigated and that it is just undetectable by our antibodies. Our observation that TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation peaks at a later time than TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation in C2C12 and MEF cells, and is significantly more transient in nature (Fig. 2), completely agrees with the kinetic data recently published for EpH4 mouse mammary gland epithelial cells (20Daly A.C. Randall R.A. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6889-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our finding that a higher concentration of TGFβ is required to induce Smad1 phosphorylation than Smad3 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3) is also in accordance with this finding for EpH4 cells (20Daly A.C. Randall R.A. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6889-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the apparent difference in ALK requirement for the TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation events between C2C12 and EpH4 cells, the overall kinetics appear to be similar. There are several potential outcomes to the TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation that we observed. First, TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1 could play a role at promoters usually activated by BMP (i.e. where phospho-Smad1 is traditionally expected to act), in keeping with the idea of phospho-Smad1 binding the DNA at the usually expected GC-rich sequence. Second, TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1 could play a role at promoters usually activated by TGFβ (i.e. at GTCT sequences where phospho-Smad3 is traditionally expected to act). We screened a panel of TGFβ and BMP responsive luciferase reporters in response to TGFβ, in several different cell lines. We were unable to identify a canonical BMP-regulated gene reporter that could respond to TGFβ (data not shown). This supports recent data showing that TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5 cannot initiate transcription via BMP-responsive elements in epithelial cells (20Daly A.C. Randall R.A. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6889-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Additionally, we were unable to rescue TGFβ-induced reporter responses in Smad3 null MEF cells by overexpression of Smad1 (data not shown), suggesting that TGFβ-induced phospho-Smad1 does not simply substitute for phospho-Smad3 in this system. However, we did observe that depletion of Smad1 significantly reduced the level of TGFβ-induced transcription from the 3TP-lux luciferase reporter in C2C12 cells, suggesting Smad1 may play a role in TGFβ-induced transcription in addition to Smad2/3 proteins. It seems possible that involvement of Smad1 in TGFβ-induced transcription could be limited to those cell lines (C2C12; HepG2) that are able to induce Smad1 phosphorylation in an ALK5-dependent, and BMP receptor-independent, manner. In short, we provide firm evidence that TGFβ can activate Smad1 independently of BMP type I receptor activity in certain cells. Future studies are likely to determine whether TGFβ-induced ALK1/2/3/6-independent Smad1 phosphorylation can occur in additional cell types, and further determine whether this has a unique function as compared with the TGFβ-induced Smad1 phosphorylation dependent on ALK1/2/3/6.

https://openalex.org/W2083178847,"Glucosinolates are plant secondary metabolites present in Brassicaceae plants such as the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Intact glucosinolates are believed to be biologically inactive, whereas degradation products after hydrolysis have multiple roles in growth regulation and defense. The degradation of glucosinolates is catalyzed by thioglucosidases called myrosinases and leads by default to the formation of isothiocyanates. The interaction of a protein called epithiospecifier protein (ESP) with myrosinase diverts the reaction toward the production of epithionitriles or nitriles depending on the glucosinolate structure. Here we report the identification of a new group of nitrile-specifier proteins (AtNSPs) in A. thaliana able to generate nitriles in conjunction with myrosinase and a more detailed characterization of one member (AtNSP2). Recombinant AtNSP2 expressed in Escherichia coli was used to test its impact on the outcome of glucosinolate hydrolysis using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry approach. AtNSP proteins share 30-45% sequence homology with A. thaliana ESP. Although AtESP and AtNSP proteins can switch myrosinase-catalyzed degradation of 2-propenylglucosinolate from isothiocyanate to nitrile, only AtESP generates the corresponding epithionitrile. Using the aromatic benzylglucosinolate, recombinant AtNSP2 is also able to direct product formation to the nitrile. Analysis of glucosinolate hydrolysis profiles of transgenic A. thaliana plants overexpressing AtNSP2 confirms its nitrile-specifier activity in planta. In silico expression analysis reveals distinctive expression patterns of AtNSPs, which supports a biological role for these proteins. In conclusion, we show that AtNSPs belonging to a new family of A. thaliana proteins structurally related to AtESP divert product formation from myrosinase-catalyzed glucosinolate hydrolysis and, thereby, likely affect the biological consequences of glucosinolate degradation. We discuss similarities and properties of AtNSPs and related proteins and the biological implications."
https://openalex.org/W2091446925,"Body mass reconstructions of extinct vertebrates are most robust when complete to near-complete skeletons allow the reconstruction of either physical or digital models. Digital models are most efficient in terms of time and cost, and provide the facility to infinitely modify model properties non-destructively, such that sensitivity analyses can be conducted to quantify the effect of the many unknown parameters involved in reconstructions of extinct animals. In this study we use laser scanning (LiDAR) and computer modelling methods to create a range of 3D mass models of five specimens of non-avian dinosaur; two near-complete specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex, the most complete specimens of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis and Strutiomimum sedens, and a near-complete skeleton of a sub-adult Edmontosaurus annectens. LiDAR scanning allows a full mounted skeleton to be imaged resulting in a detailed 3D model in which each bone retains its spatial position and articulation. This provides a high resolution skeletal framework around which the body cavity and internal organs such as lungs and air sacs can be reconstructed. This has allowed calculation of body segment masses, centres of mass and moments or inertia for each animal. However, any soft tissue reconstruction of an extinct taxon inevitably represents a best estimate model with an unknown level of accuracy. We have therefore conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis in which the volumes of body segments and respiratory organs were varied in an attempt to constrain the likely maximum plausible range of mass parameters for each animal. Our results provide wide ranges in actual mass and inertial values, emphasizing the high level of uncertainty inevitable in such reconstructions. However, our sensitivity analysis consistently places the centre of mass well below and in front of hip joint in each animal, regardless of the chosen combination of body and respiratory structure volumes. These results emphasize that future biomechanical assessments of extinct taxa should be preceded by a detailed investigation of the plausible range of mass properties, in which sensitivity analyses are used to identify a suite of possible values to be tested as inputs in analytical models."
https://openalex.org/W2124884323,"The innate immune system provides an initial defense system against microbial infections and contributes to the development of adaptive immune response. Type I interferons play a pivotal role for the first line of defense against virus infections, and dendritic cells (DCs) are important sensors of pathogens responsible for priming of adaptive immune responses in lymphoid organs. Here we have investigated the role and mechanisms of activation of the MAPK pathway in innate immune responses induced by Sendai virus, a negative sense single-stranded RNA virus. Both p38 and JNK were activated in fibroblasts and DCs after infection with Sendai virus in a manner dependent on virus replication and RIG-I. Virus replication was also required for stimulation of interferon production in both cell types and interleukin-12 production in DCs. Blocking of p38 MAPK activation by the specific inhibitor SB202190 abolished the expression of these cytokines. p38 MAPK exerted its function independent of the MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2, MNK, and MSK1/2. We also observed that TRAF2 and TAK1 were essential for RIG-I-mediated activation of p38 MAPK. Interestingly, the kinase activity of p38 MAPK was required for its own phosphorylation, which was kinetically associated with TAB1 interaction. By contrast, the canonical p38 upstream kinase MKK3 was not involved in the p38-dependent response. Thus, activation of p38 MAPK by RIG-I proceeds via a TRAF2-TAK1-dependent pathway, where the enzymatic activity of the kinase plays an essential role. The p38 MAPK in turn stimulates important processes in the innate antiviral response."

The disease is characterized by impaired biliary bile salt excretion (cholestasis), but the mechanism whereby impaired ATP8B1 function results in cholestasis is poorly understood. ATP8B1 is a type 4 P-type ATPase and is a flippase for phosphatidylserine. Atp8b1-deficient mice display a dramatic increase in the biliary extraction of cholesterol from the canalicular (apical) membrane of the hepatocyte. Here we studied the hypothesis that disproportionate cholesterol extraction from the canalicular membrane impairs the activity of the bile salt transporter, ABCB11, and as a consequence causes cholestasis. Using single pass liver perfusions, we show that not only ABCB11-mediated transport but also Abcc2-mediated transport were reduced at least 4-fold in Atp8b1 deficiency. We show that canalicular membranes of cholestatic Atp8b1-deficient mice have a dramatically reduced cholesterol to phospholipid ratio, i.e. 0.75 ± 0.24 versus 2.03 ± 0.71 for wild type. In vitro depletion of cholesterol from mouse liver plasma membranes using methyl-β-cyclodextrin demonstrated a near linear relation between cholesterol content of the membranes and ATP-dependent taurocholate transport. Abcc2-mediated transport activity was not affected up to 30% of membrane cholesterol depletion but declined to negligible levels at 70% of membrane cholesterol depletion. These effects were reversible as cholesterol repletion of the liver membranes completely restored Abcb11- and Abcc2-mediated transport. Our data demonstrate that membrane cholesterol content is a critical determinant of ABCB11/ABCC2 transport activity, provide an explanation for the etiology of ATP8B1 disease, and suggest a novel mechanism protecting the canalicular membrane against luminal bile salt overload.

Houwen R.H. Klomp L.W. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 449-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PFIC1 patients usually present at a young age with typical cholestatic symptoms; serum bile salt, bilirubin, and transaminase levels are elevated, but serum GGT levels are low. Liver histology reveals bridging fibrosis but no bile duct proliferation. Electron microscopic analysis shows that canalicular bile has a coarsely granular appearance as opposed to the amorphous or finely filamentous bile observed in other forms of cholestasis. PFIC1 patients can also develop extrahepatic symptoms, including watery diarrhea and pancreatitis. Orthotopic liver transplantation relieves the cholestasis; however, the extrahepatic phenotypes remain. BRIC1 is characterized by periodic bouts of cholestasis, the onset and resolution of which are caused by unknown factors, and leaves no liver damage. Recently it was shown that mutations in ATP8B1 also are associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (2Mullenbach R. Bennett A. Tetlow N. Patel N. Hamilton G. Cheng F. Chambers J. Howard R.

The gene involved in these diseases, ATP8B1, encodes a member of the P4 subfamily of the P-type ATPase superfamily (4Halleck M.S. Lawler Jr., J.F. Blackshaw S. Gao L. Nagarajan P. Hacker C. Pyle S.

P4 ATPases are thought to function as phospholipid flippases, i.e. activities that translocate phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of membrane bilayers (6Devaux P.F.

Absolute requirements for plasma membrane localization and activity of ATP8B1 were co-expression and the physical interaction of ATP8B1 with CDC50A, a potential β-subunit for ATP8B1. ATP8B1 is expressed in many tissues, including the liver, pancreas, and small intestine, where it localizes to the apical membrane of epithelial cells, including the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (9van Mil S.W. van Oort M.M. van den Berg I.

The mechanism underlying the cholestasis in patients with ATP8B1 deficiency is not completely understood. Interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts in PFIC1/BRIC1 patients results in a remarkable normalization of serum bile salt levels and restored hepatobiliary output of chenodeoxycholic acid (10Kurbegov A.C.

This indicates that ATP8B1 deficiency affects the activity of the major bile salt transporter, ABCB11, in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte and that bile salt depletion improves the activity. We have studied the pathophysiological mechanisms in the mouse model for PFIC1, the Atp8b1G308V/G308V mutant mouse (further referred to as Atp8b1-deficient mouse) (12Pawlikowska L. Groen A.

We have previously shown that the hepatocyte canalicular membrane in Atp8b1-deficient mice is more sensitive to the detergent action of hydrophobic bile salts. This phenotype is underscored by a dramatic increase in the bile salt-dependent biliary excretion of cholesterol and canalicular ectoenzymes (13Paulusma C.C. Groen A. Kunne C. Ho-Mok K.S. Spijkerboer A.L. de Waart R. Hoek F.J. Vreeling H. Hoeben K.A. van Marle J. Pawlikowska L. Bull L.N. Hofmann A.F. Knisely A.S. Oude Elferink R.P.

The enhanced biliary cholesterol output in Atp8b1-deficient mice was independent of the cholesterol transporter Abcg5/g8, because Atp8b1-deficient mice with inactivated Abcg5/g8 also displayed enhanced cholesterol output (15Groen A. Kunne C. Jongsma G. van den Oever K. Mok K.S. Petruzzelli M. Vrins C.L. Bull L. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P.

Furthermore, in the isolated perfused liver, we showed that Atp8b1 deficiency leads to strongly impaired biliary output of taurodeoxycholate without affected Abcb11 expression and localization. We have hypothesized that ATP8B1 deficiency leads to loss of the normal phospholipid asymmetry of the canalicular membrane. As a result the canalicular membrane becomes more sensitive to extraction of cholesterol by hydrophobic bile salts, which impairs the activity of ABCB11 and, as a consequence, causes cholestasis. In this study we have analyzed the effect of membrane cholesterol modulation on the activity of ABCB11. We show that canalicular membranes of cholestatic Atp8b1-deficient mice have a dramatically reduced cholesterol to phospholipid ratio. Furthermore, by selective extraction of membrane cholesterol using methyl-β-cyclodextrin, we show that ABCB11 activity is critically dependent on membrane cholesterol content. Mice-Atp8b1G308V/G308V mutant (Atp8b1-deficient) mice are knock-in mice for a glycine-to-valine substitution at amino acid 308 leading to near absence of the protein (12Pawlikowska L. Groen A.

Atp8b1-deficient and wild-type mice (C57BL/6JOlaHsd) were housed in an animal facility on a 12-h light-dark cycle and were fed standard rodent chow. One week before experiments, animals were fed a purified semi-synthetic (20% casein) diet (K4068.02, Arie Blok, Woerden, The Netherlands) with or without 0.5% (w/w) cholic acid. In all experiments age-matched (3–6 months) male mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Hypnorm (11.76 mg/kg fluanisone, 0.37 mg/kg fentanyl citrate) and 5.88 mg/kg diazepam. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IUCAC) of the Academic Medical Center. Isolated, Single Pass Liver Perfusion-Mice were anesthetized, and gallbladder, portal vein, and superior vena cava were cannulated. The liver (left in situ) was placed in a 37 °C climate chamber and perfused in orthograde direction (3 ml/min) with carbogene (95% O2, 5% CO2)-gassed Krebs/bicarbonate buffer (120 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mg/ml glucose). Taurodeoxycholate (TDC), containing trace amounts of [3H]TDC, was dissolved in Krebs buffer and continuously perfused at a 50 nmol/min·100 g rate for 90 min. Bile samples were taken every 5 min. At the end of the experiment, livers were weighed, and part was dissolved in 100% soluene (Packard Instrument Co.). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The ABCC2 substrate 5′-carboxyfluorescein was perfused as a bolus at an 80 nmol/min·100 g rate for 5 min followed by 75 min in Krebs buffer. Bile samples were taken every 10 min, and 5′-carboxyfluorescein fluorescence was measured using a Novostar analyzer (BMG Labtech), with excitation 485 nm/emission 540 nm. Isolation of Mouse Liver Plasma Membrane-Mouse liver mixed and canalicular plasma membranes were isolated as described (16Meier P.J. Sztul E.S. Reuben A. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were homogenized in 1 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, hypotonic buffer in a Dounce homogenizer (loose pestle, five strokes). After centrifugation of the homogenate (15 min, 1500 × g), the crude membrane pellet was diluted with 5.5 volumes of 56% sucrose. The homogenized crude membranes were layered over 56% sucrose and below a 44/36.5/8% sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (3 h, 28,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor (141,245 × g) or 2 h in an SW41 rotor (134,314 × g)). Mixed liver membranes were collected from the 44/36% interface, washed, resuspended in isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4), and revesiculated by passage of the suspension through a 27-gauge needle (30 times). Membrane vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen. For canalicular membrane isolations, mixed liver membranes were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (tight pestle, 60 strokes). Homogenized mixed liver membranes were layered over a 29.7/34/38% sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (40,000 rpm, 3 h in an SW41 rotor (274,111 × g)). Canalicular membranes were collected from the 31/29.7% interface and washed in isolation buffer. Canalicular membranes were collected at 50,000 rpm, 45 min in a Ti70 rotor (257,091 × g). Cholesterol Depletion and Repletion of Mouse Liver Plasma Membranes-Cholesterol was depleted by incubation of membrane vesicles with 0.5–4 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (300 μg of protein/2 ml of isolation buffer) in isolation buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, membranes were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g, washed in isolation buffer, and centrifuged again. For cholesterol repletion, membrane pellets were incubated for an additional hour at room temperature with methyl-β-cyclodextrin-cholesterol inclusion complex (3:1). The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in isolation buffer to a final protein concentration of 1 μg/μl. Vesicle preparations were revesiculated by passage through a 27-gauge needle. Cholesterol-inclusion complex was prepared by adding 0.01 volume of a 0.1 m cholesterol stock (in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2)) to a pre-warmed (80 °C) 3 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (in isolation buffer) solution. The solution was extensively vortexed, sonicated (three times for 10 s at 50%), and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids in the vesicle preparation were measured as described above. Protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method. Membrane Vesicle Transport Assay-Uptake of [3H]taurocholate (TC) and dinitrophenyl-[glycine-2-[3H]glutathione (DNP-[3H]GS) was measured using the rapid filtration technique as described (17de Waart D.R. Paulusma C.C. Kunne C. Oude Elferink R.P. Liver Int. 2006; 26: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane vesicles (30 μg of protein) were incubated for 3 min (at 37 °C) in reaction mixture containing 250 mm sucrose and 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.8 mg of creatine kinase per ml/1 μCi of [3H]TC per ml, with or without 4 mm ATP. Reactions were stopped, and after rapid filtration, filters were washed four times with 3 ml of stop buffer (250 mm sucrose and 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4). Filters were placed in liquid scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Recombinant Protein Expression in Sf21 Cells-Recombinant human ABCB11 and ABCC2 were expressed in Sf21 cells using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (17de Waart D.R. Paulusma C.C. Kunne C. Oude Elferink R.P. Liver Int. 2006; 26: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Baculovirus for ABCB11 was kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Thompson. Protein was produced either in suspension (3–5 × 108 cells per spinner) or in monolayer cultures (2 × 107 per flask). Cells were grown at 27 °C in Grace’s insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were incubated for 1 h with viral stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested 3 days post-infection. Membranes were isolated as described previously (17de Waart D.R. Paulusma C.C. Kunne C. Oude Elferink R.P. Liver Int. 2006; 26: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion and repletion of Sf21 membranes were described above. Bile Salts, Phospholipids, and Cholesterol Assays-Serum bile salt levels were determined using Diazyme total bile acids kit (Diazyme Laboratories, Poway, CA). Choline-containing phospholipids and cholesterol were determined enzymatically as described (13Paulusma C.C. Groen A. Kunne C. Ho-Mok K.S. Spijkerboer A.L. de Waart R. Hoek F.J. Vreeling H.

All measurements were done on a Novostar analyzer (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany). Statistical Analyses-Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test; a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All data were expressed as means ± S.D. Atp8b1-deficient Mice Display Reduced Biliary Output of Organic Anions and Bile Salts-Our present studies are performed with Atp8b1-deficient mice on a C57Bl/6 background. We studied this background because in our hands the cholestatic phenotype caused by Atp8b1 deficiency is strongest in these animals (15Groen A. Kunne C. Jongsma G. van den Oever K. Mok K.S. Petruzzelli M. Vrins C.L. Bull L. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 2091-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Single pass perfusion of Atp8b1-deficient livers with radiolabeled taurodeoxycholate showed a 4-fold reduced hepatobiliary output of label and a concomitant 4-fold enhanced hepatic retention of label compared with wild types (Fig. 1A). We subsequently investigated whether Atp8b1 deficiency only affects bile salt transport or also other prominent transport activities in the canalicular membrane. To this end we studied Abcc2-mediated organic anion excretion in Atp8b1-deficient mice using the Abcc2 substrate, 5′-carboxyfluorescein (5′-CF). To measure 5′-CF excretion, livers were perfused with a bolus of 5′-CF. Using Abcc2–/– mice, we first demonstrated that this organic anion is exclusively excreted into bile via Abcc2 (data not shown). In wild-type mice, hepatobiliary excretion of 5′-CF peaked at t = 30 min but was at least 4-fold reduced in Atp8b1-deficient mice (Fig. 1A). These data demonstrate that Atp8b1 deficiency not only impairs Abcb11-mediated bile salt transport but also Abcc2-mediated organic anion transport. Canalicular Membranes of Atp8b1 Mutant Mice Have a Reduced Cholesterol to Phospholipid Ratio-Atp8b1-deficient mice displayed enhanced Abcg5/g8-independent biliary cholesterol output when challenged with taurocholate (13Paulusma C.C. Groen A. Kunne C. Ho-Mok K.S. Spijkerboer A.L. de Waart R. Hoek F.J. Vreeling H. Hoeben K.A. van Marle J. Pawlikowska L. Bull L.N. Hofmann A.F. Knisely A.S. Oude Elferink R.P.

Thus, we hypothesized that Atp8b1-deficient canalicular membranes have reduced amounts of cholesterol compared with wild type. To study this, we isolated canalicular and basolateral membranes from wild-type and Atp8b1-deficient mice fed a 0.5% cholate-supplemented diet for 1 week, and we measured membrane cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipid content (Fig. 2). Atp8b1-deficient mice were cholestatic as judged from a dramatic increase in serum bile salt levels (∼50-fold). The cholesterol to choline-containing phospholipid ratio (CH/PC) of canalicular membranes of Atp8b1-deficient mice was 0.75 ± 0.24 compared with a ratio of 2.03 ± 0.71 for canalicular membranes from wild-type mice. Strikingly, the cholesterol depletion was not confined to the canalicular membrane but was also found in the basolateral membrane fraction. This is not surprising as lipids can freely pass the tight junctions via the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (18van Meer G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These data show that challenging Atp8b1-deficient mice with a cholate-supplemented diet strongly depletes the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane. These observations allow the hypothesis that cholestasis may be caused by impaired transporter function in a canalicular membrane that has a reduced cholesterol content. Cholesterol Depletion from Mouse Liver Plasma Membranes Reduces Abcb11- and Abcc2-mediated Transport-To test the hypothesis distilled from the experiments above (Figs. 1 and 2), we investigated the effect of modulation of membrane cholesterol content on Abcb11 and Abcc2 transport activities. To study this, we selectively extracted cholesterol from mouse liver plasma membranes with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and measured the uptake of the Abcb11- and Abcc2 model substrates TC and DNP-GS, respectively, by these vesicles. Cholesterol depletion did not interfere with plasma membrane integrity as it did not result in extraction of any protein or phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Fig. 3A). Consequently, the CH/PC ratio rapidly decreased upon treatment with increasing concentrations of MβCD (Fig. 3B). There was a striking, near-linear relation between cholesterol content of the membranes and ATP-dependent TC transport, with a complete abrogation of transport at 80% of cholesterol depletion (Fig. 3C). Abcc2-mediated transport was less sensitive to cholesterol depletion; DNP-GS uptake was not affected up to 30% of membrane cholesterol depletion. However, from that point on the ATP-dependent transport activity rapidly declined to negligible levels at 70% of membrane cholesterol depletion (Fig. 3D). Cholesterol Addition Stimulates Abcb11- and Abcc2-mediated Transport-Next, we studied whether the inactivation of Abcb11- and Abcc2-mediated transport by membrane cholesterol depletion was reversible. Maximal membrane cholesterol depletion with 4 mm MβCD resulted in a decreased CH/PC ratio (0.7 versus 1.8 in cholesterol depleted versus control or repleted membranes) and a concomitant maximal inactivation of Abcb11-mediated TC transport (Fig. 4A, white bar). Subsequent repletion of these depleted membranes with cholesterol-saturated MβCD fully restored TC transport (Fig. 4A, hatched bar). We also studied whether we could stimulate Abcb11- and Abcc2-mediated transport to higher than endogenous levels by supplementation of membranes with cholesterol. Addition of cholesterol to wild-type membranes resulted in an enhanced CH/PC ratio (1.8 versus 2.2 in control versus cholesterol-repleted membranes) and a concomitant 100% increase in Abcb11-mediated TC uptake (Fig. 4B). Similarly, cholesterol repletion of Atp8b1-deficient membranes also enhanced the CH/PC ratio (1.2 versus 1.7 in control versus cholesterol-repleted membranes) and, as expected, resulted in an even stronger stimulation of Abcb11 activity by 250% (Fig. 4C). A similar cholesterol dependence of transport activity was observed for Abcc2 (not shown). These data indicate that membrane cholesterol content and/or the cholesterol to PC ratio is a critical determinant of the transport activity of Abcb11 and Abcc2. Kinetics of Abcb11-mediated TC Uptake in Liver Plasma Membranes upon Cholesterol Depletion-Next, we determined the kinetics of Abcb11-mediated TC uptake after depletion of cholesterol from liver plasma membranes (Fig. 5). Cholesterol was depleted from liver plasma membranes with 3 mm MβCD, and the initial uptake of different concentrations of TC was measured in control- and MβCD-treated membranes. TC uptake by both control and cholesterol-depleted membranes was saturable and obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 5, inset). When expressed in an Eadie-Scatchard plot, the data indicate that the Km value is largely unaffected (the slope of both lines are the same and equal 1/Km), indicating that cholesterol depletion does not affect the affinity of TC for the transporter. Because the y axis corresponds to Vmax/Km values, this experiment demonstrates that membrane cholesterol depletion reduces the Vmax, TC. Effect of Cholesterol Repletion on ABCB11 and ABCC2 Activity in Sf21 Membranes-To study the relation between membrane cholesterol content and transporter activity in more detail, we expressed human ABCB11 and ABCC2 in Sf21 insect cells. Compared with mammalian cells, insect cells contain very little membrane cholesterol (19Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Gimpl G. Klein U. Reilander H. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13794-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which makes these cells very suitable to study the relation between membrane cholesterol and protein activity. Indeed, the cholesterol content of Sf21 membranes (cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum) is ∼6-fold lower compared with mouse liver plasma membranes (Table 1). Consequently, the CH/PC ratio of Sf21 membranes was 0.13 ± 0.02, which is in the same range as described for Sf9 cells (19Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Gimpl G. Klein U. Reilander H. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13794-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and is 13-fold lower compared with liver plasma membranes (1.7 ± 0.2). Sf21 membranes expressing ABCB11 or ABCC2 protein and mouse liver plasma membranes were incubated with 3 mm MβCD or MβCD-cholesterol (3:1) inclusion complex. Subsequently, uptake of TC or DNP-GS by these membranes was measured (Fig. 6). As expected, MβCD treatment did not affect Sf21 membrane cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipid content nor did it affect ABCB11- and ABCC2-mediated transport activity (not shown). Cholesterol repletion of Sf21-ABCB11, Sf21-ABCC2, and liver plasma membranes resulted in 10-, 11-, and 4-fold increase in membrane cholesterol compared with cholesterol-depleted membranes, respectively (Fig. 6B). Despite the 10-fold increase in membrane cholesterol of Sf21-ABCB11 membranes, uptake of TC was only 1.3-fold enhanced (Fig. 6A), which contrasts the 7-fold increase in Abcb11-mediated TC uptake in liver plasma membranes. Uptake of DNP-GS by Sf21-ABCC2 membranes was ∼3-fold enhanced (and comparable with an ∼4-fold increase in liver plasma membranes (data not shown)). The cholesterol to PC ratios of the cholesterol-repleted membranes were 1.2, 1.6, and 2.2 for the Sf21-ABCB11, Sf21-ABCC2, and liver plasma membranes, respectively (Fig. 6C). These data show that also in Sf21 membranes the activity of ABCB11 and ABCC2 can be increased by addition of cholesterol to the membrane. The marginal increase in ABCB11-mediated transport may be explained by the difference in membrane composition/biophysical properties between Sf21 cells and liver plasma membranes. Altogether, our data indicate that the activity of the ABC transporters ABCB11 and ABCC2 in the canalicular membrane is very sensitive to modulation of membrane cholesterol content, albeit to a different extent.TABLE 1Cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipid content of Sf21 and liver plasma membranes were measured and corrected for proteinCholesterolPhospholipidCholesterol/phospholipid ratioμmol/mg proteinμmol/mg proteinMouse liver membranes0.47 ± 0.130.27 ± 0.051.7 ± 0.2Sf21 membranes0.08 ± 0.010.58 ± 0.050.13 ± 0.02a p < 0.001 (n = 4 different vesicle preparations). Open table in a new tab a p < 0.001 (n = 4 different vesicle preparations). Here we show that the activity of the canalicular transport proteins Abcb11 and Abcc2 is strongly dependent on canalicular membrane cholesterol content. To withstand the high millimolar concentrations of bile salts in the canalicular lumen, the hepatocyte canalicular membrane is protected by two different mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 21Oude Elferink R.P.J. Paulusma C.C. Groen A.K. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 908-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). First, biliary excretion of bile salts is coupled to biliary output of phosphatidylcholine, a process mediated by ABCB4. PC is translocated from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet where it is readily extracted by bile salt micelles to form mixed micelles (22Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 293-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Trauner M. Fickert P. Wagner M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2007; 27: 77-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This process is essential to protect the canalicular and cholangiocyte apical membrane from the detergent action of bile salts. Second, the exoplasmic leaflet of the canalicular membrane is a rigid membrane that is enriched in (glyco)sphingolipids and cholesterol (24Mazzone A. Tietz P. Jefferson J. Pagano R. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Nibbering C.P. Carey M.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Amigo L.

Sphingolipid-cholesterolrich membrane domains or ‘rafts’ are in a liquid-ordered (Lo) phase and are highly resistant toward detergents such as bile salts (21Oude Elferink R.P.J. Paulusma C.C.

J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Based on our previous work, we have hypothesized that ATP8B1 activity is crucial in maintaining this Lo phase by flipping excess phosphatidylserine from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the canalicular membrane, thereby increasing the relative amount of sphingolipids (8Paulusma C.C.

ATP8B1 deficiency dissipates normal phospholipid asymmetry of the canalicular membrane and causes a shift from an Lo to a more liquid-disordered phase. As a result the canalicular membrane becomes sensitive to extraction of cholesterol by hydrophobic bile salts. We hypothesized that enhanced cholesterol extraction results in reduced canalicular membrane cholesterol content and that this subsequently impairs ABCB11 activity (Fig. 3). Our present data support this hypothesis. First, we show that the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio of the canalicular membrane in cholestatic Atp8b1-deficient mice was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2). This observation indicates that in cholate-fed Atp8b1-deficient mice cholesterol is extracted from the canalicular membrane, which impairs Abcb11 (and Abcc2) activity. A similar observation has been described for Abcg8–/– mice, which have impaired hepatobiliary excretion of cholesterol (28Kosters A. Kunne C. Looije N. Patel S.B. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1959-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taurodeoxycholate infusion in these mice was associated with a 50% reduction in the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio of the canalicular membrane. Under this condition these mice also became cholestatic (28Kosters A. Kunne C. Looije N. Patel S.B. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1959-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas in Atp8b1-deficient mice membrane cholesterol content is reduced because of extraction by hydrophobic bile salts, membrane cholesterol content in Abcg8–/– mice is reduced because of impaired cholesterol translocation to the exoplasmic leaflet. However, in both mouse models a cholesterol to phospholipid ratio of the canalicular membrane is associated with impaired Abcb11 activity. Second, our in vitro experiments show that Abcb11 activity is very sensitive to modulation of membrane cholesterol content (Fig. 3). Extraction of only 10% of membrane cholesterol resulted in a reduction of Abcb11 activity of 10–20% and maximal inhibition of transport at 80% of cholesterol depletion, a process that was fully reversible. Abcc2 activity, on the other hand, was less sensitive to changes in membrane cholesterol content; depletion of membrane cholesterol up to 30% did not affect Abcc2 activity, but further cholesterol depletion also completely abrogated this activity. It is not clear how cholesterol depletion affects these transport activities, but disturbance of the lipid shell of these transport proteins and/or changes in membrane fluidity may well impair protein structure and activity (for review see Ref. 29Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 62-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). We find that cholesterol depletion from liver plasma membranes does not affect the affinity of TC for Abcb11 but rather impairs the velocity of TC transport (Fig. 5). Similar findings have been reported for the multidrug transport protein ABCG2 expressed in Sf9 insect cells (30Pal A. Mehn D. Molnar E. Gedey S. Meszaros P. Nagy T. Glavinas H. Janaky T. von Richter O. Bathori G. Szente L. Krajcsi P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cholesterol repletion of ABCG2-expressing insect cell membranes stimulated ABCG2-mediated transport activity, with little effect on the substrate affinity for the protein. In another study, cholesterol repletion (10-fold increase in membrane cholesterol) stimulated the formation of the catalytic intermediate of ABCG2, and methotrexate transport was 15-fold enhanced (31Telbisz A. Muller M. Ozvegy-Laczka C. Homolya L. Szente L. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2698-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our repletion experiments in ABCB11-expressing Sf21 insect cell membranes (which contain negligible amounts of cholesterol) show that, despite an ∼10-fold increase in membrane cholesterol content, transport activity was only marginally enhanced (1.3-fold). ABCC2 activity, on the other hand, was 3-fold enhanced with a concomitant 11-fold increase in membrane cholesterol content. In relation to this, it has recently been reported that modulation of membrane cholesterol content of ABCB1 and ABCC1-expressing Sf9 membranes also showed a negligible effects on these transport activities (31Telbisz A. Muller M. Ozvegy-Laczka C. Homolya L. Szente L. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2698-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Apparently, additional parameters are important for optimal activity of these type of proteins in insect cell membranes. An important possibility is the phospholipid composition of insect cell membranes, which contain much higher amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and less (if any) sphingomyelin (19Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In our own lipid analysis of Sf21 membranes (data not shown), we also observed a much higher phosphatidylethanolamine content (∼35% of total phospholipid in Sf21 compared with ∼17% in canalicular membranes). Our study shows that canalicular membrane cholesterol content is an important determinant of ABCB11/ABCC2 activity. These data provide an explanation for the etiology of PFIC1/BRIC1 (see Fig. 7 for a model); intrahepatic cholestasis in PFIC1 is caused by an impaired aminophospholipid flippase activity that results in canalicular membrane phospholipid randomization; this renders the canalicular membrane more sensitive to extraction of cholesterol by bile salts, which reduces the cholesterol over phospholipid ratio and thereby impairs ABCB11 activity. The latter process causes cholestasis. These findings are not only relevant for PFIC1, they also suggest a novel mechanism protecting the canalicular membrane against luminal bile salt overload. When luminal bile salt levels become too high and excessively extract cholesterol from the membrane, ABCB11 activity falls. This lessens canalicular bile salt excretion, and thus prevents further membrane damage."
https://openalex.org/W1992425314,"Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a mitochondrial immunophilin and a key positive regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Several reports have shown that CypD is overexpressed in various tumors, where it has an anti-apoptotic effect. Because the MPT is a cell death-inducing phenomenon, we hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic effect of CypD is independent of the MPT but is due to its interaction with some key apoptosis regulator, such as Bcl2. Our data indicate that CypD indeed interacts with Bcl2 as confirmed with co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown, and mammalian two-hybrid assays. A cyclophilin D inhibitor, cyclosporine A, disrupts the CypD-Bcl2 interaction. CypD enhances the limiting effect of Bcl2 on the tBid-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which is not mediated via the MPT. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirm that CypD has a limiting effect on cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that such an effect of CypD is cyclosporine A- and Bcl2-dependent. On a cellular level, overexpression or knockdown of CypD respectively decreases or increases cytochrome c release from mitochondria and overall cell sensitivity to apoptosis progressing via the “intrinsic” pathway. Therefore, we here describe a novel function of CypD as a Bcl2 collaborator and an inhibitor of cytochrome c release from mitochondria independent of the MPT. This function of CypD may explain the anti-apoptotic effect of this protein observed in various cancer cells. The fact that some tumors overexpress CypD suggests that this may be an additional mechanism of suppression of apoptosis in cancer.

Apoptosis is a programmed mode of cell death and a universal phenomenon in multicellular eukaryotic organisms (1Dragovich T. Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3207-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Suppression of apoptosis is utilized by cancer cells to promote their survival (2Reed J.C. J. Clin.

It is, therefore, important to pursue the mechanisms of suppression of apoptosis in cancer to define new therapeutic targets and develop new therapies.

Grimm S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Li Y. Johnson N. Capano M. Edwards M. Crompton M. Biochem.

The goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanism underlying the reported anti-apoptotic effect of CypD. Cyclophilin D is a ppif gene product, a member of the immunophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, and a mitochondrial matrix protein that has a crucial role in protein folding (6Galat A. Metcalfe S.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 67-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability to interact with various proteins is an inherent feature of CypD. The most important interaction of CypD reported to date is with the components of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore (7Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The MPT can be induced in the presence of elevated calcium by a variety of signals (8Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CypD has been shown to interact with the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), a putative MPT pore component (7Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 9Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar), and to promote its “open” conformation so that it can transport not only ADP and ATP but also solutes of up to 1.5 kDa (10Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). As a result, solutes and water equilibrate across the inner mitochondrial membrane, causing mitochondrial swelling, depolarization, and release of various intermembrane proteins including cytochrome c (CytC). Calcium strongly promotes binding of CypD to the ANT and is mandatory for MPT induction (7Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 10Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressor, cyclosporine A (CsA), binds CypD, prevents its interaction with the ANT, and is, therefore, an effective inhibitor of the MPT (11Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Kokoszka et al. (12Kokoszka J.E. Waymire K.G. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Cai J. Jones D.P. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) have shown that mitochondria isolated from ANT knock-out mice remain sensitive to the MPT. However, various groups showed that mitochondria isolated from CypD knock-out mice completely lack the MPT (13Baines C.P. Kaiser R.A. Purcell N.H. Blair N.S. Osinska H. Hambleton M.A. Brunskill E.W.

Kubo T. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 2005; 434: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Therefore, CypD is a crucial regulator of the MPT, whereas the ANT is dispensable for this process. Lemasters and co-workers (16Waldmeier P.C. Zimmermann K. Qian T. Tintelnot-Blomley M. Lemasters J.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 1485-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) have suggested that a role in MPT induction, like that of the ANT, may be played by other transporters and/or misfolded proteins. In addition to its role in regulating the MPT, CypD has been shown to suppress apoptosis in various tumor cells via a yet unidentified mechanism (3Schubert A. Grimm S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Li Y. Johnson N. Capano M. Edwards M. Crompton M. Biochem.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14314-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because of the role of CypD in regulation of the MPT, the attempt has been made to relate the anti-apoptotic effect of CypD in cancer cells to the MPT (5Machida K. Ohta Y. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14314-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The MPT has been suggested as one of the mechanisms of release of CytC and other apoptogenic factors from mitochondria during apoptosis (17Forte M. Bernardi P. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In view of the pro-apoptotic effect of MPT opening, the anti-apoptotic effect of CypD, a key positive regulator of the MPT, seems controversial. Recently, the interaction between a member of the cyclophilin family of proteins, mitochondria-associated peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, FKBP38, and Bcl2, leading to modification of Bcl2 function, has been reported (18Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that due to functional and structural similarity to FKBP38, CypD may exert a similar effect and interact with Bcl2. Such interaction between CypD and Bcl2, a major factor that regulates apoptosis, may also modify Bcl2 function and make it a more potent inhibitor of cell death. We here present evidence that CypD and Bcl2 indeed interact and cooperate in preventing CytC release from mitochondria, leading to inhibition of apoptosis.

Immunoprecipitation-Samples at 200 μg of protein per sample were precleared with protein G beads and then mixed with 2 μg of an α-Bcl2 antibody or control non-immune mouse Ig immobilized on protein G beads in an “immunoprecipitation buffer” (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The reactions were nutated overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed in an “immunoprecipitation wash buffer” (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. The inputs were also mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer, and then the immunoprecipitation reactions and inputs were boiled for 10 min and spun down. The supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting as described below. Immunoblotting-Samples were electrophoresed and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked in 5% solutions of nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween, probed with a primary antibody at 1 μg/ml and then probed with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 0.2 μg/ml, developed using SuperSignal WestPico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and photographed. Blots were then stripped in Re-Blot Plus stripping buffer (Chemicon) and either stained with Ponceau S (in case of isolated mitochondria) or reprobed with an α-β-actin antibody (in case of whole cell lysates or permeabilized cells) to verify equal loading. Cyclophilin D Pulldown-Five μg of recombinant MBP-Bcl2 or MBP-Bax was immobilized on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) by mixing with 20 μl of resin and incubating for 30 min. The beads were washed twice with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 1 h with either mitochondrial or whole cell protein extracts. Beads were pelleted, washed three times with buffer B, mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and spun down. Supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting as described above. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay-The mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed using the Matchmaker kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, human Bcl2 cDNA was cloned into the pM vector containing a DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1C, DNA-BD), and human CypD cDNA was cloned into the pVP16 vector containing the activation domain (Fig. 1C, AD). The pM-Bcl2 and pVP16-CypD constructs were co-transfected at different ratios into the HEK293T cells along with the Great EscApe secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter plasmid. In control experiments, the following combinations of vectors were co-transfected: (i) empty pM, empty VP16; (ii) pM-Bcl2, empty VP16; and (iii) empty pM, pVP16-CypD. The pM3-VP16 vector served as a positive control. At 48 h after transfections, media containing SEAP were collected, and SEAP was assayed using the chemiluminescent substrate in an Optocomp1 luminometer.

To prepare mitochondrial protein extracts, mitochondria were lysed in Golden lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, and the debris were spun down. Permeabilization of plasma membranes in HEK293T cells was performed using digitonin at 0.01% in KCl-based buffer (125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm potassium succinate, and 1 μm rotenone). Loading of Isolated Mitochondria with Calcium-Isolated rat liver mitochondria (RLM) were incubated at 1 mg/ml in KCl-based buffer added with CaCl2 at various concentrations in a stirred cuvette. Calcium in the external medium was monitored with a calibrated selective electrode attached to a computer. Cytochrome c Release Assay-Isolated mitochondria at 1 mg/ml or digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated with recombinant human tBid at 1 μg/ml for 10 min at room temperature in KCl-based buffer. Samples were spun down, and supernatants, normalized for protein, were subjected to either immunoblotting for CytC or ELISA for CytC according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell Culture and Treatments-HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.

Stable clones were selected by treating cells with G418 (Invitrogen) at 750 μg/ml for 2 weeks and maintained in G418 at 200 μg/ml. As a result, 293T-CypD, 293T-Bcl2, and 293T-EV stable cell lines were generated. To achieve knockdown of Bcl2 or CypD, cells were stably transfected with pKD-Bcl2 shRNA vector (Upstate Biotechnologies) or SureSilencing CypD shRNA vector (SABiosciences), respectively, and selected with 2 μm puromycin for 2 weeks. The controls were transfected with the corresponding empty vectors. To induce apoptosis, cells were treated with etoposide at 20 μm for 6 h or staurosporine at 2 μm for 6 h or TNF at 10 ng/ml for 24 h or were serum-starved for 48 h in the absence or presence of CsA at 1 μm. The optimal concentrations of the inducers and optimal treatment times were determined experimentally. Nuclear Condensation Assay-Cells undergoing apoptosis and control cells were stained with the fluorescent nuclear probe Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) at 1 μg/ml for 5 min. Nuclear morphology was assessed using a Zeiss Axiovert inverted fluorescence microscope, and the number of apoptotic nuclei showing condensed chromatin versus the total number of nuclei was counted. Caspase-3 Activity Assay-Ten μg of cell lysates was mixed with the caspase-3-specific fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-amc (Calbiochem) at 20 μm in a total volume of 0.2 ml in 96-well plate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence at 440 nm (excitation at 380 nm) from the –amc tag cleaved by caspase-3 was measured in a Hitachi plate reader. Statistical Analysis-Experiments were repeated 3–5 times. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated, and the statistical significance was determined using a Student’s t test. Data with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Interaction of Cyclophilin D with Bcl2-As was shown recently by several groups, CypD is overexpressed in different types of cancer, where it has an anti-apoptotic effect (3Schubert A. Grimm S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Li Y. Johnson N. Capano M. Edwards M. Crompton M. Biochem.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14314-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because this anti-apoptotic effect of CypD in cancer is contradictory to its role in regulation of the MPT, which is a pro-death phenomenon, we hypothesized that this effect of CypD is independent of the MPT but is due to its interaction with some regulator of apoptosis. We, therefore, studied the interaction of CypD with a major anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl2. Fig. 1A shows that CypD co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2 when protein extracts from isolated RLM were immunoprecipitated with an α-Bcl2 antibody and then immunoprobed with an α-CypD antibody. The co-immunoprecipitation of CypD with Bcl2 was specific because CypD did not co-immunoprecipitate with control non-immune Ig. Similar results were obtained with protein extracts from mitochondria isolated from rat hearts and human HEK293T, Saos2, and HL60 cells and with whole cell lysates from Saos2 or HEK293T cells (data not shown). To further confirm the interaction of CypD with Bcl2, we performed a CypD pulldown assay by incubating mitochondrial protein extracts with recombinant MBP-Bcl2 fusion protein immobilized on amylose resin. Fig. 1B shows that CypD was pulled down by the MBP-Bcl2, indicating interaction between these proteins. To confirm the specificity of binding of CypD to Bcl2, we incubated mitochondrial protein extracts with a recombinant MBP-Bax fusion protein produced in our laboratory as described in Ref. 19Eliseev R.A. Alexandrov A. Gunter T. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and immobilized the extracts on amylose resin. Fig. 1B shows that CypD was not pulled down by MBP-Bax and, therefore, the binding of CypD to Bcl2 is specific. Previous reports indicated that both CypD and Bcl2 can bind the ANT (7Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 9Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 24Brenner C. Cadiou H. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Xie Z. Leber B. Andrews D. Duclohier H. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the observed interaction of CypD with Bcl2 is via the ANT, we probed the above immunoprecipitates and pulldowns with an α-ANT antibody. Our assay showed that the ANT was absent from our immunoprecipitates and pulldowns (data not shown), and, therefore, the interaction of CypD with Bcl2 is not via the ANT. As a third line of evidence for the interaction of CypD with Bcl2, we designed a mammalian two-hybrid system that included a VP-CypD vector expressing CypD fused to an activation domain, a pM-Bcl2 vector expressing Bcl2 fused to a DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1C, DNA-BD), and a SEAP reporter vector as shown in a diagram in Fig. 1C. Co-transfection of VP-CypD with pM-Bcl2 at various ratios led to a significant induction of SEAP activity reaching 10-fold at a 1 to 2 ratio of VP-CypD to pM-Bcl2 when compared with a negative control (Fig. 1D). Transfection of VP-CypD with the empty pM vector or pM-Bcl2 with the empty VP vector did not induce any significant SEAP activity, confirming the specificity of interaction of CypD and Bcl2. Co-transfection of empty pM with VP16 was used as a negative control. Transfection of pM3-VP16 was used as a positive control as suggested by the manufacturer. Therefore, using various protein-protein binding assays including co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown, and the mammalian two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that CypD interacts with the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial protein, Bcl2. Effect of Calcium and Cyclosporine A on the Interaction of Cyclophilin D with Bcl2-The literature suggests that calcium and CsA counter-regulate the ability of CypD to interact with other mitochondrial proteins such as ANT (7Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J.

We, therefore, studied the effect of calcium and CsA on binding of CypD to Bcl2. CaCl2 was added to a suspension of isolated RLM at various concentrations, and the uptake of calcium into the mitochondria was monitored by measuring changes in calcium concentration in the medium with a calibrated calcium-sensitive electrode (Fig. 2A). After 10 min following calcium uptake, mitochondria were pelleted and lysed for immunoprecipitation. Fig. 2B shows that preincubation of isolated RLM with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 did not have any significant effect on the subsequent co-immunoprecipitation of CypD with Bcl2. It should be noted that to exclude the possibility of MPT induction by CaCl2, the concentration of CaCl2 used in our experiments did not exceed 40 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. As was determined experimentally (data not shown), more than 100 nmol of CaCl2/mg of mitochondrial protein was needed to induce the MPT in our RLM. To further confirm that calcium does not have an effect on binding of CypD to Bcl2, the pulldown of CypD from mitochondrial protein extracts using immobilized MBP-Bcl2 was performed in the absence or presence of CaCl2 at 500 μm. Fig. 2C shows that the pulldown of CypD by MBP-Bcl2 was similar in the absence or presence of CaCl2. CsA is known to bind CypD and inhibit its interactions with other proteins such as ANT (7Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the effect of CsA on the binding of CypD to Bcl2. Fig. 2D shows that in the presence of CsA at 1 μm, co-immunoprecipitation of CypD with Bcl2 was significantly reduced. In addition, CsA prevented CypD pulldown from mitochondrial protein extracts using immobilized MBP-Bcl2 (Fig. 2E). Together, our data indicate that although calcium does not have any significant effect on the interaction of CypD with Bcl2, CsA effectively inhibits this interaction. Cyclophilin D Potentiates the Limiting Effect of Bcl2 on Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria-Bcl2 is a major anti-apoptotic mitochondrial protein that functions by limiting the release of CytC from mitochondria during apoptosis (25Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that binding of CypD may affect the ability of Bcl2 to inhibit CytC release from mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we performed a series of experiments using recombinant human tBid, a potent inducer of CytC release from mitochondria, and isolated RLM. As shown in Fig. 3A (left blot), the supernatant from RLM incubated with tBid at 1 μg/mg of mitochondrial protein for 10 min contained significantly more CytC than the supernatant from control RLM as measured with immunoblotting. These data indicate that tBid induced the release of CytC from mitochondria. The CypD inhibitor, CsA, at 1 μm, which we have shown to prevent the CypD-Bcl2 interaction (Fig. 2), further increased the tBid-induced release of CytC from RLM. It should be noted that under these experimental conditions, tBid did not induce the MPT, as was determined by the absence of swelling of mitochondria (data not shown). The presence of calcium at 40 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein did not significantly change the tBid-induced release of CytC from RLM into the supernatant (Fig. 3A, right blot). These data indicate that inhibition of CypD with CsA increases the tBid-induced release of CytC from mitochondria, which is not mediated via the MPT and not sensitive to calcium. To further evaluate the effect of CypD on CytC release from mitochondria, we performed a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments in HEK293T cells using the expression vectors for either CypD or Bcl2, constructed as described in detail in our previous works (22Eliseev R.A.

Mitochondrion (Kidlington). 2002; 1: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), or shRNA vectors. Cells were stably transfected and then permeabilized with digitonin at 0.01%, a concentration sufficient to permeabilize the plasma membrane but not the outer mitochondrial membrane (22Eliseev R.A. Filippov G. Velos J. VanWinkle B. Goldman A. Rosier R.N. Gunter T.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2007; 28: 1532-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), to expose mitochondria to the external medium. The medium were similar to those used in the experiments with isolated mitochondria. These permeabilized cells were incubated with tBid for 10 min in the absence or presence of CsA. The supernatants were then analyzed for the presence of CytC using the CytC ELISA kit. Fig. 3B (column set EV) shows that the level of CytC in the supernatant from the empty vector-transfected cells (EV) incubated with tBid increased 4-fold when compared with untreated controls (Ctrl). CsA further increased the tBid-induced release of CytC from mitochondria in EV cells, leading to an 8-fold increase in the level of CytC in the supernatant when compared with untreated controls. This experiment demonstrates that tBid and CsA have a stimulating effect on CytC release in permeabilized cells similar to that observed in isolated RLM. To inhibit the above effects, we stably overexpressed Bcl2 in HEK293T cells using the Bcl2 expression vector as confirmed with immunoblotting (Fig. 3C, left blot). Fig. 3B (column set Bcl2) shows that as was expected, Bcl2 overexpression abolished the tBid-induced release of CytC from mitochondria. Incubation of the Bcl2-expressing cells with the CypD inhibitor, CsA, restored the tBid-induced release of CytC from mitochondria and, therefore, reversed the inhibiting effect of Bcl2 on CytC release, suggesting that CypD plays a role in Bcl2-mediated inhibition of CytC release from mitochondria. To further confirm this finding, we knocked down 80% of the CypD in Bcl2-expressing cells using the shRNA technique as validated with immunoblotting shown in Fig. 3C (middle blot). Fig. 3B (column set Bcl2/KD CypD) shows that the specific knockdown of CypD reduced the limiting effect of Bcl2 on the tBid-induced release of CytC from mitochondria, leading to a more than 5-fold increase in CytC level in the supernatant. CsA further increased the CytC release from mitochondria in these cells; however, the effect was only marginal, probably because of the absence of the CsA target, CypD. These data indicate that CypD plays a role in Bcl2-mediated inhibition of CytC release from mitochondria. To extend our study of the effect of C"

Since PMNs play a central role in innate immunity, we examine responses by PMNs following stimulation by two antimicrobial CgA-derived peptides. Methodology/Principal Findings PMNs were treated with different concentrations of CgA-derived peptides in presence of several drugs. Calcium mobilization was observed by using flow cytometry and calcium imaging experiments. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy have shown the intracellular localization of the peptides. The calmodulin-binding and iPLA2 activating properties of the peptides were shown by Surface Plasmon Resonance and iPLA2 activity assays. Finally, a proteomic analysis of the material released after PMNs treatment with CgA-derived peptides was performed by using HPLC and Nano-LC MS-MS. By using flow cytometry we first observed that after 15 s, in presence of extracellular calcium, Chromofungin (CHR) or Catestatin (CAT) induce a concentration-dependent transient increase of intracellular calcium. In contrast, in absence of extra cellular calcium the peptides are unable to induce calcium depletion from the stores after 10 minutes exposure. Treatment with 2-APB (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate), a store operated channels (SOCs) blocker, inhibits completely the calcium entry, as shown by calcium imaging. We also showed that they activate iPLA2 as the two CaM-binding factors (W7 and CMZ) and that the two sequences can be aligned with the two CaM-binding domains reported for iPLA2. We finally analyzed by HPLC and Nano-LC MS-MS the material released by PMNs following stimulation by CHR and CAT. We characterized several factors important for inflammation and innate immunity. Conclusions/Significance For the first time, we demonstrate that CHR and CAT, penetrate into PMNs, inducing extracellular calcium entry by a CaM-regulated iPLA2 pathway. Our study highlights the role of two CgA-derived peptides in the active communication between neuroendocrine and immune systems."

We generated IRAK2-deficient mice to examine its function in detail. These mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock, because of impaired TLR4-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although IRAK2 deficiency did not affect TLR4-mediated NFκB activation, a reduction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated mRNA stabilization contributed to the reduced cytokine and chemokine production observed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from IRAK2-deficient mice. Furthermore, the ratios of LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in translation-active (polysomal) versus translation-inactive (free ribosomes) pools were reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages. Importantly, LPS-induced phosphorylation of MKK3/6, MNK1, and eIF4E was significantly reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages. Moreover, LPS stimulation induced an interaction of IRAK2 with TRAF6, MKK3/6, and MK2, implicating a critical role for mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in LPS-induced IRAK2-mediated post-transcriptional control.

Nature.. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar), TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, which are intracellular, detect nucleic acids derived from viruses and bacteria (13Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S.

Science.. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Google Scholar). Upon binding their ligands, all of the TLRs except TLR3 recruit the adaptor molecule MyD88 through the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain, mediating MyD88-dependent pathways (15Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol... 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar). MyD88 then recruits the serine-threonine kinases IRAK4 and IRAK1. IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, which then mediates the recruitment of TRAF6 to the receptor complex (16Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature.. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar). The IRAK1-TRAF6 complex then dissociates from the receptor to interact with and activate TAK1, a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family (17Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell.. 2000; 103: 351-361Google Scholar). The activation of TAK1 eventually leads to the activation of NFκB and JNK (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature.. 1999; 398: 252-256Google Scholar), which in turn induce transcription of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes, such as those encoding TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. TLR3 and TLR4 also employ a MyD88-independent pathway that uses Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF) to activate NFκB and IRF3. TLR4-mediated MyD88-independent activities are abolished in mice lacking TRAM, another adaptor in this pathway (19Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Uematsu S. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Nat. Immunol... 2003; 4: 1144-1150Google Scholar). While IL-1R and TLRs regulate transcription, they also enable gene expression by stabilizing otherwise unstable mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory proteins. Many of the mRNAs of cytokines and chemokines have very short half-lives because of AU-rich sequence elements (AREs) located within their 3′-untranslated regions (20Anderson P. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 353-359Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of mRNA stability controls inflammatory gene expression. Degradation of mRNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction, the predominant mechanism in mammalian cells, is carried out through the activation of a large complex of exonucleases termed the exosome. Binding proteins that interact with ARE in mRNAs play essential roles in directing mRNA decay through their interactions with the exosome. The ARE-binding protein, tristetraprolin (TTP), plays a critical role in destabilizing cytokines and chemokines (20Anderson P. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 353-359Google Scholar). Several signaling pathways modulate the function of these ARE-binding proteins, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and p38/MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and JNK pathways (20Anderson P. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 353-359Google Scholar). The MKK3/6-p38-MK2 signaling cascade has been implicated in LPS-mediated mRNA stabilization through the phosphorylation and stabilization of the ARE-binding protein TTP, resulting in a reduction of the affinity of TTP for AREs, relieving ARE-dependent destabilization of TNFα mRNA (21Hitti E.

On the other hand, MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinases (MNKs), substrates of the p38 and ERK pathways, are components of a translational regulatory pathway. Specifically, MNK1 interacts with the translation initiation complex, where it phosphorylates the main CAP-binding protein eIF4E, promoting CAP-dependent translation (23Fukunaga R. Hunter T.

We recently found that the kinase activity of IRAK4 is essential for IL-1R and TLR-mediated stabilization of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs (26Kim T.W. Staschke K. Bulek K. Yao J. Peters K. Oh K.H. Vandenburg Y. Xiao H. Qian W. Hamilton T. Min B. Sen G. Gilmour R. Li X. J. Exp. Med... 2007; 204: 1025-1036Google Scholar). A reduction of LPS-, R848-, and IL-1-mediated mRNA stability contributed to reduced cytokine and chemokine production in bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages from IRAK4 kinase-inactive knock-in mice. IRAK2 is another member of the IRAK family. Because the overexpression of IRAK2 activates NFκB, it has been implicated in multiple TLR signaling pathways (27Keating S.E. Maloney G.M. Moran E.M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 33435-33443Google Scholar). In a recent study, peritoneal macrophages from IRAK2-deficient mice showed impaired production of cytokines in response to multiple TLR ligands (28Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 684-691Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the IRAK2-deficient macrophages showed normal early but reduced late activation of NFκB in response to the TLR2 ligand Malp-2, suggesting that IRAK2 is critical for the late transcriptional response to the activation of TLR2. To investigate the role of IRAK2 in TLR-mediated signaling, we also generated IRAK2-deficient mice, which are resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock, because of impaired TLR4-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Importantly, a reduction of LPS-mediated mRNA stability and translation initiation contributed to the reduced cytokine and chemokine production is observed in BM-derived macrophages from IRAK2-deficient mice. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for IRAK2 in regulating post-transcriptional control of LPS-triggered proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, an essential step in the development of septic shock. Reagents-LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5 (macrophages) and O111:B4 (mice)) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. R848 (1-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-2-methyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]-quinolin-4-amine) was commercially synthesized by GLSynthesis. Antibodies to phospho-MKK3/6, phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, phospho-MNK1, phospho-eIF4E, phospho-IKKα/β, phospho-IκBα, and MK2 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies to IRAK1, IκBα, and IKKα/β were purchased from Santa Cruz. Antibody to MEKK3 was purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Antibody to IRAK2 was purchased from Abcam. Antibody to β-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibody to TTP was a gift from Dr. Perry Blackshear at National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. cDNA encoding mouse IRAK2 was amplified with primers 5′-CATGGCTTGCTACATCTACC-3′ and 5′-ACGTTTGTCTGTCCAGTTGA-3′ and cloned into TA cloning vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen). A 223-bp fragment, obtained from this construct after cutting with EcoRI and XmaI, was used as a probe for Northern analysis of IRAK2. The oligomer for NF-κB electrophoretic mobility assay was 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Generation of IRAK2 Knock-out Mice—IRAK2-deficient mice were generated using standard gene targeting technology. A targeting vector was constructed that replaced 5 kb of the Irak2 gene, including 2.7 kb of the 5′ regulatory region, exon 1, and 2.1 kb of intron 1, with a neomycin resistance gene and included the HSV-tk gene in the vector sequence. Successfully targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts and implanted into pseudopregnant females. Chimeric male offspring were mated to WT C57BL/6 female, and germ line transmission of the mutant Irak2 allele was confirmed by Southern and PCR analyses. In Vivo Endotoxin Challenges—Adult wild type (129×C57BL6) and knock-out mice (129×C57BL6-Irak 2 KO) were used for all experiments listed in the study, and the studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. For survival studies adult WT and IRAK2-deficient mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (20 mg/kg) and observed for 7 days. Animals in distress or moribund were euthanized and counted as nonsurvivors. For cytokine response, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline or LPS (4 mg/kg). At either 1.5 or 3.5 h, the animals were anesthetized, phlebotomized, and euthanized, and the serum was separated and frozen for subsequent cytokine analysis. Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—These obtained from bone marrow of tibia and femur by flushing with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. The bone marrows were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 30% L929 cell-conditioned medium for 5 days for differentiation and proliferation of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Northern Analysis and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed as described (26Kim T.W. Staschke K. Bulek K. Yao J. Peters K. Oh K.H. Vandenburg Y. Xiao H. Qian W. Hamilton T. Min B. Sen G. Gilmour R. Li X. J. Exp. Med... 2007; 204: 1025-1036Google Scholar). The results were normalized to mouse β-actin. The specific primer sequences used for mouse β-actin, mouse TNF-α, mouse IL-6, mouse KC and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, are as follows: β-actin (133 bp), 5′-GGTCATCACTATTGGCAACG-3′ and 5′-ACGGATGTCAACGTCACACT-3′; TNF-α (103 bp), 5′-CAAAGGGAGAGTGGTCAGGT-3′ and 5′-ATTGCACCTCAGGGAAGAGT-3′; IL-6 (127 bp), 5′-GGACCAAGACCATCCAATTC-3′ and 5′-ACCACAGTGAGGAATGTCCA-3′; KC (125 bp), 5′-TAGGGTGAGGACATGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-AAATGTCCAAGGGAAGCGT-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (179bp), 5′-GAGCTGAACGGGAAGCTCAC-3′ and 5′-TGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGC-3′. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—BM-derived macrophages from IRAK2 wild type and knock-out mice were cultured as indicated above. After stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml) or R848 (1 μg/ml), the cells were harvested, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described (29Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 26748-26753Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (30Qin J. Yao J. Cui G. Xiao H. Kim T.W. Fraczek J. Wightman P. Sato S. Akira S. Puel A. Casanova J. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 21013-21021Google Scholar). Polysome Fraction Analysis—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from BM-derived macrophages stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) as described (31Chaudhuri S. Vyas K. Kapasi P. Komar A.A. Dinman J.D. Barik S. Mazumder B. RNA.. 2007; 13: 2224-2237Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic exacts were carefully layered over 5–50% linear sucrose gradients in polysome buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 units of recombinant RNasin (Promega), and 0.1% Igepal-CA630 (Sigma)) and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm in a Beckman SW32.1 Ti rotor for 18 h at 4 °C. Gradients were fractioned by using an ISCO gradient fractionation system equipped with a UA-6 detector. Light RNP fractions, 40, 60, and 80 S and heavy polysome fractions were monitored by the continuous UV absorption profile at A254, and 22 tubes of 750-μl fractions were collected. The fractions collected in the first eight tubes, representing light RNP and free ribosomes, were used to isolate the translation-inactive pool of mRNAs, and the following fractions were used to isolate the translation-active mRNAs. RNAs were isolated from these fractions by extraction with TRIzol. Statistical Analysis—Survival comparison was analyzed using a Log-Rank test for survivors versus nonsurvivors at day 7. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations from in vivo challenges and macrophages stimulated with TLR ligands. One-way analysis of variance was also used to compare cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels from IRAK2 wild type and deficient macrophages stimulated with TLR ligands. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare LPS-mediated cytokine and chemokine mRNA stabilization in IRAK2 wild type and deficient macrophages. IRAK2 Is Required for TLR4-induced Cytokine and Chemokine Production—We recently generated IRAK2-deficient mice by deleting the promoter, first exon, including the translation start site, and proximal first intron of the Irak2 gene (Fig. 1). To examine the role of IRAK2 in TLR4-mediated pathways, we compared wild type and IRAK2-deficient mice for their susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock. Whereas 80% of the wild type mice died within 7 days of LPS challenge, only 10% of the IRAK2-deficient mice died during this period (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that IRAK2 is critical for the lethal response to LPS in vivo. Consistent with the lethality curve, IRAK2-deficient mice had lower serum cytokine concentrations compared with wild type mice following LPS challenge (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) and chemokine (KC) production were significantly reduced in BM-derived macrophages from IRAK2-deficient mice in response to LPS (TLR4) and R848 (TLR7) stimulation compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that IRAK2 is crucial for TLR-mediated cytokine and chemokine production.FIGURE 2Resistance of IRAK2-deficient mice to LPS-induced septic shock. A, age- and sex-matched wild type (n = 22) and IRAK2-deficient (n = 21) mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (20 mg/kg body weight). Survival was monitored for 7 days after LPS challenge. B, concentrations of TNFα, IL1β, IL 6, and IL 10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera from wild type and IRAK2-deficient mice 0, 1.5, and 3.5 h after injection of LPS (4 mg/kg of body weight).

D, WT or IRAK2-deficient (KO) BM-derived macrophages were untreated or treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or R848 (1 μg/ml). The cell lysates were analyzed by the Western method with antibodies against phospho-JNK, phospho-IKKα/β, total IKKα/β, phospho-IκBα, total IκBα, and actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IRAK2 Is Not Required for Either Early or Late TLR4-induced NFκB Activation—One hour after stimulation, IRAK2-deficient BM-derived macrophages showed similar LPS/R848-induced expression of TNFα and KC mRNAs compared with wild type macrophages, indicating that IRAK2 deficiency does not have a significant impact on TLR4/7-induced transcription at early times (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, LPS/R848 activated the signaling cascade leading to NFκB activation and JNK activation within 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 3, C and D). Previous studies assigned a critical role to IRAK2 in sustaining TLR2-induced NFκB activation (28Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 684-691Google Scholar), and the loss of this prolonging effect could explain the overall reduction in TLR2-induced cytokine and chemokine production in IRAK2-deficient macrophages. We also observed attenuated Malp2-induced NFκB activation at late times in IRAK2-deficient macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, R848-induced late NFκB activation (mediated by TLR7) was also reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this observation, TLR7-dependent induction of TNFα, IL-6, and KC mRNAs was dramatically reduced 4 h after stimulation (Fig. 3B), indicating that IRAK2 was also critical for sustained R848-mediated gene expression. Surprisingly, IRAK2-deficient and wild type macrophages showed similar LPS-induced NFκB DNA binding activity at both early (within 30 min) and late times (within 1–8 h) of stimulation, indicating that IRAK2 is not essential for sustained NFκB activation in TLR4-dependent signaling (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). Whereas the LPS-induced late NFκB activation was normal in IRAK2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3C), the LPS-mediated expression of IL-6 and KC mRNA was reduced at late times (Fig. 3B). Moreover, although IRAK2-deficient macrophages showed reduced TNFα protein production compared with wild type macrophages after LPS stimulation (Fig. 3A), LPS stimulation induced similar levels of TNFα mRNA both early and late (Fig. 3B). Together, these results indicate that the reduced TLR4-induced cytokine and chemokine production in IRAK2-deficient macrophages, and the resistance of IRAK2-deficient mice to LPS-induced septic shock are probably not simply due to lack of sustained TLR4 signaling (NFκB activation) and gene transcription at late times. Therefore, we propose that IRAK2 has a unique role in mediating LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine production. IRAK2 Is Required for Stabilization of a Subset of Cytokine and Chemokine mRNAs in Response to LPS—We previously discovered that the kinase activity of IRAK4 is required to stabilize cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in response to TLR4 activation (26Kim T.W. Staschke K. Bulek K. Yao J. Peters K. Oh K.H. Vandenburg Y. Xiao H. Qian W. Hamilton T. Min B. Sen G. Gilmour R. Li X. J. Exp. Med... 2007; 204: 1025-1036Google Scholar), leading us to hypothesize that IRAK2 might be involved in TLR4-induced cytokine and chemokine mRNA stabilization. To test this hypothesis, we investigated cytokine and chemokine mRNA stability in IRAK2-deficient macrophages in response to LPS. IRAK2-deficient and wild type macrophages were first treated with LPS alone for 1.5 h to induce gene expression, followed by treatment with actinomycin D (to block transcription) and LPS (to stabilize mRNAs) for 0.5–4 h. Although KC and IL-6 mRNAs were induced to comparable levels in IRAK2-deficient and wild type macrophages, the decay rate of those mRNAs was accelerated, and the levels of both messages were lower in BM-derived macrophages from IRAK2-deficient mice as compared with wild type cells (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that, as for IRAK4, IRAK2 is also required for LPS-mediated cytokine and chemokine mRNA stabilization. IRAK2 Plays an Important Role in the Regulation of LPS-mediated Gene Translation—Although the production of TNFα protein was reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages in response to LPS (Fig. 3A), the expression of TNFα mRNA was similar to that in wild type macrophages (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we investigated the role of IRAK2 in the regulation of cytokine and chemokine translation. BM-derived macrophages from IRAK2-deficient and wild type mice were treated with LPS for 1.5 h, and a sucrose gradient was used to separate the mRNA translation-inactive pool (free ribosomes) and translation-active pool (polysomal) (Fig. 5A). Compared with wild type macrophages, the IRAK2-deficient macrophages had more cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in the translation-inactive pool than that in the translation-active pool (Fig. 5B). As a result, the ratios of LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in translation-active versus translation-inactive pools were reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that IRAK2 is essential for normal cytokine and chemokine protein production. IRAK2-deficient macrophages showed reduced capacity to stabilize both KC and IL-6 mRNAs but did not modulate the half-life of TNFα. Although prior studies have demonstrated that TNFα mRNA decay is regulated by changes in decay mediated in part through the action of TTP, there is also significant evidence that translation of TNFα mRNA is a more important regulatory control than its decay (21Hitti E. Iakovleva T. Brook M. Deppenmeier S. Gruber A.D. Radzioch D. Clark A.R. Blackshear P.J. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell Biol... 2006; 26: 2399-2407Google Scholar, 32Andersson K. Sundler R.

Even under conditions of increased stability, TNFα mRNA remains highly unstable, consistent with the more significant role of translational control indicated in the present data. Activation of MAP Kinase Signaling Is Impaired in IRAK2-deficient Macrophages in Response to LPS—To study the role of IRAK2 on TLR4-mediated post-transcriptional control, BM-derived macrophages from wild type and IRAK2-deficient mice were examined for TLR-mediated activation of MAP kinase signaling. Although the phosphorylation of two MAP kinases, p38 and ERK, was slightly reduced in the IRAK2-deficient macrophages in response to LPS (Fig. 6A), the upstream kinase MKK3/6 and downstream effector molecules MNK1 and eIF4E were phosphorylated at lower levels in LPS-treated IRAK2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 6A). Of note, LPS stimulation led to MK2 degradation in wild type macrophages, but not in IRAK2-deficient macrophages, probably reflecting the lack of MK2 activation in the absence of IRAK2 (Fig. 6A). MK2 activation has been shown to play a critical role in LPS-induced TTP modification and stabilization (22Ronkina N. Kotlyarov A. ttrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Hitti E. Milarski K. Askew R. Marusic S. Lin L.L. Gaestel M. Telliez J.B. Mol. Cell Biol... 2007; 27: 170-181Google Scholar). TTP accumulation was reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages upon LPS stimulation compared with wild type macrophages, indicating the potential role of IRAK2 in mediating TLR4-induced TTP stabilization (Fig. 6A). Taken together, these results demonstrate the TLR4-mediated activation of MAP kinase signaling is reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages, indicating a critical role for MAP kinase signaling in LPS-induced IRAK2-mediated post-transcriptional control (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Model of LPS-mediated IRAK2-dependent post-transcriptional control. Upon LPS stimulation in macrophages, IRAK4 is activated, leading to the modification and activation of IRAK1 and IRAK2. While IRAK1 and IRAK2 activate TAK1 and MEKK3 to mediate NFκB activation, the activated IRAK2 recruits kinases (MKK3/6, ERK, p38, MK2, and MNK1) and effector molecules (TRAF6, eIF4E, and TTP) to mediate mRNA stabilization and translation initiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether IRAK2 mediates the activation of MAP kinase signaling through protein-protein interactions, IRAK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of BM-derived macrophages, with or without LPS treatment, followed by Western analysis with antibodies against TRAF6 and components of MAP kinase pathways (Fig. 6B). TRAF6, MKK3, MKK6, and MK2 formed a complex with IRAK2 in an LPS-dependent manner. Importantly, an LPS-dependent IRAK2-MKK3 interaction was also detected in reciprocal experiments in which cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MKK3 followed by Western analysis with IRAK2 antibody (Fig. 6B). However, we failed to detect interaction of p38 with IRAK2. Collectively, these results suggest that IRAK2 forms one or more ligand-dependent signaling complexes with the MAP kinases important for mRNA stabilization and translation, thereby exerting its impact on LPS-induced post-transcriptional control (Fig. 7). We report a novel function for IRAK2 in mediating LPS-triggered post-transcriptional control of cytokine and chemokine expression. Although IRAK2 deficiency did not affect the extent of either early or late TLR4-mediated NFκB activation, a reduction in LPS-mediated mRNA stability contributed to the reduced cytokine and chemokine production observed in BM-derived macrophages from IRAK2-deficient mice. Furthermore, the ratios of LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in translation-active versus translation-inactive pools were lower in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages. These data show the requirement of IRAK2 for sustained translation of these mRNAs. Consequently, the IRAK2-deficient mice were resistant to lethal endotoxic shock, because of impaired proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine induction. A previous study showed that IRAK2 is critical for sustaining NFκB activation at late times during TLR2-mediated signaling (28Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 684-691Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that IRAK2 was also important for TLR7-induced NFκB activation at late times. Therefore, IRAK2 may play a similar role in TLR2- and TLR7-mediated signaling. However, our data demonstrated that IRAK2 was not required for sustained NFκB activation in TLR4-mediated signaling. Although TLR2 and TLR7 mediate NFκB activation solely through a MyD88-dependent pathway, delayed NFκB activation was observed in MyD88-deficient mice upon TLR4 activation with LPS. The TLR4-induced MyD88-independent pathway uses the adaptor molecule TRIF to recruit RIP1 and TRAF6 to mediate late activation of NFκB in response to LPS. This MyD88-independent pathway may compensate for an IRAK2 requirement in sustained NFκB activation in TLR4-mediated signaling. As a result, IRAK2 plays a more critical role following transcription than during its initiation or continuation in TLR4-dependent signaling. Therefore, the lack of LPS-induced cytokine mRNA stabilization and inefficient translation initiation probably accounts for the resistance of the IRAK2-deficient mice to lethal endotoxic shock. Because TLR2- and TLR7-mediated late NFκB activation was reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages, TLR2/TLR7-induced gene transcription was affected, which significantly contributed to the reduced TLR2/7-mediated cytokine and chemokine production in the IRAK2-deficient macrophages. However, it is important to note that TLR7-induced phosphorylation of MKK3/6, MNK1, and eIF4E was significantly reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages, suggesting the potential role of IRAK2 in mediating the TLR7-induced signaling pathway important for post-transcriptional regulation. 5J. Thomas and X. Li, unpublished data. Future studies are required to uncouple transcription from post-transcriptional regulation by using reporter systems (driven by a constitutive promoter or an unrelated inducible promoter and under the control of 3′-untranslated region of cytokines/chemokines) to measure TLR2/TLR7-mediated post-transcriptional regulation with or without IRAK2. Because IRAK4 kinase activity is required for IL-1R and TLR-mediated mRNA stability, IRAK4 substrates are likely to be downstream signaling components that mediate mRNA stabilization. We found that although IRAK4 kinase activity is required for LPS-induced modification of both IRAK1 and IRAK2, IRAK1 and IRAK2 do not depend on each other for modification in response to LPS stimulation. 6T. W. Kim and X. Li, unpublished data. Although it is possible that IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK2 directly upon receptor activation, it has recently been shown that IRAK2 itself also has kinase activity (28Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol... 2008; 9: 684-691Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that IRAK4 mediates the activation of IRAK2, followed by IRAK2 autophosphorylation. Future studies are required to map the IRAK2 phosphorylation sites, identify the kinases for IRAK2 phosphorylation, and study the functional importance of IRAK2 modification. Although the kinase activity of IRAK2 is critical for TLR2-mediated late NFκB activation, it is important to determine whether IRAK2 kinase activity is necessary for the activation of downstream kinases (such as MAPKKKs and MKK3/6) that are known to modulate post-transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, Keating et al. (27Keating S.E. Maloney G.M. Moran E.M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 33435-33443Google Scholar) showed that IRAK2 can promote TRAF6 ubiquitination (27Keating S.E. Maloney G.M. Moran E.M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 33435-33443Google Scholar). In support of their study, we detected IRAK2-TRAF6 interaction upon LPS stimulation. Although TRAF6 appears not to be required for IL-1-induced mRNA stabilization in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (34Hartupee J. Li X. Hamilton T. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 15689-15693Google Scholar), it is possible that TRAF6 or ubiquitinated TRAF6 plays a role in recruiting MKK3/6 to modulate LPS-induced post-transcriptional control in macrophages. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that MKK3/6 and MK2 are associated with IRAK2 in response to LPS, suggesting that IRAK2 may mediate cytokine mRNA stabilization through MAP kinase signaling. A MKK3/6-p38-MK2 signaling cascade has been implicated in LPS-mediated mRNA stabilization through phosphorylation and stabilization of the ARE-binding protein TTP (21Hitti E. Iakovleva T. Brook M. Deppenmeier S. Gruber A.D. Radzioch D. Clark A.R. Blackshear P.J. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell Biol... 2006; 26: 2399-2407Google Scholar, 22Ronkina N. Kotlyarov A. ttrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Hitti E. Milarski K. Askew R. Marusic S. Lin L.L. Gaestel M. Telliez J.B. Mol. Cell Biol... 2007; 27: 170-181Google Scholar). However, p38 was not detected in the IRAK2-MKK3/6-MK2 complex. Furthermore, LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation was only slightly reduced, whereas phosphorylation of MKK3/6, MK2 activation and TTP stability were substantially reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages. These results suggest that MAP kinases other than p38 might be also involved in MKK3/6-mediated activation of the MK2 pathway. In support of this idea, LPS induced similar levels of p38 phosphorylation in IRAK4 kinase-inactive knock-in macrophages and wild type macrophages, despite the fact that the kinase activity of IRAK4 is required for LPS-mediated mRNA stabilization (26Kim T.W. Staschke K. Bulek K. Yao J. Peters K. Oh K.H. Vandenburg Y. Xiao H. Qian W. Hamilton T. Min B. Sen G. Gilmour R. Li X. J. Exp. Med... 2007; 204: 1025-1036Google Scholar). On the other hand, LPS-induced phosphorylation of MKK3/6, MK2 activation and TTP stability were significantly reduced in IRAK4 kinase-inactive knock-in macrophages.6 Data from fractionated polysomes showed that the ratios of LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in translation-active versus translation-inactive pools were reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type macrophages, indicating an important role for IRAK2 in translational control. Previous studies have shown that MNK1 phosphorylates the main CAP-binding protein eIF4E, promoting CAP-dependent translation initiation (23Fukunaga R. Hunter T.

LPS-induced phosphorylation of MNK1 was indeed reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages and IRAK4 kinase-inactive knock-in macrophages. However, although previous studies indicate that MNK1 is a substrate of the p38 and ERK pathways, LPS-induced phosphorylation of these upstream kinases was only modestly reduced in IRAK2-deficient macrophages and not altered in IRAK4 kinase-inactive knock-in macrophages (26Kim T.W. Staschke K. Bulek K. Yao J. Peters K. Oh K.H. Vandenburg Y. Xiao H. Qian W. Hamilton T. Min B. Sen G. Gilmour R. Li X. J. Exp. Med... 2007; 204: 1025-1036Google Scholar), suggesting the possible involvement of additional MAP kinase(s) in the activation of MNK1-mediated translational initiation. In summary, whereas previous studies have shown redundant functions of IRAK1 and IRAK2 in TLR-induced early NFκB activation, IRAK2 is important for late NFκB activation in response to certain TLR ligands (including TLR2 and TLR7). Importantly, we now identify a novel and important function of IRAK2 in TLR4-mediated mRNA stabilization and translational control in macrophages, resulting in resistance of IRAK2-deficient mice to lethal endotoxic shock. Analysis of IRAK1-deficient mice showed that IRAK1 contributes only modestly to TLR-induced cytokine production in macrophages, and IRAK1 deficiency had marginal impact on LPS-induced septic shock (35Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J. Immunol... 2000; 164: 4301-4306Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that IRAK2-mediated post-transcriptional regulation plays a critical role in TLR4-induced cytokine and chemokine production in macrophages (Fig. 7). It is important to note that IRAK1 has been shown to mediate IL-1-induced mRNA stabilization in nonmyeloid cells (34Hartupee J. Li X. Hamilton T. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 15689-15693Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that IL-1-induced mRNA stabilization was greatly reduced in IRAK1-deficient, but only modestly attenuated in IRAK2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells.5 It is possible that IRAK1 and IRAK2 have cell type-specific roles in TLR/IL-1R-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2083541584,"Microbial infection is a critical source of mortality for early life stages of oviparous vertebrates, but parental defenses against infection are less well known. Avian incubation has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of trans-shell infection by limiting microbial growth of pathogenic bacteria on eggshells, while enhancing growth of commensal or beneficial bacteria that inhibit or competitively exclude pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by comparing bacterial assemblages on naturally incubated and experimentally unincubated eggs at laying and late incubation using a universal 16S rRNA microarray containing probes for over 8000 bacterial taxa. Before treatment, bacterial assemblages on individual eggs from both treatment groups were dissimilar to one another, as measured by clustering in non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination space. After treatment, assemblages of unincubated eggs were similar to one another, but those of incubated eggs were not. Furthermore, assemblages of unincubated eggs were characterized by high abundance of six indicator species while incubated eggs had no indicator species. Bacterial taxon richness remained static on incubated eggs, but increased significantly on unincubated eggs, especially in several families of Gram-negative bacteria. The relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa did not change on incubated eggs, but that of 82 bacterial taxa, including some known to infect the interior of eggs, increased on unincubated eggs. Thus, incubation inhibits all of the relatively few bacteria that grow on eggshells, and does not appear to promote growth of any bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1989531836,"Anhydrobiotic animals survive virtually complete loss of cellular water. The mechanisms that explain this phenomenon are not fully understood but often include the accumulation of low molecular weight solutes such as trehalose and macromolecules like Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins. Here we report for the first time the occurrence of a mitochondria-targeted LEA gene (Afrlea3m) product in an animal species. The deduced molecular mass of the 307-amino acid polypeptide from the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana is 34 kDa. Bioinformatic analyses reveal features typical of a Group 3 LEA protein, and subcellular localization programs predict targeting of the mature peptide to the mitochondrial matrix, based on an N-terminal, amphipathic presequence. Real-time quantitative PCR shows that Afralea3m mRNA is expressed manyfold higher in desiccation-tolerant embryonic stages when compared with intolerant nauplius larvae. Mitochondrial localization of the protein was confirmed by transfection of human hepatoma cells (HepG2/C3A) with a nucleotide construct encoding the first 70 N-terminal amino acids of AfrLEA3m in-frame with the nucleotide sequence for green fluorescence protein. The chimeric protein was readily incorporated into mitochondria of these cells. Successful targeting of a protein to human mitochondria by use of an arthropod signaling sequence clearly reveals the highly conserved nature of such presequences, as well as of the import machinery. Finally, mitochondria isolated from A. franciscana embryos, which naturally contain AfrLEA3m and trehalose, exhibit resistance to water stress (freezing) as evidenced by an unchanged capacity for oxidative phosphorylation on succinate + rotenone, a resistance that is absent in mammalian mitochondria lacking AfrLEA3m.

Fluctuation in cellular water content is a universal problem confronting a variety of organisms, and any environmental stress that impacts cellular water poses a risk to life (1Somero G.N. Water and Life.(Osmond, C. B., and Bolis, C. L., eds) pp. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 1992; : 3-18Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some animals are able to cope with virtually complete loss of cellular water for prolonged times (2van Leeuwenhoek A. The Select Works of Antony van Leeuwenhoek.(Hoole, S. ed.), vol. G.

Tolerance to water stress (i.e. evaporative water loss, freezing, and osmotic removal of water) is most likely achieved by several different mechanisms designed to protect and repair the structures and functions of cells and tissues. Many desiccation-tolerant organisms respond to water stress by intracellular accumulation of selected sugars, amino acids and derivatives, and methylamines (often occurring with urea) termed ""compatible"" osmolytes (4Brown A.D.

Chandler P.M. Plant Mol. Biol... 1989; 13: 95-108Google Scholar), and their expression is associated with desiccation tolerance in seeds and anhydrobiotic plants. The expression of LEA proteins is not restricted to plants, having been documented in bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi, nematodes (38Folkert A. Hoekstra F.A. Integr. Comp. Biol... 2005; 45: 725-733Google Scholar, 39Wise M.J. Tunnacliffe A. Trends Plant Sci... 2004; 9: 13-17Google Scholar-40Close T.J. Lammers P.J.

Zool... 2007; 307A: 62-66Google Scholar) and a chironomid insect larva (14Kikawada T. Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Iwata K. Watanabe M. McGee B. Tunnacliffe A. Okuda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2006; 348: 56-61Google Scholar). Among various physiological roles for LEA proteins, stabilization of sugar glasses (vitrified, non-crystalline structure in cells promoted by sugars like trehalose) is often suggested (38Folkert A. Hoekstra F.A. Integr. Comp. Biol... 2005; 45: 725-733Google Scholar), along with protein stabilization via protein-protein interaction (18Grelet J. Benamar A. Teyssier E. Avelange-Macherel M.H.

Such networks have been hypothesized to increase cellular resistance to physical stresses imposed by desiccation (15Goyal K. Tisi L. Basran A. Browne J. Burnell A. Zurdo J. Tunnacliffe A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12977-12984Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that a combination of trehalose and protective proteins works synergistically in providing protection during desiccation (16Goyal K. Walton L.J. Tunnacliffe A. Biochem. J... 2005; 388: 151-157Google Scholar, 43Ma X. Jamil K. Macrae T.H. Clegg J.S. Russell J.M. Villeneuve T.S. Euloth M. Sun Y. Crowe J.H. Tablin F. Oliver A.E.

It is reasonable to hypothesize that mitochondria are preserved during water stress by basically the same mechanisms that govern protection of the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic proteins. Such stabilization of organelles presumably would require LEA proteins to be targeted to multiple cellular locations. Recently, the occurrence of a plant LEA protein that resides in the mitochondria has been reported for pea seeds (18Grelet J. Benamar A. Teyssier E. Avelange-Macherel M.H. Grunwald D. Macherel D. Plant Physiol... 2005; 137: 157-167Google Scholar). Thus far, no evidence exists that animal LEA proteins are accumulated within subcellular structures. Our results document a mitochondria-targeted LEA protein (AfrLEA3m) in desiccation-tolerant embryos of the brine shrimp A. franciscana and underscore the importance of preserving mitochondrial function during water stress in animals. Animals—Encysted embryos of the brine shrimp, A. franciscana Kellogg (Great Salt Lake population), were either obtained in the dehydrated state (post-diapause) from Sanders Brine Shrimp Co. (Ogden, UT) or collected from the surface of the Great Salt Lake in the hydrated state (diapause) (45Covi J.A. Hand S.C. J. Exp. Biol... 2005; 208: 2783-2798Google Scholar). Embryo viability and preservation of the diapause state during storage were evaluated as described previously (46Reynolds J.A. Hand S.C. Physiol. Biochem. Zool... 2004; 77: 366-377Google Scholar). Cells—HepG2/C3A cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) containing OPTI-MEM 1 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Medium was renewed every 3–4 days. For subcultures, cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen) and replated at 1–3 × 106 cells/plate. The number of cells was determined by counting with a hemocytometer (Hausser and Son, Philadelphia, PA). To ensure that the cell cultures were mycoplasma-free, the MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME) was used periodically. Sequencing of Afrlea3m—DNA inserts were sequenced directly from plasmids isolated from bacterial clones picked from a full-length, unidirectional cDNA Library (Lambda Uni-ZAP XR Vector). The library was prepared from poly(A) mRNA purified and pooled from active and diapause stage embryos. Sequencing utilized BigDye terminator chemistry and an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer walking was used to ensure that full-length sequence was obtained. Sequences were assembled using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Bioinformatic Analyses—Sequences were compared with the GenBank™/NCBI data base using BLAST software. The Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (47Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol... 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) was used to construct the hydropathy plot (using ExPASy ProtScale). The hydropathy plot was computed with a 9-residue moving average. The SDSC Biology Workbench 3.2 site was used for multiple sequence alignments (CLUSTALW) and evaluation of amino acid abundance (AASTATS). Secondary structure predictions were run with SOPMA (48Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci... 2000; 25: 147-150Google Scholar), Gor 4, and Porter (at University College Dublin). Subcellular localization of proteins was predicted using TargetP, MitoProt, and Predator. De novo repeat detection in the AfrLEA3m protein sequence was performed with the TRUST Server (IBIVU) and RADAR (Rapid Automatic Detection and Alignment of Repeats). Isolation of Total RNA and Preparation of cDNA for Real-time Quantitative PCR (rtqPCR)—Post-diapause embryos were hydrated and incubated at room temperature in medium equilibrated with air as described previously (45Covi J.A. Hand S.C. J. Exp. Biol... 2005; 208: 2783-2798Google Scholar). Diapause embryos were incubated for 4 days as reported previously (46Reynolds J.A. Hand S.C. Physiol. Biochem. Zool... 2004; 77: 366-377Google Scholar) to allow individuals not in diapause to hatch; larvae and empty shells were removed. To obtain samples of larvae (24 h), swimming nauplii were separated from the shed chorion. After the desired incubation times, RNA extractions were performed with an RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions for animal tissues. The concentration of RNA in each sample was determined spectrophotometrically (A260). The DyNAmo cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), which utilizes M-MuLV RNase H+ reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers, was employed to reverse transcribe total RNA for rtqPCR experiments. rtqPCR Analysis—Quantification of the reverse-transcribed mRNA from various developmental stages of A. franciscana was performed with an iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and SYBR Green. PCR reaction mixes were prepared by using a SYBR Green master mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) with a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Cycling parameter were 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C (15 s) and 60 °C (60 s) followed by a melting curve analysis. Every developmental stage was evaluated with 4–6 independent experiments, each with three nested replicates, and with reference dye normalization. The cycle threshold (Ct) value was determined with the manufacturer's software. After determination of the PCR efficiencies (49Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res... 2001; 29: 2001-2007Google Scholar), all Ct values were normalized to the expression of a bona fide housekeeping gene, α-tubulin (50Zheng Y. Roy P.J. Liang P. MacRae T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1442: 419-426Google Scholar). Primer sequences for α-tubulin were 5′-CGA CCA TAA AAG CGC AGT CA-3′ and 5′-CTA CCC AGC ACC ACA GGT CTC T-3′, and for Afrlea3m, they were 5′-ATA AAG GTG ACA CTC CGC CAC CAA-3′ and 5′-TGC ACC TTC AGC AAC ATC TTT GGC-3′. Values for the -fold change in expression are given as means ± S.E., and significance was assessed by applying the t test of the mean with Minitab 12 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA). Transient Expression of GFP Fusion Protein in HepG2/C3A Cells—Using standard techniques, we fused a nucleotide construct encoding for the first 70 N-terminal amino acids of AfrLEA3m in-frame with the nucleotide sequence for a modified GFP protein harbored in a reporter plasmid (pEGFP-N3 vector, Clontech). The Afrlea3m fragment was obtained by PCR that utilized a forward primer containing the Kozak consensus sequence and the XhoI restriction site (5′-AGT TCT CGA GCC ACC ATG GTG TCC AAG CGT TTA ATT AAA AGC-3′), a reversed primer containing the BamHI restriction site (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATA TTC TGG ATC ATA CTC TCC CTT AGC-3′), and the AfrLEA3m cDNA clone from our library as template. PCR was performed with Phusion hot start DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. After agarose gel electrophoreses, the PCR product was cleaned with the Wizard SV gel clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI). The 210-bp-long PCR product and the destination vector (pEGFP-N3 vector, Clontech) were digested with XhoI and BamHI. After ligation with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), this vector encoding the AfrLEA3m presequence plus GFP was used to transform XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to amplify the plasmid for final sequence confirmation and transfection of mammalian cells. Finally, FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was used to transfect HepG2/C3A cells with the expression vector encoding the above chimeric protein. Control cells were transfected with the unmodified pEGFP-N3 vector. Cellular localization of recombinant protein was visualized by confocal imaging 4 days after cell transfection. Images were acquired with a Leica Microsystems TCS SP2 microscope equipped with a Plan Apo 63× N.A. 1.4 oil immersion lens. Three lasers, 488 nm at 15% power, 543 nm at 25% power, and 633 nm at 50% power, were used to sequentially excite GFP, MitoTracker Red and DRAQ 5 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), respectively. Emission passes of 500–535, 558–613, and 655–746 nm were used to detect the signals. Mitochondrial Respiratory Capacity Pre- and Post-freezing—Mitochondria were isolated from A. franciscana embryos as described by Reynolds and Hand (46Reynolds J.A. Hand S.C. Physiol. Biochem. Zool... 2004; 77: 366-377Google Scholar), and respiration measurements were performed first on fresh preparations using an Oxygraph-2K (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria; (51Gnaiger E. Mendez G. Hand S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 11080-11085Google Scholar)). Briefly, mitochondria were added to a 2.0-ml final volume of respiration medium (240–300 μg/ml mitochondrial protein) that consisted of 0.5 m trehalose, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) BSA (fatty acid-free, fraction V), titrated to pH 7.5 with KOH (total osmolality, 918 mosm). In some experiments, a mammalian respiration medium (MIRO5, Oroboros Instruments) was used for a comparison that consisted of 110 mm sucrose, 60 mm potassium lactobionate, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm taurine, 10 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% BSA (fatty acid-free, fraction V), titrated to pH 7.1 with KOH (total osmolality, 330 mosm). After temperature equilibration at 25 °C, 5 mm succinate plus 1 μm rotenone was added to the chamber, and state 2 respiration was recorded for several minutes. State 3 respiration was initiated by adding 250 μm ADP. State 4 respiration was recorded for at least 5 min once ADP was depleted. Respiration data were analyzed with DatLab software (Oroboros Instruments). Oxygen flux (Jo2 nmol O2 s-1 mg protein-1) was calculated as the time derivative of oxygen concentration, and the respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated as Jo2 (state 3)/Jo2 (state 4). Mitochondria suspended in 500 mm trehalose, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.5) were pipetted in 0.5-ml aliquots into microtubes, wrapped in bubble wrap, and placed in a -80 °C freezer for one month. Samples were thawed, placed on ice, and assayed for respiratory capacity as described above. Mitochondrial protein was assayed using Coomassie Plus™ protein assay reagent and BSA as the standard (Pierce). Sequence Analysis—Afrlea3m encodes a polypeptide of 307 amino acids (Fig. 1A) that exhibits high similarity to LEA proteins found in a wide range of organisms including plants (e.g. accession numbers: NP_190872, Arabidopsis thaliana, thale cress, e-value 3e-14; CAF32327, Pisum sativum, pea, 3e-11), a nematode (NP_001024042, Caenorhabditis elegans, 2e-14), and an insect (BAE92617, Polypedilum vanderplanki, 1e-10). High homology is also found to a recently identified LEA protein from A. franciscana (ACA47268, 2e-12) that was reported earlier by us (41Hand S.C. Jones D. Menze M.A. Witt T.L. J. Exp. Zool... 2007; 307A: 62-66Google Scholar). The percentages of identities of amino acid residues between these proteins and AfrLEA3m average about 29%. Based on all three software programs utilized, a mitochondrial localization is projected for AfrLEA3m: 67.6% probability (Target P), 79.4% (MitoProt II), and 54% (Predator). Target P and MitoProt II software predicts AfrLEA3m to be synthesized as a precursor containing a N-terminal presequence of 29 amino acids (Fig. 1A) that is likely to be cleaved after the protein is imported into the mitochondrion. Such N-terminal, amphipathic leader sequences, when present without other internal targeting sequences, direct proteins to the mitochondrial matrix in almost all cases (52Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14473-14476Google Scholar, 53Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2007; 76: 723-749Google Scholar-54Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2001; 2: 339-349Google Scholar). The deduced molecular mass of the AfrLEA3m polypeptide is 34 kDa and would be reduced to 30.9 kDa upon cleavage of the presequence. The primary structure is highly enriched in amino acids with hydrophilic (58.9%) and charged (37%) residues. Cysteine is not found in the mature protein, a common feature of many LEA proteins; however, multiple cysteines are present in the N-terminal targeting sequence of AfrLEA3m. A common characteristic of group 3 LEA proteins is a high α-helix content (55Wise M.J. BMC Bioinformatics.. 2003; 4: 52-71Google Scholar). Secondary structure analysis carried out with several programs predicts a high proportion of α-helices (SOPMA, 84%; Porter, 75%; Gor4, 61%) in AfrLEA3m and reveals the underrepresentation of glycine and arginine. The primary sequence of AfrLEA3m displays several repeated motifs, which is a common feature of low complexity proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). A motif that bears strong resemblance to the historical 11-mer repeat seen for some group 3 LEA proteins (56Dure III L. Plant J... 1993; 3: 363-369Google Scholar, 57Cumming A.C. Seed proteins.(Shewry, P., and Casey, R., eds) pp. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA. 1999; *: 753-780Google Scholar) is found once in AfrLEA3m (amino acids 130–140) (Fig. 1D), but it does not repeat. A lack of concordance with the historical repeats is not uncommon even among plant LEA proteins (cf. Ref. 18Grelet J. Benamar A. Teyssier E. Avelange-Macherel M.H. Grunwald D. Macherel D. Plant Physiol... 2005; 137: 157-167Google Scholar). Finally, a number of important features for AfrLEA3m can be seen in its hydropathy plot (Fig. 1E). With the exception of the amphipathic presequence that is overall more hydrophobic, the remainder of the protein is very hydrophilic. The repetitive motifs in the mature protein mentioned above can be clearly seen in this plot. Differential Expression of Afrlea3m mRNA in Dehydration-tolerant Stages—There is a strong up-regulation of Afrlea3m mRNA that is tightly associated with the two developmental stages of A. franciscana that are dehydration tolerant: a 9-fold increase in the post-diapause embryo and an 11-fold increase in the diapause embryos, as compared with the dehydration-intolerant nauplius larva (Fig. 1F). These expression profiles are consistent with a functional role for AfrLEA3m in dehydration tolerance. Experimental Evidence for Mitochondrial Targeting—When a nucleotide construct encoding for the first 70 N-terminal amino acids of AfrLEA3m is ligated to the nucleotide sequence for GFP and transfected into human hepatoma cells (HepG2/C3A), the chimeric protein is expressed and then imported into mitochondria (Fig. 2, Aa–Ad). The mitochondrial network of these cells is clearly targeted, as verified by co-localization of Mitotracker red (Fig. 2Ac). In contrast, the GFP lacking the AfrLEA3m leader sequence is not targeted to mitochondria, is dispersed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2Ba), and does not co-localize with Mitotracker Red (Fig. 2Bc). Quantitative confirmation of the presence and absence of co-localization is provided by the scatter plots presented in Fig. 2 (Ad and Bd). These results demonstrate that a mitochondrial targeting sequence is an intrinsic component of AfrLEA3m and strongly suggest that AfrLEA3m is naturally localized to mitochondria of A. franciscana. The results also indicate the highly conserved nature of the protein import machinery for mitochondria of mammalian and invertebrate cells, and indirectly, of the targeting sequence as well. As noted earlier, a synergistic stabilization of proteins by trehalose and LEA protein has been observed (16Goyal K. Walton L.J. Tunnacliffe A. Biochem. J... 2005; 388: 151-157Google Scholar), and a similar synergism has been reported during cell desiccation between trehalose and the stress protein p26 (43Ma X. Jamil K. Macrae T.H. Clegg J.S. Russell J.M. Villeneuve T.S. Euloth M. Sun Y. Crowe J.H. Tablin F. Oliver A.E. Cryobiology.. 2005; 51: 15-28Google Scholar). Thus, we predict that for optimal mitochondrial stabilization by AfrLEA3m, trehalose must be present inside and outside of mitochondria. Like many sugars, trehalose is not permeable to biological membranes. This is a practical problem because evidence shows that trehalose is most effective as a stabilizer during drying when it is present on both surfaces of a membrane (21Chen T. Acker J.P. Eroglu A. Cheley S. Bayley H. Fowler A. Toner M. Cryobiology.. 2001; 43: 168-181Google Scholar, 25Crowe J.H. Crowe L.M. Tablin F. Integr. Comp. Biol... 2005; 44: 542Google Scholar, 42Buchanan S.S.

As water is removed, hydroxyl groups of trehalose form hydrogen bonds with phospholipid head groups on each side of the lipid bilayer and prevent lipid phase transitions during rehydration. Thus, in the dried state, direct contact of trehalose is required with all membrane surfaces of cells, organelles, and macromolecules for optimal preservation. Consistent with the above predictions, our previous studies have shown that mitochondria isolated from rat liver, which contained trehalose artificially loaded into the matrix via transient opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, recovered 86% of their original membrane potential (ΔΨ) upon rehydration following drying to 0.1 g of water/g of solids (trehalose was also present extramitochondrially (17Liu X.H. Aksan A. Menze M.A. Hand S.C. Toner M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2005; 1717: 21-26Google Scholar)). By comparison, 30% of ΔΨ was recovered by mitochondria dried with trehalose present only outside and only 20% in controls without any trehalose at all. Oxidative phosphorylation was partially protected by trehalose outside and loaded within the matrix. These data show that stabilizing both the inner and the outer mitochondrial membranes improves mitochondrial performance after drying. Similarly, Yamaguchi et al. (19Yamaguchi R. Andreyev A. Murphy A.N. Perkins G.A. Ellisman M.H. Newmeyer D.D. Cell Death Differ... 2007; 14: 616-624Google Scholar) showed that when rat liver mitochondria were frozen with trehalose present only extramitochondrially and in the intermembrane space, i.e. absent from the matrix, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was severely compromised. In other words, properties dependent on functionality of the inner membrane were disrupted by freezing, whereas selected properties that only required an intact outer membrane were protected. Importantly, mitochondria isolated from A. franciscana embryos contain trehalose inside the matrix naturally, 3J. A. Reynolds, M. A. Menze, G. D. Elliott, M. Toner, and S. C. Hand, unpublished results. and based on what is reported here, at least one LEA protein (AfrLEA3m) is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Freezing Tolerance of Mitochondria Isolated from A. franciscana Embryos—In light of the above discussion, we chose to freeze mitochondria from A. franciscana embryos in a trehalose solution (with trehalose and AfrLEA3m naturally present internally). Table 1 shows the recovery of remarkably high respiratory control ratios (succinate plus rotenone) for frozen/thawed mitochondria when compared with control, non-frozen mitochondria. These RCR values (ranging from 4.5 to 9.1) are much higher than those reported for mitochondria frozen/thawed without LEA protein but with trehalose present outside (19Yamaguchi R. Andreyev A. Murphy A.N. Perkins G.A. Ellisman M.H. Newmeyer D.D. Cell Death Differ... 2007; 14: 616-624Google Scholar) or for mitochondria desiccated to 0.1 g of water/g of solids with trehalose present both outside and in the matrix but no LEA protein. Future studies will incorporate the addition of cytoplasmic-targeted LEA proteins on the outside of mitochondria to further improve stability during freezing.Table 1Respiration of non-frozen and frozen mitochondria isolated from A. franciscana embryos (succinate + rotenone as substrate) Mitochondria were assayed in medium matching the internal osmotic concentration of A. franciscana mitochondria and in a typical medium used for mammalian mitochondria (MIRO5, see ""Experimental Procedures”).

Further, our data indicate a functional importance of AfrLEA3m for stabilization of animal mitochondria during water stress.

https://openalex.org/W2030283269,"Abnormal accumulation and activation of receptor tyrosine kinase Ron (recepteur d'origine nantais) has been demonstrated in a variety of primary human cancers. We show that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Ron kinase in a highly tumorigenic colon cancer cell line led to reduced proliferation as compared with the control cells. Decreased Ron expression sensitized HCT116 cells to growth factor deprivation stress-induced apoptosis as reflected by increased DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation. In addition, cell motility was decreased in Ron knockdown cells as measured by wound healing assays and transwell assays. HCT116 cells are heterozygous for gain of function mutant PIK3CA H1047R. Analysis of signaling proteins that are affected by Ron knockdown revealed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity of the mutant PI3K as well as AKT phosphorylation was substantially reduced in the Ron knockdown cells compared with the control cells. Moreover, we demonstrated in vivo that knockdown of Ron expression significantly reduced lung metastasis as compared with the control cells in the orthotopic models. In summary, our results demonstrate that Ron plays an essential role in maintaining malignant phenotypes of colon cancer cells through regulating mutant PI3K activity. Therefore, targeting Ron kinase could be a potential strategy for colon cancer treatment, especially in patients bearing gain of function mutant PI3K activity."

MCOs contain four copper ions arranged in two sites: a blue type 1 mononuclear copper center (T1) and a trinuclear copper cluster (T2/T3) consisting of a normal type 2 copper center (T2) and dinuclear type 3 (T3) center (1Solomon E.I.

Substrate oxidation is coupled to reduction of dioxygen to water via electron transfer from the T1 site to the T2/T3 cluster where dioxygen binds (4Sakurai T. Kataoka K. CMLS Cell. Mol.

Because of structural similarities, MCOs are often grouped with copper nitrite reductases (NIRs), which contain both T1 and T2 sites (6Suzuki S. Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and are collectively referred to as multicopper blue proteins (MCBPs) (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MCOs are composed of multiple cupredoxin domains, and both three-domain and six-domain variants have been studied. Three-domain MCOs (3dMCOs) include ascorbate oxidase, laccases, CueO, and Fet3. In these proteins, the T1 site is located in the C-terminal cupredoxin domain, and the T2/T3 cluster is located at the interface between domains 1 and 3 (8Zhukhlistova N.E. Zhukova Y.N.

Ceruloplasmin is a six-domain MCO that houses T1 sites in domains 2, 4, and 6 and a T2/T3 cluster between domains 1 and 6 (10Lindley P.F. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammer B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because of the prevalence of cupredoxin domains, blue copper proteins, and MCOs in nature, understanding their origins has the potential for addressing important questions about the evolution of protein size, function, structure, and complexity (11Rydén L.G. Hunt L.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Several models for the evolution of three- and six-domain MCOs have been proposed. In these models, the key evolutionary intermediates are two-domain ancestral MCOs (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Rydén L.G. Hunt L.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The two-domain MCOs (2dMCOs) are hypothesized to result from a single domain duplication event and have architectures resembling the homotrimeric two-domain NIRs. NIRs contain a T1 site in each domain 1 and a T2 site at the intersubunit interfaces between domains 1 and 2 (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Rydén L.G. Hunt L.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F.

On the basis of genome sequence analysis, three types of two-domain MCOs (2dMCOs) have been predicted and are classified according to the proposed location of the T1 copper sites (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The type A 2dMCOs contain a T1 site in each domain, whereas the type B and type C 2dMCOs contain a single T1 site in the second or first cupredoxin domains, respectively. The latter two types are postulated to have evolved from the type A 2dMCOS. Despite the recent identification of genes encoding 2dMCOs (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), biochemical and structural characterization of these proteins has been limited. The first 2dMCO isolated was blue copper oxidase (BCO, encoded by NE0925 (14Chain P. Lamerdin J. Larimer F. Regala W. Lao V. Land M. Hauser L. Hooper A. Klotz M. Norton J. Sayavedra-Soto L.

Lipscomb J.D. Hooper A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 320-326Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and identified as a type C 2dMCO almost 20 years later (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N.

Of all the 2dMCOs identified by Nakamura et al. (7Nakamura K. Kawabata T. Yura K. Go N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Nakamura K. Go N. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2050-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), BCO was predicted to be the most similar to NIRs. In addition to laccase-like activity, BCO was found to oxidize the ferrous heme groups in hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and cytochrome c-554. Nitrite reductase activity was also observed using reduced cytochrome c-552 as an electron donor (15DiSpirito A.A. Taaffe L.R. Lipscomb J.D. Hooper A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 320-326Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Beyond BCO, three 2dMCOs from Streptomyces have been characterized biochemically: EpoA from Streptomyces griseus (16Endo K. Hayashi Y. Hibi T. Hosono K. Beppu T. Ueda K. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), SLAC from Streptomyces coelicolor (17Machczynski M.C. Vijgenboom E. Samyn B. Canters G.W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and a halotolerant-alkaline laccase from Streptomyces psammoticus (18Niladevi K.N. Jacob N. Prema P. Process Biochem. 2008; 43: 654-660Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences for EpoA and SLAC are known, and sequence alignments indicate they are type B 2dMCOs (13Nakamura K. Go N. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2050-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although the S. psammoticus laccase was not specifically identified as a 2dMCO, its small molecular mass of 43 kDa is suggestive of a 2dMCO. The physiological role of the 2dMCOs is not clear, but the biochemical data indicate substrate specificities similar to three-domain laccases (15DiSpirito A.A. Taaffe L.R. Lipscomb J.D. Hooper A.B.

The crystal structure of the type B 2dMCO SLAC was recently determined to 2.7 Å resolution and revealed a homotrimer with an overall architecture similar to NIRs (19Skálová T. Dohnálek J.

To further understand 2dMCOs and the relationships between NIRs and MCOs, we have determined the crystal structure of a type C 2dMCO, BCO from N. europaea, to 1.9 Å resolution. Cell Growth-N. europaea cells were grown in batch cultures at 30 °C in the dark (20Hyman M.R. Arp D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1534-1545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stein L.Y. Arp D.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (1.5 liters) and polypropylene carboys (9 liters) for 72 h on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) and used for inoculants. Each large scale cell culture (closed high density polyethylene dome tanks, 120-liter cultures) was inoculated with the contents of a carboy. The dome tanks were aerated for about 48 h with an oil-less diaphragm pump (3-5 liter/min) through coarse glass spargers to allow proper mixing. The large scale cell cultures were harvested at ∼0.06 A600 using a tangential-flow system equipped with two ultrafiltration modules (Millipore, MA). The concentrated cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended with an equal volume of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2). This resuspension was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until used. BCO Purification and Activity-For protein isolation, N. europaea cells were sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 129,000 × g. Following a 40% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation step, the supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4 and eluted with 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0). Fractions blue in color were concentrated using an Amicon centrifuge filter (50-kDa molecular mass cutoff, Millipore) and loaded onto a S-200 HiPrep® gel filtration column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Pipes (pH 6.8) and 20 mm NaCl. Oxidation of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) by purified enzyme was measured on a Cary 500 spectrophotometer using 20 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 1 mm ABTS, and 20 mm NaCl (22Bourbonnais R. Paice M.G. Reid I.D. Lanthier P. Yaguchi M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a final protein concentration of 0.275 mg/ml. From five replicates, BCO was found to oxidize ABTS at a rate of 105.1 ± 4.24 μmol·min-1 mg-1 protein. Protein concentration was measured as described previously (15DiSpirito A.A. Taaffe L.R.

Crystallization and Data Collection-Crystals of BCO were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C using 100 mm Tris·HCL (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, and 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentane-diol as a reservoir solution. Protein samples (1 μl of 2.75 mg·ml-1 in 20 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 20 mm NaCl) were mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals grew within 1 day to ∼0.05 mm in the longest dimension and belong to the space group P1 with unit cell dimensions a = 76.1, b = 76.3, c = 105.2, α = 81.5, β = 73.4, γ = 61.8. Crystals were cryoprotected using fresh reservoir solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data sets were collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) (sector 21) beamline ID-D and at the General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA-CAT) (sector 23) beamline ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, IL using a Mar 300 CCD detector. Data sets were processed using the HKL2000 package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement-The structure was solved using copper multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (Table 1). Using autoSHARP, all 24 copper sites were located, and density modification was performed using a solvent content of 47.2% (24Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Doublié S. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2007: 215-230Google Scholar). The initial model was built with Coot (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22527) Google Scholar) using polyalanine chains generated automatically with ARP/wARP (26Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and refined against 1.9 Å diffraction data with Refmac5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Six-fold noncrystallographic symmetry was used in the early stages of refinement. Two homotrimers comprise the asymmetric unit. The final model (Table 1) consists of residues 44-361 for each of the six chains (A-F), 24 copper ions, 2,009 water molecules, and four glycerol molecules. The first 43 residues are predicted to be a periplasmic signal peptide, and the 2 C-terminal residues were not observed in the electron density. A Ramachandran plot calculated with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicates that 100% of the residues are in the most favored and additionally allowed regions. Figures were generated with PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Sequence and Structure Alignments-Sequence alignments (supplemental Fig. S1) were generated using the program T-Coffee (30Poirot O. O'Toole E. Notredame C.

The BCO coordinates were superposed onto coordinates of 13 other MCOs using the Secondary Structure Matching algorithm (32Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3081) Google Scholar). The BCO model used for pairwise superposition onto 3dMCOs consisted of chain A residues 44-318 and residues 179-318 from chain B. As a control, similar constructs of AniA and SLAC were superposed in the same fashion. BCO subunits were also pairwise-superposed onto subunits from five different NIRs. In cases in which the Secondary Structure Matching algorithm presented multiple solutions, the solution with the lowest r.m.s.d. and comparable %sse (percentage of secondary structure of query protein found in target protein) is reported in Table 2 and supplemental Table S2.TABLE 2Structural comparison of BCO with other MCBPsEnzymer.m.s.d.OrganismPDBÅ3dMCOsLaccase1.82Melanocarpus albomyces1GW0Laccase1.82Rigidoporus lignosus1V10Lacasse1.67Trametes trogii2HRGLaccase1.75Coriolus zonatus2HZHLaccase1.75Trametes versicolor1GYCLaccase1.82Cerrena maxima2H5ULaccase1.75Coriolopsis gallica2VDSLaccase1.79Lentinus tigrinus2QT6Laccase1.77Coprinus cinereus1HFUCueO1.91Escherichia coli2FQEFet3p1.69Saccharomyces cerevisiae1ZPUCotA (laccase)1.85Bacillus subtilis1GSKAscorbate oxidase1.43Cucurbita pepo var. melopepo1AOZAverage1.76NIRsAniA2.02Neisseris gonorrhoeae1KBWAxNIR2.15Alcaligenes xylosoxidans1NDTAfNIR2.10Alcaligenes faecalis1AS7AcNIR2.05Achromobacter cycloclastes1NICRsNIR2.06Rhodobacter sphaeroides1ZV2Average2.08BCOAscorbate oxidaseDomain 1Domain 2Domain 3Individual domainsDomain 11.002.001.78Domain 21.821.441.46 Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effect of lattice contacts on the tower loop regions, subunits with tower loops involved in crystal packing (chains A, B, D, E, and F) were superposed onto the tower loop of chain C, which is not involved in lattice formation. Crystal contacts using a 5 Å cut-off were identified using the CCP4 program CONTACT (33Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) and by visual inspection. Residues 189-208 from each subunit were superposed using the program TopMatch (34Sippl M.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2008; 24: 872-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Sippl M.J. Wiederstein M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2008; 24: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Tower loop superposition results can be found in supplemental Table S3. Overall Structure-BCO comprises a cylindrical homotrimer (Fig. 2, A and C). Each subunit consists of two cupredoxin domains (domain 1 and domain 2), and the overall architecture resembles that of NIRs (Fig. 2B). Although primary sequence alignments and three-dimensional superpositions show that the core domains of BCO are well conserved in NIRs (supplemental Fig. S1), there are several significant differences. First, the loop proximal to the T1 site is different. In NIRs, this solvent-exposed loop, referred to as the tower loop (36Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), acts as docking surface for proteinaceous electron donors (37Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Ohnuki T.

Biol. 2002; 315: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NIR tower loop extends from the first β-strand domain 2 to an α-helix ranging in size from one-and-a-half turns to four turns. The corresponding region in BCO is 15 amino acids shorter than that in the NIRs from Alcaligenes faecalis (AfNIR) (40Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Murphy M.E. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 41Murphy M.E. Turley S. Adman E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28455-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (AxNIR) (42Inoue T. Gotowda M. Deligeer Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. Watanabe H. Gohow M. Kai Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 876-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 8 amino acids shorter than that in AniA, a NIR from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Fig. 2D) (43Boulanger M.J. Murphy M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1111-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although AniA lacks part of the tower loop, the effect of the deletion is very different in BCO. In the BCO tower loop region, the first β-strand of the domain 2 is followed by a short 310 helix that extends into a long loop. This loop is positioned similarly to the four-turn α-helix found in both AfNIR and AxNIR despite forming no secondary structure. The C terminus of the AniA tower loop retains some helical structure that aligns well with the C-terminal part of the AfNIR and AxNIR helices. However, the loop regions of AniA and BCO preceding this helix adopt different orientations than the loop regions in AfNIR and AxNIR (Fig. 2D). As a result of the modified tower loop region, the surface of the BCO trimer is much less contoured than those of NIRs. This difference likely explains the in vitro ability of BCO to accept electrons from proteinaceous donors of drastically different shapes and sizes (15DiSpirito A.A. Taaffe L.R. Lipscomb J.D. Hooper A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 320-326Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tower loop region in the N. europaea NIR is also truncated (supplemental Fig. S1). It may be that NIR and BCO from N. europaea can accept electrons from similar protein donors. It is important to note that five of the six tower loops in the asymmetric unit are involved in crystal contacts. Superposition of these tower loops with that from chain C, which is not involved in crystal lattice formation, gives r.m.s.d. values of ∼0.1 Å (supplemental Table S3). Thus, crystal packing cannot account for all the observed conformational differences. The second notable difference between BCO and NIRs is the position of the C terminus. In some NIR structures, the C-terminal extension stabilizes the trimer by forming a β-strand that interacts with the domain 1 β-sheet from an adjacent subunit (41Murphy M.E. Turley S. Adman E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28455-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 44Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Sasaki H. Tanokura M. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12107-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In BCO, the C terminus extends across the solvent-exposed side of domain 2, forming a short β-strand that interacts with domain 1 from the same subunit. The last 10 residues extend over the first two strands of domain 1 toward the T1 site. The Copper Centers-Anomalous difference maps indicate that the BCO trimer contains 12 copper ions, arranged in three T1 sites, and three T2/T3 clusters. The T1 sites are located in domain 1 of each subunit and are ∼13 Å from the nearest T2/T3 cluster. Although access to the BCO T1 site is more limited by the conformation of the tower loop region than in other MCOs, such as Rigidoporus lignosus laccase (RlL) (45Garavaglia S. Cambria M.T. Miglio M. Ragusa S. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Rizzi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the BCO T1 site is still capable of accepting electrons from multiple proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous donors (15DiSpirito A.A. Taaffe L.R. Lipscomb J.D. Hooper A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 320-326Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The T2/T3 sites are positioned at the subunit-subunit interfaces, similar to the location of the T2 site in NIRs. By contrast, the T1 center in 3dMCOs is located in domain 3, and the T2/T3 site is located at the interface between domains 1 and 3. The BCO T1 sites are coordinated by His-99, His-154, and Cys-147 in trigonal planar geometry, as well as an axial methionine, Met-160 (Fig. 3A). The metal-ligand distances are similar to those of other T1 sites (supplemental Table S1). The BCO T2/T3 sites are coordinated by 8 histidines, His-102, His-104, His-146, and His-148 from domain 1 and His-246, His-248, His-294, and His-296 from domain 2 of the adjacent subunit (Figs. 2A and 3, B and C). Similar to other MCOs (46Bento I. Martins L.O. Lopes G.G. Arménia Carrondo M. Lindley P.F. Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3507-3513Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), there are two solvent channels leading to the trinuclear copper cluster. Unlike SLAC, neither of these channels originate from the core of the trimer. The T2 copper ion is coordinated by His-102, His-146, and a solvent ligand. The T3 copper ions are ligated by 3 histidines each and a solvent ligand that is clearly coordinated to Cu3(a) but 2.7-3.0 Å from Cu3(b) (Fig. 3D and supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, the BCO T2/T3 copper ions are coordinated by seven δ nitrogen atoms and one ∈ nitrogen atom similar to most other 3dMCOs, whereas SLAC uses an all ∈ nitrogen ligation similar to ceruloplasmin (19Skálová T. Dohnálek J. Østergaard L.H. Østergaard P.R. Kolenko P. Dusková J. Stepánková A. Hasek J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The average Cu-Cu distances in BCO are 5.04, 4.05, and 4.04 Å (Fig. 3B). These distances are similar to those observed in the crystal structures of laccases from R. lignosus (RlL) (45Garavaglia S. Cambria M.T. Miglio M. Ragusa S. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Rizzi M. J. Mol.

A terminal solvent ligand to Cu3(a) is also observed in the structure of T2-depleted Coprinus cinereus laccase (49Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Østergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pederson A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The BCO Cu-Cu distances are also similar to those in the structure of reduced ascorbate oxidase (50Messerschmidt A. Luecke H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 997-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Superposition of BCO and RlL shows that not only are the metal distances similar, but the arrangement of histidine ligands at the T2/T3 site is well conserved (Fig. 3C). Although ascorbate oxidase was chemically reduced with dithionite, neither BCO nor RlL was treated with reductants. A probab"

The proteome of M. tuberculosis contains over 400 potentially secreted proteins, the majority of which are uncharacterized. A family of seven cutinase-like proteins (CULPs) was identified by bioinformatic analysis, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and characterized in terms of their enzymatic activities. These studies revealed a functional diversity of enzyme classes based on differential preferences for substrate chain length. One member, Culp1, exhibited strong esterase activity, 40-fold higher than that of Culp6, which had strong activity as a lipase. Another, Culp4, performed moderately as an esterase and weakly as a lipase. Culp6 lipase activity was optimal above pH 7.0, and fully maintained to pH 8.5. None of the CULP members exhibited cutinase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of each residue of the putative catalytic triad in Culp6 confirmed that each was essential for activity toward all fatty acid chain lengths of nitrophenyl esters and lipolytic function. Culp1 and Culp2 were present only in culture supernatants of M. tuberculosis, while Culp6, which is putatively essential for mycobacterial growth, was retained in the cell wall, suggesting the proteins play distinct roles in mycobacterial biology."
https://openalex.org/W2065787148,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptor syndecan-1 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal LG4/5 domain in laminin 332 (alpha3LG4/5) and participates in cell adhesion and spreading. To dissect the function of syndecan-1 in these processes, we made use of a cell adhesion model in which syndecan-1 exclusively interacts with a recombinantly expressed alpha3LG4/5 fragment. Plating HT1080 cells on this fragment induces the formation of actin-containing protrusive structures in an integrin-independent manner. Here we show that syndecan-1-mediated formation of membrane protrusions requires dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in syndecan-1. Accordingly, inhibition of phosphatases with orthovanadate decreases cell adhesion to the alpha3LG4/5 fragment. We demonstrate that the PDZ-containing protein syntenin-1, known to connect cytoskeletal proteins, binds to syndecan-1 in cells plated on the alpha3LG4/5 fragment and participates in the formation of membrane protrusions. We further show that syntenin-1 recruitment depends on the dephosphorylation of Tyr-309 located within syndecan-1 PDZ binding domain EFYA. We propose that tyrosine dephosphorylation of syndecan-1 may regulate its association with cytoskeleton components."
https://openalex.org/W2059176541,"Flavins are employed to transform physical input into biological output signals. In this function, flavins catalyze a variety of light-induced reactions and redox processes. However, nature also provides flavoproteins with the ability to uncouple the mediation of signals. Such proteins are the riboflavin-binding proteins (RfBPs) with their function to store riboflavin for fast delivery of FMN and FAD. Here we present in vitro and in vivo data showing that the recently discovered archaeal dodecin is an RfBP, and we reveal that riboflavin storage is not restricted to eukaryotes. However, the function of the prokaryotic RfBP dodecin seems to be adapted to the requirement of a monocellular organism. While in eukaryotes RfBPs are involved in trafficking riboflavin, and dodecin is responsible for the flavin homeostasis of the cell. Although only 68 amino acids in length, dodecin is of high functional versatility in neutralizing riboflavin to protect the cellular environment from uncontrolled flavin reactivity. Besides the predominant ultrafast quenching of excited states, dodecin prevents light-induced riboflavin reactivity by the selective degradation of riboflavin to lumichrome. Coordinated with the high affinity for lumichrome, the directed degradation reaction is neutral to the cellular environment and provides an alternative pathway for suppressing uncontrolled riboflavin reactivity. Intriguingly, the different structural and functional properties of a homologous bacterial dodecin suggest that dodecin has different roles in different kingdoms of life."
https://openalex.org/W2032385067,"MutSα (MSH2/MSH6) and MutSβ (MSH2/MSH3) are eukaryotic mismatch recognition proteins that preferentially process base-base and small insertion/deletion (ID) mispairs, respectively, despite the fact that cells contain a MutSα:MutSβ ratio of 10:1. To explore the mechanism underlying the differential mismatch recognition by these two proteins, purified human MutSα and MutSβ were analyzed individually and competitively for their abilities to interact with a T-G and an ID substrate. We show that MutSα has KD values of 26.5 and 38.2 nm for the G-T and ID substrates, respectively, and that MutSβ has KD values of 76.5 and 23.5 nm for G-T and ID, respectively. Consistent with these results, competitive binding assays revealed the following relative binding affinities: MutSβ-ID > MutSα-T-G > MutSα-ID ≫ MutSβ-T-G. Interestingly, binding of MutSβ to ID heteroduplexes is greatly stimulated when the MutSα:MutSβ ratio is ≥10. Distinct ATP/ADP binding and ATPase activities of MutSα and MutSβ were also observed. In the absence of DNA, ADP binding and ATPase activities of MutSβ are significantly higher than those of MutSα. However, interaction with DNA significantly stimulates the MutSα ATPase activity and reduces the MutSβ ATPase activity, the consequence being that both proteins exhibit the same level of hydrolytic activity. We conclude that the preferential processing of base-base and ID heteroduplexes by MutSα and MutSβ is determined by their significant differences in ATPase activity, ADP binding activity, and high cellular MutSα:MutSβ ratio.

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 2The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; ID, insertion/deletion mismatch; nt, nucleotide. 2The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; ID, insertion/deletion mismatch; nt, nucleotide. plays an important role in maintaining genome stability by primarily correcting both base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion (ID) mispairs generated during DNA replication (1.Li G.-M. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The MMR system is highly conserved as both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use a similar group of protein factors and a similar repair mechanism for correcting mispairs. MMR reactions in Escherichia coli and human cells have been reconstituted with purified proteins (2.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar).Mismatch recognition is a critical step of MMR. In E. coli, recognition of both base-base and ID mismatches is conducted by the MutS protein. However, at least two mismatch recognition proteins, MutSα (the MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer) and MutSβ (the MSH2/MSH3 heterodimer), have been identified in eukaryotic cells, and each of them is a heterodimeric complex. Both genetic and biochemical studies suggest that MutSα and MutSβ have partially overlapping functions, with MutSα targeting base-base mismatches and 1-2-nucleotide (nt) ID mispairs and MutSβ targeting ≥2-nt but ≤16-nt ID heteroduplexes (5.Genschel J.

A recent genetic study in yeast suggests that MutSβ may also play some role in the repair of base-base mismatches (9.Harrington J.M. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells make ∼10-fold more MutSα than MutSβ, and overexpression of MSH3 results in a strong mutator phenotype (10.Drummond J.T. Genschel J. Wolf E. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

It is unclear how MutSα and MutSβ, at a 10:1 ratio, partition in cells to specifically process their favored substrates.In addition to the mismatch binding activity, all MutS proteins, from E. coli to humans, contain an ATPase activity and ATP and ADP binding activities (12.Lamers M.H.

Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that two subunits of yeast MutSα exhibit differential nucleotide binding ability: the MSH6 subunit has a higher affinity for ATP binding than the MSH2 subunit, but the MSH2 subunit exhibits a higher affinity for ADP binding than the MSH6 subunit. ATP hydrolysis by MutS proteins is thought to promote translocation of these proteins along DNA helixes (27.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or to verify MutS mismatch binding and authorize the eventual repair reaction (18.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although much of the work concerning ATP/ADP binding and hydrolysis is conducted with bacterial MutS and eukaryotic MutSα, it is not known whether or not these activities in MutSβ are different from those of MutSα and whether or not they contribute to specific recognition of ID heteroduplexes by MutSβ.To address these issues, purified human MutSα and MutSβ were analyzed individually and competitively for their ability in base-base and ID mismatch recognition, ATP/ADP binding, and ATP hydrolysis. We identified some hitherto unknown properties of these two mismatch recognition proteins and their striking differences in nucleotide binding and ATPase activities. The possible involvement of these novel properties and activities in differential mismatch recognition by MutSα and MutSβ is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant MMR Proteins—Human MutSα and MutSβ were expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system. Baculovirus stocks for the human MSH2, MSH6, and MSH3 genes were generous gifts of Josef Jiricny (University of Zurich). MutSα and MutSβ were overexpressed and purified essentially as described previously (4.Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.-M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 17.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified to near homogeneity. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.Gel Shift Analysis—Gel shift assays were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 110 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide heteroduplexes, and MutSα and/or MutSβ in the presence of a 10-fold excess amount of unlabeled oligonucleotide homoduplex. The reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 50% (w/v) sucrose. Samples were loaded on and separated by electrophoresis through a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in buffer containing 50 mm Tris borate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The buffer was recirculated during electrophoresis (28.Gu L. Li G.-M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and analyzed by a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare).Nucleotide UV Cross-linking and ATPase Analyses—The nucleotide cross-linking assays were performed essentially as described (26.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were assembled and incubated on ice in nucleotide binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol in the presence or absence of 5 mm MgCl2. Where specified, DNA heteroduplex or homoduplex was added 10 min prior to addition of nucleotide. MutSα or MutSβ was mixed with [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]ADP, or [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 10 min. Samples were then subjected to 10 min of UV cross-linking (Stratalinker), followed immediately by fractionation by 8% SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled bands were quantified using a Phosphor-Imager. [α-32P]ADP was generated by incubating [α-32P]ATP with hexokinase and purified as described (26.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of MutSα and MutSβ was assayed in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 110 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2,[γ-32 P]ATP, and the indicated amount of proteins and DNA substrates. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated and fractionated through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 32P-containing species were detected and quantified by PhosphorImager.RESULTSBinding of a G-T and a 2-nt ID DNA Substrate by MutSα and MutSβ—To examine the molecular basis by which MutSα and MutSβ play differential roles in the repair of base-base mismatches and ID mispairs, purified recombinant human MutSα and MutSβ were examined for their ability to interact with a 31-mer oligonucleotide duplex containing a G-T mismatch and a 50-mer duplex containing a 2-nt ID mispair, which are referred to as G-T and ID, respectively (Fig. 1A). In initial studies, the binding constants were determined for each protein/DNA substrate pair. Binding reactions were carried out in reactions with a constant DNA substrate concentration (5 nm) and a variable concentration of MutSα (7.5-75 nm) or MutSβ (16-48 nm). Reaction products were visualized by the gel shift method and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Representative gel shift assays are shown in Fig. 1 (B and D). The fraction of bound and unbound DNA substrate was determined, and the values were plotted (Fig. 1, C and E).Steady-state binding analysis showed that the KD values of MutSα for the G-T and ID substrates were 26.5 and 38.2 nm, respectively. For MutSβ, the KD values for G-T and ID DNA substrates were 76.5 and 23.5 nm, respectively. Thus, MutSα has an ∼1.5-fold higher affinity for the base-base mismatched substrate than for the ID substrate, whereas MutSβ has an ∼3-fold higher affinity for the ID substrate than for the base-base mismatched substrate. To confirm this result, each protein was co-incubated with the G-T and ID DNA substrates in competition with each other by gel shift analysis (Fig. 2). Binding reactions were carried out in reactions with 6 nm MutSα and different ratios of the two DNA substrates (i.e. 5 nm G-T and 0-40 nm ID substrate or 5 nm ID substrate and 0-40 nm G-T DNA substrate). As shown in Fig. 2A, although the increase in the ID:G-T ratio is associated with the increased amount of free G-T substrate (lanes 5-8), only <50% of the free G-T probe is seen in the presence of an 8-fold excess amount of the ID substrate (compare the amount of free G-T substrate between lanes 1 and 8), indicating that at least 50% of the G-T substrate remains bound under this condition. When the substrate ratio was reversed (Fig. 2A, lanes 9-11), unbound ID substrate was almost kept at the same level as the input (compare the amount of free ID substrate in lanes 9-11 with that in lane 2). These results are consistent with the KD values of MutSα for these two substrates described above and support the notion that MutSα preferentially binds to base-base mismatches.FIGURE 2Competitive binding of MutSα or MutSβ to T-G and ID heteroduplexes. Gel shift analyses were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the indicated proteins and heteroduplexes. A, competitive binding of T-G and ID to MutSα; B, competitive binding of T-G and ID to MutSβ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In competitive binding reactions with MutSβ (Fig. 2B), the ID DNA substrate is bound preferentially in the examined conditions. When the two DNA substrates are equal in concentration (Fig. 2B, lane 5), the amount of unbound ID substrate is about the same (if not less) as that in the reaction containing only the ID substrate (lane 4); almost all G-T substrates exist in unbound form when excess amounts of ID are present (lanes 6-8). In contrast, a molar excess of the G-T substrate only slightly reduces the fraction of the ID DNA substrate bound by MutSβ (Fig. 2B, lanes 9-11). Comparing the corresponding reactions in Fig. 2 (A and B) also draws a clear conclusion that the preferred substrate for MutSα or MutSβ is the G-T or ID heteroduplex, respectively. These results are consistent with the KD values for the enzyme/DNA substrate pairs noted above.High MutSα:MutSβ Ratios Stimulate MutSβ Binding to ID Substrates—Cells express both MutSα and MutSβ, and the two proteins may compete for binding to the same DNA heteroduplexes, especially those that are well recognized by both proteins. To simulate the situation in vitro, MutSα and MutSβ were co-incubated with a 2-nt ID substrate, and the reaction products were analyzed by gel shift analysis. Protein-DNA complexes with MutSα and MutSβ were distinguished by their ability to be “supershifted” by an anti-MSH3 antibody, which specifically supershifts the MutSβ-DNA complex but not the DNA substrate and/or the MutSα-DNA complex (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Surprisingly, increasing amounts of MutSα stimulate binding of MutSβ to the ID DNA substrate. When a reaction contained a MutSα:MutSβ ratio ≥10 (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10), >3-fold MutSβ-DNA complex (see arrow) supershifted by the anti-MSH3 antibody was observed (compare lanes 9 and 10 with lane 6). No supershifted products were detected in the same reactions without MutSβ (Fig. 3B), consistent with the fact that the antibody is highly specific to MutSβ. The enhanced interaction between MutSβ and the ID heteroduplex appears to be specifically mediated by MutSα because the addition of bovine serum albumin, regardless of the amount of protein used, did not promote binding of MutSβ to the ID substrate (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these observations suggest that a MutSα:MutSβ ratio ≥10 is necessary to stimulate MutSβ affinity for its preferred DNA substrates.FIGURE 3High MutSα:MutSβ ratios stimulate MutSβ-ID interaction. Unless otherwise specified, gel shift assays were performed (see “Experimental Procedures”) using 20 nm MutSα and 16 nm MutSβ. An antibody (Ab; 400 ng) against the MSH3 subunit of MutSβ was used, as indicated, to supershift the MutSβ-ID complex. A, stimulation of the MutSβ-ID interaction (arrow) by high concentrations of MutSα. The MutSα concentrations used were 40, 80, 160, and 240 nm in lanes 7-10, respectively. B, the MSH3 antibody does not supershift the MutSα-ID complex. The MutSα concentrations used were 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm in lanes 3-7, respectively. C, bovine serum albumin (BSA) at high concentrations does not stimulate the MutSβ-ID interaction. The bovine serum albumin concentrations used were 80, 160, and 320 nm in lanes 5-7, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MutSα and MutSβ Possess Distinct Nucleotide Binding Activities—MutS protein family members share a conserved ATP/ADP-binding site and ATPase activity. Previous studies have shown that binding to ATP/ADP and hydrolysis of ATP by MutS or MutSα play a crucial role in MMR, including verifying mismatch recognition and authorizing the repair (18.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To explore whether MutSα and MutSβ possess differential ATP/ADP binding and hydrolysis activities, which may contribute to their distinct mismatch recognitions, purified MutSα and MutSβ were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP with or without DNA substrates. Bound ATP was immobilized by UV cross-linking, and reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by a PhosphorImager. Under these conditions, the MSH6 subunit of MutSα is cross-linked much more efficiently to ATP than the MSH2 subunit of the protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4), consistent with previous observations for yeast MutSα (26.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the MSH2 and MSH3 subunits of MutSβ are cross-linked to ATP with similar efficiency (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-4). Interestingly, whereas DNA duplexes, regardless of homoduplex (G-C) or heteroduplex (G-T or ID), have little effect on ATP binding to MutSα (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4), they significantly reduce the MutSβ-ATP interaction (compare lane 1 with lanes 2-4 in Fig. 4B). When the reactions were performed in the presence of Mg2+, which supports ATP hydrolysis, little 32P-labeled MutSα was detected in reactions containing [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-8), consistent with the fact that the 32P-labeled phosphate (at the γ-position) is hydrolyzed by MutSα ATPase activity (26.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, under the same conditions, enhanced cross-links were observed in the MSH2 subunit of MutSβ in the presence of DNA (Fig. 4B, lanes 6-8). This result suggests that MutSβ, when interacting with DNA duplexes, has adapted a conformation in favor of ATP binding but not hydrolysis, and this seems to apply only to MSH2 but not MSH3 (Fig. 4B, lanes 6-8).FIGURE 4Binding of MutSα and MutSβ to ATP or ADP. MutSα (A, C, and E) or MutSβ (B, D, and F) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]ATP, or [α-32P]ADP, as indicated, in the presence or absence of the indicated DNA duplexes and 5 mm MgCl2, followed by UV cross-linking and SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 32P-cross-linked subunits were detected by a Storm PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar cross-linking experiments were performed by substituting [γ-32P]ATP with [α-32P]ATP (Fig. 4, C and D). As expected, in the absence of Mg2+ (i.e. no ATP hydrolysis), the amount of ATP cross-links to individual subunits of MutSα or MutSβ is essentially the same as observed in reactions with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1-4 in A and C for MutSα and in B and D for MutSβ). Under conditions that support ATP hydrolysis (i.e. in the presence of Mg2+), the MSH2 subunit but not the MSH6 subunit of MutSα was preferentially labeled (Fig. 4C, lanes 5-8), consistent with the observation with yeast MutSα (26.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of MutSβ, both subunits were well labeled, with a better cross-link for MSH2 (Fig. 4D, lanes 5-8). Apparently, DNA plays an inhibitory role in MutSβ cross-linking with [α-32P]ATP, as judged by the fact that much intense labeling was detected for both MSH2 and MSH3 in the absence of DNA substrates (Fig. 4D, lane 5). Because Mg2+ stimulates ATP hydrolysis and because DNA substrates selectively block Mg2+-provoked ATP hydrolysis by MutSβ (Fig. 4B, lanes 6-8), the 32P-labeled proteins in Fig. 4D could result from cross-linking to [α-32P]ATP (without hydrolysis), [α-32P]ADP (with hydrolysis), or both.To distinguish these possibilities, cross-linking experiments were conducted in the presence of [α-32P]ADP. As shown in Fig. 4E, only the MSH2 subunit of MutSα interacts with ADP. Interestingly, this interaction is greatly enhanced in the presence of Mg2+ (compare lanes 5-8 with lanes 1-4, respectively, in Fig. 4E), and the enhancement is more pronounced in reactions containing heteroduplexes (lanes 7 and 8). The cross-linking experiments performed with MutSβ reveal that in the absence of Mg2+, the protein behaves similarly to MutSα, i.e. only the MSH2 subunit cross-links to ADP (Fig. 4F, lanes 1-4); however, addition of Mg2+ to the reaction not only stimulates the MSH2-ADP interaction but also promotes the MSH3 subunit to interact with the nucleotide (lanes 5-8). ADP appears to bind equally well to MSH2 and MSH3 in the presence of Mg2+ and the absence of DNA (Fig. 4F, lane 5); DNA greatly reduces the affinity of MSH3 but not that of MSH2 for ADP (lanes 6-8). Similar to the interaction between MutSα and ADP, there appeared to be a little more ADP binding to the MSH2 subunit of MutSβ in the reaction containing the ID substrate (Fig. 4F, lane 8). These results may explain why Mg2+ is required for mismatch binding by MutS (29.Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and why MutS proteins in their ADP-bound form possess a higher affinity for heteroduplexes (18.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30.Fishel R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1239-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Comparing data in Fig. 4 (D and F), it appears that the cross-links in D (lanes 5-8) contain components of both ADP and ATP. These observations suggest that DNA stimulates the ATPase activity of MutSα, but it slightly inhibits the ATPase activity of MutSβ.MutSα and MutSβ Possess Distinct ATPase Activities—The ATPase activity of MutS proteins is essential for their functions in MMR (17.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19.Studamire B. Quach T. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7590-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the ATPase activity of MutSα could be stimulated by homo- or heteroduplex DNA although to different extents (20.Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31.Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is any difference in ATPase activity between MutSα and MutSβ, which may contribute to their preferential mismatch recognition, the purified human MutS heterodimers were assayed for their ability to hydrolyze [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of DNA substrates. The 32P-containing species, i.e. the unreacted [γ-32P]ATP and the hydrolyzed [γ-32P]phosphate, were detected after gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5, A and B). The results indicate that in the absence of DNA substrates, MutSβ exhibited a much more active ATPase activity than MutSα at all concentrations and time points tested (Fig. 5, C and D). However, DNA substrates, regardless of a homoduplex and a heteroduplex, significantly stimulated the ATPase activity of MutSα (Fig. 5D; also compare lane 7 with lanes 8-10 in Fig. 5A), consistent with previous observations. Surprisingly, DNA substrates were found to inhibit MutSβ ATPase activity by ∼ 20% (Fig. 5D; also compare lane 7 with lanes 8-10 in Fig. 5B)."

https://openalex.org/W2170468070,"The cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6 is an important regulator of cellular pathways that include response to stress, protein folding, microtubule stability, and cell migration, thus representing an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. However, little is known about its upstream regulation. Our previous work has implicated HDAC6 as a new protein target for the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), although HDAC6 lacks a farnesylation motif. Here we show that the protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) and HDAC6 are present in a protein complex together with microtubules in vivo and in vitro. FTase binds microtubules directly via its alpha subunit, and this association requires the C terminus of tubulin. Treatment with an FTI removed FTase, but not HDAC6, from the protein complex, suggesting that the active form of FTase is bound to microtubules. Importantly, the removal of FTase from microtubules abrogated HDAC6 activity, as did a stable knockdown of the alpha subunit of FTase (FTalphaKD). Interestingly, the FTalphaKD cells showed increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of Taxol and the FTI lonafarnib when used either as single agents or in combination as compared with parental cells. Altogether, these data suggest that FTase, via its tubulin-association, is a critical upstream regulator of HDAC6 activity and that FTase expression could help stratify cancer patients that would most benefit from this treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2043501072,"The spindle checkpoint is a cell cycle surveillance system that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation. In mitosis, it elicits the “wait anaphase” signal to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome until all chromosomes achieve bipolar microtubule attachment and align at the metaphase plate. Because a single kinetochore unattached to microtubules activates the checkpoint, the wait anaphase signal is thought to be generated by this kinetochore and is then amplified and distributed throughout the cell to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Several spindle checkpoint kinases participate in the generation and amplification of this signal. Recent studies have begun to reveal the activation mechanisms of these checkpoint kinases. Increasing evidence also indicates that the checkpoint kinases not only help to generate the wait anaphase signal but also actively correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects. The spindle checkpoint is a cell cycle surveillance system that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation. In mitosis, it elicits the “wait anaphase” signal to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome until all chromosomes achieve bipolar microtubule attachment and align at the metaphase plate. Because a single kinetochore unattached to microtubules activates the checkpoint, the wait anaphase signal is thought to be generated by this kinetochore and is then amplified and distributed throughout the cell to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Several spindle checkpoint kinases participate in the generation and amplification of this signal. Recent studies have begun to reveal the activation mechanisms of these checkpoint kinases. Increasing evidence also indicates that the checkpoint kinases not only help to generate the wait anaphase signal but also actively correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects. Faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes into each daughter cell is essential for genetic stability. Defects in chromosome segregation result in aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer cells. The spindle checkpoint is a cell cycle surveillance system that monitors kinetochore-microtubule attachment and guards against chromosome missegregation (1.Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2.Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). When activated, the spindle checkpoint inhibits the multisubunit ubiquitin ligase, the APC/C, 2The abbreviations used are:APC/Canaphase-promoting complex/cyclosomeCPCchromosome passenger complexMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseRNAiRNA interferenceAPCadenomatosis polyposis coli. through interfering with the functions of its mitotic activator, Cdc20 (3.Yu H.

Inhibition of APC/C blocks sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit until all pairs of opposing sister kinetochores attach to microtubules emanating from the two opposite spindle poles, referred to as amphitelic attachment. Once all sister chromatids achieve amphitelic attachment, the spindle checkpoint is turned off, and APC/C is activated. APC/C then promotes the degradation of securin and cyclin B (Fig. 1). Degradation of securin and cyclin B activates separase, which cleaves cohesin to trigger separation of sister chromatids. Cyclin B degradation also inactivates Cdk1 to allow mitotic exit. The separated sister chromatids are then distributed evenly into the two daughter cells through their attachment to the mitotic spindle. anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome chromosome passenger complex mitogen-activated protein kinase RNA interference adenomatosis polyposis coli. The core components of the spindle checkpoint in human cells include Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benomyl 1), Bub3, BubR1, Mad1 (mitotic arrest deficiency 1), Mad2, Mps1 (monopolar spindle 1), and the CPC that consists of Aurora B, INCENP, survivin, and borealin (1.Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2.Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). They are recruited to kinetochores at prometaphase and promote the formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex, consisting of BubR1, Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20, for APC/C inhibition (Fig. 1). A single unattached kinetochore is sufficient to activate the spindle checkpoint, suggesting that certain steps of checkpoint signaling must be catalytic. Indeed, several spindle checkpoint components are protein kinases, including Bub1, BubR1, Mps1, and Aurora B. The kinase activities of Bub1, Mps1, and Aurora B are required for the spindle checkpoint. Recent studies have shed light on the activation mechanisms of these kinases. It has also become increasingly clear that, in addition to monitoring kinetochore-microtubule attachment, the spindle checkpoint kinases actively promote proper attachment of microtubules to kinetochores. The dual functions of these checkpoint kinases ensure equal partition of sister chromatids during mitosis and maintain genetic stability. The kinetochore localization of spindle checkpoint components is a prerequisite for checkpoint signaling (Fig. 1). The recruitment of spindle checkpoint proteins to kinetochores is hierarchical, i.e. the kinetochore recruitment of some depends on the prior recruitment of others. Aurora B, Mps1, and Bub1 lie at the top of this hierarchy, whereas BubR1, Mad1, and Mad2 lie downstream (5.Vigneron S. Prieto S. Bernis C. Labbe J.C. Castro A. Lorca T. Mol. Biol.

The kinetochore localization of the spindle checkpoint kinases appears to be required for their activation and function. For instance, chromosome-bound Bub1 is hyperphosphorylated (9.Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to the core spindle checkpoint kinases such as Mps1, Bub1, BubR1, and Aurora B, several other kinases, including Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1), Nek2A, Chk1, MAPK, and Cdk1, localize to kinetochores (10.Arnaud L.

Cell. 2008; 14: 474-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that the kinetochore is a hub for kinase signaling. Recent studies have begun to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which these kinases are recruited to and activated at the kinetochores. A conserved network of kinetochore proteins referred to as the KMN network is necessary and sufficient for capturing microtubules in Caenorhabditis elegans (16.Cheeseman I.M. Chappie J.S. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Desai A. Cell. 2006; 127: 983-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The KMN network consists of KNL-1, the Mis12 complex, and the Ndc80 complex. The calponin homology domains of an Ndc80 dimer (called Hec1 in humans) directly bind to microtubules, and this interaction is regulated by phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of Ndc80 by Aurora B (17.DeLuca J.G. Gall W.E. Ciferri C. Cimini D. Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 969-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). KNL-1 has additional microtubule-binding activities that strengthen microtubule binding of the KMN network (16.Cheeseman I.M. Chappie J.S. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Desai A. Cell. 2006; 127: 983-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Several proteins within this network have been implicated in recruiting spindle checkpoint proteins to kinetochores. The Ndc80 complex is required for the kinetochore recruitment of Mps1, Mad1, and Mad2 (18.Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Recently, Kiyomitsu et al. (19.Kiyomitsu T. Obuse C. Yanagida M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) showed that the human KNL-1 protein called blinkin was likely the direct kinetochore receptor for Bub1 and BubR1. Therefore, blinkin and the KMN network appear to be the platform for the docking of Bub1, BubR1, and possibly other spindle checkpoint kinases at the kinetochore. Microtubule binding reduces the concentrations of the spindle checkpoint kinases at the kinetochores. A similar set of kinetochore proteins, the KMN network, is responsible for both microtubule capture and recruitment of checkpoint proteins. Competitive binding of microtubules and spindle checkpoint proteins to the KMN network thus provides a straightforward on-and-off switch for the spindle checkpoint (15.Burke D.J. Stukenberg P.T. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 474-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). How does kinetochore recruitment activate the checkpoint kinases? Two recent studies suggest that kinetochore targeting elevates the local concentrations of these kinases and enhances their trans-autophosphorylation, leading to their activation. The first study by Kelly et al. (20.Kelly A.E. Sampath S.C. Maniar T.A. Woo E.M. Chait B.T. Funabiki H. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) dealt with the activation mechanism of Aurora B. Aurora B had been shown to be activated by autophosphorylation at Thr232 in its activation loop and by phosphorylation of the C-terminal TSS motif in its binding partner INCENP (21.Yasui Y. Urano T. Kawajiri A. Nagata K. Tatsuka M. Saya H. Furukawa K. Takahashi T. Izawa I. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12997-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22.Honda R. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 23.Kang J. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Kelly et al. showed that the microtubule-destabilizing protein Op18 underwent Aurora B-dependent hyperphosphorylation after the addition of sperm nuclei or purified centrosomes in Xenopus egg extracts. When antibodies against the CPC were included in the extracts, Op18 was hyperphosphorylated without chromosomes or centrosomes. Antibody addition also increased the phosphorylation of the TSS motif of INCENP. These results suggested that induced dimerization of the CPC through antibody binding activated Aurora B. The results of Kelly et al. further suggested that the kinetochore and chromosome localization of CPC might enhance the autophosphorylation and activation of Aurora B because of its high local concentration and clustering at these structures. In the second study, Kang et al. (24.Kang J. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Yu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20232-20237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that activation of Mps1 also involved trans-autophosphorylation of its activation loop. Mattison et al. (25.Mattison C.P. Old W.M. Steiner E. Huneycutt B.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Winey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30553-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) first reported that autophosphorylation of Thr676 in the activation loop of human Mps1 was required for its kinase activity in vitro and for the ability of Mps1 to induce centrosome duplication in human cells. Kang et al. (24.Kang J. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Yu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20232-20237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) further showed that Mps1 Thr676 phosphorylation occurred in vivo and was elevated during mitosis. Ectopic expression of the Mps1 T676A mutant failed to sustain nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest of HeLa cells that were depleted of endogenous Mps1 by RNAi. Autophosphorylation of Mps1 at Thr676 could occur in trans, and chemical-induced dimerization of Mps1 increased its kinase activity in cells. These results suggested that the kinetochore localization and clustering of Mps1 might promote its trans-autophosphorylation, leading to its activation. The proposed mechanism of chromosome- or kinetochore-induced clustering and activation of Aurora B and Mps1 is reminiscent of the ligand-induced dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases (26.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar). Future studies are needed to test whether this mechanism indeed accounts for the activation of spindle checkpoint kinases by unattached kinetochores in living cells. A recent study by Xu et al. (27.Xu Q. Zhu S. Wang W. Zhang X. Old W. Ahn N. Liu X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also uncovered a role of Mps1 autophosphorylation in its kinetochore targeting, suggesting the existence of a positive feedback loop for Mps1 kinetochore targeting and activation. Finally, the MAPK pathway mediates phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the Mps1 kinase domain. This phosphorylation event is required for the kinetochore localization of Mps1 (6.Boyarchuk Y. Salic A. Dasso M. Arnaoutov A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27.Xu Q. Zhu S. Wang W. Zhang X. Old W. Ahn N. Liu X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28.Zhao Y. Chen R.H. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to the activation loop phosphorylation, several spindle checkpoint kinases can be activated through the binding of cofactors (Fig. 1). Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (29.Rosasco-Nitcher S.E. Lan W. Khorasanizadeh S. Stukenberg P.T. Science. 2008; 319: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) recently showed that TD-60 (telophase disc-60kD) and microtubules cooperatively stimulated the Aurora B kinase activity in vitro and in Xenopus egg extracts. Preincubation of Aurora B with unphosphorylated substrates such as the histone H3 N-terminal tail prevented the autophosphorylation and activation of Aurora B. Prior phosphorylation of H3 Thr3 by the kinase haspin eliminated this inhibitory function of the H3 tail. Because haspin-dependent phosphorylation of H3 occurs at the centromeres (30.Dai J. Sullivan B.A. Higgins J.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (29.Rosasco-Nitcher S.E. Lan W. Khorasanizadeh S. Stukenberg P.T. Science. 2008; 319: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) proposed that priming phosphorylation of H3 Thr3 by haspin at the centromeres might establish a chromatin domain permissible for Aurora B activation. Therefore, Aurora B is regulated at several levels by binding of cofactors (including INCENP, TD-60, and microtubules), by autophosphorylation, and by priming phosphorylation on substrates. Another example of kinase activation by cofactor binding is BubR1 activation by CENP-E, a kinetochore-bound motor protein (Fig. 1). BubR1 binds directly to Cdc20 and inhibits APC/C by acting as a pseudo-substrate (31.King E.M. van der Sar S.J. Hardwick K.G. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e342Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32.Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33.Malureanu L.A.

Inhibition of APC/C by BubR1 does not require the kinase activity of BubR1 (34.Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The BubR1 kinase activity is nevertheless required for the maintenance of the spindle checkpoint in mammalian cells in the presence of spindle poisons (33.Malureanu L.A. Jeganathan K.B. Hamada M. Wasilewski L. Davenport J. van Deursen J.M. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 118-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mao et al. (35.Mao Y. Abrieu A. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2003; 114: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) showed that a kinase-inactive mutant of BubR1 failed to restore the checkpoint in Xenopus extracts with BubR1 completely depleted. They proposed that BubR1 had two independent functions in the spindle checkpoint: 1) inhibition of APC/C in a kinase-independent manner and 2) phosphorylation of unidentified targets catalytically to activate the spindle checkpoint. They further showed that CENP-E was required for the spindle checkpoint and for the kinase activity of BubR1 in Xenopus egg extracts. CENP-E directly bound to the kinase domain of BubR1, and this binding greatly enhanced the kinase activity of BubR1 in vitro. Addition of microtubules silenced the activation of BubR1 by CENP-E in vitro (36.Mao Y. Desai A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that kinetochore-microtubule attachment might inactivate BubR1 and the spindle checkpoint. Therefore, CENP-E was proposed to link kinetochore-microtubule attachment to spindle checkpoint inactivation. The mechanism by which CENP-E activates BubR1 remains to be established. The mitotic kinase Plk1 regulates multiple processes in mitosis, including mitotic entry, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, cytokinesis, and the spindle checkpoint (37.Petronczki M. Lenart P. Peters J.M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 646-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Plk1 is inactive during interphase partly because of autoinhibition, i.e. the C-terminal polo-box domain of Plk1 binds to and inhibits its N-terminal kinase domain (38.Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). During mitosis, this inhibition is relieved by Thr210 phosphorylation in its activation loop. Plk1 is recruited to kinetochores through its interactions with Bub1 and INCENP (39.Qi W. Tang Z. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40.Goto H. Kiyono T. Tomono Y. Kawajiri A. Urano T. Furukawa K. Nigg E.A. Inagaki M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It then generates tension-sensitive 3F3 epitopes on BubR1 and facilitates the kinetochore localization of BubR1, Mad2, and Cdc20 (41.Wong O.K. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two recent studies provided additional insights into the activation mechanism of Plk1, which required the binding of a cofactor called Bora and Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation of Thr210 in the activation loop of Plk1 (42.Macurek L. Lindqvist A. Lim D. Lampson M.A. Klompmaker R. Freire R. Clouin C. Taylor S.S. Yaffe M.B. Medema R.H. Nature. 2008; 455: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 43.Seki A. Coppinger J.A. Jang C.Y. Yates J.R. Fang G. Science. 2008; 320: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These two studies established Aurora A as an upstream activating kinase for Plk1 and, along with other results, suggested the following model for Plk1 activation at the G2/M transition. In this model, Bora binds to Plk1 and causes a conformational change of Plk1 to expose Thr210, which is then recognized and phosphorylated by Aurora A to activate Plk1. In mitosis, Bora is phosphorylated by Plk1 and degraded, which allows the polo-box domain of Plk1 to interact with its mitotic substrates that have undergone priming phosphorylation. In this way, Plk1 is recruited to kinetochores and other cellular structures and efficiently phosphorylates multiple mitotic regulators. In addition to sensing the lack of proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment and blocking anaphase onset, several spindle checkpoint kinases, including Aurora B, Bub1, BubR1, Mps1, and Nek2A, directly promote correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment and actively participate in the correction of spindle defects (Fig. 2). The dual functions of these spindle checkpoint kinases in error detection and error correction are reminiscent of the DNA damage checkpoint kinases, which participate in both DNA damage sensing and repair (44.Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Chromosome alignment is coordinately regulated by several classes of microtubule-based motors and by microtubule-binding proteins that control microtubule dynamics (45.Tanaka T.U. Desai A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Upon entry into mitosis, microtubules that originate from centrosomes search and capture the kinetochores of sister chromatids. The kinetochores initially attach to the side of a microtubule and move toward the pole from which the microtubule originates through molecular motors. During transport to the pole, this lateral attachment is converted to end-on attachment. Chromosome congression to the metaphase plate is then achieved through amphitelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Recent studies indicate that the spindle checkpoint kinases are required for chromosome alignment and promote stable amphitelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Lampson and Kapoor (46.Lampson M.A. Kapoor T.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) first discovered a role of BubR1 in stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachment and in chromosome alignment (Fig. 2). They treated human cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 2 h to block cells at metaphase and then examined the presence of chromosome misalignment in these cells. About 30% of the BubR1-depleted cells contained misaligned kinetochores, whereas few of the Mad2-depleted cells did, suggesting that BubR1 had a checkpoint-independent role in chromosome alignment. The misaligned kinetochores in BubR1-depleted cells were detached from microtubules and had elevated CENP-A phosphorylation, which was indicative of increased Aurora B activity. Several studies have established that Aurora B corrects improper kinetochore-microtubule attachment by selectively disassembling the kinetochore-microtubule fibers. Consistently, inhibition of Aurora B partially rescued the alignment defect of BubR1-depleted cells. Therefore, BubR1 stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachment in part by restraining the activities of Aurora B at kinetochores. BubR1 also directly contributes to stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Zhang et al. (47.Zhang J. Ahmad S. Mao Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed that the kinase activity of BubR1 was required for chromosome alignment in Xenopus egg extracts. The APC tumor suppressor protein and EB1, a microtubule plus-end-binding protein and a binding partner of APC, appeared to be the targets of BubR1 in this process. APC colocalized with BubR1 at the kinetochores. APC depletion caused similar chromosome alignment defects compared with BubR1 depletion. BubR1 phosphorylated APC in vitro, and this phosphorylation was required for the recruitment of APC to kinetochores. BubR1 and APC formed a ternary complex with microtubules in vitro. These results suggest that BubR1 recruits the APC-EB1 complex to kinetochores, thereby facilitating stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment. The current evidence therefore suggests that BubR1 stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachment in two ways: counteracting Aurora B activity and recruiting APC-EB1. It remains to be determined whether these two mechanisms are coordinated. How is the function of BubR1 in chromosome alignment regulated? Qi et al. (39.Qi W. Tang Z. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) first reported an interaction between BubR1 and Plk1 in mitosis. Several subsequent studies then showed that BubR1 was a substrate of Plk1 in vivo and in vitro (41.Wong O.K. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 48.Matsumura S. Toyoshima F. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2205-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Two of these studies further showed that phosphorylation of BubR1 by Plk1 regulated the function of BubR1 in chromosome alignment (48.Matsumura S. Toyoshima F. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15217-15227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 49.Elowe S. Hummer S. Uldschmid A. Li X. Nigg E.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2205-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In particular, Matsumura et al. (48.Matsumura S. Toyoshima F. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15217-15227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that Plk1 phosphorylated two sites in the kinase domain of BubR1. A BubR1 mutant mimicking phosphorylation at these sites rescued the chromosome alignment defects of cells depleted of both Plk1 and BubR1. The kinase-dead version of the same phospho-mimicking BubR1 mutant did not rescue the defects of BubR1 and Plk1 co-depletion. These results suggest that Plk1 phosphorylates BubR1 and stimulates its kinase activity, which then phosphorylates downstream targets such as APC to promote chromosome alignment. Very recently, BubR1 was shown to be phosphorylated by Mps1, and some of these phosphorylation events were also essential for the establishment of proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment (50.Huang H. Hittle J. Zappacosta F. Annan R.S. Hershko A. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mitotic kinase Nek2A also plays a role in kinetochore-microtubule attachment (51.Du J. Cai X. Yao J. Ding X. Wu Q. Pei S. Jiang K. Zhang Y. Wang W. Shi Y. Lai Y. Shen J. Teng M. Huang H. Fei Q. Reddy E.S. Zhu J. Jin C. Yao X. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It directly phosphorylates Hec1 (a subunit of the Ndc80 complex), enhances the microtubule-binding affinity of Ndc80, and stabilizes the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment in human cells. Establishing stable amphitelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment is critical for chromosome alignment at metaphase. Taylor and co-workers (52.Johnson V.L. Scott M.I. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) first showed that depletion of Bub1 by RNAi in human cells greatly increased the percentage of cells with misaligned chromosomes at metaphase, implicating a role of Bub1 in chromosome congression. Meraldi and Sorger (53.Meraldi P. Sorger P.K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) also reported that Bub1 functions in chromosome congression. In their study, HeLa cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to block them at metaphase. About 60% of Bub1 RNAi cells at metaphase showed chromosome congression errors. The kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes exhibited side-on microtubule attachment. The interkinetochore distance of unaligned chromosomes was 1 μm compared with 2 μm in aligned ones, indicating reduced tension between the unaligned sister kinetochores. These results support a role of Bub1 in promoting the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Logarinho et al. (54.Logarinho E. Resende T. Torres C. Bousbaa H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1798-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) confirmed and extended these results. They showed that 10–30% of cells depleted of Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1 at metaphase had more than four misaligned chromosomes. The misaligned chromosomes in Bub3-depleted cells exhibited side-on microtubule attachment, as observed in Bub1-depleted cells. Inhibition of Aurora B further increased the chromosome alignment defects in Bub1- or Bub3-depleted cells, suggesting that the microtubule attachment defects caused by Bub1 or Bub3 depletion were corrected by Aurora B. The prevalence of side-on microtubule attachment in Bub1- or Bub3-depleted cells suggests that the Bub1-Bub3 complex promotes the conversion of side-on attachment to end-on attachment. The mechanism by which Bub1-Bub3 accomplishes this task is unknown. Bub1-Bub3 regulates multiple mitotic processes such as protecting centromeric cohesion through shugoshin (Sgo1) and recruiting CENP-E and BubR1 to kinetochores (52.Johnson V.L. Scott M.I. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 55.Tang Z. Sun Y. Harley S.E. Zou H. Yu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18012-18017Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether Bub1-Bub3 directly contributes to chromosome alignment or indirectly through Sgo1, CENP-E, or BubR1. Aurora B has long been known to sever erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachment (56.Tanaka T.U. Rachidi N. Janke C. Pereira G. Galova M. Schiebel E. Stark M.J. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2002; 108: 317-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have established a role of Mps1 in this process through activating Aurora B. Tanaka and co-workers (57.Maure J.F. Kitamura E. Tanaka T.U. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 2175-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that, similar to Aurora B, Mps1 promoted chromosome bi-orientation in budding yeast. This study failed, however, to reveal a cross-talk between Mps1 and Aurora B. In the second study, Kops and co-workers (58.Jelluma N. Brenkman A.B. van den Broek N.J. Cruijsen C.W. van Osch M.H. Lens S.M. Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) showed that the role of Mps1 in chromosome alignment was conserved in human cells. Many misaligned chromosomes in Mps1-depleted cells were adjacent to the centrosomes and exhibited no localization of CLIP-170 at their kinetochores, indicative of syntelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Unlike in budding yeast, Mps1 acted upstream of Aurora B in correcting faulty kinetochore-microtubule attachment. In Mps1-depleted cells, the Aurora B activity at the kinetochores was weaker as judged by CENP-A phosphorylation. Mps1 phosphorylated borealin, a CPC subunit, and activated the kinase activity of Aurora B in vitro. A phospho-mimicking mutant of borealin rescued the chromosome alignment defects caused by Mps1 depletion but not those caused by BubR1 or Plk1 depletion, indicating that borealin was the major target of Mps1 in chromosome alignment. Therefore, Mps1 corrects syntelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment through phosphorylating borealin and activating Aurora B at the kinetochores. The spindle checkpoint ensures the accuracy of chromosome segregation and genetic stability. Malfunction of the spindle checkpoint leads to aneuploidy, which contributes to cancer and birth defects (59.Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed three general features of the spindle checkpoint. First, similar to the DNA damage checkpoint, the spindle checkpoint not only halts the cell cycle by sensing defects in kinetochore-microtubule attachment but also actively promotes the correction of these defects. Second, the spindle checkpoint kinases can be activated by multiple mechanisms at the kinetochores and play vital roles in both processes. Finally, microtubules and the spindle checkpoint proteins share the same receptors at the kinetochores. Competition between microtubule and spindle checkpoint proteins for binding to these receptors provides a simple on-and-off switch for checkpoint signaling."

As antiporter proteins of ∼100 amino acids, SMRs must self-assemble into homo-oligomeric structures for efflux of drug molecules.

Here, we use Hsmr, the 110-residue SMR family member of the archaebacterium Halobacterium salinarum, to determine the TM4 residue motif required to mediate drug resistance and SMR self-association. Twelve single point mutants that scan the central portion of the TM4 helix (residues 85–104) were constructed and were tested for their ability to confer resistance to the cytotoxic compound ethidium bromide. Six residues were found to be individually essential for drug resistance activity (Gly90, Leu91, Leu93, Ile94, Gly97, and Val98), defining a minimum activity motif of 90GLXLIXXGV98 within TM4. When the propensity of these mutants to dimerize on SDS-PAGE was examined, replacements of all but Ile resulted in ∼2-fold reduction of dimerization versus the wild-type antiporter. Our work defines a minimum activity motif of 90GLXLIXXGV98 within TM4 and suggests that this sequence mediates TM4-based SMR dimerization along a single helix surface, stabilized by a small residue heptad repeat sequence.

Individual SMR molecules must assemble into homo-oligomeric structures to transport substrates, a requirement likely related to the relatively small size of the individual SMR molecule (∼110 residues divided into four transmembrane (TM) segments (3Kikukawa T.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Structural studies of dimers of the Escherichia coli SMR EmrE indicate that substrates bind a pocket formed by TMs 1–3 of two monomers (21Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 24Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This pocket is lined with aromatic and hydrophobic residues from TMs 1–3 that interact with substrates and a conserved Glu residue in TM1 that coordinates protons and positive charges on substrate molecules (21Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To date, a role for residues in TM4 in substrate binding and translocation has not been recognized (24Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and these segments are paired and separated from the binding site (21Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This pair of TM4 helices is in close contact along the entire helix length and remains in approximately identical conformations and positions in both the free and the substrate-bound dimer (11Korkhov V.M. Tate C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The TM4 helix pair has accordingly been proposed to represent a strong intermonomer association that does not contribute to conformational change during ligand binding but instead stabilizes the dimer interface (24Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This potential dependence of SMR function on TM4 self-assembly suggests that inhibition of the self-interaction of this segment may provide a straightforward means of controlling drug efflux. Although these EmrE structural studies have provided invaluable information regarding the overall geometry of SMR self-interaction, atomic resolution data capable of identifying the specific side chains and interactions that assemble SMRs are not yet available. Mutagenesis data from our laboratory and others (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), however, are beginning to pinpoint the residues and interactions that could stabilize TM4-mediated intermonomer contacts in SMR family members. In a previous study of peptides that correspond to TM4 of the Halobacterium salinarum SMR protein, Hsmr, we noted that TM4 had a propensity to strongly self-interact in vitro (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We also found that the oligomerization of Hsmr TM4 peptides was sensitive to residue replacements of Gly90 and Ile94 that altered side chain volume. Disruption of dimerization by replacement of the TM4 residues Gly90 and Gly97 with Cys or Pro was also noted in the E. coli SMR, EmrE (26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The six-residue separation of these Gly residues suggested that they form a GG7 motif (27Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 28Liu Y. Engelman D.M. Gerstein M. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0054.1, research0054.12)Google Scholar) which mediates “knobs-into-holes” packing across the TM4-TM4 interface (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the “knob” residues involved in such an interaction have not yet been identified, although roles for Leu93 and Ile94 SMR self-assembly have been suggested (26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With the goal of cataloguing the residues that may be required for TM4-mediated SMR oligomerization, in the present work, we have constructed a library of 12 mutants that scan the central portion of TM4 segment of Hsmr. This SMR homolog was selected because it is capable of self-assembly in the presence of SDS (23Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), allowing for rapid screening and quantitation of oligomerization on PAGE. We find that three key residues, Gly90, Gly97, and Val98, define an assembly “hot spot” where replacements are highly disruptive to Hsmr-based drug resistance. Production of Wild-type and Mutant Hsmr Proteins-The pT7-7 Hsmr-His6 plasmid was kindly provided by S. Schuldiner. Hsmr were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and grown at 37 °C to A600 ∼ 0.7. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm while shaking for 1 h. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and lysed with 4 ml/g of cells of 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8 (lysis buffer). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and Hsmr was eluted with lysis buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. Eluted Hsmr was dialyzed against 0.3% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Purified Hsmr molecules were extracted from detergent for mass spectrometric analysis by incubation of a 10 μm dialyzed Hsmr protein solution with an equal volume of hexane in the presence of an appropriate amount of Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent (as specified by Bio-Rad) for 1 h. The hexane layer was collected, and protein molecular weight was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Final protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) using manufacturer-supplied bovine serum albumin as a standard. Ethidium Resistance Assays-The ability of wild-type and mutant Hsmr proteins to confer resistance to the cytotoxic compound ethidium bromide (EtBr) was performed essentially as described (23Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the Hsmr plasmid were grown on LB plates in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Individual colonies were picked and added to 2× YT broth (w/v: 1.6% Tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0, 200, or 500 μm EtBr. Cell growth was assayed by A600 after 16 h of growth with shaking at 37 °C. Assays were performed in triplicate. Mutants with <20% of WT activity at 200 μm EtBr were classified as highly disruptive; those with <20% of WT activity at 500 μm EtBr were classified as disruptive; those with >50% but <70% of WT activity at 500 μm EtBr were classified as partially disruptive; and with >70% of WT activity were classified as non-disruptive. Gel Electrophoresis and Densitometry-100 ng of purified Hsmr proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) in MES buffer according to the manufacturer’s directions. Unstained Mark-12 protein standards (Invitrogen) were used for molecular weight estimation. Proteins were visualized by silver stain using SilverXpress staining kit (Invitrogen), and densitometry measurements were performed using ImageJ (NIH). The percentage of dimer was estimated by dividing the density of the dimer band by the total density of the dimer and monomer bands. Modeling of Hsmr TM4 Dimers-Potential dimerization sites for the TM4 sequence were identified using the CNS searching of helix interactions (CHI) software suite of the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) as described elsewhere (29Adams P.D.

Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar, 31Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, two identical α-helices were generated from the primary sequence of Hsmr TM4 (residues 85–105, inclusive), and their potential interactions were identified via global computational searching. TM4-TM4 helix interactions were independently searched in parallel and antiparallel orientations. All simulations were conducted in vacuo, a partial mimetic of the low dielectric of the membrane. Residues mediating the close approach of TM4 helices in each of the CHI-generated TM4 dimers as well as those in contact between chain B residues 42–64 and 134–155 of the cyanobacterial photosystem I (PSI; Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1jb0) were determined by contact analysis in CNS; structures were queried for side chain and Cα atoms on each monomer found within 4.5 Å of side chain and/or Cα atoms on the other monomer. The 4.5 Å cutoff used represents approximately one-half the center-to-center distance of the pair of EmrE TM segments that could represent TM4 (11Korkhov V.M. Tate C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as well as approximately one-half the average distance between helices packed by small residue heptad repeats (32Walters R.F. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cα atoms were included in residue contact calculations in order for Gly residues to be considered. CNS was also used to determine intermonomer contact areas in the TM4 dimer models using a probe size of 1.88 Å. The contacting residue pairs in each model were compared with our present mutagenesis data and those of previous studies (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Dimer models were excluded from consideration if they did not include all of the residues identified as fully disruptive or disruptive at the TM4-TM4 interface or if the interface encompassed one or more of the residues identified as non-disruptive in our present mutagenesis study. Design of Residue Substitutions in Hsmr TM4-An inspection of the Hsmr sequence and comparison of TM4 sequences among family members (Fig. 1) was followed by mutagenesis to full-length Hsmr at 12 TM4 positions that were targeted for replacement based on their approximate localization to the central portion of the segment and their degree of conservation (Fig. 1). Because the intention was to disrupt any potential helix-helix interactions at TM4, the residue substitutions selected were designed to alter side chain volume. Those with larger side chains (Val, Leu, Ile, Asn) were replaced with Ala; conversely, small side chains (Gly and Ala) were mutated to Val or Met. These replacements were anticipated to disrupt any close-packed or knobs-into-holes type interactions in which TM4 may participate. Mutations at Conserved Sites in Hsmr TM4 Compromise Protein Function-The ability of each TM4 mutant to confer resistance to cytotoxic compounds was evaluated by measuring bacterial growth in the presence of either 200 or 500 μm EtBr. Here, cell survival depends on the ability of Hsmr to pump EtBr out of the cell with the degree of resistance proportional to protein activity (23Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). EtBr resistance in the presence of Hsmr TM4 mutants ranged from 0 to 100% versus WT at the two EtBr concentrations tested (Fig. 2, A and B). The changes in apparent Hsmr activity observed in the WT and mutant proteins were not expected to arise from altered SMR expression levels as protein recovery from this E. coli strain was found to be consistent among Hsmr variants (not shown). The Hsmr mutants were classified into groups based on resistance phenotype at the two EtBr concentrations tested; cells expressing the fully disruptive G90V, G97V, and V98A mutants could not grow at 200 μm EtBr; those expressing the disruptive mutants L91A, L93A, and I94A could not grow at 500 μm EtBr; those expressing the partially disruptive mutants V100A and L101A had less than 70% of WT activity at 500 μm EtBr; and those expressing the non-disruptive mutants V89A, A92M, V95A, and N102A retained at least 80% of WT activity at 500 μm EtBr (Fig. 2, A and B). Disruptive TM4 Mutants Compromise Hsmr Oligomerization-To determine whether the activity trends observed could be traced to disrupted helix-helix contacts, we exploited the ability of the Hsmr protein to self-associate in the detergent SDS (23Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and separated monomeric and oligomeric Hsmr molecules using PAGE (Fig. 2C). The two partially disruptive (V100A, L101A) and four non-disruptive (V89A, A92M, V95A, N102A) mutants ran as WT (A92M shown as an example). Conversely, each of the three fully disruptive mutants significantly disrupted the self-association of Hsmr, with the G90V- and G97V-substituted molecules dimerizing at ∼60% WT levels and the V98A mutant dimerizing with ∼40% WT efficiency. Two of the three disruptive mutants, L91A and L93A, reduced Hsmr dimerization to ∼50–60% of the WT value. However, the disruptive I94A replacement had no effect on Hsmr self-association on SDS-PAGE, although this mutant exhibited reduced resistance to EtBr in vivo. Upon mapping these residue groups onto a projection of TM4 (Fig. 2D), it was noted that the fully disruptive, disruptive, and partially disruptive mutants all lie on the evolutionarily conserved face of the TM4 helix. Additionally, the fully disruptive and disruptive mutants (G90V, L91A, L93A, I94A, G97V, and V98A) localize toward the central portion of the TM4 segment, whereas the two partially disruptive mutants (V100A, L101A) are positioned toward its C-terminal end. It can therefore be concluded that the minimum sequence on the TM4 helix required for SMR-mediated resistance at high toxicant levels could be represented as 90GLXLIXXGV98. Modeling of Hsmr TM4-TM4 Dimers-Because structural and biochemical data suggest a role for TM4-TM4 interactions in SMR assembly, computational modeling of TM4 homodimers was used to visualize how the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence might mediate Hsmr assembly. The modeling of Hsmr TM4 self-interaction was accomplished using CHI, an algorithm developed to model the self-assembly of the TM domains of glycophorin A (GpA) and phospholamban (29Adams P.D. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1996; 26: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hsmr TM4 dimers were modeled in both parallel and antiparallel orientations because evidence exists to support each mode of SMR oligomerization (see Refs. 33Steiner-Mordoch S. Soskine M. Solomon D.

Biochem. 2007; 142: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, respectively). Independent parallel and antiparallel simulations produced 24 TM4-TM4 association models (data not shown). Two of these (Fig. 3) were compatible with our present mutagenesis data and would not be expected to aggregate indefinitely (36Rath A. Deber C.M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 90GLXLIXXGV98 Sequence Is Crucial for Hsmr Drug Efflux Activity and Self-assembly-The six residues found to be individually essential for Hsmr drug resistance activity each localize to the conserved surface of the TM4 helix. These conserved residues, including Gly90, Leu91, Leu93, Ile94, Gly97, and Val98, are unable to confer resistance to high concentrations of ethidium when mutated to oppositely sized residues (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutants at Gly90 and Gly97 in the TM4 of the related EmrE SMR were similarly found to be defective in self-association as well as activity, implying that abrogated function arises from disruption of TM4-mediated intermonomer interactions (26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE results presented here also implicate the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence in dimer assembly, with five of six individual mutants that exhibit impaired drug resistance also disrupting Hsmr oligomerization. We therefore conclude that the minimum TM4 sequence required for Hsmr drug resistance activity can be defined as 90GLXLIXXGV98. This sequence encompasses the Gly90 and Gly97 residues previously identified as important for TM4-mediated SMR self-assembly and function in EmrE (26Elbaz Y. Salomon T. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12276-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and two of the residues key to strong self-association of Hsmr TM4 peptides (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TM4-mediated Intermonomer Interactions Are Stabilized by Close Packing between Residues-The pattern of large and small residues in the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence of TM4 defined in this work by mutagenesis matches the conservation of residue size along the TM4 helix (Fig. 1), suggesting that knobs-into-holes packing may stabilize SMR assembly via this segment. Two sequence motifs described in the literature are capable of mediating such interactions: the GG4 motif (alternately termed GX3GorGASRight) and the small residue heptad motif (also known as GASLeft) (reviewed in Ref. 37Moore D.T. Berger B.W. DeGrado W.F. Structure (Camb.). 2008; 16: 991-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The former exhibits a characteristic i, i + 4 small residue periodicity and is exemplified by the GpA homodimer, where two small Gly residues create a shallow groove into which the large Val residues of individual monomers intercalate at the dimer interface (38Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 39Smith S.O. Bormann B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Small residue heptad packing motifs, on the other hand, can be defined by a seven-residue repeat (typically designated by the letters a–g, see Fig. 4), where the a and d positions most directly contact the opposing helix and are frequently occupied by small residues (32Walters R.F. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Helix pairs packed by the GG4 versus heptad repeat motif also differ in their geometry (reviewed in Ref. 37Moore D.T. Berger B.W. DeGrado W.F. Structure (Camb.). 2008; 16: 991-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), with the former crossing in a right-handed manner at an angle of ∼40° and the latter crossing in a left-handed fashion at ∼20° (32Walters R.F. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Comparison of the patterning of the fully disruptive, disruptive, partially disruptive, and non-disruptive mutations in Hsmr TM4 to that of the interfacial residues of the GpA dimer (GG4) or to that of sequences assembled via small residue heptad motifs (Fig. 4) suggests that the periodicity of the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence required for Hsmr self-assembly and/or function more closely approximates the latter, with the two key Gly90 and Gly97 residues occupying the a positions. The positioning of the Leu91, Leu93, and Val98 residues is also consistent with heptad repeat packing; analogous positions adjacent to small residues are occupied by large side chains and/or are in close contact in a helix pair packed via a small residue heptad repeat (Fig. 4). Placement of the Ile94 residue at position d in the TM4 heptad repeat, however, does not match the expected small residue pattern (Fig. 4), although we note that the functionally disruptive I94A mutation uniquely maintains dimerization relatively equal to WT (Fig. 2C). The large-to-small substitution at Ile94 may therefore disrupt function by altering, rather than preventing, residue intercalation between Hsmr monomers. Identification of the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence defined in this work as a small residue heptad repeat is consistent with the left-handed geometry of antiparallel TM4-TM4 association observed in the EmrE crystal structure (21Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Intercalation of the key small and large residues of the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence additionally occurs in each of our parallel and antiparallel orientations modeled in silico, and each is packed in a left-handed manner (Fig. 3). The geometry of the antiparallel model, however, appears to more closely approximate the estimates of residue location along the TM segments provided by selenomethionine labeling of EmrE (21Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For example, the crystallized antiparallel EmrE dimer has its two Leu93 residues located adjacent to one another on the boundary between the dimer interface and the surrounding lipid, similar to the Leu93 positioning of the antiparallel model of Hsmr TM4 presented in this work (Fig. 3A). Such an arrangement would be inconsistent with the parallel model, where the Leu93 residues localize to opposite sides of the dimer (Fig. 3B). Superimposition of our antiparallel Hsmr TM4 model with the x-ray structure of the antiparallel TM4 portion of the EmrE dimer indicates that the TM4 helices of the model are appropriately oriented for dimerization to occur at the 90GLXLIXXGV98 sequence (Fig. 3C); for example, Gly90 and Gly97 residues on one helix are proximal to Gly97′ and Gly90′, respectively, across the interface between the TM4 helix pair. The Hsmr TM4 model and the EmrE structure show some deviation at the helix termini, potentially due to truncated helix ends in EmrE (21Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and/or to sequence differences such as the presence of Pro86 in EmrE (Fig. 1B). The mutational analysis presented here does not specifically implicate oligomeric states higher than dimer in Hsmr function; however, the TM4 surfaces exposed in each of our model dimers are compatible with additional self-interaction. The potential of SMRs to form tetramers via “two-faced” TM4-TM4 interactions has also been suggested to utilize some of the Ala and Val residues on the non-conserved face of TM4 (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and monomer pairings that involve Ala92 and Val95 in helix-helix packing are observed in our parallel computational models (data not shown). We note that a dimer-tetramer model of SMR assembly mediated solely by TM4 could satisfy both parallel and antiparallel assembly constraints, with antiparallel contacts mediating dimerization at one surface and parallel at the other (Fig. 3D). Although our results cannot unequivocally exclude the possibility that the interactions mediated by the 90GLXLIXXGV98 small residue heptad repeat motif on TM4 involve an Hsmr helix other than TM4, many lines of evidence support the role for TM4 self-interaction in SMR assembly. TM4 remains in a relatively constant conformation during SMR binding by a variety of substrates, acting as an anchor for the oligomer (11Korkhov V.M. Tate C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and peptides corresponding to the Hsmr TM4 sequence self-associate strongly in a manner dependent on Gly90 and Ile94 (25Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15546-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Implications for SMR Inhibitor Design-Given the broad specificity and relatively inefficient binding of toxin substrates by small multidrug resistance proteins, strategies to inhibit their action that involve small molecule inhibitors targeted at the substrate binding pocket are unlikely to be consistently successful. The requirement of oligomerization for function in the SMR family, however, provides an additional opportunity for the design of inhibitors that disrupt this resistance pathway. Key to creation of such an inhibitor is knowledge of the SMR residues that must be targeted to reduce self-association. The SMR resistance/assembly motif defined in this work as the TM4 residues 90GLXLIXXGV98 thus provides the starting point for the design of peptide or small molecules that inhibit SMR oligomerization through competition with critical TM4-TM4 interactions.

In yeast, Arl3p targeted to trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes activates Arl1p, and the activated Arl1p in turn recruits a GRIP domain-containing protein; this complex regulates retrograde transport to the TGN and anterograde transport from the TGN. In the present study, using RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ARFRP1 and ARL1, we have examined whether the orthologs of Arl3p-Arl1p-GRIP story serve similar functions in mammalian cells. However, we have unexpectedly found differential roles of ARL1 and ARFRP1. Specifically, ARL1 and ARFRP1 regulate retrograde transport of Shiga toxin to the TGN and anterograde transport of VSVG from the TGN, respectively.

The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic have been well established, whereas much less is known about the functions of ARL proteins. Accumulating lines of evidence in yeast, however, have suggested a cascade model in which N-acetylated Arl3p is targeted to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes where it causes activation of Arl1p; activated Arl1p in turn recruits a GRIP (golgin-97/RanBP2/Imh1p/p230) domain-containing protein, Imh1p, and regulates retrograde transport from endosomes to the TGN via tethering of endosome-derived vesicles to the TGN and anterograde transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane (3Panic B.

Our laboratory and other groups previously showed, by expressing a dominant-negative mutant of ARFRP1, that the small GTPase functions upstream of ARL1 and the golgins and regulates anterograde traffic from and retrograde traffic to the TGN (11Shin H.-W. Kobayashi H. Kitamura M. Waguri S. Suganuma T. Uchiyama Y. Nakayama K. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 4039-4048Google Scholar, 13Zahn C. Hommel A. Lu L. Hong W. Walther K. Florian S. Joost H.-G.

However, our subsequent experiments using the dominant-negative mutant of both ARL1 and ARFRP1 have suggested that these mutants might nonspecifically affect the recruitment of TGN-localizing proteins, and ARL1 might not necessarily act downstream of ARFRP1.In the present study, we have therefore re-evaluated the roles of ARL1 and ARFRP1 by RNAi-mediated knockdown of these small GTPases. We have found that ARL1 predominantly regulates retrograde transport of Shiga toxin B fragment (StxB) to the TGN, whereas ARFRP1 regulates anterograde transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) from the TGN. Furthermore, our data have suggested that Q-SNAREs (syntaxin 6, syntaxin 16, and Vti1a) participate in the retrograde transport process by functioning downstream of ARL1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Reagents, and Plasmids—Preparation and affinity purification of anti-ARL1 and anti-ARFRP1 antibodies were described previously (11Shin H.-W.

Cell.. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Google Scholar). A HeLa cell line stably expressing CD4-furin was established as described previously (21Ishizaki R. Shin H.-W. Mitsuhashi H. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 2650-2660Google Scholar). Knockdown of ARFRP1, ARL1, Vti1a, Vti1b, or syntaxin 6 was performed as previously described (22Ishizaki R. Shin H.-W. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Nakayama K. Genes Cells.. 2006; 11: 949-959Google Scholar). Briefly, pools of siRNAs directed for the mRNA regions covering nucleotide residues 1–546, 1–606, 1–540, 1–699, and 1–470, respectively (when the A residue of the initiation Met codon is assigned as residue 1) were prepared using a BLOCK-iT RNAi TOPO transcription kit and a BLOCK-iT Dicer RNAi kit (Invitrogen). Single siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at Dharmacon: GUGGAUGGUGAAGUGUGUC for ARFRP1 and AAGAAGAGCUGAGAAAAGCCA for ARL1. Control siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. The cells were transfected with the siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated overnight. The transfected cells were then transferred to a culture dish containing coverslips, further incubated for 48 h, and processed for immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses.StxB uptake experiments were performed as described previously (11Shin H.-W. Kobayashi H. Kitamura M. Waguri S. Suganuma T. Uchiyama Y. Nakayama K. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 4039-4048Google Scholar, 20Shin H.-W. Morinaga N. Noda M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, HeLa cells were mock treated (a pool of siRNAs for LacZ) or treated with siRNAs for ARFRP1, ARL1, Vti1a, Vti1b, or syntaxin 6 for 72 h and incubated with AlexaFluor488-conjugated StxB at 19 °C for 50 min. After medium change, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. Uptake of anti-CD4 antibody by CD4-furin-expressing HeLa cells was analyzed as described previously (19Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 28397-28401Google Scholar, 20Shin H.-W. Morinaga N. Noda M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of StxB or CD4-furin that reached the Golgi region was quantified using IP-Lab4.0 software (Solution Systems, Japan). The Golgi structures containing GM130 or β′-COP were defined as regions of interest in more than 50 cells, and the pixel intensity of StxB or CD4-furin in the GM130 or β′-COP regions of interest was estimated. Transport of EGFP-VSVG from the Golgi to the cell surface was examined as described previously (11Shin H.-W. Kobayashi H. Kitamura M. Waguri S. Suganuma T. Uchiyama Y. Nakayama K. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 4039-4048Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with pCIpreEGFP-VSVG were incubated at 40 °C overnight and then at 19 °C for 2 h to arrest the protein at the Golgi and finally incubated at 32 °C for up to 30 min. The cells were stained with anti-GFP antibody without permeabilization.RESULTSDominant-negative Mutants of ARL1 Might Disorganize the TGN—We previously showed that exogenous expression of an HA-tagged dominant-negative ARFRP1 mutant, ARFRP1-(T31N)-HA, in HeLa cells causes redistribution of ARL1 and golgin-245 from the TGN (Fig. 1, A and A′, and supplemental Fig. S1) and blocks both exit of VSVG from the TGN (see supplemental Fig. S2) and retrograde transport of StxB from endosomes to the TGN (see supplemental Fig. S3). Furthermore, exogenous expression of dominant-negative ARL1, ARL1(T31N), redistributed golgin-245 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1) and blocked transport of VSVG and StxB (see supplemental Figs. S2 and S3); note that we used an untagged version of the ARL1 mutant, because the expression efficiency of the mutant with any epitope tag sequence examined (HA, Myc, or FLAG) was extremely low for an unknown reason. Taken together with a previously proposed model in yeast (3Panic B. Whyte J.R.C. Munro S. Curr. Biol... 2003; 13: 405-410Google Scholar, 4Setty S.R.G. Strochlic T.I. Tong A.H.Y. Boone C. Burd C.G.

Cell Sci... 2006; 119: 3845-3855Google Scholar), these observations suggested that ARFRP1 functioned upstream of ARL1 and GRIP domain-containing golgins and participated in both anterograde transport of VSVG and retrograde transport of StxB.However, we also made an observation suggesting that ARFRP1 may not function upstream of ARL1. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and B′), the ARL1(T31N) expression resulted in redistribution of not only golgin-245 but also ARFRP1 (cells indicated by asterisks); note that the cells expressing exogenous ARL1(T31N) were indirectly identified by redistribution of golgin-245, because double-staining for ARL1 and ARFRP1 was technically impossible because of antibody restriction. This observation was incompatible with the notion that ARFRP1 functions entirely upstream of ARL1. ARL1(T31N) expression also caused redistribution of CI-MPR (Fig. 1, D and D′), TGN46, and GGA3 (data not shown), all of which are markers of TGN, but not that of GM130, a cis-Golgi marker (Fig. 1, C and C′). It is therefore possible that the ARL1 mutant causes redistribution of ARFRP1 (Fig. 1B′) by disorganizing the structure of the TGN.Depletion of ARL1 Results in Redistribution of Specific TGN Proteins—To prevent possible misinterpretation caused by overexpression of dominant-negative mutants, we next took an RNAi approach. As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that treatment of HeLa cells with a pool of siRNAs for ARFRP1, which were prepared using a Dicer RNAi system (see ""Experimental Procedures”), resulted in the significant depletion of ARFRP1 but did not affect the level of ARL1, golgin-97, or SNAREs, and a pool of siRNAs for ARL1 specifically knocked down ARL1. When examined by immunofluorescence analysis, the ARFRP1 siRNA treatment abolished Golgi-like staining for ARFRP1 (Fig. 2B). Inconsistent with the data obtained by overexpression of the dominant-negative ARFRP1 mutant (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1), however, the ARFRP1 knockdown did not change the Golgi localization of ARL1, golgin-245 (Fig. 2, C and D), or golgin-97 (data not shown). Treating cells with the ARL1 siRNAs abolished not only the ARL1 staining but also the staining for its direct effectors, golgin-245 (Fig. 2, F and G) and golgin-97 (data not shown), in the Golgi region. The localization of golgin-245 was restored by overexpression of wild-type ARL1 (not siRNA-resistant version) (Fig. 3A, panels a and a′, asterisks) but not ARFRP1 (Fig. 3A, panels b and b′, crosses), supporting the specificity of the RNAi. In contrast to the data obtained by the ARL1(T31N) overexpression (Fig. 1B′), however, the ARL1 knockdown did not cause redistribution of ARFRP1 from the Golgi region (Fig. 2E). A simple explanation for these observations is that ARL1 determines the TGN association of the GRIP domain-containing golgins, whereas ARFRP1 is not directly involved in the association of ARL1 or the golgins with TGN membranes.FIGURE 2Specific knockdown of ARFRP1 and ARL1 by RNAi and its effect on localization of GRIP domain-containing golgins.

As shown in Fig. 4, the depletion of ARFRP1 or ARL1 did not significantly affect the localization of GM130 (cis-Golgi proteins) or GGA3 or CI-MPR (localized to the TGN and endosomes).FIGURE 4Golgi proteins whose localization were not affected by knockdown of ARFRP1 or ARL1. HeLa cells treated with a pool of siRNAs for ARFRP1 (A–C) or ARL1 (D–F), or control siRNAs (G–I) were stained with antibody to GM130 (A, D, and G), GGA3 (B, E, and H) or CI-MPR (C, F, and I).

The asterisks indicate knockdown cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, the depletion of ARFRP1 and ARL1 differentially affected the localization of SNAREs that are involved in transport from endosomes to the TGN. Vti1a is a Q-SNARE that is mainly localized to the TGN and involved in retrograde transport of Stx from early/recycling endosomes to the TGN (23Kreykenbohm V. Wenzel D. Antonin W. Atlachkine V.

Cell Biol... 2006; 7: 631-643Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, knocking down ARL1 (E) but not ARFRP1 (A) abolished the Vti1a staining in the TGN region. By contrast, the ARL1 knockdown did not significantly affect the localization of Vti1b (F), which is a close homolog of Vti1a and mainly associated with late endosomes and lysosomes (25Hong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2005; 1744: 120-144Google Scholar, 26Jahn R. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

HeLa cells treated with a pool of siRNAs for ARFRP1 (A–D) or ARL1 (E–H), or control siRNAs (I–L) were stained with antibody to Vti1a (A, E, and I), Vti1b (B, F, and J), syntaxin 6 (C, G, and K), or syntaxin 16 (D, H, and L). The insets are zoom-out images of the cells stained with antibody to ARFRP1 (A–C), ARL1 (E–G), or golgin-245 (H). The asterisks indicate knockdown cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because Vti1a is known to form a SNARE complex together with syntaxin 6, syntaxin 16, and VAMP3/4, and to regulate retrograde transport from early/recycling endosomes (24Mallard F. Tang B.L. Galli T. Tenza D. Saint-Pol A. Yue X. Antony C. Hong W. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol... 2002; 156: 653-664Google Scholar), we also examined effects of the ARL1 knockdown on the localization of syntaxin 6 and syntaxin 16. As shown in Fig. 5G, the syntaxin 6 staining disappeared in the Golgi region and was dispersed more peripherally in the ARL1-depleted cells than in the control (K) and ARFRP1-depleted (C) cells. The syntaxin 16 staining also disappeared in the Golgi region in the ARL1-depleted cells (Fig. 5H); note that the ARL1-depleted cells were indirectly identified by redistribution of golgin-245, because double staining for ARL1 and syntaxin 16 was technically impossible because of antibody restriction. The ARFRP1-depleted cells cannot be identified for the same reason (Fig. 5D). The syntaxin 16 localization is almost intact (more than 80%) in the ARFRP1-depleted cells. Mislocalization of Vti1a, syntaxin 6, and syntaxin 16 can be rescued by overexpression of wild-type ARL1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, ARL1 depletion appears to affect the localization of a specific set of SNAREs involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to the TGN.Differential Effects of Depletion of ARFRP1 and ARL1 on Anterograde and Retrograde Transport—Because overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant of either ARFRP1 or ARL1 blocks exit of VSVG from the TGN (supplemental Fig. S2) and retrograde transport of StxB from endosomes to the TGN (supplemental Fig. S3), we next examined the effects of knockdown of either ARFRP1 or ARL1 on these transport processes. As shown in Fig. 6, in the control (C–C″) and ARFRP1-depleted (A–A″) cells, significant fractions of StxB were transported from endosomes to the Golgi region by 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. However, the knock-down of ARL1 significantly inhibited transport of StxB, most of which was arrested at punctate endosomal structures (B–B″).FIGURE 6Inhibition of StxB transport from endosomes to the Golgi by ARL1 depletion. HeLa cells treated with siRNAs for ARFRP1 (A), ARL1 (B), or control siRNAs (C) were incubated with AlexaFluor488-conjugated StxB at 19 °C for 50 min to accumulate StxB at early/recycling endosomes and then at 37 °C for 30 min to allow its transport toward the Golgi. The cells were then stained with anti-GM130 antibody to identify the Golgi region (A′–C′). Merged images of StxB and GM130 are shown in A″–C″. D, pixel intensity of AlexaFluor488-StxB in GM130-positive regions was estimated as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" The values are the means of more than 50 cells from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, VSVG transport from the TGN to the cell surface was significantly retarded in cells depleted of ARFRP1 but not in those depleted of ARL1 (Fig. 7); EGFP-VSVG molecules that reached the cell surface were detected by incubating fixed cells with anti-GFP antibody under nonpermeabilized conditions (see ""Experimental Procedures”).FIGURE 7Inhibition of VSVG exit from the TGN by ARFRP1 depletion. HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector for N-terminally EGFP-tagged VSVG tsO45 were treated with siRNAs for ARFRP1 (A–C), ARL1 (D–F), or control siRNAs (G–I) and incubated at 40 °C overnight and then at 19 °C for 2 h to accumulate EGFP-VSVG at the Golgi (0 min; A, D, and G). The temperature was then shifted to 32 °C for 15 min (B, E, and H) or 30 min (C, F, and I) to allow EGFP-VSVG transport toward the plasma membrane. To detect cell surface expression of EGFP-VSVG, the cells were stained with anti-GFP antibody under nonpermeabilized conditions (red). The cells expressing EGFP-VSVG were identified by the epifluorescence of EGFP (green). The images are representative of three independent experiments. J, percentages of cells with cell surface expression of EGFP-VSVG in total EGFP-VSVG-expressing cells were estimated after temperature shift to 32 °C for 15 or 30 min. n, numbers of cells counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results presented so far were obtained using cells treated with pools of siRNAs that were prepared using a Dicer RNAi system. To corroborate that the observed block in transport of StxB and VSVG indeed resulted from specific depletion of ARL1 and ARFRP1, respectively, but not from off-target effects, we also examined the effects of single siRNA oligonucleotide for ARL1 and that for ARFRP1 on transport of StxB and VSVG, respectively. As shown in supplemental Fig. S4, treatment of cells with the ARL1 siRNA caused specific reduction in the ARL1 protein and a block in retrograde transport of StxB to the Golgi. Treating cells with the ARFRP1 siRNA specifically retarded the VSVG transport to the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S4).StxB is transported from the plasma membrane to the Golgi via early and recycling endosomes (24Mallard F.

J. Cell Biol... 1998; 143: 973-990Google Scholar). We next examined whether ARL1 depletion affected another retrograde transport process, furin transport via late endosomes to the TGN (28Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 146: 345-359Google Scholar, 29Schapiro F.B. Soe T.T. Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 2884-2894Google Scholar). To this end, we made use of a HeLa cell line that stably expresses CD4-furin (21Ishizaki R. Shin H.-W. Mitsuhashi H. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 2650-2660Google Scholar), which is a chimeric protein with the exoplasmic domain of CD4 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of furin (19Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 28397-28401Google Scholar), and examined its retrograde transport by following extracellularly added anti-CD4 antibody as described previously (19Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 28397-28401Google Scholar, 21Ishizaki R. Shin H.-W. Mitsuhashi H. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol.

Cell.. 2004; 15: 2884-2894Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S5, however, the retrograde transport of the furin construct from endosomes to the TGN was not significantly altered by the ARL1 depletion. The internalized CD4-furin colocalizes well with a Golgi marker, β′-COP, after 90 min of chase in control as well as in ARL1 knockdown cells. As we showed previously, the knockdown of BIG1 and BIG2 inhibited the CD4-furin transport (21Ishizaki R. Shin H.-W. Mitsuhashi H. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 2650-2660Google Scholar). Therefore, depletion of ARL1 inhibits the retrograde transport of StxB from early/recycling endosomes but not that of CD4-furin from late endosomes to the Golgi.Depletion of Vti1a or Syntaxin 6 Blocks Retrograde Transport of StxB—Taking into account our observations that knocking down ARL1 redistributed Vti1a and syntaxin 6 (Fig. 5) and blocked the retrograde transport of StxB (Fig. 6), we next asked whether knockdown of these Q-SNAREs also affect StxB transport. For this purpose, we first examined knockdown efficiency of these SNARE proteins. As shown in Fig. 8A, immunoblot analysis confirmed specific depletion of Vti1a and syntaxin 6 by treatment of HeLa cells with corresponding siRNAs. When examined by immunofluorescence analysis, RNAi for syntaxin 6 specifically abolished its Golgi-like staining; the staining for Vti1a, Vti1b, golgin-245, ARFRP1, or ARL1 was not significantly affected (Fig. 8, H–M). When the cells were treated with siRNAs for Vti1a, the Golgi-like staining for not only Vti1a (Fig. 8B) but also syntaxin 6 (Fig. 8C) disappeared. In this context, it is noteworthy that syntaxin 6 localization has been reported to be also perturbed in syntaxin 16 knockdown cells (30Wang Y. Tai G. Johannes L. Hong W. Tang B.L. Mol. Membr.

https://openalex.org/W2083404300,"IRBIT is a recently identified protein that modulates the activities of both inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and pancreas-type Na(+)/HCO(3)(-) cotransporter 1, and the multisite phosphorylation of IRBIT is required for achieving this modulatory action. Here, we report the identification of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), which is a multi-protein complex involved in 3' processing of mRNA precursors, as an additional binding partner for IRBIT. We found that IRBIT interacted with CPSF and was recruited to an exogenous polyadenylation signal-containing RNA. The main target for IRBIT in CPSF was Fip1 subunit, and the phosphorylation of the serine-rich region of IRBIT was required both for direct association with Fip1 in vitro and for redistribution of Fip1 into the cytoplasm of intact cells. Furthermore, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an agent that induces oxidative stress, increased the phosphorylation level of IRBIT in vivo and in parallel enhanced the interaction between IRBIT and CPSF and promoted the cytoplasmic distribution of endogenous Fip1. In addition to CPSF, IRBIT interacted in vitro with poly(A) polymerase (PAP), which is the enzyme recruited by CPSF to elongate the poly(A) tail, and inhibited PAP activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. These findings raise the possibility that IRBIT modulates the polyadenylation state of specific mRNAs, both by controlling the cytoplasmic/nuclear partitioning of Fip1 and by inhibiting PAP activity, in response to a stimulus that alters its phosphorylation state."
https://openalex.org/W1991040817,"The amyloid aggregation pathway is a multistep process, and many in vitro studies have highlighted the role of particular intermediates in the cellular toxicity of various amyloid diseases. In a previous study, we generated a yeast toxic mutant (M8) of the harmless model amyloid protein Het-s(218-289). In this study, we compared the aggregation characteristics of the wild-type (WT) and the toxic mutant at the molecular level. Both proteins formed fibrillar amyloid aggregates but with different dye-binding properties and X-ray diffraction patterns. The toxic amyloid formed very unusual short (80 nm) unbranched fibers visible on transmission electron microscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that M8 beta-sheets were essentially organized into a mixed parallel and antiparallel structure, whereas the WT protein displayed a predominantly parallel organization. Cellular toxicity may therefore be related to assembly of the toxic amyloid in a new aggregation pathway."

Based on the incidence of these tumors, the disease is divided into distinct subtypes (1Lonser R.R. Glenn G.M. Walther M. Chew E.Y. Libutti S.K. Linehan W.M. Oldfield E.H. Lancet.. 2003; 361: 2059-2067Google Scholar, 2Kaelin W.G. Annu. Rev. Pathol... 2007; 2: 145-173Google Scholar). Type 1 is characterized by RCCs and hemangioblastomas, but not pheochromocytomas, and is associated with disruptive mutations and gross deletions in VHL. Type 2, which is predominantly associated with VHL missense mutations, is defined by the occurrence of pheochromocytomas, either alone (type 2C) or in combination with hemangioblastomas (type 2A) or with hemangioblastomas and RCCs (type 2B). In addition to von Hippel-Lindau disease, VHL is also mutated in the majority of sporadic RCCs and in Chuvash polycythemia (2Kaelin W.G. Annu. Rev. Pathol... 2007; 2: 145-173Google Scholar). The VHL gene product, pVHL, is the substrate recognition subunit of the CBCVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (3Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 6: 9-20Google Scholar), which in addition to pVHL consists of the scaffold protein Cullin-2, the RING finger protein Rbx1/Roc1, and the adaptors ElonginB and ElonginC that bind and stabilize pVHL. Key cellular targets of CBCVHL are the closely related hypoxia-inducible transcription factor α subunits HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which are ubiquitylated by CBCVHL and rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome under normoxic conditions (4Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature.. 1999; 399: 271-275Google Scholar, 5Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P.

Recognition by pVHL depends on the post-translational modification of two HIF-1/2α prolyl residues by members of the PHD/EglN/HPH prolyl hydroxylase family (8Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

EMBO J... 2001; 20: 5197-5206Google Scholar). These enzymes turn over molecular oxygen and thus are inactive under hypoxic conditions. Consequently, HIF-1/2α is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and assembles with HIF-1β/ARNT1 to activate transcription of hypoxia-responsive target genes involved in angiogenesis, glucose uptake and metabolism, and erythropoiesis (13Kaelin Jr. W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 30: 393-402Google Scholar). Most VHL mutations in von Hippel-Lindau disease affect the oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF-1/2α (2Kaelin W.G. Annu. Rev. Pathol... 2007; 2: 145-173Google Scholar). Type 1-associated pVHL mutant proteins fail to assemble into a functional CBCVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (14Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science.. 1999; 284: 455-461Google Scholar), whereas type 2A- and type 2B-associated pVHL mutant proteins were shown to be differentially affected in HIF-1/2α binding (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar, 16Li L. Zhang L. Zhang X. Yan Q. Minamishima Y.A. Olumi A.F. Mao M. Bartz S. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Mol. Cell.

Defective HIF-1/2α regulation is believed to be sufficient to induce development of hemangioblastomas and to be a key pathogenic event in the development of RCC (reviewed in Ref. 2Kaelin W.G. Annu. Rev. Pathol... 2007; 2: 145-173Google Scholar). This critical role of HIF-1/2α down-regulation for the tumor suppressor function of pVHL is underscored by the finding that inhibition of HIF-2α is necessary and sufficient for pVHL to suppress VHL-/- tumor growth in mouse models (18Kondo K. Klco J. Nakamura E. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Cancer Cell.. 2002; 1: 237-246Google Scholar, 19Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr. W.G. PLoS Biol... 2003; 1: 439-444Google Scholar). Nevertheless, contributions of other, HIF-independent pVHL functions to tumor suppression are possible (20Frew I.J. Krek W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 2007; 19: 685-690Google Scholar, 21Roberts A.M. Ohh M. Curr. Opin. Oncol.. 2008; 20: 83-89Google Scholar). Most notably, VHL mutations have been shown to affect primary cilium formation in kidney cells (22Thoma C.R. Frew I.J. Krek W. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 1809-1813Google Scholar), microtubule stability (23Hergovich A. Lisztwan J. Barry R. Ballschmieter P. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol... 2003; 5: 64-70Google Scholar), and extracellular matrix organization (24Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 1: 959-968Google Scholar). Although the critical role of HIF-1/2α dysregulation in the development of hemangioblastoma and RCC is widely accepted, the molecular basis of pheochromocytoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease is still under debate. The pathogenesis of pheochromocytoma has been studied by analyzing functional defects of pVHL mutant proteins linked to type 2C disease (pheochromocytoma only). In contrast to types 1 and 2A/B, type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins have been reported to be proficient in HIF-1/2α down-regulation and to suppress VHL-/- tumor growth in nude mice (25Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2001; 10: 1019-1027Google Scholar, 26Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Maher E.R. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2001; 10: 1029-1038Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these mutant proteins were recently implicated in decreased apoptosis of sympathetic neuronal precursor cells upon NGF withdrawal, suggesting that the supernumerous surviving cells give rise to pheochromocytomas (27Lee S. Nakamura E. Yang H. Wei W. Linggi M.S. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Freeman R.S. Carter B.D. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Schlisio S. Cancer Cell.. 2005; 8: 155-167Google Scholar). However, it is presently unclear to what extent the pathogenic events delineated by Lee et al. (27Lee S. Nakamura E. Yang H. Wei W. Linggi M.S. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Freeman R.S. Carter B.D. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Schlisio S. Cancer Cell.. 2005; 8: 155-167Google Scholar) are indeed independent of HIF-1/2α regulation (2Kaelin W.G. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, molecular defects of type 2C-associated mutant pVHL proteins that would specifically compromise their activity in this pathway have not been characterized. The two most frequent type 2C-associated VHL missense mutations result in the amino acid substitutions L188V (31Neumann H.P. Eng C. Mulligan L.M. Glavac D. Zauner I. Ponder B.A. Crossey P.A.

Interestingly, a recent report showed that families originally diagnosed to carry the L188V allele in fact carry an additional mutation leading to a second amino acid substitution, P81S (35Weirich G. Klein B. Wohl T. Engelhardt D. Brauch H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab... 2002; 87: 5241-5246Google Scholar). The P81S single mutation, in turn, has been linked to low penetrance type 1 von Hippel-Lindau disease (36Hes F.J. McKee S. Taphoorn M.J. Rehal P. van Der Luijt R.B. McMahon R. van Der Smagt J.J.

Lett... 2004; 151: 301-310Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of pheochromocytoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease, we analyzed structural defects of type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches. We show that pVHL mutant proteins carrying the amino acid substitutions L188V, P81S/L188V, and V84L are impaired in forming stable pVHL-ElonginC-ElonginB (VCB) complexes in vitro and CBCVHL ubiquitin ligase complexes in vivo. Furthermore, we show that type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins are mildly defective in HIF-1α regulation, suggesting the possibility that a low level of HIF-1/2α dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of pheochromocytomas. Plasmids—pVB and pBB75 (14Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science.. 1999; 284: 455-461Google Scholar), pST39-HisTrxN-VHL-ElonginB-ElonginC (39Tan S. Protein Expr. Purif... 2001; 21: 224-234Google Scholar), and pcDNA3-HA-VHL (23Hergovich A. Lisztwan J. Barry R. Ballschmieter P. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol... 2003; 5: 64-70Google Scholar) were gifts of N. Pavletich (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY), S. Tan (Penn State University, University Park, PA), and W. Krek (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland), respectively. Human VHL (codons 54–213) was subcloned into pCMV-2C (Stratagene) and pBabe-Puro (40Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res... 1990; 18: 3587-3596Google Scholar) (gift of W. Krek) using standard techniques. Human ElonginB (full length) and ElonginC (codons 17–112) were PCR-amplified using pST39-HisTrxN-VHL-ElonginB-ElonginC as template and cloned into a pET24a (Invitrogen) derivative for the expression of fusion proteins with the lipoyl domain of Bacillus stearothermophilus dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase. VHL alleles coding for pVHL mutant proteins carrying the amino acid substitutions P81S, L188V, P81S/L188V, V84L, and C162F, respectively, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The correct sequences of all inserts were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Lines—HEK293T cell lines (ATCC) and the packaging cell line LinX-A (41Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 1769-1774Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RCC4 VHL-/- renal cell carcinoma cell lines were a gift of P. Maxwell (Imperial College, London, UK). RCC4-derived cell pools expressing wild type or mutant VHL were generated by infection with retroviruses obtained by transfecting LinX-A cells with pBabe-Puro-VHL using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Stable cell pools were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 μg/ml puromycin. Protein Purification—Expression and purification of recombinant VCB complex were performed exactly as described (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar). For isotopically enriched protein preparations, VCB or ElonginBC complexes were co-expressed in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and purified as will be published elsewhere. 4E. Cartwright, K. Knauth, A. Buchberger, S. Freund, and M. Bycroft, manuscript in preparation. Biochemical Analyses—In vitro transcription and translation using pcDNA3-HA-VHL as template and HIF-1α peptide binding measurements were performed exactly as described (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar). Partial tryptic proteolysis was essentially performed as described (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar), using 800 ng of VCB complex and 8 ng of trypsin. For the analysis of VCB aggregation state by size exclusion chromatography, 30 μg of VCB complex were incubated overnight at 4, 30, or 37 °C and subsequently loaded at 4 °C onto a Superdex S75 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Eluted fractions were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. NMR Spectroscopy—1H,15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled wild type VCB complex, pVHLL188V-containing VCB complex, and ElonginBC complex (all 0.1 mm in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% D2O) were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker AVANCE 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryo probe head. Full assignments of the wild type VCB spectrum will be published elsewhere. 4E. Cartwright, K. Knauth, A. Buchberger, S. Freund, and M. Bycroft, manuscript in preparation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—Expression of FLAG-pVHL in 293T cells and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (42Bex C. Knauth K. Dambacher S. Buchberger A. Nucleic Acids Res... 2007; 35: e142Google Scholar). Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblots using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope (M2; Sigma), Cullin-2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Rbx1 (Ab-1; NeoMarkers), and ElonginC (R-20; Santa Cruz). Protein levels in RCC4-derived cell pools were analyzed by immunoblots using antibodies directed against pVHL (VHL-CT; gift of W. Krek), HIF-1α (clone 54; BD Transduction), and tubulin (Sigma). Quantitative PCR—To quantify mRNA levels in RCC4-derived cell pools, total RNA from 106 cells was purified using a High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 μg of total RNA using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) with a combination of oligo(dT)18 primer (final concentration, 2.5 μm) and primer pBabe3 (5′-CTG ACA CAC ATT CCA CAG GG-3′; final concentration, 2 μm). Real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) using a SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 μl of cDNA (diluted 1:10) and primer pairs (final concentration, 0.5 μm) specific for VHL (forward, 5′-TTG TCC GGA GCC TAG TCA AG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG TGC TGG CGA ATT CAA TC-3′); GLUT1 (forward, 5′-GAG CAG CTA CCC TGG ATG TC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAG AAC CAG GAG CAC AGT GA-3′); HPRT (forward, 5′-TGG ACA GGA CTG AAC GTC TTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAG TCA TAG GAA TGG ATC TAT CAC-3′); and PBG-D (forward, 5′-CCC TGG AGA AGA ATG AAG TGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTC TCT GGC AGG GTT TCT AGG-3′). Crossing point raw data were quantified using as standard curve a serial dilution of cDNA from RCC4/pBabe-Puro-pVHL wild type, and subsequently normalized to the mean of the HPRT and PBG-D data. Negative controls performed by omitting reverse transcriptase from the cDNA synthesis reaction did not result in any PCR product (data not shown). Type 2C-associated pVHL Mutant Proteins Are Proficient in Substrate Binding—Type 2C-associated mutations do not affect pVHL residues in close proximity to the HIF-1α-binding site (14Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science.. 1999; 284: 455-461Google Scholar, 43Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y.

Consistently, no significant defects in HIF-1α binding were detected in previous, qualitative analyses of type 2C-associated mutant pVHL proteins (25Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr. W.G. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2001; 10: 1019-1027Google Scholar, 26Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Maher E.R. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2001; 10: 1029-1038Google Scholar). To test this more rigorously, we used recombinant wild type and mutant VCB complexes to quantify the binding of a fluorescent, HIF-1α-derived substrate peptide (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar). In kinetic measurements of substrate peptide release, all of the mutant VCB complexes were found to possess dissociation rate constants very similar to the wild type complex (Table 1). In equilibrium titration experiments, the pVHLP81S-containing VCB complex and the type 2C-associated pVHLL188V- and pVHLP81S/L188V-containing VCB complexes bound substrate peptide with slightly (∼3-fold) lower affinity than the wild type complex (Table 1). Thus, type 2C-associated mutations affect substrate binding of pVHL only moderately. In particular, the affinities for the HIF-1α-derived peptide are still in the low nanomolar range and thus 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than for prototypical type 2A-band type 2B-associated mutant pVHL proteins (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar).Table 1Substrate binding of wild type and mutant VCB complexes The Kd and koff values for the interaction with the HIF-1α-derived Hyp-MIANS peptide (15Knauth K.

To that end, VHL was transcribed and translated in vitro at 30 °C in reticulocyte lysate providing endogenous ElonginB and ElonginC, and the formation of stable VCB complex was monitored by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar, 45Feldman D.E. Spiess C. Howard D.E. Frydman J. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 12: 1213-1224Google Scholar, 46Hansen W.J. Ohh M. Moslehi J. Kondo K. Kaelin W.G. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2002; 22: 1947-1960Google Scholar). When the electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C, wild type and type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins migrated in a defined VCB complex, unlike the assembly-deficient pVHLC162F mutant protein that served as a negative control (Fig. 1). At 30 °C, in contrast, pVHLP81S/L188V and pVHLV84L failed to migrate in a stable VCB complex, and the level of stably assembled pVHLL188V was significantly reduced. At 37 °C, the differences between wild type and mutant pVHL proteins were even more pronounced, because pVHLL188V completely failed to migrate in a stable complex, and the amount of pVHLP81S incorporated into VCB was strongly reduced. These data show that type 2C-associated mutant pVHL proteins are impaired in their ability to form or maintain stable VCB complexes at physiologically relevant temperature. Moreover, the destabilization caused by the L188V and P81S amino acid substitutions was additive in this assay, because the pVHLP81S/L188V double mutant protein was significantly stronger affected than pVHLL188V. It is important to note, however, that all type 2C-associated mutant proteins were fully proficient in forming a stable VCB complex at 4 °C after they had been in vitro translated at 30 °C, indicating that they, unlike the type 1-associated pVHLC162F mutant protein, do not possess a general assembly defect. This conclusion is also supported by our ability to purify recombinant mutant VCB complexes to homogeneity over several chromatographic steps at 4 °C after co-expression of the subunits in Escherichia coli at room temperature. To further analyze the temperature-dependent stability of the wild type and mutant VCB complexes, we performed size exclusion chromatography of recombinant VCB at 4 °C after overnight incubation at 4, 30, or 37 °C (Fig. 2). After incubation at 4 °C, wild type and mutant complexes showed indistinguishable elution profiles consistent with their molecular masses of 43 kDa, confirming that type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins do not cause gross structural perturbations or destabilization of the VCB complex at this temperature. After incubation at 30 °C, however, significant amounts of pVHLL188V- and pVHLP81S/L188V-containing VCB complex eluted in the void volume of the column, indicating a higher oligomerization/aggregation state and/or altered shape at this temperature. Preincubation at 37 °C aggravated this effect and resulted in the accumulation of ∼50% of pVHLL188V-containing and more than 50% of pVHLP81S/L188V-containing VCB complex in the void volume, as judged by the relative peak areas of the chromatograms. At this temperature, some pVHLP81S-containing VCB complex also eluted in the void volume, whereas wild type VCB complex was exclusively detected as a 43-kDa species. Together, these results indicate that type 2C-associated mutations cause temperature-dependent aggregation or structural alterations of the VCB complex, consistent with the results obtained with the reticulocyte system. Type 2C-associated pVHL Mutant Proteins Are Partially Unfolded—To specifically analyze the conformation of pVHL at 37 °C, the susceptibility of wild type and type 2C-associated mutant recombinant VCB complexes to tryptic degradation was tested (Fig. 3). While the ElonginB and ElonginC subunits were protease resistant during the time course of the experiment, wild type pVHL was gradually degraded and barely detectable after 2 h. The pVHLP81S mutant protein was degraded only slightly faster than the wild type. In contrast, pVHLL188V, pVHLP81S/L188V, and pVHLV84L were extremely susceptible to tryptic degradation and undetectable after 10–20 min. Of note, the protease concentration in these experiments was 10-fold lower compared with our previous analysis of type 2A/B-associated mutant pVHL proteins (15Knauth K. Bex C. Jemth P. Buchberger A. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 370-377Google Scholar) in order to detect type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins at all. These results suggest that type 2C-associated mutations induce significant conformational changes in pVHL, either within the VCB complex or upon dissociation from ElonginB and ElonginC. To analyze the folding state of wild type pVHL and the type 2C-associated pVHLL188V mutant protein within the VCB complex in more detail in a noninvasive manner, we employed two-dimensional, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of the wild type complex at 25 °C shows the expected number of predominantly well dispersed cross-peaks, with some spectral overlap in the central part and the side chain region (Fig. 4a, blue spectrum). The spectrum of the heterodimeric ElonginB-ElonginC complex overlaps extensively with the wild type VCB spectrum (Fig. 4a, yellow spectrum), illustrating that the overall structure of ElonginB and C is retained in the VCB complex. While the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of the pVHLP81S-containing VCB complex is almost indistinguishable from the wild type complex (data not shown), the spectrum of the pVHLL188V-containing complex is dramatically different (Fig. 4b, red spectrum). The most obvious difference is the almost complete lack of native pVHL resonances, highlighting the loss of structure of the pVHL subunit of the mutant VCB complex. Although pVHLL188V shows extensive structural disorder, as evident from the intense, overlapping resonances in the central region of the spectrum, most ElonginB and C signals are retained, demonstrating the individuality of the Elongins within the VCB complex. Of note, however, some weak residual native pVHL resonances could be identified, including the β domain residues Gly123, Asn131, Gln132, and Gly144 (Fig. 4, c and d). These signals indicate conformational exchange between the folded and unfolded states of pVHLL188V, with an emphasis on the unfolded state. In addition, they show that at"
https://openalex.org/W1994659883,"Indole derivatives compounds (IDC) are a new class of splicing inhibitors that have a selective action on exonic splicing enhancers (ESE)-dependent activity of individual serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins. Some of these molecules have been shown to compromise assembly of HIV infectious particles in cell cultures by interfering with the activity of the SR protein SF2/ASF and by subsequently suppressing production of splicing-dependent retroviral accessory proteins. For all replication-competent retroviruses, a limiting requirement for infection and pathogenesis is the expression of the envelope glycoprotein which strictly depends on the host splicing machinery. Here, we have evaluated the efficiency of IDC on an animal model of retroviral pathogenesis using a fully replication-competent retrovirus. In this model, all newborn mice infected with a fully replicative murine leukemia virus (MLV) develop erythroleukemia within 6 to 8 weeks of age. We tested several IDC for their ability to interfere ex vivo with MLV splicing and virus spreading as well as for their protective effect in vivo. We show here that two of these IDC, IDC13 and IDC78, selectively altered splicing-dependent production of the retroviral envelope gene, thus inhibiting early viral replication in vivo, sufficiently to protect mice from MLV-induced pathogenesis. The apparent specificity and clinical safety observed here for both IDC13 and IDC78 strongly support further assessment of inhibitors of SR protein splicing factors as a new class of antiretroviral therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2060907452,"Transplantation of vasculogenic progenitor cells (VPC) improves neovascularization after ischemia. However, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus show a reduced VPC number and impaired functional activity. Previously, we demonstrated that p38 kinase inhibition prevents the negative effects of glucose on VPC number by increasing proliferation and differentiation towards the endothelial lineage in vitro. Moreover, the functional capacity of progenitor cells is reduced in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes (Lepr(db)) in vivo.The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying signalling mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we performed DNA-protein binding arrays in the bone marrow of mice with metabolic syndrome, in blood-derived progenitor cells of diabetic patients as well as in VPC ex vivo treated with high levels of glucose. The transcriptional activation of ETS transcription factors was increased in all samples analyzed. Downregulation of ETS1 expression by siRNA abrogated the reduction of VPC number induced by high-glucose treatment. In addition, we observed a concomitant suppression of the non-endothelial ETS-target genes matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and CD115 upon short term lentiviral delivery of ETS-specific shRNAs. Long term inhibition of ETS expression by lentiviral infection increased the number of cells with the endothelial markers CD144 and CD105.These data demonstrate that diabetes leads to dysregulated activation of ETS, which blocks the functional activity of progenitor cells and their commitment towards the endothelial cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2020962857,"We hypothesize that specific bone marrow lineages and cytokine treatment may facilitate bone marrow migration into islets, leading to a conversion into insulin producing cells in vivo. In this study we focused on identifying which bone marrow subpopulations and cytokine treatments play a role in bone marrow supporting islet function in vivo by evaluating whether bone marrow is capable of migrating into islets as well as converting into insulin positive cells. We approached this aim by utilizing several bone marrow lineages and cytokine-treated bone marrow from green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive bone marrow donors. Sorted lineages of Mac-1(+), Mac-1(-), Sca(+), Sca(-), Sca(-)/Mac-1(+) and Sca(+)/Mac-1(-) from GFP positive mice were transplanted to irradiated C57BL6 GFP negative mice. Bone marrow from transgenic human ubiquitin C promoter GFP (uGFP, with strong signal) C57BL6 mice was transplanted into GFP negative C57BL6 recipients. After eight weeks, migration of GFP positive donor' bone marrow to the recipient's pancreatic islets was evaluated as the percentage of positive GFP islets/total islets. The results show that the most effective migration comes from the Sca(+)/Mac(-) lineage and these cells, treated with cytokines for 48 hours, were found to have converted into insulin positive cells in pancreatic islets in vivo. This study suggests that bone marrow lineage positive cells and cytokine treatments are critical factors in determining whether bone marrow is able to migrate and form insulin producing cells in vivo. The mechanisms causing this facilitation as well as bone marrow converting to pancreatic beta cells still need to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2050195890,"Human disease studies using DNA microarrays in both clinical/observational and experimental/controlled studies are having increasing impact on our understanding of the complexity of human diseases. A fundamental concept is the use of gene expression as a ""common currency"" that links the results of in vitro controlled experiments to in vivo observational human studies. Many studies--in cancer and other diseases--have shown promise in using in vitro cell manipulations to improve understanding of in vivo biology, but experiments often simply fail to reflect the enormous phenotypic variation seen in human diseases. We address this with a framework and methods to dissect, enhance and extend the in vivo utility of in vitro derived gene expression signatures. From an experimentally defined gene expression signature we use statistical factor analysis to generate multiple quantitative factors in human cancer gene expression data. These factors retain their relationship to the original, one-dimensional in vitro signature but better describe the diversity of in vivo biology. In a breast cancer analysis, we show that factors can reflect fundamentally different biological processes linked to molecular and clinical features of human cancers, and that in combination they can improve prediction of clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2047366027,"Arylsulfatase A (ASA) catalyzes the intralysosomal desulfation of 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide) to galactosylceramide. The reaction requires saposin B (Sap B), a non-enzymatic proteinaceous cofactor which presents sulfatide to the catalytic site of ASA. The lack of either ASA or Sap B results in a block of sulfatide degradation, progressive intralysosomal accumulation of sulfatide, and the fatal lysosomal storage disease metachromatic leukodystrophy. We studied the coupled Sap B-ASA reaction in vitro using detergent-free micellar and liposomal assay systems and in vivo using cell culture models of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Under in vitro conditions, the reaction had a narrow pH optimum around pH 4.3 and was inhibited by mono- and divalent cations, phosphate and sulfite. Bis(monoacylglycero) phosphate and phosphatidic acid were activators of the reaction, underscoring a significant role of acidic phosphoglycerolipids in sphingolipid degradation. Desulfation was negligible when Sap B was substituted by Sap A, C, or D. Up to a molar ratio between Sap B and sulfatide of 1:5, an elevation of Sap B concentrations caused a sharp increase of sulfatide hydrolysis, indicating the requirement of unexpected high Sap B levels for maximum turnover. Feeding of ASA-deficient, sulfatide-storing primary mouse kidney cells with ASA caused partial clearance of sulfatide. Co-feeding of Sap B or its precursor prosaposin resulted in the lysosomal uptake of the cofactor but did not promote ASA-catalyzed sulfatide hydrolysis. This suggests that Sap B is not a limiting factor of the coupled Sap B-ASA reaction in mouse kidney cells even if sulfatide has accumulated to unphysiologically high levels."
https://openalex.org/W2020766238,"The chain length of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 capsular polysaccharide (cellubiuronic acid) is tightly regulated by the cellubiuronic acid synthase through an assembly process involving a catalytic motif that is potentially conserved over a wide range of related processive beta-glucan synthases. Cellubiuronic acid is initiated on a lipid and is composed of alternating beta-1,3-Glc and beta-1,4-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) linkages. The entire assembly process is carried out by a polypeptide synthase thought to contain a single active site, suggesting that the donor specificity is controlled by the terminal nonreducing sugar in the acceptor subsite. Shortly after initiation, the synthase undergoes an allosteric transition accompanied by the tight binding of the nascent chain via its nonreducing oligosaccharide terminal segment to the carbohydrate acceptor recognition site. The chain length of polysaccharide assembled by recombinant synthase in Escherichia coli membranes was determined by an ejection mechanism that appeared to be a reversal of the allosteric transition of the synthase from the transitory to the fully processive state. The rates of both ejection and transition were shown to be highly sensitive to the concentration of UDP-GlcUA. As the concentration of UDP-GlcUA was increased, both the rate of synthesis and the processive turnover time increased. The product of the processive turnover time and the rate of synthesis predicted a marked increase in polysaccharide chain size (from 50 to 1150 kDa) over a relatively narrow concentration range of 1-11.5 microm UDP-GlcUA. The kinetic model chain length predictions were in close agreement with chemically determined sizes of polysaccharides synthesized at the same UDP-sugar concentrations. The model indicates that translocation occurs following the addition of GlcUA to the chain terminus, whereas UDP-Glc drives chain termination when inadequate levels of UDP-GlcUA are present. In sum, type 3 synthase appears to modulate polysaccharide chain length by functioning as a concentration-dependent kinetic timing device."
https://openalex.org/W1997526300,"Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is a major collagen receptor on the platelet surface that recognizes the glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (GPO) sequence in the collagen molecule and plays a crucial role in thrombus formation.

For low molecular weight drug design for GPVI, it is essential to obtain precise structural and interaction information about GPVI-binding ligands. However, experimentally obtained structural and interaction information of small ligands, such as peptides, in the GPVI-bound state has not been reported. In this study, by screening a phage-displayed peptide library, we discovered a novel peptide ligand (pep-10L; YSDTDWLYFSTS) without any similarities to the sequence of collagen that inhibits GPVI-GPO binding. Systematic Ala scanning in surface plasmon resonance experiments and a saturation transfer difference NMR experiment revealed that Trp6, Leu7, Phe9, and Ser10 residues in the pep-10L peptide interacted with GPVI. Furthermore, the GPVI-bound conformation of the pep-10L peptide was determined using transferred nuclear Overhauser effect analysis. The obtained structure has revealed that the central part of pep-10L (Asp5–Phe9) has a helical conformation, the side chains of Trp6, Leu7, and Phe9 form a hydrophobic side in the helix, and the Tyr8 side chain faces the opposite direction from the hydrophobic side. Computational docking prediction has shown that the hydrophobic side of pep-10L sticks in the hydrophobic groove on the GPVI surface, which corresponds to the putative collagen-related peptide binding groove.

These observations suggest that inhibitors that block the interaction of GPVI with collagen could be effective antithrombotic drugs without severe side effects.

GPVI recognizes the glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (GPO) sequence in the collagen molecule (10Knight C. Morton L. Onley D. Peachey A. Ichinohe T. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Cardiovasc. Res... 1999; 41: 450-457Google Scholar). In addition to collagen, synthetic collagen-related peptide (CRP), which contains 10 GPO repeats, is also a specific agonist for GPVI and is commonly used to study GPVI function (11Lecut C. Arocas V.

Other studies, using blocking phage antibodies, site-directed mutagenesis, and crystal structure-based computational docking prediction, have shown the possibility that GPVI has multiple binding sites (11Lecut C.

Recently, we established a rapid and easy preparation method for stable-isotope labeled peptides, which are directly obtained from a bacteriophage library (15Mizukoshi Y. Takahashi H. Shimada I. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2006; 34: 23-30Google Scholar). NMR is a versatile and useful technique for structural determinations and also for analyses of the interactions of peptides bound to target molecules with various affinities. The structural and interaction information obtained by NMR analyses provide insight into improving the affinity of peptides and/or the design of the small molecules that bind to the target protein. In this study, novel peptide ligands that inhibit GPVI-GPO binding were found through screening a phage-displayed peptide library, and NMR analyses were performed. The amino acid residues interacting with GPVI were found by systematic Ala scanning of the peptide with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and by saturation transfer difference (STD) analysis (16Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl... 1999; 38: 1784-1788Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GPVI-bound conformation of the peptide was determined by transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (TRNOE) analysis. These data could enable the structure-guided development of a small molecule GPVI antagonist. Preparation of Peptides—All synthetic peptides were purchased from BEX, Tokyo, Japan. The homotrimer of GPO-1 was prepared as described below from backbone peptide, according to a previous report (17Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar). The GPO-1 peptide (sequence: (GPP)4GPO(GPP)4GPCCGGG) was dissolved in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (1 mg/ml); then, 9 mm GSSG and 0.9 mm GSH were added. After incubation for 5 days at 20 °C, the solution was dialyzed with 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to confirm the molecular weights of the GPO-1 homotrimer. The GPO-1 homotrimer peptide was biotinylated using an EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Recombinant GPVI-Fc2—Recombinant human GPVI protein (residues Gln21–Phe234) was expressed as a chimera with a human IgG Fc portion at the C terminus using the pcDNA3.1 vector and was purified as previously described with a minor modification (18Miura Y. Takahashi T. Jung S. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 46197-46204Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines expressing recombinant dimeric GPVI-Fc (GPVI-Fc2) were selected in α-minimal essential medium (Wako) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). For the purification of recombinant GPVI-Fc2 protein, conditioned medium in Chinese hamster ovary-S-SFM II (Invitrogen) was collected after 4 days of culture. Conditioned medium was applied to a protein A affinity column (HiTrap Protein A HP, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4). The bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 3.0) and immediately neutralized by 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purity and the molecular mass of the protein were confirmed by 12% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions. Construction of Phagemid Vector and Phage Library—The phagemid vector containing the DNA sequence for the gVIII signal and gVIII was generated as previously described (15Mizukoshi Y. Takahashi H. Shimada I. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2006; 34: 23-30Google Scholar). For construction of the phage library, two rounds of PCR were performed. In the first PCR, the resulting phagemid vector was used as a template, and the following primers were used: 5′-AAACAGACCATGGCCATGAAAAAGTCTTTA-3′ (forward) (underline indicates NcoI site) and 5′-GTCACCGGATCCCATMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNGTAAGCGAAAGACAGCATCGG-3′ (backward) (underline indicates BamHI site). In the second PCR, we used the products from the first PCR as a template, and the following primers were used: 5′-AAACAGACCATGGCCATGAAAAAGTCTTTA-3′ (forward, same as the forward primer of first PCR) (underline indicates NcoI site) and 5′-GTCACCGGATCCCAT-3′ (backward) (underline indicates BamHI site). The resulting fragments were inserted into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the phagemid vector. The resulting phagemid encodes a fusion product with the gVIII signal peptide Y-XXXXXXXXXX-M-GSGD, and gVIII (Y, detectable residue at 280 nm by high-performance liquid chromatography; XXXXXXXXXX, 10-mer random sequence (peptide library sequence); M, cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage residue; and GSGD, flexible linker). The phagemid mixture was transformed by electroporation into Escherichia coli XL1-blue. The transformants were then infected with the KO7 helper phage (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting library had a diversity of 7.0 × 105. Screening of Phage Library—The phage libraries were cycled through five rounds of binding selection with GPVI-Fc2. For rounds 1, 3, 4, and 5, GPVI-Fc2 (5 μg) in PBS was immobilized on Protein A magnetic beads (Invitrogen) through incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. For round 2, GPVI-Fc2 (0.4 μg/well) in PBS was added to the Protein-G-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After coating GPVI-Fc2, the beads or plates were blocked with BlockAce (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka, Japan) at room temperature for 30 min and then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS (T-PBS). Phage particles were incubated with the GPVI-Fc2-bound beads or plates for 1 h at room temperature. The beads or plates were washed three times under the following conditions: for rounds 1 and 2, 20% BlockAce (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma) and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS (BA-T-PBS) for 3 min; for rounds 3 and 4, BA-T-PBS for 10 min; for round 5, 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in BA-T-PBS for 10 min. The bound phage particles were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) and immediately neutralized by 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The eluted sample was used to infect fresh E. coli XL 1-Blue cells. After 5 rounds of binding selection, individual phage particles were isolated and subjected to DNA sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using GPVI-Fc2 was performed in 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). A recombinant protein irrelevant to GPVI, which has human IgG-Fc, was used as a control protein. GPVI-Fc2 (0.1 μg) and control protein (0.1 μg) in PBS (50 μl) were added to wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed twice with T-PBS, and then blocked with BA-T-PBS (200 μl/well) at room temperature for 30 min. Individual phage clones in BA-T-PBS (50 μl) were added to each well, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the wells were washed four times with T-PBS, anti-M13-HRP antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in BA-T-PBS (1:2000, v/v, 50 μl/well) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed four times with T-PBS, and then 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was added to the wells (50 μl/well), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After the addition of 0.5 m H2SO4 (50 μl/well, Wako, Osaka, Japan), optical density at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Multiskan JX, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). SPR Analysis—SPR analysis was performed at 25 °C using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences) and HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% v/v surfactant P20). Human type I collagen (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and CRP (sequence: GKO(GPO)10GKOG) were immobilized on a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Amersham Biosciences) using an Amine Coupling Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biotinylated GPO-1 homotrimer peptide was immobilized on an SA sensor chip (Amersham Biosciences). GPVI-Fc2 in HBS-EP buffer was injected over the ligand-immobilized surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and the maximum response was recorded. For competitive experiments, GPVI-Fc2 (1 μm for CRP, 12 μm for collagen, and 5 μm for GPO-1) and peptide (0–2000 μm) were incubated before injection. Based upon the dose-dependent inhibition curve, IC50 values could be determined and the inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated by the Cheng-Pursoff equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + [L]/KD), where [L] is GPVI-Fc2 concentration and KD is the dissociation constant of the interaction between GPVI-Fc2 and each immobilized ligand. Each sample was also analyzed using a flow cell without ligands for a control. The sensorgram of the ligand immobilized surface was subtracted by that of the control surface. Preparation of Labeled Peptide—Tandem repeat inserts were prepared by annealing (70 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 25 °C over a 3-h period) and ligation of oligonucleotides encoding the pep-10L peptide sequences 5′-P-TACTCTGACACCGACTGGCTGTACTTCTCTACCATG-3′ and 5′-P-GGTAGAGAAGTACAGCCAGTCGGTGTCAGAGTACAT-3′. The resulting tandem repeat inserts were ligated into the pET31b(+) plasmid (AlwNI-digested and dephosphorylated) containing a gene encoding ketosteroid isomerase and a His tag, which facilitate the purification of target peptides (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BLR(DE3)pLysS (a recA- derivative of BL21); as anticipated, this resulted in a series of products with a varying number of pep-10L insertions. The insertion of pep-10L and its tandem repeats was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems), and a plasmid containing four copies of the pep-10L coding sequence was selected. The cells were grown in 13C/15N CHL medium (Chlorella Industry, Tokyo, Japan) containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A600 = 0.6 and were then induced for 4 h at 37 °C with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). The cells were harvested, and then the inclusion body was prepared. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m guanidine-HCl, and the ketosteroid isomerase/pep-10L peptide/His tag fusion protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography in the denatured condition. After imidazole was removed from the fraction containing the ketosteroid isomerase/pep-10L peptide/His tag fusion protein using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), 1 m HCl (final concentration of 0.1 m), and 400 mg/ml CNBr (Wako) in acetonitrile (final concentration of 20 mg/ml) were added to the solution. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The CNBr-cleaved peptide mixture was centrifuged (9000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was roughly separated using C8 Sep-Pak® (Waters). The 30% acetonitrile fractions were lyophilized, diluted with water, and further purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a YMC-Pack PROTEIN-RP (YMC, Kyoto, Japan) with a gradient of H2O/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular weight of the labeled pep-10L peptide was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Shimadzu). NMR Spectroscopy—The assignments of the backbone (13Cα, 15N, and 1HN) and 13Cβ resonances of pep-10L were achieved by using HNCACB (19Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. B.. 1993; 101: 201-205Google Scholar) and CBCA(CO)NH (20Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1992; 114: 6291-6293Google Scholar). The spectra of the pep-10L peptide at 407 μm were recorded at 298 K in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), prepared in 95% H2O and 5% D2O. The assignments of side-chain 1H and 13C resonances were obtained from the combined use of HCCH-COSY (21Ikura M. Kay L. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1991; 1: 299-304Google Scholar) and HCCH-TOCSY (22Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Singer A.U. Muhandiram D.R. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Magn. Reson. B.. 1993; 101: 333-337Google Scholar), with the knowledge of the assigned 13Cα and 13Cβ resonances. The spectra of the pep-10L peptide at 375 μm were recorded at 298 K in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), prepared in 99.9% D2O. All spectra were processed by NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar), and the software Sparky 4T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, Sparky 3, University of California, San Francisco. was used to assist in data analyses. For the two-dimensional STD-HSQC experiments, 130 μg of lyophilized 13C/15N-pep-10L peptide was dissolved in 275 μl of 99.9% D2O/50 mm NaCl/20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 405 μg of GPVI-Fc2 (16Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl... 1999; 38: 1784-1788Google Scholar). The final concentrations of the peptide and GPVI-Fc2 were 300 μm and 12.3 μm, respectively. The two-dimensional STD-HSQC experiments were performed at 288 K on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryo-cooled triple-resonance probe. A series of equally separated 50-ms Gaussian-shaped pulses with a 1-ms delay between the pulses was used for selective saturation of the target protein (GPVI-Fc2), and the total saturation time was ∼1.5 s. The additional relaxation delay was set to 1.5 s prior to the saturation scheme. The irradiation power of the selective pulses was set to 100 Hz, and the on-resonance irradiation was performed at a chemical shift of -0.5 ppm, while the off-resonance irradiation was applied at -30 ppm. For TRNOE experiments 445 μg of lyophilized pep-10L peptide was dissolved in 300 μl of 5% D2O/50 mm NaCl/20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 895 μg of GPVI-Fc2. The final concentrations of the peptide and GPVI-Fc2 were 1 mm and 25 μm, respectively. Two-dimensional TRNOE experiments with a mixing time of 50 ms were performed at 310 K on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer with a cryo-cooled triple-resonance probe. For the attenuation of broad resonances of the large protein, the relaxation filter that utilizes spin-locking of z-magnetizations after the preparation delay was applied (25Ni F. Prog. NMR Spect... 1994; 26: 517-606Google Scholar). In this condition, NOE cross-peaks originating from the peptide in the absence of the target protein are mostly suppressed. To minimize intense solvent resonances, the WATERGATE scheme was employed (26Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Distance restraints for pep-10L upon binding to GPVI-Fc2 were derived from the NOE cross-peaks in the TRNOE experiment described above that were converted into distances by volume integration using Sparky4 and the CALIBA program within the CYANA 2.1 software suite (27Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar, 28Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 319: 209-227Google Scholar). An r-4 distance dependence of the NOE cross-peak intensity is assumed to minimize the potential spin diffusion effect of the NOE distance restraints (29Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol... 1991; 217: 517-530Google Scholar, 30Koenig B. Kontaxis G. Mitchell D. Louis J. Litman B. Bax A. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 322: 441-461Google Scholar). The NOE intensity between Trp6 Hδ1-Hϵ1 aromatic protons, which corresponds to a distance of 2.6 Å, was used for calibration. A total of 100 structures was calculated by using the torsion angle dynamics protocol. The obtained structures were sorted according to the final value of the target function: the best 20 structures were analyzed with regard to distance and angle violations. Of these 20 structures, the best 10 structures were visualized using MOLMOL. Binding Site and Binding Pose Prediction—The binding site predictions of GPVI were performed using the following four computer programs, which detect possible ligand-binding sites based on the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of the receptor: ""SiteMap"" in Schrödinger Suite (Schrödinger, Portland, OR), ""Site Detection"" in the program ""fred_receptor"" (OpenEye Scientific Software, Santa Fe, NM), ""Site Finder"" in the program package MOE (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada), and ""Site ID"" in the program SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). The crystal structure of GPVI D1-D2 (PDB 2GI7) (14Horii K. Kahn M. Herr A. Blood.. 2006; 108: 936-942Google Scholar) was used as the input coordinates for prediction. The binding pose prediction of the pep-10L peptide was performed using the PatchDock server (31Schneidman-Duhovny D. Inbar Y. Polak V. Shatsky M. Halperin I. Benyamini H. Barzilai A. Dror O. Haspel N. Nussinov R. Wolfson H. Proteins.. 2003; 52: 107-112Google Scholar). The crystal structure of GPVI D1 (PDB 2GI7) (14Horii K. Kahn M. Herr A. Blood.. 2006; 108: 936-942Google Scholar) and the conformation of the pep-10L determined from the TRNOE data were used for the prediction. Selection of Peptide-displayed Phages by GPVI-Fc2—To obtain a large amount of peptide ligands with diversity for GPVI, a phage library that displayed random foreign peptides on the N terminus of the major coat protein (gVIII protein) of bacteriophage M13 was constructed. As a target for the panning of the phage display library, recombinant human GPVI-Fc2 expressed by CHO cells was used. After 5 rounds of panning, 10 individual clones were obtained (Table 1). These 10 clones were examined for their GPVI-binding ability in phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1). A recombinant protein irrelevant to GPVI, which has human IgG-Fc, was used as a control protein. Nine clones (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) bound to GPVI-Fc2 and did not bind to the control protein. Furthermore, the No. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 clones showed less nonspecific binding than that of the No. 1, 2, and 8 clones. These results indicate that the No. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 clones have specific binding activity for GPVI.Table 1Amino acid sequences of peptides expressed by phage clones bound to GPVI-Fc2 Phages were isolated from the fifth round of panning against GPVI-Fc2 from a random phage display library. The phage DNA sequences were determined, and amino acid sequences were deduced from the codons.

Because the peptide forms the C-terminal homoserinelactone peptide after being released from the modified gVIII protein using CNBr, the C-terminal Met residue was replaced with Ser for the synthetic peptide sequence. The synthetic peptides were tested for their inhibitory effect on GPVI-Fc2 binding to CRP in SPR experiments. CRP, which contains 10 GPO repeats, is a specific agonist for GPVI and is commonly used to study GPVI function (11Lecut C. Arocas V. Ulrichts H. Elbaz A. Villeval J. Lacapère J. Deckmyn H. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 52293-52299Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (Kd) of GPVI-Fc2 for CRP is 5.0 × 10-6 m, as shown in a previous report (18Miura Y. Takahashi T. Jung S. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 46197-46204Google Scholar). Three peptides, pep-5, pep-7, and pep-10 (200 μm), showed a >20% inhibitory effect on GPVI-Fc2 binding to CRP (Fig. 2); these peptides also showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect (data not shown). These results suggest that pep-5, pep-7, and pep-10 can share the GPO recognition site in GPVI. The sequences of these peptides share more than two acidic residues and four continuous hydrophobic residues (pep-5: Trp8-Leu9-Phe10-Pro11; pep-7: Trp8-Trp9-Leu10-Phe11; and pep-10: Trp6-Met7-Tyr8-Phe9). The similarity between the peptides suggests that acidic residues and/or hydrophobic residues may be involved in GPVI binding. The pep-10 peptide had the strongest inhibitory effect on GPVI binding to CRP (Fig. 2). Therefore, this peptide was the focus of further experiments. Another synthetic peptide, pep-10L, which replaces the CNBr-cleavable Met residue in the pep-10 sequence with a Leu residue, was prepared. The pep-10L peptide had an inhibitory effect on GPVI-Fc2 binding to CRP equal to pep-10 (Fig. 2). This result indicates that the inhibitory effect of pep-10L is comparable to that of pep-10 and that the Met residue is replaceable with Leu without a loss of activity. The pep-10L peptide dose-dependently inhibited GPVI-Fc2 binding to CRP (supplemental Fig. S1), and its Ki was calculated to be 180 μm (Table 2). This result suggests that the pep-10L peptide is a full antagonist for GPVI-Fc2 binding to CRP.Table 2The inhibition constants of pep-10L for the interaction between GPVI-Fc2 and its ligands Immobilized ligand Ki of pep-10L μm CRP 180 GPO-1 225 Type1 collagen 179 Open table in a new tab Inhibitory Effect of pep-10L on GPVI-Fc2 Direct Binding to the GPO Sequence—Next, the effect of the pep-10L peptide on GPVI binding to human type I collagen and the GPO-1 peptide was investigated. Type I collagen is a native ligand for GPVI and is involved in platelet adhesion and activation in the vascular subendothelium (32Cosemans J. Kuijpers M. Lecut C. Loubele S. Heeneman S. Jandrot-Perrus M. Heemskerk J. Atherosclerosis.. 2005; 181: 19-27Google Scholar). Unlike in CRP, there are very few contiguous runs of GPO triplets in type I collagen. Type I collagen has five GPOGPO motifs and over"
https://openalex.org/W2018682565,"The processive reaction mechanisms of β-glycosyl-polymerases are poorly understood. The cellubiuronan synthase of Streptococcus pneumoniae catalyzes the synthesis of the type 3 capsular polysaccharide through the alternate additions of β-1,3-Glc and β-1,4-GlcUA. The processive multistep reaction involves the sequential binding of two nucleotide sugar donors in coordination with the extension of a polysaccharide chain associated with the carbohydrate acceptor recognition site. Degradation analysis using cellubiuronan-specific depolymerase demonstrated that the oligosaccharide-lipid and polysaccharide-lipid products synthesized in vitro with recombinant cellubiuronan synthase had a similar oligosaccharyl-lipid at their reducing termini, providing definitive evidence for a precursor-product relationship and also confirming that growth occurred at the nonreducing end following initiation on phosphatidylglycerol. The presence of a lipid marker at the reducing end allowed the quantitative determination of cellubiuronic acid polysaccharide chain lengths. As the UDP-GlcUA concentration was increased from 1 to 11.5 μm, the level of synthase in the transitory processive state decreased, with the predominant oligosaccharide-lipid product containing 3 uronic acid residues, whereas the proportion of synthase in the fully processive state increased and the polysaccharide chain length increased from 320 to 6700 monosaccharide units. In conjunction with other kinetic data, these results suggest that the formation of a complex between a tetrauronosyl oligomer and the carbohydrate acceptor recognition site plays a central role in coordinating the repetitive interaction of the synthase with the nucleotide sugar donors and modulating the chain length of cellubiuronan polysaccharide.

Cellubiuronic acid, the capsular polysaccharide of type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae, is composed of the repeating disaccharide cellobiuronic acid (-3)-β-d-GlcUA 2The abbreviations used are: GlcUA, glucuronic acid; PLD, phospholipase D; DOC, deoxycholate; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; UA, uronic acid; βOG, β-octyl glucoside. -(1,4)-β-d-Glc-(1-) (1Reeves R. Goebel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 139: 511-517Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and is synthesized by a processive mechanism similar to that for cellulose, chitin, hyaluronic acid, and other related β-glycans (2Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This group of polysaccharides is synthesized by inverting GT-2A polymerases that are located in the plasma membrane with their active sites on the cytoplasmic face, and following chain initiation, the synthases are thought to be involved in the extrusion of the nascent chains to the external membrane face (3Arrecubieta C.

The overall processive elaboration of these polysaccharides remains poorly understood at the molecular level. In particular, there is relatively little information concerning the initiation process, the facilitation of chain extrusion, the mechanism of translocation, and the regulation of the final chain length during the assembly of these polymers. Recent investigations in this laboratory have begun to unravel some of the details of both the early and later stages of the biosynthesis of cellubiuronan. Unlike most S. pneumoniae capsules, whose elaboration requires multiple glycosyltransferases, a polymerase, and an additional transport system (9Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the assembly and transport of cellubiuronic acid in type 3 strains is carried out by the single enzyme cellubiuronan synthase (Cps3S) (3Arrecubieta C. Lopez R. Garcia E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp.

Microbiol. 1960; 22: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Studies of the synthase in S. pneumoniae and recombinant Escherichia coli membranes have shown that assembly of the polysaccharide involves two distinct kinetic phases: 1) a transitory processive state wherein the chain is thought to be initiated by the formation of an oligosaccharide-lipid that is loosely associated with the synthase, and 2) a fully processive state in which the polysaccharide is tightly bound to the carbohydrate substrate recognition site, except for a brief period during the translocation stage of each catalytic cycle (5Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Each catalytic cycle in the extrusion mode provides for chain extension by the addition of a repeating disaccharide and requires the alternate association of the synthase with UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA, the formation of the glycosidic linkages of the respective sugars, and the release, translocation, and reattachment of the elongating chain at the synthase carbohydrate recognition site. Transition from the transitory mode to the fully processive extrusion mode correlates with the attainment of a threshold-length oligosaccharide of ∼8 sugars (12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nod factor chito-oligosaccharides from rhizobia are synthesized by a related group of synthases that apparently are not capable of organizing into an extrusion mode (13Fernandez-Lopez M. D'Haeze W. Mergaert P. Verplancke C. Prome J.-C. Montagu M.V. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Significantly, the maximum length of any reported Nod-factor oligosaccharide is 6 sugars (14D'Haeze W. Holsters M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 79R-105RCrossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Based on β-glucosidase sensitivity of singly added [14C]Glc to the terminal end of high molecular weight cellubiuronan, it was deduced that the polysaccharide grows by repetitive β-1,3-Glc and β-1,4-GlcUA additions to the nonreducing terminus (2Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide-lipid assembly is thought to initiate on phosphatidylglycerol (15Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Jensen J.W. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48831-48839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To date, however, there has been no quantitative demonstration of polysaccharide-lipid conjugate, and the similarity of the distal sugar-lipid linkages in the polysaccharide- and oligosaccharide-lipid products has not been verified. Cellubiuronan depolymerase is a Bacillus circulans β-endoglucuronidase that specifically cleaves cellubiuronic acid chains at GlcUA-β1,4-Glc linkages (16Campbell J.H. Pappenheimer A.M. Immunochemistry. 1966; 3: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Torriani A. Pappenheimer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polysaccharide is successively cleaved at random internal linkages, which upon completion of hydrolysis yields a series of oligosaccharide end products containing 1–4 Glc-β1,3-GlcUA disaccharide units, with the most abundant oligomer being a tetrasaccharide. The high degree of specificity of this depolymerase has provided a sensitive analytical tool to further characterize cellubiuronan oligosaccharide- and polysaccharide-lipids, and even more importantly, it has provided a means for determining the chain length of these polysaccharides. Both in vivo (18Ventura C.L. Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in vitro studies (12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) indicate that the processivity of cellubiuronan synthase is modulated by the concentration of UDP-GlcUA. However, lacking well defined cellubiuronan polysaccharide size standards, there has been no way to clearly establish the actual length of the polymer synthesized under different reaction conditions. The methodology described in this article has allowed a clear demonstration of the relationship between the polysaccharide size and the UDP-GlcUA substrate concentration and in turn has led to the development of a kinetic model (38Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11836-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which provides both for UDP-sugar modulation of polysaccharide chain length and for the assembly by a single-site synthase of a polysaccharide composed of a repeating heterodisaccharide.

Sephacryl S-1000 was from Amersham Biosciences, solid phase C-18 cartridges (100 mg) were from Alltech, and Econosafe scintillation mixture was from Research Products International. UDP-[14C]GlcUA was prepared from [14C]Glc by a modification of previously described methods for the preparation of UDP-[14C]Glc (20Wright A. Robbins P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 104: 594-596Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a 1-ml volume containing [14C]Glc (258 mCi/mmol), 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NAD, 2 mm UTP, hexokinase (3 units), phosphoglucomutase (4.5 units), UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (3.75 units), and UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (0.25 units). The reaction was monitored by the reduction of NAD at 340 nm. After 4 h at 28 °C, the products were purified on a 0.6 × 2-cm column of DEAE-cellulose and eluted with a 40-ml gradient of 0–0.3 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). Fractions (0.8 ml) were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and monitored at 262 nm. Fractions corresponding to standard UDP-GlcUA were pooled and rechromatographed as above to remove a slight contamination with UDP. The final product had the same mobility as UDP-GlcUA on paper chromatography in two solvents. The final concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 262 nm and yielded a specific activity of 202 mCi/mmol. All UDP-sugar substrate concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 262 nm. Gel filtration chromatography of oligosaccharides was conducted on a 1.5 × 88-cm column of Biogel P-4 irrigated with a solution consisting of 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4), 0.04% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide at a flow rate of 10 ml/h, as previously described (12Forsee W.T.

Column fractions of 0.9 ml were collected, and the radioisotope content was determined by scintillation counting. Background counts were subtracted in each experiment. Gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 and S-1000 was carried out on 1.4 × 38-cm columns irrigated with a solution consisting of 10 mm deoxycholate (DOC), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.5), and 0.02% sodium azide at flow rates of 0.4 and 0.15 ml/min, respectively. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and monitored for radioactivity. Chromatography on a 1.4 × 28-cm Sephacryl S-300 column employed the same solvent at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, collecting 0.8-ml fractions. Digestion with β-glucosidase was carried out in 50 mm imidazole acetate (pH 5.0) at 35 °C, as further described under “Results.” The coupling inefficiency or cycling of the synthase in transitioning between oligosaccharide and polysaccharide assembly modes was calculated by the formula, cycling number = (cpm in oligosaccharides/UA residues per oligosaccharide)/(cpm in polysaccharides/UA residues per polysaccharide). E. coli membranes containing recombinant cellubiuronan synthase were prepared, as previously described (12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A mixture of [14C]glucuronyl-labeled oligosaccharide-lipid and polymer-lipid was synthesized in 5-ml reaction mixtures consisting of the indicated concentration of UDP-[14C]GlcUA (2.5 × 106 cpm), 1 mm UDP-Glc, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were initiated with synthase at sufficiently low concentrations (54–162 μg of membrane protein) such that not more than 20% of the isotope was incorporated during incubation periods of 15–35 min at 35 °C. The reactions were terminated in an ice-water bath. The 14C-labeled membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Since very large quantities of UDP-[14C]GlcUA were required for these preparations and since no detectable breakdown occurred during the incubations, the supernatants were used for a second round of synthesis. Similar results were obtained for up to four sequential cycles of polymer synthesis. The supernatants were preincubated at 35 °C, and fresh UDP-[14C]GlcUA (15–20% of the above) was added to replace the previously incorporated substrate and restore the original concentration. The reaction was initiated with synthase, and the second round of product was collected as above. The combined pellets were suspended in 2.5 ml of a wash solution consisting of 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol. The washed membranes were collected by centrifugation as above, and this wash step was repeated once more. Membranes were suspended in 0.4 ml of 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), heated at 100 °C for 4 min, and solubilized by the addition of 0.25% Nonidet P-40. Three general purification procedures were used for the preparation of oligosaccharide-lipid, low molecular weight polysaccharide-lipid, and high molecular weight polysaccharide-lipid. Procedure A, Preparation of Oligosaccharide-Lipid—Solubilized reaction products were applied to a 0.6 × 2.5-cm column of DEAE-cellulose (OH–), followed by sequential elution with 6 ml of 0.25 m ammonium acetate and then 10 ml of 1.0 m ammonium acetete (Fig. 1). All solutions contained 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Column fractions of 1 ml were monitored for radioactivity. Oligosaccharide-lipid (Fig. 1B) and polysaccharide-lipid (Fig. 1C) fractions with less than 1% cross-contamination were obtained, as assessed by Sephacryl S-400 chromatography (described above). Procedure B, Preparation of Low Molecular Weight Polysaccharide-Lipid—For experiments demanding more highly purified polymer, procedure A was slightly modified such that the solubilized product was applied to DEAE-cellulose in 0.25 m ammonium acetate. The oligosaccharide-lipid passed through without binding, and virtually pure polymer-lipid was eluted with 1.0 m ammonium acetate, containing only 0.01% oligosaccharide-lipid, as determined by paper chromatography. Polymer-lipid was desalted by dialysis (three times) against 50 volumes of 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h in a nice bath and frozen at –20 °C. The oligosaccharide-lipid fraction was further purified by hydrophobic adsorption on a solid phase C-18 cartridge, as described below, and stored at –20 °C in detergent solutions. Procedure C, Preparation of High Molecular Weight Polysaccharide-Lipid—High molecular weight chains (greater than 2000 sugars) were inefficiently eluted from DEAE-cellulose but were completely separated from oligosaccharide-lipid by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. Gel filtration elutions of high molecular weight polymer often included about 5% of the product that tailed into the low molecular weight elution region. This material appeared to be outside the modal distribution and was excluded. Polysaccharide in DOC solutions was dialyzed three times against 50 volumes of H2O for 1 h in a nice bath and stored frozen at –20 °C. Digestion with the cellubiuronan-specific B. circulans depolymerase was carried out with detergent, as indicated, in 50 mm Mes (pH 6.0) with 2 μg/ml of depolymerase at 35 °C for the indicated time. Samples containing DOC formed a precipitate with Mes (pH 6), which was diminished by the addition of either Nonidet P-40 or β-octyl glucoside (βOG) and did not appear to interfere with hydrolysis. The extent of hydrolysis was monitored by chromatography on 3MM paper in an ascending solvent of butanol/acetic acid/H2O (44:16:40) for 5–14 h. The chromatogram was cut into 1-cm sections, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Depolymerase hydrolysates were separated by gel filtration on Biogel P-4 or fractionated on C-18 solid phase cartridges as described below. The limit glycan attached to the lipid eluted in the detergent micelle region in the former and in the hydrophobic region in the latter. The proportions of radioisotope in hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligosaccharide fractions were used to calculate the polymer/lipid-linked limit glycan ratio. This number, in conjunction with the average size of the lipid-linked limit glycan, which was determined by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, was used to calculate the number of GlcUA residues in the polysaccharide chain. Biogel P-4 chromatography of hydrolysates was carried out on 1 × 37-cm columns irrigated at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min with a solution of 0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Samples were concentrated to 0.5 ml under a stream of N2 at 50 °C prior to application. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected and monitored for radioactivity. Fractions containing the soluble oligosaccharides and the oligosaccharide-lipid/detergent micelles were pooled separately, and the radioisotope content of each was determined, yielding a polymer/limit glycan ratio. The oligosaccharide-lipid fraction was dialyzed twice in an ice bath against 50 volumes of 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 40 min, concentrated to 0.5 ml under a stream of N2 at 50 °C, and stored at –20 °C. Hydrophobic C-18 fractionation of hydrolysates was carried out on two solid phase C-18 (100 mg) cartridges, in tandem, that were sequentially washed with H2O and eluted with a solution of chloroform/methanol/H2O (1:2:1). Fractions (1 ml) were monitored for radioactivity. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions containing radioactivity were separately pooled and the radioisotope content of each was determined, yielding a polymer/limit glycan ratio. The hydrophobic eluate was dried under a stream of N2, and the residue was dissolved in aqueous 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and stored at –20 °C. Ion exchange chromatography of oligosaccharides was carried out on 0.6 × 2.5-cm DEAE-cellulose columns as previously described (12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides were first liberated from the solubilized oligosaccharide-lipids by digestion with PLD (25 units) for 1 h at 30 °C in 0.8-ml mixtures containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8) and 10 mm CaCl2. The digests were heated at 100 °C for 4 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The digests were diluted 10-fold with H2O and applied to the DEAE-cellulose columns, which were eluted with a 35-ml gradient from 0 to 0.3 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). Any remaining material was eluted with 1 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) beginning at fraction 61. Fractions (0.65 ml) were monitored for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting and for ionic strength by conductivity. Hydrolysates containing DOC required larger (1.6 × 3-cm) columns that were eluted with 70-ml gradients from 0 to 0.3 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4), and the fraction size was increased to 1.3 ml. E. coli membranes (576 μg of protein) were incubated for 7 min at 35 °C in a 5-ml reaction mixture consisting of 10 μm UDP-[3H]Glc (3.4 × 106 cpm), 10 μm UDP-GlcUA, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was terminated in an ice-water bath, and the membranes were collected by sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were suspended with a Teflon pestle in 0.5 ml of cold unlabeled reaction mixture as above. The enzyme suspension was then added to a 5-ml reaction mixture at 35 °C, which was similar to the above except that it contained 2.5 × 106 cpm of 10 μm UDP-[14C]GlcUA and unlabeled 10 μm UDP-Glc. The incubation was repeated for another 7 min at 35 °C. The reaction was terminated in an ice-water bath, and the membranes were collected by sedimentation and washed as described under “Preparation of Oligosaccharide- and Polysaccharide-Lipid.” The polysaccharide-lipid was further purified by procedure B above under “Separation of Oligo- and Polysaccharide-Lipid.” The polysaccharide-lipid was hydrolyzed for 25 min in 0.05% Nonidet P-40 with 6 μg of depolymerase in a final volume of 5 ml as described above. The lipid-linked limit glycan was isolated by hydrophobic C-18 fractionation as described above, and the oligosaccharides were released by PLD and fractionated by ionic exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose as described above. At any fixed concentration of UDP-GlcUA, the cellubiuronan polymerization reaction rapidly comes into a steady state in which the synthase is distributed between two modes, synthesizing either oligosaccharide-lipid or polysaccharide-lipid (12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Upon transition into the fully processive state of polysaccharide-lipid synthesis, the size of the growing polymer is thought to be determined by the UDP-sugar concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2, discrete populations of distinctive size chains were observed under different UDP-GlcUA concentrations, when the cellubiuronan products were synthesized in vitro using E. coli membranes containing the recombinant synthase. The relative elution positions of the polysaccharide products indicate a very large increase in chain size as the concentration of UDP-GlcUA was increased from 1 to 11.5 μm. To definitively establish the presence of a lipid constituent at the reducing end of the cellubiuronic acid polymer and in turn to use the lipid presence as a marker to develop a set of polysaccharide standards of defined size, we used the cellubiuronan-specific depolymerase, an endoglycosidase from B. circulans, to analyze the above products. Depolymerase Hydrolysis of Cellubiuronan Polysaccharide Products—Cellubiuronic acid polysaccharide products labeled with [14C]GlcUA were subjected to hydrolysis with the cellubiuronan-specific depolymerase. The random endoglycosidic cleavage of the polysaccharide by the depolymerase (17Torriani A. Pappenheimer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as opposed to removal of tetrasaccharide units from the end of the polymer, was confirmed by the gradual reduction in the size of a single polysaccharide peak when assessed by gel filtration following hydrolysis with low levels of depolymerase (data not shown). Preferential cleavage in the interior region of the chain was demonstrated by the rapid accumulation of hexasaccharide, along with tetrasaccharide, in the early stage of depolymerase digestion (Fig. 3). As the reaction continued, the hexasaccharide product gradually disappeared concomitant with an increase of disaccharide and tetrasaccharide. The cleavage of hexasaccharide, yielding di- and tetrasaccharide, occurred at a much slower rate than the initial hydrolysis of chain segments that were octasaccharides or longer. The size and anionic charge of the di-, tetra-, and hexasaccharide products were confirmed as previously described (12Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Limit Glycans Obtained by Depolymerase Digestion of Oligosaccharide-Lipid Products—Cellubiuronan oligosaccharide-lipid products labeled with [14C]GlcUA were synthesized in vitro using E. coli membranes containing the recombinant synthase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Prior to depolymerase hydrolysis, most of the oligosaccharide-lipid eluted in the detergent micelle fraction when analyzed by gel filtration (Fig. 4A). The oligosaccharides were released with PLD, and shown by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose to consist of a major triuronosyl (UA) component, along with lesser amounts of mono-, di-, and tetrauronosyl oligomers (Fig. 4B). Depolymerase hydrolysis of the oligosaccharide-lipid fraction occurred at a much slower rate than with long polysaccharide chains (Fig. 3) and was strongly affected by the presence of detergents. When the oligosaccharide-lipid fraction was reconstituted in Nonidet P-40 micelles, 26% of the labeled GlcUA was released after 1 h of digestion, primarily as tetrasaccharide with minor amounts of di- and hexasaccharide, as shown by gel filtration (Fig. 4C). The lipid-linked limit glycan remaining after depolymerase hydrolysis was isolated from the detergent micelle fraction following Biogel P-4 chromatography, and the residual oligosaccharides were released by PLD and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Depolymerase hydrolysis in Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 4, compare B and D) resulted in the complete elimination of the tetra-UA component, a reduction in the relative amount of tri-UA oligosaccharides, and increases in the relative amounts of di- and mono-UA oligosaccharides. The relatively low proportion of disaccharide in Fig. 4C suggests a slower rate of release of disaccharide from oligosaccharide-lipid than from polysaccharide, as shown in Fig. 3. This pattern indicates that the depolymerase is restricted in the removal of disaccharide fragments from the nonreducing termini and leads to the suggestion that most of the disaccharide comes from the reducing end of the hexasaccharide product subsequent to its cleavage from the parent substrate. In conjunction with a comparison of the oligomer patterns in Fig. 4, C and D, the data indicate"
https://openalex.org/W2083782585,"All seryl-tRNA synthetases (SerRSs) are functional homodimers with a C-terminal active site domain typical for class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and an N-terminal domain involved in tRNA binding. The recently solved three-dimensional structure of Methanosarcina barkeri SerRS revealed the idiosyncratic features of methanogenic-type SerRSs; that is, an active site zinc ion, a unique tRNA binding domain, and an insertion of ∼30 residues in the catalytic domain, which adopt a helix-turn-helix (HTH) fold.

Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that tRNA binds across the dimer. The fidelity of protein synthesis relies upon the interpretation of the genetic code by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs). 2The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (standard amino acid abbreviations precede RS throughout); mMbSerRS, methanogenic-type M. barkeri SerRS; HTH, helix-turn-helix; PAR, 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; T. thermophilus SerRS; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; PMPS, 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol-p-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate; WT, wild type. Each enzyme from this family catalyzes covalent attachment of a cognate amino acid to a specific set of tRNA isoacceptors in the first step of protein biosynthesis (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2000; 69: 617-650Google Scholar). Extensive studies of the structure and function of these enzymes have shown that the family is divided into two classes based on the topology of the adenylate binding sites and the modes of tRNA binding (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature.. 1990; 347: 203-206Google Scholar, 3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature.. 1990; 347: 249-255Google Scholar). The class I aaRSs share a canonical dinucleotide binding fold (Rossmann-fold) with two regions of conserved sequences, named HIGH and KMSKS motifs. The class II synthetases are built around an antiparallel β-sheet partly capped by helices, thus creating a unique fold first identified in seryl-tRNA synthetase. Most of the class II synthetases are homodimers characterized by three conserved signature motifs. Although motif 1 is involved in dimerization, motifs 2 and 3 are crucial components of the enzymatic active site. aaRSs are modular enzymes that, in addition to the active site domain, possess a tRNA binding domain responsible for selection and binding of the cognate tRNA. Sometimes, additional domains such as an editing domain are added to the two-domain core of synthetase (4Francklyn C. Perona J.J. Puetz J. Hou Y.M. RNA.. 2002; 8: 1363-1372Google Scholar). The seryl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the aminoacylation of several tRNASer isoacceptors as well as tRNASec, with serine in a two-step reaction (5Weygand-Durasevic I. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases.(Ibba, M., Francklyn, C., and Cusack, S., eds) pp. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX. 2005; : 177-192Google Scholar). Interestingly, two distinct types of SerRS enzymes have occurred; the methanogenic-type SerRS exists only in methanogenic Archaea, whereas the other, bacterial-type SerRS functions in a variety of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms (6Tumbula D. Vothknecht U.C. Kim H.S. Ibba M. Min B. Li T. Pelaschier J. Stathopoulos C. Becker H. Söll D. Genetics.. 1999; 152: 1269-1276Google Scholar). In the bacterial-type SerRS, as revealed by studies on the synthetases of Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus, each subunit possesses a C-terminal active site domain typical for class II aaRSs, which comprises the three class II conserved signature motifs, whereas the first 100 N-terminal residues form an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil involved in binding of tRNA (5Weygand-Durasevic I. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases.(Ibba, M., Francklyn, C., and Cusack, S., eds) pp. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX. 2005; : 177-192Google Scholar, 7Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1995; 2: 824-831Google Scholar, 8Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 1997; 7: 881-889Google Scholar) and positioning of the 3′-end of tRNA in the active site of the C-terminal domain. Thus, the tRNA molecule interacts with the N-terminal domain of one subunit and the C-terminal domain of the other subunit in the dimer (9Vincent C. Borel F. Willison J.C. Leberman R. Härtlein M. Nucleic Acids Res... 1995; 23: 1113-1118Google Scholar, 10Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science.. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of Methanosarcina barkeri SerRS (mMbSerRS) (Fig. 1) (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar) revealed that although the overall structure of the catalytic module is built from antiparallel strands surrounded by α-helices as for the bacterial-type SerRS, the mode of amino acid substrate binding is quite different and involves a zinc ion located in a deep cleft in the active site of the methanogenic-type enzyme (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar). The fold of the mMbSerRS N-terminal domain, made of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet capped by a helical bundle on one side, is very different from the coiled-coil tRNA binding domain in bacterial-type SerRS (3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature.. 1990; 347: 249-255Google Scholar). Because the crystal structure of mMbSerRS in the complex with tRNA has not been obtained yet, as it has been for the bacterial system (10Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science.. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Google Scholar), the role of the N-terminal domain in the tRNA binding and aminoacylation is still unclear. Another idiosyncratic feature of mMbSerRS is a unique ∼30-residue-long insertion positioned between motifs 1 and 2 in the catalytic domains of all methanogenic-type SerRSs (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar). The structure reveals that these residues adopt a helix-turn-helix (HTH) fold. Two protomers in the mMbSerRS dimer interact in a side-by-side fashion with their HTH motifs swapped. The amphipathic helices of the HTH fold bury their hydrophobic surface against the catalytic core of the other protomer and use charged side chains to make a series of salt bridges with the helix of the tRNA binding domain (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar). Thus, structural data suggest that the HTH motif contributes to the interactions between the protomers and to the positioning of the tRNA binding domain. The aim of this study is to provide functional evidences on the role of the HTH motif in dimer stabilization and in interdomain interactions. tRNA Preparation and Aminoacylation Assays—Production of in vivo expressed M. barkeri tRNAGGASer, aminoacylation assays, and active site titration were carried out as previously described (12Bilokapic S. Rokov Plavec J. Ban N. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS J... 2008; 275: 2831-2844Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Construction of Deletion Fragments of M. barkeri SerRS, and Purification of the Proteins—The seryl-tRNA synthetase expression vector (pET15b-mMbSerRS), which contained the wild-type sequence of M. barkeri SerRS inserted between the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (13Korencic D. Polycarpo C. Weygand-Durasevic I. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 48780-48786Google Scholar), was used as the template for construction of different mutants and deletion fragments (Table 1) by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The importance of the HTH motif was investigated by excision of the HTH sequence from the serS gene, generating the pET15b-mMbSerRSΔHTH mutant.Table 1The list of mMbSerRS variants Name Description of alteration mMbSerRS-NTD STOP codon introduced at position 164, which generated the N-terminal domain mMbSerRS-CTD START codon introduced at position 167, which generated C-terminal domain mMbSerRS-ΔHTH Deleted HTH motif mMbSerRS-CTDΔHTH START codon introduced at position 167 of mMbSerRS-ΔHTH, generating the C-terminal domain without HTH mMbSerRS-R147A R147A replacement in helix 4 located in the N-terminal domain mMbSerRS-E273A E273A replacement in helix 9 located in the C-terminal domain mMbSerRS-E273A/D277A/K280A Triple replacement (E273A, D277A, K280A) in helix 9 mMbSerRS-K164A K164A replacement in the linker peptide Open table in a new tab The recombinant vectors pET28b-mMbSerRS-NTD and pET15b-mMbSerRS-CTD were used to overexpress the individual synthetase domains (N-terminal domain (NTD); C-terminal domain (CTD)). E. coli BL21 cells were co-transformed with both plasmids for concomitant overexpression of two mMbSerRS domains. 1 mm ZnCl2 was added to the medium during the expression of mutated proteins. They were purified as reported previously for the wild-type enzyme (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar). The tRNA binding and catalytic domains of SerRS were purified by the same general protocol, employing affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. No degradation of protein fragments was observed on SDS-gel (supplemental Fig. 1). The concentrations of the full-length protein, different single point mutants, and deletion mutants were determined by the absorption at A280 using theoretical extinction coefficients. Western blot analysis with E. coli anti-SerRS antibodies excluded the presence of contaminating endogenous SerRS in all purified mMbSerRS variants. The overall structures of the wild-type and mutated SerRS were examined by circular dichroism spectrometry as previously described (12Bilokapic S. Rokov Plavec J. Ban N. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS J... 2008; 275: 2831-2844Google Scholar). Native PAGE and Gel Retardation Assay—The gel retardation assay was performed under conditions described previously (12Bilokapic S. Rokov Plavec J. Ban N. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS J... 2008; 275: 2831-2844Google Scholar) unless stated differently. Irreversible Thermal Denaturation—SerRS and its mutant derivatives (50 μl of 50 nm wild-type and 200 nm mutants in 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 4 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl) were incubated simultaneously in a PCR thermocycler for 60 min at increasing temperatures. At the end of irreversible heat denaturation, the temperature was lowered to 4 °C. Residual aminoacylation activity was measured at 37 °C. Sigmoidal curves were fitted to the datasets by nonlinear regression, and the temperature at which 50% of activity was lost under given conditions was calculated (T50). The experiments were repeated at least three times. Preparation of Heterodimers—For overexpression of the heterodimeric form of mMbSerRS, E. coli BL21 cells were co-transformed with pET20b-mMbSerRS and pET28b-mMbSerRS-CTD (or pET28b-mMbSerRS-CTDΔHTH) plasmids. pET20b-mMbSerRS allows the expression of the whole SerRS polypeptide without N-terminal His tag, whereas the C-terminal domain (expressed from the construct with or without HTH) carries the affinity tag at its N terminus. Co-expression of two SerRS polypeptides (whole-length and truncated, comprising only the C-terminal domain) resulted in three types of dimers (one hetero- and two homodimers). As only the C-terminal domain contains the affinity tag, heterodimer and homodimer of C-terminal domains were separated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography from the wild-type homodimer. The separation of heterodimer from truncated homodimer (homodimer consisting of C-terminal domains) was performed by electrophoresis on 0.7% native agarose gel in 90 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.4, at 80 mA for 4 h. The bands were visualized by transferring the proteins onto nitrocellulose membrane and staining with Ponceau S (supplemental Fig. 2). Bands corresponding to the heterodimer were cut out, and the protein was electroeluted from gel slices in 3 ml of electrophoresis buffer. The sample was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 30 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl buffer. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. 4-(2-Pyridylazo)-resorcinol-p-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate (PMPS) Assay—Wild-type and different C-terminal domains of SerRS were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl. Three buffer exchanges ensured complete removal of 2-mercaptoethanol. 3.2 μm dialyzed protein with 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol (PAR) added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm was titrated at room temperature with 0.5 mm stock solution of PMPS. Absorbance at 500 nm was recorded 5 min after each PMPS addition to allow for a stable reading. The absorbance change was converted into moles of zinc by using the reported extinction coefficient for the Zn(II)PAR2 complex (ϵ = 6.6 × 104 m-1 cm-1). Intrinsic Fluorescence Experiments—Samples for spectroscopic measurements were diluted at least 100-fold into solutions containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and the indicated concentration of urea. Corresponding blanks were prepared using enzyme storage buffer. Sample solutions were prepared at least 8 h before measurements, as preliminary experiments revealed that a time-dependent change of fluorescence intensity after preparation of the sample is ended within the corresponding time. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer at room temperature using quartz cuvettes (1 cm). Under the experimental conditions the fluorescence intensities of studied species were proportional to their concentrations. The samples were excited at 280 and 295 nm, and the signal of emission was monitored at 337 and 340 nm for wild type and mutant, respectively. The fluorescence spectrum of the protein was corrected by subtraction of the fluorescence spectrum of the buffer alone with urea added in a corresponding concentration. Fluorescence intensities could be reproduced to within ±2% for each sample in independent experiments. Cross-linking—0.2 μm protein samples at different urea concentrations were prepared as for fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. After denaturation in urea, samples were cross-linked with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were stopped with 100 mm NaBH4 for 3 min at room temperature and analyzed on 9% denaturating SDS-PAGE. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The N-terminal domain was recloned from the pET15b-mMbSerRS-NTD vector as an NcoI/XhoI cassette in-frame to the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the transcription factor Gal4 activation domain of the pACT2 prey vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). C-terminal domains with or without the HTH motif were recloned from pET28b-mMbSerRS-CTD and pET28b-mMbSerRS-CTDΔHTH plasmids in-frame to the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the transcription factor LexA DNA binding domain (LexA BD) of bait plasmid pAB151 (14Rocak S. Landeka I. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett... 2002; 214: 101-106Google Scholar) as NdeI/SmaI cassettes. Further, C-terminal domains were recloned from pET28bmMbSerRS-CTD and pET28b-mMbSerRSCTDΔHTH plasmids as NcoI/XhoI cassettes to the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the transcription factor Gal4 activation domain of pACT2 prey vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA. The resultant fusion proteins were tested for expression in Western blot with anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (Roche Applied Science) or anti-LexA antibodies (Invitrogen) (data not shown). LexA BD domain and Gal4 activation domain fusion constructs were introduced by lithium acetate transformation into L40 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (MATa his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 leu2-3, 112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) (14Rocak S. Landeka I. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett... 2002; 214: 101-106Google Scholar). Double transformants were grown in selective -Trp-Leu media until late log phase (A600 of 0.7–1.0), and serial dilutions were spotted as 4-μl aliquots on selective -Trp-Leu or -Trp-Leu-His synthetic dropout (SD) agar plates supplemented with 1–100 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Furthermore, transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity using X-gal for colony-lift filter assay or o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (15Godinic V. Mocibob M. Rocak S. Ibba M. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS J... 2007; 274: 2788-2799Google Scholar). The Role of HTH-fold in Building the Dimerization Interface—Most class II synthetases are dimers, except for AlaRS, which is a tetramer, and PheRS, which is either monomeric or tetrameric (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2000; 69: 617-650Google Scholar). Glycyl-tRNA synthetase is one of the few synthetases which exhibit different oligomeric structures in different organisms (α2-dimeric or α2β2 tetrameric in some prokaryotic species) (16Tang S. Huang J. FEBS Lett... 2005; 579: 1441-1445Google Scholar). In the dimeric class II synthetases, motif 1 contributes to the formation of the dimer interface. A similar role has also been observed in the α2β2 PheRS (17Mosyak L. Reshetnikova L. Goldgur Y. Delarue M. Safro M.G. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1995; 2: 537-547Google Scholar). In tetrameric AlaRS, motif 1 is not involved in any intermolecular interactions, as the C-terminal domain is responsible for enzyme oligomerization (18Jasin M. Regan L. Schimmel P. Nature.. 1983; 306: 441-447Google Scholar). In mMbSerRS, the axes of the motif 1 interface helices are 15 Å apart (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar), too far for their side chains to interact directly unlike E. coli SerRS where the helix axis separation is about 10 Å (3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature.. 1990; 347: 249-255Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other regions of motifs 1 contribute to the stabilization of the dimer interface (Fig. 2). In addition, as revealed by the crystal structure, the HTH motif of one protomer is also responsible for extensive interactions with the catalytic domain of the other protomer, significantly increasing the buried surface area of the dimer interface (Fig. 2). To understand the role of the HTH motif in dimerization, we created a mutated enzyme mMbSerRSΔHTH in which the HTH motif has been removed and neighboring loops connected. As mMbSerRS protein is rich in aromatic amino acid residues, we used the intrinsic fluorescence to monitor protein conformational changes and stability during unfolding in urea. The difference in the stability of the two proteins was obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity at 320 nm by the intensity at 365 nm (I320/I365) (Fig. 3). The fluorescence change in the unfolding experiments was measured over a range of protein concentrations (0.1–10.4 μm), and no concentration dependence was observed, although at concentrations lower than 0.06 μm some protein loss is noticeable, probably due to adsorption to glass. To confirm that the observed differences in intrinsic fluorescence during the denaturation of the mutant and wild-type mMbSerRS are due to differences in dimer to monomer dissociation, cross-linking of protein subunits with glutaraldehyde was performed at the same protein concentration as used for the fluorescence study followed by the SDS-PAGE. In the absence of urea we detected a species with a mobility expected for the dimer (Fig. 3). At higher concentrations of urea (2.5 m), mMbSERSΔHTH mutant migrated to a position expected for the monomer. The transition from dimer to monomer for the wild-type enzyme was detected at even higher denaturant concentrations. The contribution of the HTH fold to dimer stability was additionally documented by a yeast two-hybrid approach (see below). Such stabilization could be of biological significance, considering that many methanogenic Archaea are thermophilic organisms and/or live in special environments. The Role of the HTH Fold in Positioning the N-terminal tRNA Binding Domain Relative to the Catalytic Domain—Besides its role in dimer stabilization, structural data suggested that a portion of HTH motif is involved in the positioning of the N-terminal domain with respect to the catalytic domain (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar). Despite structural differences between the two types of SerRSs, the N-terminal domain of mMbSerRS is also proposed to be the main tRNA binding region (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar), and its mispositioning would certainly affect the second step of aminoacylation reaction. We intended to test the ability of mMbSerRSΔHTH to properly position the 3′-end of tRNA in the enzyme active site by the aminoacylation reaction. However, the deletion mutant was inactive in tRNA serylation and, surprisingly, in serine activation reactions (supplemental Fig. 3). Possible changes in the structure and folding of mMbSerRSΔHTH were evaluated by CD spectroscopy. As expected, CD data revealed a lower helical content in the mutant enzyme but a slightly higher ratio of sheets and unstructured elements in comparison with the wild-type synthetase (not shown, see supplemental Fig. 4). However, mMbSerRSΔHTH retained the tRNA binding capacity, as revealed by a gel shift assay (not shown, see supplemental Fig. 4), arguing against overall protein misfolding. Together, these data exhibit a subtle structural change in the overall fold of mMbSerRSΔHTH. The HTH motif is positioned above the catalytic domain and interacts with the latter through numerous hydrophobic interactions. Removal of HTH motif exposes these hydrophobic surfaces to the hydrophilic environment. In sequence space, zinc ligand Cys-261 is only 10 residues apart from the HTH motif, and conformational changes in this motif could affect its positioning and zinc binding capabilities. Therefore, the zinc ion content in the wild-type and mMbSerRSΔHTH mutant was determined using the PMPS test (not shown, see supplemental Fig. 5). It revealed that the removal of the HTH motif indeed diminishes the metal binding ability of the active site. Loss of activity of mMbSerRSΔHTH mutant prevented its use in serylation assays. Therefore, to investigate the role of HTH motif in positioning of the N-terminal domain toward the catalytic domain and, consequently, the tRNA in the active site, we mutated several residues in helix 4 (the N-terminal domain) and helix 9 (the HTH motif) that contribute to the interactions between tRNA binding and the catalytic domain to alanines. Mutated proteins R147A, E273A, and E273A/D277A/K280A (positions are highlighted in Fig. 1) were purified under identical conditions as the wild-type mMbSerRS; gel filtration chromatography confirmed that they also form homodimers (data not shown). The steady-state kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant SerRSs were determined in aminoacylation reactions with in vivo overexpressed M. barkeri tRNAGGASer (12Bilokapic S. Rokov Plavec J. Ban N. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS J... 2008; 275: 2831-2844Google Scholar). Mutant R147A shows a 3-fold decrease in kcat and almost 6-fold increase in the Michaelis-Menten constant (Table 2) in comparison with the wild-type enzyme, whereas E273A displays only modest reduction in the specificity constant, caused by slightly increased Km value accompanied with a small increase in kcat. E273A/D277A/K280A mutant, having disabled several interactions between the two domains, showed an ∼2-fold increase in Km value and, interestingly, 3-fold elevated kcat. Elevation of Km values observed in serylation reaction with E273A and triple mutant E273A/D277A/K280A may suggest that blocking of some interactions between helices 4 and 9 affects the orientation between two domains and, consequently, tRNA binding. However, once bound, tRNA molecules are properly presented to catalytic residues in the active site, as revealed from elevated kcat values for E273A and triple mutant. The replacement of Arg-147 in helix 4 with alanine has an opposite effect on kcat in comparison with the other mutated residue involved in linking the RNA binding domain to the active site. This can be explained by a dual role of Arg-147, which also coordinates the main chain of Arg-143 in the N-terminal domain. The strict conservation of Arg-143 in all methanogenic-type SerRSs suggests a critical functional role for these residues. Our model of the mMbSerRS·tRNA complex (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar) reveals that this role may involve the direct interaction with the tRNA substrate (Fig. 1).Table 2Kinetic parameters for M. barkeri tRNASer aminoacylation with wild-type and mutant mMbSerRS enzymes mMbSerRS Km kcat kcat/Km kcat/Km (rel) μm s–1 mm–1 s–1 WT 2.6 ± 0.5 0.45 ± 0.04 173 1 R147A 14.6 ± 0.7 0.15 ± 0.01 10.6 0.06 E273A 4.2 ± 0.6 0.55 ± 0.10 130 0.75 E273A/D277A/K280A 4.7 ± 0.6 1.4 ± 0.2 290 1.68 K164A 2.4 ± 0.4 0.0087 ± 0.0009 3.6 0.02 Open table in a new tab Higher flexibility of the N-terminal domain and weaker interactions with the catalytic domain could cause destabilization of dimeric SerRS. To compare the stabilities of mMbSerRS and its variants bearing alterations in helix 9, irreversible thermal denaturation was performed followed by the determination of residual aminoacylation activity. Mutated enzymes with multiple preserved interactions between the two domains displayed higher stability, whereas the replacement of several helix 9 residues (mutant E273A/D277A/K280A) presumably results in additional conformational freedom between N- and C-terminal domains and consequently reduces the stability of the protein (supplemental Fig. 6). The absolute requirement of the HTH motif for domain-domain interaction was additionally confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in Fig. 4, the separated C-terminal domain with the HTH motif interacts with the N-terminal domain, whereas the catalytic domain lacking HTH does not. Furthermore, the experiment confirms that the HTH-fold contributes significantly to the stability of mMbSerRS dimer (Fig. 4). N-terminal Domain Affects Folding of the Catalytic Domain in Trans—The short linker peptide that connects the N- and C-terminal domains is highly flexible and makes no interactions with the domains as observed in the crystal structure (11Bilokapic S. Maier T. Ahel D. Gruic-Sovulj I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. Ban N. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2498-2509Google Scholar). This emphasizes the importance of the HTH motif as a main scaffold in maintaining the connectivity between two functional regions of the synthetase. Therefore, we decided to test whether the HTH motif is capable of positioning and orienting the N-terminal domain relative to the catalytic core even when produced"

https://openalex.org/W1998508674,"The transcriptional activator Gcn4p is considered the master regulator of amino acid metabolism in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and is required for the transcriptional response to amino acid starvation. Here it is shown that Gcn4p plays a previously undescribed role in regulating adaptation to anaerobic growth. A <i>gcn4</i> mutant exhibited a highly extended lag phase after a shift to anaerobiosis that was the result of l-serine depletion. In addition, the one-carbon metabolism and purine biosynthesis transcriptional regulator Bas1p were strictly required for anaerobic growth on minimal medium, and this was similarly due to l-serine limitation in <i>bas1</i> mutants. The induction of one-carbon metabolism during anaerobiosis is needed to increase the supply of l-serine from the glycine and threonine pathways. Using a number of experimental approaches, we demonstrate that these transcription regulators play vital roles in regulating l-serine biosynthesis in the face of increased demand during adaptation to anaerobiosis. This increased l-serine requirement is most likely due to anaerobic remodeling of the cell wall, involving <i>de novo</i> synthesis of a large number of very serine-rich mannoproteins and an increase in the total serine content of the cell wall. During anaerobic starvation for l-serine, this essential amino acid is preferentially directed to the cell wall, indicating the existence of a regulatory mechanism to balance competing cellular demands."

Analysis of the APA three-dimensional model complexed with glutamate phosphonate showed that Tyr-471 interacted with the inhibitor, providing support for previous demonstrations that this residue is essential for stabilizing the transition state of catalysis in APA (19Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J... 1997; 327: 883-889Google Scholar). This model also provided evidence of an interaction between the N-terminal amine of glutamate phosphonate and the Glu-352 and Glu-215 residues of APA, which are responsible for the exopeptidase specificity of this enzyme (20Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J... 1998; 334: 407-413Google Scholar, 25Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Okada M. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 14785-14793Google Scholar). We then introduced Ca2+ into this three-dimensional model. We identified the Ca2+ ligands in the S1 subsite: Asp-213 (corresponding to Asp-221 in human APA (26Goto Y. Hattori A. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 37074-37081Google Scholar)) and Asp-218 (27Claperon C. Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Inguimbert N. Okada M. Roques B. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J... 2008; 416: 37-46Google Scholar). We also visualized another residue in the S1 subsite, Thr-348, which interacts with the side chain of the inhibitor. We characterized here the role of Thr-348 in substrate/inhibitor binding and substrate specificity of APA for N-terminal acidic amino acid residues further, through a combination of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies. We replaced Thr-348 by a serine, tyrosine, or aspartate residue. We checked that the mutated enzymes displayed similar processing and had a similar subcellular distribution to wild type APA. We then biochemically and kinetically characterized the purified recombinant wild type and mutated enzymes and determined their sensitivity to Ca2+ and various inhibitors. We also evaluated the influence of the mutations on APA substrate specificity. The effects of the mutations on the three-dimensional model of APA were followed in parallel. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Expand high fidelity Taq polymerase PCR system was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The liposomal transfection reagent, Lipofectamine 2000, the pcDNA 3.1-His vector, and the monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. The monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Immobilized cobalt affinity columns (Talon) were obtained from Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany). The synthetic substrate, α-l-glutamyl-β-naphthylamide (GluNA), was purchased from Bachem (Bunderdorf, Switzerland). Modeling of the Mutated APA + Ca2+ System—The protein + ligand + Zn2+ + Ca2+ system was investigated as previously described (27Claperon C. Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Inguimbert N. Okada M. Roques B. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J... 2008; 416: 37-46Google Scholar); we checked the stability of the system by carrying out several rounds of energy minimization followed by short molecular dynamics runs, using a molecular mechanics program and simulation protocol similar to those described in a previous study (23Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 29242-29252Google Scholar). The refined whole model of APA + glutamate phosphonate + Zn2+ + Ca2+ + water obtained in this way was used for all of the subsequent calculations. The mutants were obtained by changing only the side chains of the amino acid residue 348 and subjecting the corresponding structures to a new cycle of refinement. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mouse cDNA encoding APA was used as a template for the generation of mutants by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, as previously described (28Herlitze S. Koenen M. Gene (Amst.).. 1990; 91: 143-147Google Scholar). Two overlapping regions of the cDNA were amplified separately, using two flanking oligonucleotides: A (5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA-3′; corresponding to nucleotides 862–883) as a forward primer and B (5′-GAATCCTAAGATAGAGGCCCGGAG-3′; corresponding to nucleotides 3215–3238) as a reverse primer, together with two overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 2045–2065 and containing the mutated residue at the appropriate position (C1D1 for Ala-348, C2D2 for Asp-348, C3D3 for Ser-348, and C4D4 for Tyr-348). The forward primers were: C1, 5′-GATTTTGGCGCCGGCGCCATG-3′; C2, 5′-GATTTTGGCGACGGCGCCATG-3′; C3, 5′-GATTTTGGCTCAGGCGCCATG-3′; and C4, 5′-GATTTTGGCTACGGCGCCATG-3′. The reverse primers were: D1, 5′-CATGGCGCCGGCGCCAAAATC-3′; D2, 5′-CATGGCGCCGTCGCCAAAATC-3′; D3, 5′-CATGGCGCCTGAGCCAAAATC-3′; and D4, 5′-CATGGCGCCGTAGCCAAAATC-3′. The underlined bases encode the new amino acid residue and replace the naturally occurring codon at position 348. Nucleotide numbering is as for the mouse APA sequence (29Wu Q. Lahti J.M. Air G.M. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1990; 87: 993-997Google Scholar) deposited in the GenBank™/EBI data base (accession number M29961). The products of the first two rounds of amplification (A-D1–4 and B-C1–4) were used as the template for a second PCR with the two flanking oligonucleotides, A and B. For all PCRs, high fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) (1 unit) was used (25 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min). The final 2376-bp PCR product was digested with HindIII and EcoRV, and the resulting 1505-bp HindIII-EcoRV fragment containing the mutation was used to replace the corresponding nonmutated region (HindIII-EcoRV) of the full-length APA cDNA. The presence of the mutation and the absence of nonspecific mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer with dye deoxyterminator chemistry. Cell Culture, Establishment of Stable CHO-K1 Cell Lines Producing Wild type and Mutated His-APAs, and Purification of Recombinant His-APAs—CHO-K1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). The cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid containing the polyhistidine-tagged wild type or a polyhistidine-tagged mutated APA cDNA, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable cell lines producing the polyhistidine-tagged wild type and mutated His-APAs were established as previously described (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Google Scholar). Stably transfected CHO cells were harvested, and a crude membrane preparation was obtained, as previously described (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Google Scholar). Wild type and mutated His-APAs were purified from the solubilized crude membrane preparation by metal affinity chromatography with a metal chelate resin column (Talon Co2+), as previously described (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE in 8% polyacrylamide gels, as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. We routinely obtain a purified protein >80% pure with an overall yield of about 14% and a purification factor of 10. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Western Blotting—Purified wild type and mutated His-APAs were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 25 mm Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.3, supplemented with 20% (V/V) methanol. His-tagged recombinant proteins were detected with the anti-Xpress antibody (dilution 1:5000), and loading control was done with the anti-α-tubulin antibody (dilution 1: 4000). The resulting immune complex was then detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Immunofluorescence Analysis of Stably Transfected CHO Cells—CHO cells producing wild type and mutated His-APAs were dispensed (25,000 cells) onto 14-mm-diameter coverslips. The cells were cultured for 24 h in Ham's F-12 medium in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. They were then fixed and permeabilized by incubation for 5 min in 100% ice-cold methanol. The cells were rinsed three times in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4, and then saturated by incubation with 5% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-(rat APA) serum (31Song L. Ye M. Troyanovskaya M. Wilk E. Wilk S. Healy D.P. Am. J. Physiol... 1994; 267: F546-F557Google Scholar) in 0.5% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with cold PBS and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of cyanin 3-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody in 0.5% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and once with water and mounted in Mowiol. The cells were examined with a Leica TCS SP II (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser and configured with a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope. Cyanin 3 fluorescence was detected after 100% excitation at 568 nm. The images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were obtained with a 63× magnification oil-immersion objective. Each image corresponded to a cross-section of the cell. Enzyme Assay—Enzyme assays were carried out for wild type and mutated His-APA in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with or without 4 mm CaCl2, by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis of GluNA, as previously described (8Chauvel E.N. Llorens-Cortès C. Coric P. Wilk S. Roques B. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. J. Med. Chem... 1994; 37: 2950-2956Google Scholar). The sensitivity to Ca2+ of purified wild type and mutated His-APAs was determined by incubating 0.5 mm GluNA with 0 or 4 mm CaCl2 in a final volume of 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. All of the assays were performed in black 96-well plates (solid black 96-well flat-bottomed nontreated plates with no lid; Corning Costar). All of the enzymatic studies were performed such that substrate hydrolysis rates were maintained below 10% (initial rate conditions). The progress curves were monitored by following the increase in fluorescence at 460 nm (lex = 330 nm), induced by the release of the β-naphthylamine fluorogenic part of the substrate by APA. Fluorescence signals were monitored by counting photons with a spectrophotometer (Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer; Packard) equipped with a temperature control device and a plate shaker. The kinetic parameters (Kmand kcat) were determined from Michaelis-Menten plots, using Enzfitter software (Biosoft™), with a final concentration of substrate (GluNA) from 0.005 to 2 mm. For evaluation of the substrate specificity of APA in the absence or presence of Ca2+, the rate of hydrolysis of two additional substrates, LeuNA and LysNA, was determined under the same experimental conditions as described for GluNA. The sensitivity of wild type and mutated His-APAs to inhibition by glutamate thiol (GluSH), lysine thiol (LysSH), and methionine thiol (MetSH) was determined by establishing dose-dependent inhibition curves for a final GluNA concentration of 0.5 mm, in the presence of 0 or 4 mm CaCl2. Because these compounds are linear competitive inhibitors, their Ki were calculated from the formula Ki = IC50/(1+ [GluNA]/Km). Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons were carried out with Student's unpaired t test. Differences were considered significant if p was less than 0.05. Modeling of APA Mutants in the Absence of Ca2+ and in the Presence of the APA Inhibitor Glutamate Phosphonate—The three-dimensional model of wild type APA complexed with glutamate phosphonate obtained in the absence of Ca2+ showed the presence of a hydrophilic pocket containing two aspartate residues (Asp-213 and Asp-218) and a threonine residue (Thr-348), corresponding to the S1 subsite (Fig. 1A) (27Claperon C. Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Inguimbert N. Okada M. Roques B. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J... 2008; 416: 37-46Google Scholar). The acidic side chain of the inhibitor is pointing toward this pocket and the Cα amine of Thr-348 is engaged in one hydrogen bond with the acidic side chain of Asp-213. Moreover, the Thr-348 alcohol side chain is engaged in two balanced hydrogen bonds, one with the carboxylate side chain of Asp-213 and the other with the carboxylate side chain of glutamate phosphonate. In the absence of Ca2+, this interaction is skewed toward the carboxylate side chain of Asp-213. We investigated the role of Thr-348, by replacing this residue with a serine, aspartate, or tyrosine residue and constructing the corresponding three-dimensional active site models. The three-dimensional active site model of the Ser-348 mutated APA (Fig. 2) is similar to that of wild type APA, as described above, except that the Ser-348 hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded only with the carboxylate side chain of glutamate phosphonate. In the three-dimensional active site model of the Asp-348 mutated APA (Fig. 2), only the hydrogen bond between the Asp-348 backbone and the Asp-213 side chain is maintained, because the carboxylate side chain of Asp-348 now interacts with a water molecule. Greater disturbance of the binding pocket is observed in the three-dimensional model of Tyr-348 mutated APA (Fig. 2), because of the presence of an aromatic group involved in a pi-anion interaction with the carboxyl end of the inhibitor (32Schottel B.L. Chifotides H.T. Dunbar K.R. Chem. Soc. Rev... 2008; 37: 68-83Google Scholar). In this case, the position of the inhibitor differs from that in the wild type. Modeling of APA in the Presence of Ca2+ and in the Presence of the APA Inhibitor Glutamate Phosphonate—In the three-dimensional model of wild type or Ser-348 mutated APAs in the presence of Ca2+ and glutamate phosphonate (Figs. 1B and 2), the alcohol side chain of Thr- or Ser-348 in the S1 subsite establishes a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate side chain of glutamate phosphonate. Moreover, the nitrogen of the Cα amine moiety of residue 348 interacts with Asp-213 (27Claperon C. Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Inguimbert N. Okada M. Roques B. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J... 2008; 416: 37-46Google Scholar). The Ca2+ atom is thus connected to glutamate phosphonate through a water molecule. In the three-dimensional model of Asp-348 mutated APA (Fig. 2), the glutamate phosphonate-water-Ca2+ link is maintained, but the carboxylate side chain of Asp-348 displaces the water molecule away from the Ca2+ coordination shell. As in the three-dimensional model of the Tyr-348 mutated APA obtained in the absence of Ca2+, in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2), the phenol ring of Tyr-348 strongly modifies the binding pocket and, consequently, the position of the inhibitor; Tyr-348 establishes a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate side chain of Glu-215, whereas a new hydrogen bond is created between the Gly-349 backbone and glutamate phosphonate, which is now held away from the Ca2+ atom through a network of two water molecules. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Wild type and Mutant His-APAs—We investigated the role of Thr-348 in substrate/inhibitor binding and substrate specificity by replacing this residue with an alanine, serine, aspartate, or tyrosine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type and mutated His-APAs were then stably expressed, and the recombinant enzymes were purified by metal affinity chromatography, as previously described (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Google Scholar). We first checked that the mutations did not affect the production and processing of the recombinant proteins. For this purpose, we analyzed by Western blot wild type and mutated His-APAs transitory transfected in CHO cells. We showed that all recombinant proteins, except the Ala-348 mutant, displayed a major mature 160-kDa form and a minor immature 140-kDa form. The Ala-348 mutant displayed a truncated form of 40-kDa (Fig. 3A), probably reflecting the cleavage of this misfolded mutated protein. In an additional set of experiments (data not shown) performed on CHO cells stably expressing the Ala-348 mutant, we also detected the presence of a truncated form of 40-kDa, but only when cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (16 μm, cell treatment for 16 h), suggesting that the mutation induces the cleavage of a nonmature unglycosylated form of APA rapidly degraded by the proteasome machinery. Moreover, we investigated the subcellular distribution of wild type and mutant His-APAs in stably transfected CHO cells by immunofluorescence staining with a rabbit polyclonal anti-rat APA antibody and a cyanin-3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Confocal microscopy analysis of CHO cells stably expressing wild type and mutated His-APA constructs showed that APA was located at the plasma membrane, except for the Ala-348 mutant APA, which remained trapped in an intracellular network possibly corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3B). We therefore did not carry out enzymatic characterization of this mutant. Finally, Western blot analysis of purified wild type and mutated His-APAs stably expressed in CHO cells showed that all proteins displayed a mature 160-kDa form (Fig. 3C). Enzymatic Activity of Purified Wild type and Mutated His-APAs—Because APA activity is enhanced by Ca2+, we evaluated the enzymatic activity of purified wild type and mutated APAs in the presence or absence of 4 mm Ca2+, using GluNA as a substrate (Table 1). In the absence of Ca2+, the replacement of Thr-348 by a serine residue led to a significant increase in substrate hydrolysis, by a factor of 1.5 compared with wild type His-APA. By contrast, the level of enzymatic activity detected for the Asp-348 and Tyr-348 mutants was significantly lower, corresponding to 40 and 13% of wild type His-APA activity levels, respectively. In the presence of 4 mm Ca2+, the enzymatic activity of Ser-348 remained significantly (2 times) higher than that of the wild type His-APA, whereas those of Asp-348 and Tyr-348 APA were significantly lower, corresponding to 11 and 50% of wild type His-APA activity, respectively. The presence of 4 mm Ca2+ enhanced the enzymatic activity of wild type, Ser-348, Asp-348, or Tyr-348 His-APA by factors of 8, 10, 2, and 30, respectively (Table 1).Table 1Enzymatic activity of purified recombinant wild type and mutated His-APAs Shown are the enzymatic activity (μmol of GluNA hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein) means ± the standard error from three to six separate experiments with duplicate determinations.

The results are summarized in Table 2. In the absence of Ca2+, the replacement of Thr-348 with a serine residue doubled hydrolysis efficiency. By contrast, the replacement of Thr-348 with an aspartate or a tyrosine residue led to decreases in kcat/Km by factors"
https://openalex.org/W1971644113,"The performance of Watson & Ahumada's model of human visual motion sensing is compared against human psychophysical performance. The stimulus consists of random dots undergoing rotary motion, displayed in a circular annulus. The model matches psychophysical observer performance with respect to most parameters. It is able to replicate some key psychophysical findings such as invariance of observer performance to dot density in the display, and decrease of observer performance with frame duration of the display.Associated with the concept of rotary motion is the notion of a center about which rotation occurs. One might think that for accurate estimation of rotary motion in the display, this center must be accurately known. A simple vector analysis reveals that this need not be the case. Numerical simulations confirm this result, and may explain the position invariance of MST(d) cells. Position invariance is the experimental finding that rotary motion sensitive cells are insensitive to where in their receptive field rotation occurs.When all the dots in the display are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution, illusory rotary motion is perceived. This case was investigated by Rose & Blake previously, who termed the illusory rotary motion the omega effect. Two important experimental findings are reported concerning this effect. First, although the display of random dots evokes perception of rotary motion, the direction of motion perceived does not depend on what dot pattern is shown. Second, the time interval between spontaneous flips in perceived direction is lognormally distributed (mode approximately 2 s). These findings suggest the omega effect fits in the category of a typical bistable illusion, and therefore the processes that give rise to this illusion may be the same processes that underlie much of other bistable phenomenon."
