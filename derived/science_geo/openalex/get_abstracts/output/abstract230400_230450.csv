https://openalex.org/W2117425975,"Networks of cross-linked and bundled actin filaments are ubiquitous in the cellular cytoskeleton, but their elasticity remains poorly understood. We show that these networks exhibit exceptional elastic behavior that reflects the mechanical properties of individual filaments. There are two distinct regimes of elasticity, one reflectingbendingof single filaments and a second reflectingstretchingof entropic fluctuations of filament length. The mechanical stiffness can vary by several decades with small changes in cross-link concentration, and can increase markedly upon application of external stress. We parameterize the full range of behavior in a state diagram and elucidate its origin with a robust model."
https://openalex.org/W2000989371,"The realization of the Borromean link in a wholly synthetic molecular form is reported. The self-assembly of this link, which is topologically achiral, from 18 components by the template-directed formation of 12 imine and 30 dative bonds, associated with the coordination of three interlocked macrocycles, each tetranucleating and decadentate overall, to a total of six zinc(II) ions, is near quantitative. Three macrocycles present diagonally in pairs, six exo -bidentate bipyridyl and six endo -diiminopyridyl ligands to the six zinc(II) ions. The use, in concert, of coordination, supramolecular, and dynamic covalent chemistry allowed the highly efficient construction, by multiple cooperative self-assembly processes, of a nanoscale dodecacation with an approximate diameter of 2.5 nanometers and an inner chamber of volume 250 Å 3 , lined with 12 oxygen atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2164232957,"Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a protein localized in jejunal enterocytes that is critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption. The uptake of intestinal phytosterols and cholesterol into absorptive enterocytes in the intestine is not fully defined on a molecular level, and the role of NPC1L1 in maintaining whole body cholesterol homeostasis is not known. NPC1L1 null mice had substantially reduced intestinal uptake of cholesterol and sitosterol, with dramatically reduced plasma phytosterol levels. The NPC1L1 null mice were completely resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, with plasma lipoprotein and hepatic cholesterol profiles similar to those of wild type mice treated with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe. Cholesterol/cholate feeding resulted in down-regulation of intestinal NPC1L1 mRNA expression in wild type mice. NPC1L1 deficiency resulted in up-regulation of intestinal hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase mRNA and an increase in intestinal cholesterol synthesis, down-regulation of ABCA1 mRNA, and no change in ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA expression. NPC1L1 is required for intestinal uptake of both cholesterol and phytosterols and plays a major role in cholesterol homeostasis. Thus, NPC1L1 may be a useful drug target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and sitosterolemia.

Thus, NPC1L1 may be a useful drug target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and sitosterolemia. Cholesterol absorption of both dietary cholesterol and cholesterol cleared from the liver through biliary secretion contributes along with regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis to maintain a tight control of cholesterol homeostasis. The mechanism by which cholesterol moves from the intestinal lumen into the absorptive enterocytes lining the proximal small intestine is poorly understood. The identification of ezetimibe as a potent selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol uptake and absorption confirmed this mechanism as a key point of therapeutic intervention for lowering plasma cholesterol levels and indicated that this process is mediated by a specific transporter (1van Heek M. France C.F. Compton D.S. McLeod R.L. Yumibe N.P. Alton K.B. Sybertz E.J. Davis H.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 157-163PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rosenblum S.B. Huynh T. Davis H.R. Yumibe N.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 1943-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Based on the properties of ezetimibe in animal models of cholesterol uptake, it was predicted that such a transporter would be expressed in jejunal enterocytes and localized to the brush border membrane, which forms the interface between the intestinal lumen and the intracellular compartments responsible for cholesterol esterification and packaging into chylomicrons. Through studies designed to understand the mechanism by which ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption, we recently identified Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) 1The abbreviations used are: NPC1L1, Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; ABC, ATP binding cassette; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. as a critical protein for the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). NPC1L1 was identified through a genomics-bioinformatics approach by sequencing an expression sequence tags library from rat jejunum, annotating the sequences, and searching databases for intestinal proteins with features of a cholesterol transporter (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). NPC1L1 was found to be highly expressed in the jejunum and localized on the surface of the absorptive enterocytes. Mice deficient in NPC1L1 exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol absorption, and the low level of residual cholesterol absorption was insensitive to ezetimibe treatment. These previous results suggested that NPC1L1 resides in an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway responsible for cholesterol absorption (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting cholesterol absorption, ezetimibe reduces plasma phytosterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia, although a molecular mechanism for intestinal phytosterol uptake and absorption has yet to be established (4Sudhop T. Lutjohann D. Kodal A. Tribble D. Shah S. Perevozskaya I. von Bergmann K. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1943-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Ezetimibe also effectively reduces phytosterol levels in patients with sitosterolemia, which is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding cassette (ABC) co-transporters, either ABCG5 or ABCG8 (7Salen G. von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Kwiterovich P. Kane J. Patel S.B. Musliner T. Stein P. Musser B. Circulation. 2004; 109: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). ABCG5 and ABCG8 are expressed on the apical surface of hepatocytes and enterocytes, and their function is required to export phytosterols into the bile and intestinal lumen, respectively. The present study describes the role of NPC1L1 in the selective intestinal uptake and absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols, regulation of the expression of intestinal NPC1L1, and other proteins related to sterol metabolism and resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in NPC1L1-deficient mice. Materials—All solvents, chemicals, and sterols were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Campesterol was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Platinum quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (catalog no. 11730-017) was purchased from Invitrogen. [14C]Cholesterol ([4-14C]cholesterol, 45-60 mCi/mmol, catalog no.

[2-14C]Mevalonic acid (CFA484) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Animals—All animals were housed, treated, and cared for according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals and the Animal Welfare Act in a program accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care under a protocol approved by the Schering-Plough Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. NPC1L1 null (-/-) mice were generated as previously described (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), with a targeting vector containing a LacZ-Neo-encoding cassette. Cellular localization of the LacZ in the mice was determined in 10-μm tissue sections post-fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained for β-galactosidase activity using a Beta-Gal staining kit (Invitrogen, catalog no. K1465-01). The colony of NPC1L1 (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice was maintained at Schering-Plough Research Institute. Cholesterol, Sitosterol, and Triglyceride Absorption—Cholesterol absorption was determined in NPC1L1 (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice, and sitosterol and triglyceride absorption was determined in NPC1L1 (-/-) and (+/+) mice (3van Heek M. Farley C. Compton D.S. Hoos L. Davis H.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Yao X. Laverty M. Compton D.S. Zhu L. Crona J.H.

Littermate or age-matched mice were fed a standard chow diet and gavaged with [14C]cholesterol, 1 μCi with 0.1 mg of unlabeled cholesterol (n = 5-10/group), 2 μCi of [3H]sitosterol (n = 5/group), or 1 μCi of [carboxy-14C]triolein (n = 4-5/group) in 0.1 ml of corn oil. Two (cholesterol and triglyceride) or four (sitosterol) h later, plasma, livers, and small intestines were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting as previously described (6Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Yao X. Laverty M. Compton D.S. Zhu L. Crona J.H. Caplen M.A. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Priestley T. Burnett D.A. Strader C.D. Graziano M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Sitosterol absorption (4 h) was also determined in female C57BL/6 mice treated orally with 10 mg/kg ezetimibe or corn oil vehicle 30 min before 2 μCi of [3H]sitosterol administration (n = 5/group). Plasma Cholesterol, Sitosterol, and Campesterol Levels—Plasma sterol levels were determined in male littermate or age-matched NPC1L1 (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice fed a standard chow diet. Plasma samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Samples of plasma, 50 μl each, were added to glass tubes containing 50 μg epicoprostanol and 1 μg stigmastanol solubilized in 10 μl of toluene. Ethanolic potassium hydroxide (1 ml) was added to each sample, mixed, and incubated at 60 °C for 1 h with shaking. The ethanolic KOH was prepared by diluting 6 ml of a 500 g/l aqueous solution of KOH to 100 ml with ethanol. After saponification, 1 ml water was added, and neutral sterols were extracted with 2 ml petroleum ether. The upper phase (1.6 ml) was collected and dried under a gentle stream of argon, and the remainder was redissolved in 100 μl of a 1:2:3 mixture by volume of chlorotrimethylsilane, hexamethyldisilazane, and pyridine. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 60 °C to convert free hydroxyl groups into trimethylsilyl ethers, dried under a stream of argon, dissolved in 500 μl of isooctane, and divided in 2 aliquots which were analyzed by GC and GC-MS for determination of cholesterol and plant sterols, respectively. For cholesterol, GC analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890 Plus instrument equipped with a split/splitless injector and a flame ionization detector using a 30-m, 0.32-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm-film HP-5 column. The oven temperature was kept at 280 °C isothermally, and the split ratio was set to 1:20. 1 μl of each sample was injected, and the amount of cholesterol was calculated from the ratio of the area of the cholesterol peak (retention time 6.46 min) to the area of the peak of the internal standard, epicoprostanol (retention time 5.50 min), using a standard curve. For campesterol and sitosterol, GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890N instrument equipped with a split/splitless injector operating in the splitless mode coupled to an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector. A 30-m, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm-film HP-5MS column was used. The injector temperature was set at 280 °C, and oven temperature was programmed as follows: hold at 60 °C for 2 min, 20 °C/min to 180 °C, 10 °C/min to 250 °C, 5 °C/min to 300 °C, hold at 300 °C for 10 min. The transfer line was set at 300 °C, and the mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode with the electron energy set at 70 eV. Selective ion monitoring for m/z 472, 486, and 488 was performed for the detection of campesterol (retention time 25.57 min), sitosterol (retention time 26.68 min), and stigmastanol (retention time 26.84 min), respectively. Each sample (1 μl) was injected, and the amounts of campesterol and sitosterol were calculated from the ratio of the area of their respective peaks to the area of the peak of the internal standard, stigmastanol, using a standard curve. Intestinal Cholesterol Synthesis—Cholesterol synthesis was determined in littermate or age-matched NPC1L1 (-/-) and (+/+) female mice fed a standard chow diet. Mice were orally gavaged with 2 μCi of [14C]mevalonic acid in saline. One hour later proximal small intestine samples were collected (proximal half 2 cm distal to pylorus), lipids were extracted, and free cholesterol fractions were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as previously described (8van Heek M. Farley C. Compton D.S. Hoos L. Torhan A.S. Davis H.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis of TLC plate radioactivity was accomplished by phosphorimaging, digitizing, and computer quantitation (Storm 860 PhosphorImager Scanner and Image Quant Version 2.2, Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Cholesterol-fed NPC1L1 Knockout Mice—Male littermate or age-matched NPC1L1 (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice (n = 5/group) were fed rodent chow supplemented with 1% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate for 7 days (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). Plasma lipoprotein profiles were determined by fast protein liquid chromatography with an Amersham Biosciences Superose 6 column. Fast protein liquid chromatography fractions, total plasma cholesterol, and bile cholesterol levels were determined using the Wako Cholesterol CII enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA). Liver cholesterol levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography essentially as described (9Burrier R.E. Deren S. McGreger D.G. Hoos L.M. Smith A.A. Davis H.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1545-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed as previously described (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). The proximal half of the small intestine was collected from 2 cm distal to the pylorus and rapidly rinsed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was isolated as described (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix -UDG (Invitrogen) on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Tissue expression levels of individual genes were quantified and normalized against a control reaction for mouse 18 S RNA. Two independent reverse transcriptase reactions were each analyzed twice. Each analysis performed in triplicate included both 18 S RNA and the gene of interest primer/probe pairs as multiplexed reactions that contained 18 S primers at 200 nm each, 6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAM™)/carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA™)-labeled probe at 100 nm, gene-specific primers at 100 nm each, and VIC™/carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA™)-labeled probe at 50 nm.

Statistical significance among groups was assessed using one way analysis of variance, Dunnett multiple comparisons test, and unpaired Student's t tests. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. NPC1L1 null (-/-) mice were generated by using a NPC1L1-targeting vector consisting of a LacZ-Neo-encoding cassette flanked by ∼1.9 kilobases of 5′ and 3.2 kilobases of 3′ mouse genomic DNA sequence, resulting in the deletion from base 790 to 998 of the mouse NPC1L1 sequence (Deltagen Inc., Palo Alto, CA) (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). 129/OlaHsd ES cells injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts were used to generate chimeric mice. A colony of NPC1L1 (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice was established initially by intercrossing F1 heterozygous males and females. Tissue and cellular localization of the LacZ-Neo cassette in the NPC1L1 (-/-) mice was determined with a histochemical reaction for β-galactosidase activity. Extensive histological evaluations of tissues from the NPC1L1 (-/-) mice revealed that the LacZ-Neo cassette was highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes, primarily in the jejunum (Fig. 1). No other tissue or cellular expression was found in the (-/-) mice, except for intestinal enterocytes over Peyer's patches and a few isolated cells at the base of the stomach mucosa. The tissue distribution of NPC1L1 expression demonstrated by the LacZ-Neo cassette supports the participation of NPC1L1 in cholesterol absorption, which occurs primarily in the proximal jejunum. Cholesterol absorption into plasma and liver and intestinal cholesterol uptake was determined in the NPC1L1 null (-/-), heterozygous (+/-), and wild type (+/+) mice at 2 h after administration of [14C]cholesterol (Fig. 2, A and B). The (-/-) mice absorbed 86 and 79% less cholesterol into the plasma and liver compared with (+/+) and the (+/-) mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption in the (+/-) mice appeared to be reduced compared with the (+/+) mice, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 2A). Cholesterol uptake by the proximal small intestine was reduced by 64% in the (-/-) mice compared with the (+/+) mice (Fig. 2B) (p < 0.01). These results are consistent with the previous observation that cholesterol absorption is severely reduced in NPC1L1 (-/-) mice when measured by the fecal dual-isotope method (5Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar) and strongly support the role of NPC1L1 as a critical component of the cholesterol absorption pathway. Sitosterol absorption and intestinal uptake was determined 4 h after administering [3H]sitosterol to NPC1L1 (-/-) and (+/+) mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Sitosterol absorption was significantly reduced in the (-/-) mice by 64% compared with (+/+) mice. The uptake of sitosterol into the intestine was also reduced by 52% in the (-/-) mice compared with the (+/+) mice (Fig. 2B)(p < 0.01). A single 10-mg dose of ezetimibe was found to reduce sitosterol absorption by 67% from 0.356 ± 0.043 to 0.116 ± 0.011% of the administered labeled sitosterol in wild type C57BL/6 mice (p < 0.001). Intestinal sitosterol uptake was reduced by 55% in ezetimibe-treated mice, from 3.04 ± 0.29 to 1.36 ± 0.14% (p < 0.001). Thus, the degree of reduction for sitosterol absorption and intestinal uptake in the NPC1L1 (-/-) mice was very similar to that observed in wild type mice treated with ezetimibe. Because ezetimibe specifically inhibits sterol absorption without affecting absorption of triglycerides (3van Heek M. Farley C. Compton D.S. Hoos L. Davis H.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), triglyceride absorption and intestinal uptake was evaluated in the NPC1L1 (-/-) compared with wild type mice (+/+). Intestinal triglyceride uptake and absorption into the liver and plasma compartments was not altered in the (-/-) mice relative to the (+/+) mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Plasma cholesterol and phytosterol levels were measured in chow-fed NPC1L1 (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice (Fig. 3) to determine whether deletion of NPC1L1 reduced basal levels of phytosterols, as would be predicted from its apparent role in phytosterol absorption. Plasma cholesterol levels were similar among the (-/-), (+/-), and (+/+) mice. The plasma levels of the phytosterols, sitosterol and campesterol, were extremely low in the (-/-) mice and were reduced by greater than 90% relative to the (+/+) mice and from 83-92% relative to the (+/-) mice (p < 0.01). The phytosterol levels in the NPC1L1 heterozygous (+/-) mice were reduced compared with the (+/+) mice by 37 and 50% for sitosterol and campesterol, respectively (p < 0.05). These results support the hypothesis that NPC1L1 is part of the major pathway by which phytosterols are absorbed. The effect of cholesterol feeding on plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol profiles was determined in the null (-/-), heterozygous (+/-), and wild type (+/+) mice. The mice were fed a diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate for 7 days, and a group of (+/+) mice was also treated with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe at 10 mg/kg/day. Plasma cholesterol levels increased 2-fold in the (+/+) mice, whereas plasma cholesterol levels did not significantly change in the (+/-) or the (-/-) mice (Fig. 4A). Ezetimibe treatment of the (+/+) mice inhibited the rise in plasma cholesterol levels and resulted in plasma cholesterol levels similar to the (+/-) and (-/-) mice. Plasma lipoprotein profiles of the mice revealed that cholesterol feeding did not alter the lipoprotein-cholesterol profiles in the (+/-) and (-/-) mice relative to non-cholesterol-fed mice (Fig. 5). The lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in the (+/+) mice were found to increase primarily in the VLDL and LDL fractions (Fig. 5 and 6). Compared with the cholesterol-fed (+/+) mice, the VLDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the (+/-) and (-/-) mice as well as in the ezetimibe-treated (+/+) mice (Fig. 6) (p < 0.05). LDL cholesterol levels were also significantly lower in the (-/-) mice compared with the cholesterol-fed (+/+) mice (Fig. 6). The plasma lipoprotein profile of the cholesterol-fed, ezetimibe-treated (+/+) mice was similar to that of the cholesterol-fed (-/-) mice. Thus, the absence of NPC1L1 prevents the elevation in VLDL and LDL cholesterol observed upon increasing dietary cholesterol.Fig. 5Effect of cholesterol feeding on lipoprotein cholesterol profiles in NPC1L1 knockout mice. Plasma lipoprotein profiles were determined by fast protein liquid chromatography from NPC1L1 null (-/-) (bottom panel), heterozygous (+/-) (middle panel), and wild type (+/+) (top panel) mice fed a basal rodent diet or chow containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate for 7 days. Total cholesterol levels were determined in each of the lipoprotein fractions.

A group of cholesterol-fed (+/+) mice were treated with ezetimibe (EZE; 10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days (stripped bars). Pooled lipoprotein cholesterol levels were determined in VLDL (fractions 15-19), LDL (fractions 20-27), and high density lipoprotein (fractions 28-35 from Fig. 5).

The appearance of the livers from wild type (+/+) mice and NPC1L1 null (-/-) mice fed the cholesterol-containing diet for 7 days were dramatically different. The livers from the (+/+) mice were pale from the accumulation of lipids, whereas the livers from the (-/-) mice appeared like normal livers from chow-fed mice. Hepatic cholesteryl ester levels were determined in the mice (Fig. 4B) and confirmed the qualitative visual observation. Feeding a diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate for 7 days to (+/+) mice caused a 7-fold increase in hepatic cholesteryl ester content compared with chow-fed (+/+) animals (p < 0.001). Among the chow-fed groups, the (+/-) mice showed no decrease in hepatic cholesteryl ester content, whereas there was a small but significant decrease in the (-/-) mice compared with the (+/+) mice (Fig. 4B). With cholesterol feeding, hepatic cholesteryl ester levels increased 2-fold in the NPC1L1 heterozygous (+/-) mice compared with chow-fed (+/-) mice (p < 0.05). However, hepatic cholesterol levels remained 79% lower in the (+/-) mice than the levels observed in the cholesterol-fed (+/+) mice (p < 0.01). The NPC1L1 null (-/-) mouse hepatic cholesteryl ester levels increased slightly with cholesterol feeding but remained 86% lower than those of the cholesterol-fed (+/+) mice (p < 0.01). Ezetimibe treatment of cholesterol-fed (+/+) mice prevented accumulation of cholesterol in the liver, and final levels of cholesteryl esters were the same as those for the cholesterol-fed NPC1L1 (-/-) mice (Fig. 4B). The deletion of NPC1L1 matched the effect of ezetimibe treatment on hepatic cholesterol content under conditions of cholesterol feeding in mice. Levels of cholesterol in gall bladder bile were also evaluated in the groups of cholesterol-fed mice. The biliary cholesterol concentrations were 11.1 ± 1.01 μmol/ml in the (+/+) group, 7.36 ± 0.58 μmol/ml in the (+/-) group, 7.37 ± 1.00 μmol/ml in the (-/-) group, and 6.15 ± 0.55 μmol/ml in the (+/+) mice treated with ezetimibe. The biliary cholesterol levels were significantly less in the NPC1L1 (+/-), (-/-), and the ezetimibe-treated (+/+) mice compared with the cholesterol-fed wild type mice (p < 0.05), suggesting a decrease in the hepatic cholesterol pool with a deletion or reduction in NPC1L1 expression or ezetimibe treatment. Because cellular cholesterol metabolism is under tight control and NPC1L1 deficiency may alter the size of the intracellular regulatory cholesterol pool, alterations in the intestinal mRNA expression of proteins involved in sterol metabolism were determined in the chow- and cholesterol-fed NPC1L1 null (-/-), heterozygous (+/-), and wild type (+/+) mice. NPC1L1 mRNA was absent in the proximal (jejunum) small intestine of the NPC1L1 (-/-) mice, whereas it was easily detectable in both the (+/-) and (+/+) mice (Fig. 7). Feeding the mice a diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholate caused a 75% reduction in the intestinal expression of NPC1L1 in both (+/+) and (+/-) mice compared with chow-fed mice of the same genotype (Fig. 7). The reduced intestinal uptake of sterols in the chow-fed NPC1L1 (-/-) mice resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the expression of mRNA for the cholesterol synthetic enzyme HMG-CoA synthase relative to expression in the (+/+) and (+/-) mice (Fig. 7). Intestinal cholesterol synthesis from orally administered [14C]mevalonate was found to be increased 3.9-fold in chow-fed NPC1L1 null (-/-) mice relative to wild type (+/+) mice (8.3 × 106 and 2.1 × 106 dpm, respectively, p < 0.05), consistent with the observed increase in HMG-CoA synthase. Intestinal HMG-CoA synthase mRNA expression levels remained elevated in the"

Using this system, we conducted hydrogenation reactions that proceeded smoothly to afford the desired products quantitatively within 2 minutes for a variety of substrates. The system could also be applied to deprotection reactions. We could achieve an effective interaction between hydrogen, substrates, and a palladium catalyst using extremely large interfacial areas and the short path required for molecular diffusion in the very narrow channel space. This concept could be extended to other multiphase reactions that use gas-phase reagents such as oxygen and carbon dioxide."

Here we describe a mutation in the gene encoding the protein kinase AKT2/PKBβ in a family that shows autosomal dominant inheritance of severe insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Expression of the mutant kinase in cultured cells disrupted insulin signaling to metabolic end points and inhibited the function of coexpressed, wild-type AKT. These findings demonstrate the central importance of AKT signaling to insulin sensitivity in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2013020466,"Nucleic acid diagnostics is dominated by fluorescence-based assays that use complex and expensive enzyme-based target or signal-amplification procedures. Many clinical diagnostic applications will require simpler, inexpensive assays that can be done in a screening mode. We have developed a 'spot-and-read' colorimetric detection method for identifying nucleic acid sequences based on the distance-dependent optical properties of gold nanoparticles. In this assay, nucleic acid targets are recognized by DNA-modified gold probes, which undergo a color change that is visually detectable when the solutions are spotted onto an illuminated glass waveguide. This scatter-based method enables detection of zeptomole quantities of nucleic acid targets without target or signal amplification when coupled to an improved hybridization method that facilitates probe-target binding in a homogeneous format. In comparison to a previously reported absorbance-based method, this method increases detection sensitivity by over four orders of magnitude. We have applied this method to the rapid detection of mecA in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus genomic DNA samples."

Using seismic imaging, we detected a cause of the Tokai silent slip, which occurred at a presumed fault zone of a great earthquake. The seismic image that we obtained shows a zone of high pore fluid pressure in the subducted oceanic crust located down-dip of a subducted ridge. We propose that these structures effectivelyextend a region of conditionallystable slips and consequently generate the silent slip."

Intracellular levels of p53 are controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Here we show that PKB inhibits Mdm2 self-ubiquitination via phosphorylation of Mdm2 on Ser166 and Ser188. Stimulation of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with insulin-like growth factor-1 increased Mdm2 phosphorylation on Ser166 and Ser188 in a phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH kinase-dependent manner, and the treatment of both human embryonic kidney 293 and COS-1 cells with phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH kinase inhibitor LY-294002 led to proteasome-mediated Mdm2 degradation. Introduction of a constitutively active form of PKB together with Mdm2 into cells induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser188 and stabilized Mdm2 protein.

Mdm2 harbors a self- and p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity within its evolutionarily conserved C-terminal RING finger domain, which mediates p53 ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome (20Honda R.

Indeed, it has been reported that Mdm2 could be phosphorylated by PKB in vitro at Ser166 and Ser186, and this phosphorylation promotes the nuclear entry of Mdm2 (31Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl.

Phosphorylation of Mdm2 by PKB leads to inhibition of Mdm2 self-ubiquitination and stabilization of Mdm2 by protecting Mdm2 from proteasome-dependent degradation. Thus, our results suggest that PKB-dependent phosphorylation of Mdm2 leads to the increase of Mdm2 stability and a consequent down-regulation of p53.

Samples were then subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or 32P determination in excised gel slices at positions corresponding to Mdm2. To determine the effect of phosphorylation on Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, phosphorylation of Mdm2 was carried out under the similar conditions using nonradioactive ATP instead of [γ-32P]ATP. At each time point the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mm EDTA (final) and 20 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After extensive washing, the bead-bound GST-Mdm2 was used for ubiquitination assay. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—32P-Labeling of GST-ubiquitin and ubiquitination assay were carried out as described previously (35Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Assay conditions were 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 15 ng of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, 0.5 μg of GST-UbcH5, and 1.5 μg of GST-Mdm2 or mutants in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were started by the addition of 2 μg of 32P-labeled GST-ubiquitin and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. GST-Mdm2 was then precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose 4B and eluted in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by autoradiography. Effect of Phosphorylation on Mdm2 Self-ubiquitination—We identified two major phosphorylation sites of Mdm2 on Ser166 and Ser188 by PKB in vitro (data not shown). Residue Ser166 has been previously described as a PKB site (31Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 32Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), whereas Ser188 was identified as a novel PKB site here for the first time. We also confirmed the sites of phosphorylation by in vitro kinase assay using peptides corresponding to the two sites as substrates (data not shown). We failed to detect phosphorylation on Ser186, which was previously described by other groups (31Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 32Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The region surrounding Ser166 and Ser188 in human Mdm2 conforms to a consensus sequence motif for PKB phosphorylation, i.e. RXRXX(S/T) (36Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It was also found that Ser166 and Ser188 are the best predicted sites for PKB using the Scansite motif-profile scoring algorithm program generated by Yaffe and Cantley (Ref. 37Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.C. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, scansite.mit.edu). Because Mdm2 is capable of self-ubiquitination and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway-dependent degradation is an important mechanism for regulating Mdm2 levels in cells (20Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), we asked whether PKB-induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 might have an effect on its ubiquitination. We examined the effect of phosphorylation on reconstituted Mdm2 self-ubiquitination in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1A, Mdm2 self-ubiquitination was observed only in the presence of both ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, UbcH5. The degree of Mdm2 self-ubiquitination was reduced over time by PKB-mediated phosphorylation. To determine which phosphorylation site was responsible for this reduction of Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, two mutants, i.e. GST-Mdm2S166A and GST-Mdm2S188V (in which the serine residues were individually changed to alanine or valine), were first phosphorylated by recombinant ΔPH-PKBα and then subjected to the ubiquitination assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, the non-phosphorylated forms of Mdm2 and the mutants were all ubiquitinated in the presence of both E1 and UbcH5. Phosphorylation of wild-type GST-Mdm2 completely abolished Mdm2 self-ubiquitination. However, phosphorylation of either GST-Mdm2S166A or GST-Mdm2S188V only partially inhibited Mdm2 self-ubiquitination. The Mdm2S188A and Mdm2S166A/S188V double mutant were highly degraded in E. coli and could not be tested. Three Asp mutants (GST-Mdm2S166D, GST-Mdm2S188D, and GST-Mdm2S166D/S188D) were also generated and tested in this in vitro ubiquitination assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, all three Asp mutants were poorly ubiquitinated, further supporting the idea that the protective effect of PKB on Mdm2 self-ubiquitination may be due primarily to the phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser188. Production and Characterization of Mdm2 Phospho-specific Antibodies—To monitor the phosphorylation of Mdm2 in vivo, two rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognized phosphorylated Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser188 were prepared. These antibodies are referred to as Ser(P)166 and Ser(P)188, respectively. The specificity of the purified antibodies was evaluated by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, GST-Mdm2 phosphorylated by either pervanadate-activated HA-PKBα (WT, van) or recombinant ΔPH-PKBα was recognized by each antibody. Non-phosphorylated GST-Mdm2 or GST-Mdm2 phosphorylated by either untreated HA-PKBα (WT) or kinase-defective HA-PKBα (KD) was not detected. The Ser(P)166 antibody detected both GST-Mdm2 and GST-Mdm2S188V phosphorylated by ΔPH-PKBα but did not detect GST-Mdm2S166A (Fig. 2A). Similarly, Ser(P)188 could also detect GST-Mdm2 and GST-Mdm2S166A but not GST-Mdm2S188V when phosphorylated by ΔPH-PKBα. These results suggest that each phospho antibody specifically detected phosphorylation of Mdm2 by PKB at Ser166 and Ser188, respectively. IGF-1 Induces in Vivo Phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser188—To determine whether our phospho antibodies could detect Mdm2 phosphorylation in vivo, the effect of IGF-1 on HEK293 cells was examined. Serum-starved cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for different times, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using Ser(P)166 and Ser(P)188. After IGF-1 stimulation a dramatic increase in phosphorylation on Mdm2 residues Ser166 and Ser188 was observed, and a relatively high level of phosphorylation was maintained for the 30-min duration of the experiment (Fig. 2B). The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 was suppressed by pretreatment with 50 μm LY-294002, an inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the activation of PI3K/PKB pathway is required for Mdm2 phosphorylation at Ser166 and Ser188in vivo. PKB Promotes Mdm2 Phosphorylation in Vivo and Prevents Its Degradation—To test whether Mdm2 is phosphorylated in transfected cells, a pEGFP-Mdm2 was co-transfected with pCMV5-HA-m/p-PKBα (m/p-PKBα, a constitutively active membrane-targeted myristoylated/palmitoylated PKBα), pCMV5-HA-KD-PKBα (KD-PKBα, a kinase-deficient PKBα), or pCMV5 into COS-1 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of m/p-PKBα but not KD-PKBα caused an increase in the phosphorylation level of GFP-Mdm2 at both Ser166 and Ser188 (Fig. 3A), indicating that PKB kinase activity is required for the phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser188in vivo. Significantly, the level of GFP-Mdm2 expression was lower in the mock or KD-PKBα-transfected cells but remained high in the m/p-PKBα-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, left panel). To explore whether the lower levels of Mdm2 were due to degradation of protein, transfected cells were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3A, the reduction of Mdm2 protein levels in both mock and KD-PKBα-transfected cells was reversed upon MG132 treatment and reached a similar level to that of the m/p-PKBα-transfected cells. The efficiency of transfection was monitored by co-expression of GFP as indicated. Lysates were probed with anti-phospho-Ser473 antibody (Ser(P)473) to confirm the activation status of PKB. These data suggested that transfected GFP-Mdm2 is a labile protein that is a target for degradation (20Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) and, furthermore, that PKB phosphorylation is required for protecting Mdm2 from proteasome-dependent destruction, thus increasing Mdm2 stability. To further confirm the hypothesis that PKB activity is sufficient to stabilize Mdm2, GFP-Mdm2 was co-transfected with m/p-PKBα, KD-PKBα, or pCMV5 empty vector in COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for the indicated period of time before harvesting. Levels of GFP-Mdm2 were markedly decreased in mock or KD-PKBα-cotransfected cells but remained relatively high in m/p-PKBα co-transfected cells over time (Fig. 3B). This was not a result of variations in transfection efficiency as shown by the levels of GFP control. These data suggest that maintenance of a higher level of GFP-Mdm2 in the m/p-PKBα-cotransfected cells may be primarily due to prevention of Mdm2 protein degradation by PKB rather than activation of transcriptional machinery. To investigate whether phosphorylation of Mdm2 by PKB was sufficient to increase its stability, three Ser to Asp phosphorylation site mutants of Mdm2 were constructed and transfected into COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, wild-type GFP-Mdm2 (WT) was rapidly degraded in the absence of MG132 but markedly accumulated in the presence of this inhibitor. Substitution of Ser166 to Asp (GFP-Mdm2S166D) and Ser188 to Asp (GFP-Mdm2S188D) resulted in increased Mdm2 stability even in the absence of MG132. A double mutant in which both Ser166 and Ser188 were changed to Asp (GFP-Mdm2S166D/S188D, DD) was tested and was as stable as each single mutant. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser188 b"

Bgn-deficient mice develop age-related osteopenia with a phenotype that resembles osteoporosis and premature arthritis. In the present study, we have examined the differentiation of bgn-deficient osteoblasts from neonatal murine calvariae and found that the absence of bgn caused less BMP-4 binding, which reduced the sensitivity of osteoblasts to BMP-4 stimulation. The loss of sensitivity resulted in a reduction of Cbfa1 expression, which ultimately led to a defect in the differentiation of osteoblasts. However, the response of bgn-deficient osteoblasts to BMP-4 was completely rescued by reintroduction of biglycan by viral transfection. We propose that biglycan modulates BMP-4-induced signaling to control osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2089986715,"During somitogenesis, a pair of somites buds off from the presomitic mesoderm every 2 hours in mouse embryos, suggesting that somite segmentation is controlled by a biological clock with a 2-hour cycle1,2,3. Expression of the basic helix-loop-helix factor Hes7, an effector of Notch signaling, follows a 2-hour oscillatory cycle controlled by negative feedback; this is proposed to be the molecular basis for the somite segmentation clock4,5,6. If the proposal is correct, this clock should depend crucially on the short lifetime of Hes7. To address the biological importance of Hes7 instability, we generated mice expressing mutant Hes7 with a longer half-life (∼30 min compared with ∼22 min for wild-type Hes7) but normal repressor activity. In these mice, somite segmentation and oscillatory expression became severely disorganized after a few normal cycles of segmentation. We simulated this effect mathematically using a direct autorepression model. Thus, instability of Hes7 is essential for sustained oscillation and for its function as a segmentation clock."
https://openalex.org/W2034328033,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is expressed by endothelial cells. We investigated the characteristics of BDNF expression by brain-derived endothelial cells and tested the hypothesis that BDNF serves paracrine and autocrine functions affecting the vasculature of the central nervous system. In addition to expressing TrkB and p75NTR and BDNF under normoxic conditions, these cells increased their expression of BDNF under hypoxia. While the expression of TrkB is unaffected by hypoxia, TrkB exhibits a base-line phosphorylation under normoxic conditions and an increased phosphorylation when BDNF is added. TrkB phosphorylation is decreased when endogenous BDNF is sequestered by soluble TrkB. Exogenous BDNF elicits robust angiogenesis and survival in three-dimensional cultures of these endothelial cells, while sequestration of endogenous BDNF caused significant apoptosis. The effects of BDNF engagement of TrkB appears to be mediated via the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-Akt pathway. Modulation of BDNF levels directly correlate with Akt phosphorylation and inhibitors of PI 3-kinase abrogate the BDNF responses. BDNF-mediated effects on endothelial cell survival/apoptosis correlated directly with activation of caspase 3.

Angiogenesis is a tightly controlled process in which new vessels form from those pre-existing. This process occurs in a regulated fashion during development and growth as well as in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Angiogenesis as been shown to be a receptor- and ligand-regulated process, with a still growing, diverse number of soluble factors and their cognate receptors being involved in the different phases of the angiogenic process (1Yancopoulos G.D.

In the developing brain, angiogenesis has been shown to be regulated by factors secreted by neuronal and glial cell populations in an orderly, spatiotemporal fashion (2Ogunshola O.O. Stewart W.B.

Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that neurotrophins expressed by endothelia and are capable of influencing several endothelial cell functions including endothelial cell survival and vessel stabilization (5Leventhal C.

BDNF, given peripherally, accelerates the regenerative sprouting of injured adult spinal motor neurons and axotomized retinal ganglion cells (19Novikov L. Novikova L. Kellerth J.O. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, BDNF appears to be involved in peripheral sensory and motor neuron regeneration at the site of nerve injury. Neurotrophins mediate their action on responsive neurons by binding to two classes of cell surface receptor (20Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev.

These studies suggest that there may be a complex and dynamically regulated cross-talk between neuronal cells and endothelial cells during development, growth, and in response to pathological stimuli in the brain and prompted us to investigate these potential interactions. In this report we have demonstrated the expression of BDNF by brain-derived endothelial cells and the expression and activation of the neurotrophin receptors TrkB and p75NTR in these brain-derived endothelial cells. In addition, we have shown that engagement of either TrkB or p75NTR (by BDNF and pro-NGF, respectively) results in distinct endothelial behaviors, survival and angiogenesis in the case of BDNF activation of TrkB and apoptosis in the case of pro-NGF activation of p75NTR. Furthermore, the importance of these findings in the control of neurovascular development and responses to chronic sublethal hypoxic injury is discussed. Recombinant NGF and Pro-NGF—Cleavage-resistant pro-NGF was purified from the media of cells stably expressing the construct, using nickel chromatography and imidazole elution as described (23Lee R.

Wortmannin, LY294002, and PD98059 were purchased from Sigma. Cells were cultured for 6 days. Medium was changed, and recombinant proteins were added every 24 h. All hypoxia experiments were performed with cells incubated in a sealed, humidified chamber gassed with 10% O2, 5% CO2, 85% N2 at 37 °C as described (32Chow J. Ogunshola O. Fan S.Y. Li Y. Ment L.R.

Cells were infected with adenovirus containing HA-tagged dominant negative Akt (Akt-AAA) with a marker of green fluorescent protein (a generous gift of Dr. William Sessa, Yale University) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium for 1 h and then incubated for 24 h in complete growth medium as described (34Fujio Y.

Infection efficiency of bEnd-WT cells with recombinant adenoviruses at 40 multiplicity of infection was close to 100% as determined by the green fluorescent color observed in the cells and immunohistochemical staining of β-galactosidase. The expression and relative levels of endogenous and recombinant adenoviral Akt were confirmed by Western blotting. Matrigel Assay—BD Matrigel™ matrix was used to coat tissue culture dishes according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Cells were plated onto the matrix at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 30-mm plate and allowed to grow for various times. At specific time points, light microscopy images were taken and analyzed, and cell lysates were prepared as described (38Solowiej A. Biswas P. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Vessel Counting—Vessel counts were performed with three samples per condition. Three random fields were photographed per sample. Random digital images of cultures were taken using an inverted research microscope (Olympus Co.) equipped with Nikon coolpix 995 digital camera using Photoshop 5.0 software on a Macintosh G4 computer. NIH Image 1.62 or IP LabSpectrum software was used to select, measure, and analyze the images to determine aggregate tube length. Data were expressed in terms of pixel change (NIH Image) or microns (IP LabSpectrum) compared with normoxic (5% CO2 and room air (20% O2)) controls. Statistics (Student's t test and standard error) were calculated and graphically presented using Excel 2000 on a Macintosh G4 computer. Statistical significance was assumed for p values < 0.05. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cell lysates and subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-VEGFR-2/Flt-1 and Western blotting with anti-VEGFR-2/Flt-1 and anti-PY (PY 99) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were performed as described (39Ilan N.

Detection was carried out using Pierce supersignal detection reagent (Pierce) with membrane exposure to Hyperfilm reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed on scanned images (Agfa Arcus II Scanner using Adobe Photoshop 5.0, Adobe Systems) using the BioMax Program (Eastman Kodak) on a Macintosh G4 computer. All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (p < 0.05). Immunocytochemistry—Cultured RBE4 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100. The primary antibodies used were anti-BDNF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., SC-546 at 1:200) and anti-TrkB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., SC-8316 at 1:200), anti-p75NTR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., SC-8317 at 1:200). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. CY3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., Bar Harbor, ME) was used as secondary antibody. Images were taken using a Zeiss research microscope equipped with a SPOT camera. Images were collected using Photoshop 5.0 on a Macintosh G4 computer. FACS Analysis of Apoptosis—FACS analysis of cultured, transfected bEnd-WT cells was performed as described previously (33Graesser D. Solowiej A. Bruckner M. Osterweil E. Juedes A. Davis S. Ruddle N.H. Engelhardt B. Madri J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Propidium iodide and Annexin V (BD Biosciences) were used to assess apoptotic cells. BD FACStation Software for Mac OSX was used to analyze the results, and Statview Software was used to determine significance. BDNF Expression Is Induced by Hypoxia in Vivo in the Microvasculature of the Central Nervous System and Is Expressed by RBE4 Cells and Induced in These Cells by Hypoxia in Vitro—Imunohistochemical staining of cortical sections of pups reared in normoxia (Nx) and hypoxia (Hx) revealed increased expression of BDNF protein, primarily in the microvasculature Fig. 1, A-D). We then performed immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the expression of BDNF on RBE4 cells. We also performed Western blotting on RBE4 cell lysates. We determined that RBE4 cells expressed BDNF under baseline (normoxic (Nx)) culture conditions. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions (hypoxic (Hx)) BDNF expression was found to be increased in both RBE4 cells and astrocytes (data not shown) using both immunofluorescence and Western blotting methods (n = 5; p < 0.03) (Fig. 1, E-H). BDNF was localized in essentially all RBE4 cells, and its expression was noted to be significantly increased under hypoxic culture conditions. RBE4 Cells Form Tubes and Sprouts in Collagen Gels, Which Are Enhanced by Recombinant BDNF but Blocked by Soluble, Recombinant TrkB—RBE4 cells placed in three-dimensional matrices of collagen type I gel and cultured for 6 days cluster to form multicellular cysts, from which elongated tube-like processes extend (32Chow J. Ogunshola O. Fan S.Y. Li Y. Ment L.R. Madri J.A. Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous recombinant BDNF stimulated increased tube formation in cultures (Fig. 2, compare A and B), while addition of recombinant, soluble TrkB (which sequesters BDNF) acted to inhibit the cyst and tube formation of RBE4 cells (Fig. 2, compare C with A and B). When cultured under hypoxic conditions, tube formation of RBE4 cells was reduced compared with that of normoxic cultures (Fig. 2, compare D and A). As noted in normoxic cultures, treatment with exogenous BDNF stimulated tube formation (Fig. 2E), and treatment with soluble, recombinant TrkB significantly reduced cyst and tube formation (Fig. 2F). Fig. 2G represents a quantitation analysis of these studies. Similar results were obtained when bEnd-WT cells were used. Representative fields of bEnd-WT cells cultured on Matrigel coatings under normoxic conditions in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml rBDNF or 2.0 μg/ml rTrkB are illustrated in Fig. 2, H-J. Note the increased amount of tube formation in the presence of rBDNF and the decreased amount of tube formation in the presence of rTrkB. Quantitation of bEnd-WT cell tube formation (Fig. 2I) in normoxic conditions in the absence or presence of rBDNF or rTrkB revealed a robust increase in tube formation in the presence of rBDNF and a marked decrease in tube formation when rTrkB was added to the cultures. TrkB Is Expressed by and Activated by BDNF in RBE4 Cells—To determine whether TrkB is expressed on RBE4 cells, we performed Western blot analyses of lysates of RBE4 cells derived from normoxic and hypoxic cultures. Western blotting illustrated the presence of TrkB in RBE4 cell lysates, and overall, protein levels of TrkB remained unchanged in response to hypoxic stimulation (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the TrkB present in these brain-derive endothelial cells is activated, we performed Western bolts using anti-pTrkB followed by Western blotting analysis using anti-TrkB. We found that a fraction of TrkB was tyrosinephosphorylated under base-line culture conditions, and phosphorylated TrkB levels were increased following the addition of exogenous BDNF (Fig. 3B). Additionally, treatment of RBE4 cultures with recombinant, soluble TrkB resulted in a significant reduction of phosphorylated TrkB compared with the control (normoxic) cultures. Similar results were observed under hypoxic conditions. These results suggest that TrkB expressed on RBE4 cells is activated by endogenous and exogenous BDNF. Akt, but Not Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase, Activation Is Associated with BDNF-mediated RBE4 Cell Survival in Vitro—To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this BDNF-mediated endothelial cell survival and tube formation in this culture system, we assessed the activation states of Akt and ERK1/2, members of two signaling pathways known to be involved in mediating endothelial survival and tube formation (32Chow J. Ogunshola O. Fan S.Y. Li Y. Ment L.R. Madri J.A. Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 40Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylated ERK was significantly increased by hypoxia but not following treatment of exogenous BDNF or soluble, recombinant TrkB (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the level of serine-phosphorylated Akt was significantly increased following treatment with BDNF under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4A). In addition, treatment with soluble, recombinant TrkB reduced the levels of phosphorylated Akt in normoxic and hypoxic cultures (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that Akt is activated following BDNF engagement and activation of TrkB and this pathway may be in part responsible for mediating the survival of these endothelial cells. To confirm the role of Akt activation in mediating brain-derived endothelial survival bEnd-WT, cells were infected with a dominant negative HA-tagged Akt construct (Akt-AAA) or a β-galactosidase-containing vector and apoptotic levels determined following normal culture conditions, serum starvation, and BDNF treatment. While a base-line low apoptotic level was noted in cells infected with the β-galactosidase containing vector with and without addition of exogenous BDNF (approximately 10.6% ± 1.3%), high apoptotic levels were observed in the β-galactosidase vector-infected cells cultured under serum starvation (17.3%). In contrast, cells infected with the dominant negative Akt-AAA construct exhibited high apoptotic rates in the absence (approximately 17.3% ± 2%) and presence (approximately 20.5% ± 2%) of exogenous BDNF (Fig. 4C). These results lend additional support to the concept that Akt is activated following BDNF engagement, and activation of TrkB and this pathway may be in part responsible for mediating the survival of these endothelial cells. Exogenous BDNF Blunted Activation of Caspase 3, while Soluble, Recombinant TrkB Induced Activation of Caspase 3 in RBE4 Cells—Additional studies revealed that BDNF modulated caspase 3 cleavage. Exogenous BDNF induced tube formation and rescued the cells from hypoxic insult. Under normoxic conditions, cleaved caspase 3 expression was decreased significantly by addition of exogenous BDNF and was increased following treatment with recombinant soluble TrkB (Fig. 5). Culture of RBE4 cells under hypoxic conditions induced activation of caspase 3; however, cleaved caspase 3 levels were significantly decreased following the addition of exogenous BDNF to hypoxic cultures. As noted above, soluble, recombinant TrkB further increased the activation of caspase 3 in hypoxic cultures (Fig. 5). These results suggest that BDNF modulates apoptosis in these brain-derived endothelial cells in part by regulating caspase 3 activity. Modulation of Cleaved Caspase 3 Expression by PI 3-Kinase and MEK Inhibitors on BDNF-treated Endothelial Cells under Hypoxia—To further determine the specific signaling pathways involved in the BDNF-induced inhibition of apoptosis and inhibition of caspase 3 activation, a pharmacological approach was taken. Namely, chemical inhibitors of either MEK (PD98059, 20 μm) or PI 3-kinase (LY240002 and wortmannin, 20 μm (data not shown)) were added daily for 6 days to RBE4 cultures. Under normoxic conditions, 20 μm LY240002, but not PD98059, significantly increased the levels of cleaved caspase 3 in cultures treated with BDNF (Fig. 6). Under hypoxic conditions, these PI 3-kinase inhibitors, but not the MEK inhibitor, also increased the levels of cleaved caspase 3 significantly in cultures treated with BDNF (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is involved in the BDNF-mediated modulation of RBE4 cell caspase activation and survival behavior.

Here, we observed a marked inefficiency in exogenous presentation of epitopes derived from signal sequences in mouse models. These data indicate that certain virus- and tumor-associated antigens may not be detected by CD8 + T cells because of impaired cross-priming.

In an animal model of NEC, we determined that intestinal restitution was significantly impaired compared with control animals.

Strikingly, endotoxin treatment significantly inhibited intestinal restitution, as measured by impaired IEC-6 cell migration across a scraped wound. Lipopolysaccharide was found to increase RhoA activity in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner, leading to an increase in phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and an enhanced number of focal adhesions. Importantly, endotoxin caused a progressive, RhoA-dependent increase in cell matrix tension/contractility, which correlated with the observed impairment in enterocyte migration.

Transcription is coupled spatially and temporally to the capping of the pre-mRNA at the 5′-end, splicing, and 3′-end formation. The mature 3′-ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs are generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary transcript followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail to the upstream cleavage product (for reviews see Refs. 1Wahle E. Rüegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Colgan D.F. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In mammals, these reactions are catalyzed by a large multicomponent complex that is assembled in a cooperative manner on specific cis-acting sequence elements in the pre-mRNA. The cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) (3Jenny A. Hauri H.-P. Keller W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8183-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) recognizes the highly conserved hexanucleotide AAUAAA, whereas the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) (4MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6647-6654Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) binds a more degenerate GU- or U-rich element downstream of the poly(A) site. It has been suggested that in vivo CPSF and CstF may become associated with each other prior to pre-mRNA binding, recognizing the two elements in a concerted manner (5Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, the cleavage reaction requires mammalian cleavage factor I (CF Im), cleavage factor IIm (CF IIm), and poly(A) polymerase (PAP). After the first step of 3′-end processing, CPSF remains bound to the upstream cleavage fragment and tethers PAP to the 3′-end of the pre-mRNA (6Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the presence of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPN1), PAP elongates the poly(A) tail in a processive manner (6Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These factors are both necessary and sufficient to reconstitute cleavage and polyadenylation in vitro. However, the other proteins involved in either transcription, such as the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, or capping (nuclear cap-binding complex) and splicing (U2AF65) have been shown to greatly enhance the efficiency of the first step of the reaction (7Flaherty S.M.

Reconstitution of CF Im activity with recombinant proteins suggests that CF Im is a heterodimer consisting of the 25-kDa subunit and one of the larger polypeptides (11Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All of the three larger proteins appear to be highly related in their amino acid sequence. Moreover, all of the CF Im subunits are only present in metazoan organisms. The primary sequence of the 25-kDa polypeptide contains a NUDIX motif (12Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the 68-kDa protein has a domain organization that is reminiscent of spliceosomal SR proteins. Members of the SR family of splicing factors contain one or more N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that function in sequence-specific RNA binding and a C-terminal domain rich in alternating arginine and serine residues, referred to as RS domain, which is required for protein-protein interactions with other RS domains (13Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In the 68-kDa protein, the RRM and the RS-like domain are separated by a region with high proline content (47%). SR proteins bound to specific RNA sequence elements are thought to recruit key splicing factors, thus enhancing the recognition of splice sites and controlling splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner (for review see Ref. 14Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that preincubation of the RNA substrate with CF Im reduces the lag-phase of the cleavage reaction (11Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the binding of this factor to the pre-mRNA may be an early step in the assembly of the 3′-end-processing complex, such that CF Im could have a role similar to that of SR proteins in spliceosome assembly. Recent SELEX experiments identified a related set of sequences within the 3′-untranslated region of the pre-mRNA of its 68-kDa subunit to which CF Im preferentially binds (15Brown K.M. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1467-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the analysis of the functional domains of the 25- and 68-kDa subunits of CF Im. To this end, we generated several deletion and point mutants of the two subunits. We expressed wild type and mutant proteins in heterologous systems and analyzed the purified proteins for protein-protein interactions and for RNA binding. We found that the 25-kDa subunit of CF Im interacts not only with PAP (16Kim H. Lee Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but also with PABPN1. Although the amino acid composition of this subunit does not display a known RNA recognition motif, CF Im25 binds to RNA. Surprisingly, despite having an RRM, CF Im68 does not bind very strongly to RNA but requires its RRM for interaction with the 25-kDa protein instead. A yeast two-hybrid screen with the RS-like domain of CF Im68 identified members of the SR family of splicing factors, suggesting that CF Im may contribute to the coordination of splicing and 3′-end formation. Furthermore, we investigated the subcellular localization of CF Im. We found that CF Im subunits are localized to the nucleus and accumulate within a few bright foci that partially overlap with paraspeckles (17Fox A.H. Lam Y.W. Leung A.K. Lyon C.E. Andersen J. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Finally, we report that the RS-like domain is sufficient for targeting the protein to the nucleus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by Microsynth or MWG. The sequences were as follows: GST-25-(1–80 sense), 5′-GGGATTACATATGTCTGTGGTACCGCCCAATC-3′; GST-25-(1–80 antisense), 5′-GCGGGATCCTCATACAGTCCTCCTCATTC-3′; GST-25-(81–160 sense), 5′-GGGATTACATATGGAAGGGGTTCTGATTG-3′; GST-25-(81–160 antisense), 5′-GCGGGATCCTCAATATGGATACTGAGGAG-3′; GST-25-(161–227 sense), 5′-GGGATTACATATGATTCCTGCACATATTAC-3′; GST-25-(161–227 antisense), 5′-GCGGGATCCTCAGTTGTAAATAAAATTG-3′; 5′-U2AF65, 5′-ACGCGGATCCATGTCGGACTTCGACGAG-3′;3′-U2AF65, 5′-ATCCGCTCGAGCTACCAGAAGTCCCGGCGG-3′; 5′-U2AF35, 5′-ACGCGGATCCATGGCGGAGTATCTGGC-3′; 3′-U2AF35, 5′-ATCCGCTCGAGTCAGAATCGCCCAGATC-3′; GST-68, 5′-RS, 5′-GAACGCGGATCCCTGCAAGAACGCCATTGAG-3′; 3′-RS, 5′-ATCCGCCTCGAGCTTCTAACGATGACGATATTC-3′; 5′-RRM, 5′-GATCCCCCGGGAATGGCGGACGGCGTGGA-3′; 3′-RRM, 5′-CTTCGGGATCCCAGGAAATCTGTCCCCACC-3′; 3′-Pro, 5′-CTTCGGGATCCCACTCAATGGCGTTCTTGC-3′; BclI (5′-end), 5′-TGGGCATGATCAGATAGA-3′; Bsu36I (3′-end), 5′-GACCTAAGGGTGGACG-3′; RNP2 sense, 5′-ATTGCATTATATATTGTAGTTCTAACATGGTGGAC-3′; RNP2 antisense, 5′-GTCCACCATGTTAGAACTACAATATATAATGCAA-3′; ΔRS sense, 5′-AACAGTGGCATGCCTACATC-3′; ΔRS antisense, 5′-CACCCAAGCTTCTACTCAATTCCATGAAGGCA-3′; ythSRs, 5′-CACCGGAATTCGAGTCCAAGTCTTATGG-3′; ythSRas, 5′-TAACCGCTCGAGCTAACGATGACGATATTC-3′; 5′-TraX, 5′-AGTCTAGAAGCGACAGCGGCGAGCA-3′; 3′-TraB, 5′-ACGGATCCTTAATAGCGACGAGGTGAGT-3′; 5′-9G8X, 5′-AGTCTAGATCGCGTTACGGGCGGTA-3′; and 3′-9G8B, 5′-ACGGATCCTCAGTCCATTCTTTCAGGA-C-3′.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid library screening and analysis were performed as described in the HybriZAP-2.1 two-hybrid protocol provided by Stratagene with the yeast strain YRG-2. The C-terminal charged domain of CF Im68 (aa 481–551) was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotides ythSRs and ythSRas and then cloned into the EcoRI and SmaI restriction sites of the yeast vector pBD-Gal4. This construct was used to screen a pre-made HeLa cell cDNA library that was cloned into the yeast vector pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene). Reporter genes in the HybriZAP-2.1 vector system are β-galactosidase (lacZ) and histidine (HIS3). The ability to express the reporter HIS3 gene was tested on SC plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine but containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. β-Galactosidase activity was detected by filter lift assays (18Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Library plasmids from positive colonies were recovered in Escherichia coli and sequenced.Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—For expression of recombinant GST fusion proteins in E. coli, the sequence of interest was cloned into the polylinker region of the pGDV expression plasmid (19Dichtl B. Keller W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The coding region of CF Im25 was inserted into the NcoI and XhoI sites. To express fragments of the 25-kDa subunit of CF Im, the open reading frame was divided into three regions corresponding to amino acids 1–80, 81–160, and 161–227 that were amplified by PCR with the respective primers. The GST-25 mutant containing an internal deletion corresponding to amino acids 140–168 was obtained by digestion of the cDNA with Tth111I and Bsu36I, filling-in of the extremities, and religation. To obtain recombinant GST-U2AF subunits, the entire U2AF65 and U2AF35 open reading frames were amplified by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library with the oligonucleotides 5′-U2AF65 and 3′-U2AF65 and 5′-U2AF35 and 3′-U2AF35, respectively. The fragments were cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences).The CF Im68 mutants RS, RRM, RRM/Pro, and Pro/RS were generated by PCR with the respective oligonucleotides, cloned into pGemTeasy (Promega), and sequenced by Centro Richerche Interdipartimentale Biotecnologie Innovative (Università di Padova). The fragments were excised with XmaI and BamHI and cloned into pGDV that had been linearized with the same enzymes.E. coli BL21 (DE3) were transformed with these plasmids, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Whereas GST-U2AF65, GST-25, and its deletion mutants were present in high amounts in the soluble fraction, soluble full-length GST-59 and GST-68 could neither be recovered from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS nor from Epicurian Coli BL21 codon plus (Stratagene). In contrast, the expression of several mutant derivatives was successful. Although most of the induced proteins were in inclusion bodies, a significant amount was present in the soluble fraction. The proteins in the supernatant were bound to GST-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions.Expression of wild type CF Im68 in baculovirus was achieved with the BAC-To-BAC baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The entire coding region together with 162 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated region and eight additional adenosines was inserted into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pFASTBAC-Hta. Recombinant viruses were prepared by transforming the plasmid into DH10BAC-competent cells and inducing the formation of the recombinant bacmids. High molecular weight DNA was then prepared from selected E. coli clones, and 1–2 μg were used to transfect 1 × 106Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. After 2–3 days, the supernatant was recovered and ∼1 ml of the virus was used to infect 2 × 106 cells that had been seeded on a 10-ml plate. The plates were again incubated at 27 °C for 3–4 days. At this stage, the cells were analyzed for protein expression by Western blot analysis. 2 ml of the resulting virus was added to a 30-ml suspension culture of Sf9 cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 4–5 days, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in approximately two packed volumes of lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged after incubation on ice for 30 min, and proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography.GST Pull-down Experiments—0.5–1 μg of purified GST-25 protein was incubated with ∼100 μg of either HeLa cell nuclear extract or whole cell extracts prepared from transfected HeLa or human embryonic kidney 293 cells for 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads then were added and incubated for an additional 2 h. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of IPP150. Proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins then were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and the membrane was probed with anti-CF Im68 polyclonal antibodies or anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen).[35S]Methionine (Amersham Biosciences) was used to label proteins in a transcription/translation system (Promega). Purified GST or GST fusion proteins (∼500 ng) were incubated with in vitro translated proteins in 30 μl of total reaction volume. Volumes were adjusted with GST buffer (75 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 10 nm reduced glutathione, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added and the volume was adjusted to 500 μl with 1× PBS, 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Incubation was continued for 1 h, and the resin was washed three times with IPP150. Proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 2× Laemmli buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography.CF Im subunits were cloned into the BlueScript vector (KS, Stratagene), which allows in vitro transcription/translation with the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The open reading frame of the 25-kDa subunit was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI, respectively (pBS25). The open reading frames of CF Im59 and CF Im68 were inserted into the EcoRI site of BlueScript (Stratagene). The CF Im68 mutant that carries two point mutations in the RNP2 motif (G86V,N87V) was generated with two consecutive PCR reactions with primers BclI (5′-end), Bsu36I (3′-end), RNP2 sense, and RNP2 antisense. Two internal BclI and Bsu36I restriction sites were used to substitute the wild type sequence with the PCR fragment carrying the mutations.The ΔSR mutant was generated by PCR with pBS68 and primers that contained the SphI (ΔRS sense) and HindIII (ΔRS antisense) restriction sites. The amplified fragment was inserted into pBS68 that had been digested with SphI and HindIII and resulted in a C-terminally truncated version lacking aa 482–551 of the full-length protein.RNA Binding Assays—GST pull-down experiments were adapted from Dichtl and Keller (19Dichtl B. Keller W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Approximately, 500 ng of GST fusion protein were incubated with 30–100 fmol of labeled RNA under cleavage conditions (20Barabino S.M. Hübner W. Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1703-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 30 °C. GST-Sepharose was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with 1× PBS, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in the proteinase K mixture. After 30 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.For UV cross-linking experiments, 20-μl reactions were set up on ice as follows. To 8 μl of premixture (2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 2% polyethylene glycol, 0.4 mm cordycepin, 5 units/μl RNA Guard, 0.025 μg/μl creatine kinase, 1.5 mm MgCl2), either 1 pmol of CF Im25/68 and CF Im68, 5 pmol of CF Im25, or 4 pmol of purified CF Im was incubated with 200 fmol of labeled L3 pre-mRNA. These proteins had been expressed in E. coli and assembled in vitro as described previously (11Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 75 mm potassium acetate and 200 fmol of RNA substrate (resuspended in water) were added, and volumes were adjusted with buffer E. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and exposed to UV light (2 × 250 mJ, UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene) in a microtiter plate at room temperature. Samples were treated with 5 ng/μl RNase A (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed on x-ray film.Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/60-mm dish containing ∼60% confluent cells with the calcium phosphate method. The epitope-tagged 9G8 and hTra2β expression plasmids were constructed by amplifying the cDNAs isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen with specific primers and subcloning the resulting PCR products as a XbaI-BamHI fragment into pCGTHCFFLT7 expression vector (21Wilson A. Peterson M. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2445-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Amplification was performed with Amplitaq Gold (Roche Applied Science) and oligonucleotides (5′-9G8X, 3′-9G8B, 5′-TraX, and 3′-TraB) purchased from MWG. Construction of pCG-SRp20 was described previously (22Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were either plated on glass coverslips and transfected or distributed after transfection on polylysinecoated coverslips. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. Cells were incubated 1 h at 37 °C with the primary antibody, washed three times with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and again incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the appropriate secondary antibody.For localization of endogenous CF Im, polyclonal antibodies raised against CF Im68 and CF Im25 (11Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were used at a 1:500 and 1:200 dilution, respectively. Colocalization studies of GFP fusion proteins and endogenous SRp20 protein were performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) used as a 1:100 dilution and detected with a Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, 1:1000) secondary antibody. SC35 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 1:2000), and endogenous CPSF was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (3Jenny A. Hauri H.-P. Keller W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8183-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) used as a 1:1000 dilution.GFP expression plasmids were constructed by cloning DNA fragments encoding full-length and mutant CF Im68 into pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech). GFP-68 was obtained by digesting pBS68 with BamHI and SalI and inserting the two fragments that are generated (BamHI/SalI and SalI/SalI) into pEGFP-C1 linearized with BglII and SalI. GFP-68 deletion mutants were excised from the corresponding GST constructs with XmaI and BamHI (filled) and cloned into pEGFP-C1 linearized with XmaI and XbaI (filled).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells was carried out with a Nikon YFL microscope equipped with a ×60, 1.4 oil Plan-Apochromat objective or a Leica DM IRE2 confocal microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser (488 nm) to excite GFP fluorescence and a helium/neon laser (543 nm) to excite the Alexa 594 fluorescence and a ×63, 1.4 oil HCX Plan-Apochromat objective. For double-labeling experiments, images from the same focal plane were sequentially recorded in different channels and superimposed.RESULTSCF Im68 Interacts with the 25-kDa Protein via Its RRM— Four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 25, 59, 68, and 72 kDa copurified with CF Im activity. Previous studies have shown that the 25- and 68-kDa proteins are sufficient to reconstitute CF Im activity in vitro. It has been suggested that CF Im forms a heterodimer composed of the 25-kDa subunit and one of the larger polypeptides, which seem to be related as they are recognized by the same antibody that was raised against the 68-kDa protein (11Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To verify that the larger CF Im subunits associate with the 25-kDa protein, we expressed the 25-kDa protein as a GST fusion (GST-25) in E. coli and incubated it with HeLa cell nuclear extract. Western blot analysis with anti-CF Im68 antibody detected all three larger CF Im subunits (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This result was confirmed by incubating GST-25 with CF Im68 and CF Im59 that had been transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). In addition, CF Im25 appeared to interact weakly with itself (Fig. 1B, lane 9), which might indicate that heterodimers bind to each other to form larger CF Im complexes. The experiments were carried out in the presence of RNase A, and the interactions thus were not mediated through RNA.Since no known protein-protein interaction motif has so far been identified in the sequence of the 25-kDa polypeptide, we wished to map the region responsible for its binding to CF Im68. For this purpose, the fragments of the 25-kDa protein were expressed as GST fusions in E. coli (a schematic representation of the different mutants is shown in Fig. 1C). Pull-down experiments performed with the GST-25 fragments and in vitro transcribed/translated CF Im68 only detected association with the full-length GST-25 (Fig. 1C, lane 3). None of the deletion constructs was able to interact with CF Im68, suggesting that intact 25-kDa protein is required for the stable binding of the two proteins.CF Im25 Interacts with PAP and PABPN1—The binding of CPSF and CstF to conserved sequence elements in the pre-mRNA located upstream and downstream of the poly(A) site mediates specific recognition of the polyadenylation site. As has been shown previously, the association of CF Im with the substrate leads to a faster assembly of the 3′-end-processing complex (11Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, CF Im may help to recruit CPSF and CstF to the pre-mRNA. To test this hypothesis, we tested in GST pull-down experiments for the direct interaction of CF Im with CPSF and CstF. However, our results with GST-25 suggest only weak association with in vitro transcribed/translated CstF50, CstF77, and CPSF160 and no detectable interaction with the other CstF and CPSF subunits (results not shown). Therefore, if the recruitment of CstF and CPSF is facilitated by CF Im, this does not appear to be mediated by a direct interaction with the smallest subunit of CF Im.An interaction between CF Im25 and PAP has been described previously (16Kim H. Lee Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The authors isolated the 25-kDa subunit of CF Im in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the C-terminal domain of mouse PAP (aa 472–739) as a bait. In addition to PAP, we found that GST-25 interacts with PABPN1 (Fig. 2A, lane 8). A deletion of the C-terminal 226 residues of PAP did not affect its binding to GST-25 (Fig. 2A, PAPΔC, lane 5). Incubation of GST-25 with HeLa cell nuclear extract and subsequent Western blot analysis confirmed the interaction of GST-25 with PAP and PABPN1 (results not shown).Fig. 2The central region of CF Im25 is required for the interaction with PAP and PABPN1.A, GST-25 directly interacts with PAP and PABPN1. GST (lanes 3, 6, and 9) or GST-25 (lanes 2, 5, and 8) was preincubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled PAP, PAPΔC, or PABPN1 proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 10% of the input is shown in lanes 1, 4, and 7. B, residues 81–160 of CF Im25 are sufficient for interaction with PABPN1. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled PABPN1 was incubated with the indicated purified GST fusion proteins (GST-25, 1–160, 81–227, 1–80, 81–160, or 161–227) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 10% of the input is shown in lane 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDo"
https://openalex.org/W1969183021,"The formation of disulfide is essential for the folding, activity, and stability of many proteins secreted by Gram-negative bacteria. The disulfide oxidoreductase, DsbA, introduces disulfide bonds into proteins exported from the cytoplasm to periplasm. In pathogenic bacteria, DsbA is required to process virulence determinants for their folding and assembly. In this study, we examined the role of the Dsb enzymes in Salmonella pathogenesis, and we demonstrated that DsbA, but not DsbC, is required for the full expression of virulence in a mouse infection model of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Salmonella strains carrying a dsbA mutation showed reduced function mediated by type III secretion systems (TTSSs) encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2). To obtain a more detailed understanding of the contribution of DsbA to both SPI-1 and SPI-2 TTSS function, we identified a protein component of the SPI-2 TTSS apparatus affected by DsbA. Although we found no substrate protein for DsbA in the SPI-1 TTSS apparatus, we identified SpiA (SsaC), an outer membrane protein of SPI-2 TTSS, as a DsbA substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis of the two cysteine residues present in the SpiA protein resulted in the loss of SPI-2 function in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we provided evidence that a second disulfide oxidoreductase, SrgA, also oxidizes SpiA. Analysis of in vivo mixed infections demonstrated that a Salmonella dsbA srgA double mutant strain was more attenuated than either single mutant, suggesting that DsbA acts in concert with SrgA in vivo.

The secretion of proteins is a prerequisite for interactions between pathogenic bacteria and their hosts. In Gram-negative bacteria, several types of secretion pathways for proteins that are important for such bacterial interactions with host cells have been identified. The type I secretion mechanism requires three accessory proteins to form a transmembrane structure, which includes a channel spanning the inner and outer membranes. Proteins secreted by this pathway have an uncleaved C-terminal secretion signal responsible for directing the secretion of protein (1Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 2Koronakis V. Andersen C. Hughes C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion of proteins by the type II secretion pathway (also known as the “general secretion pathway”) involves two different steps. Proteins are first translocated through the inner membrane via signal peptides that interact with the Sec-dependent pathway, and the proteins are then transported across the outer membrane by either of several different terminal branches of the process (4Sandkvist M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 5Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type III secretion system (TTSS) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; CI, competitive index; HA, hemagglutinin; cfu, colony-forming units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DTT, dithiothreitol; SIF, Salmonella-induced filament. functions as a pathway for secretion across bacterial membranes and for the translocation of secreted proteins across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells (6Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type IV secretion system also translocates proteins in a single step from the cytoplasm to the cytosol of a host cell (7Christie P.J. Vogel J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Proteins secreted via the type V secretion system are autotransporter proteins, which are characterized by a unifying structure possessing an N-terminal signal sequence and a pore-forming C-terminal domain (8Henderson I.R. Cappello R. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Henderson I.R. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In all of these secretion pathways, many of the proteins residing in or transiting through the periplasmic space acquire disulfide bonds after their translocation across the inner membrane. The formation of disulfide bonds is a key step in the folding of many secreted and membrane proteins. In Escherichia coli, disulfide bond formation is catalyzed by the Dsb proteins (10Kadokura H.

DsbA is a 21-kDa periplasmic protein with a CXXC motif in its active site, and it interacts with reduced substrate proteins, catalyzing the oxidation of their cysteine residues to disulfide bonds (11Bardwell J.C.

These proteins reshuffle misfolded multiple disulfide bonds (17Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DsbA plays a central role in periplasmic protein folding. A dsbA mutant of an E. coli strain exhibits numerous in vivo phenotypes, including a loss of motility, an absence of alkaline phosphatase activity, sensitivity to benzylpenicillin and dithiothreitol, and resistance to phage M13, because of severe defects in disulfide bond formation in proteins requiring these processes (11Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 22Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, dsbA-null mutants have a decreased growth rate in minimal media, as compared with the wild-type strain, and show mucoid colonies when grown on plates in minimal media (11Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Although DsbC mutants are defective at disulfide bond formation, a mutation in dsbC does not display any obvious phenotype, except for a defect in the expression of dsbC substrates that contain multiple disulfide bonds (17Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In many pathogenic bacteria, DsbA is involved in pathogenicity through the catalysis of oxidative protein folding in virulence determinants. These virulence factors include the following: the cholera toxin of Vibrio cholerae (23Yu J. Webb H. Hirst T.R. Mol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20524-20532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbA is also required for the proper function of the TTSS in Yersinia pestis (31Jackson M.W. Plano G.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5126-5130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Shigella flexneri (32Watarai M. Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Y. pestis, a mutation in dsbA results in the unstable expression of an outer membrane protein, YscC, that constitutes the TTSS apparatus, which leads to the decreased translocation of Yop proteins. Substitution of cysteine residues in YscC reproduced all of the phenotypes seen in a dsbA mutation, suggesting that DsbA catalyzes the YscC as a substrate (31Jackson M.W. Plano G.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5126-5130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative and facultative intracellular bacterium that is pathogenic to humans and animals; this pathogen is known to cause a broad spectrum of diseases such as gastroenteritis and bacteremia, as well as typhoid fever. The nature and severity of infection by Salmonella is generally dependent upon both the serovar and the host species. Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers result from systemic infection with human-adapted serovars such as S. enterica serovar Typhi and S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A. In contrast, infection with the broad host range-adapted serovar S. enterica serovar Typhimurium usually causes gastroenteritis in humans but produces a systemic infection similar to typhoid fever in susceptible mice. S. enterica utilize two different virulence-associated TTSS, encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2, respectively), for different stages of pathogenesis. The SPI-1 TTSS is required for the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and the induction of the inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa (6Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Galan J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 53-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 35Kaniga K. Tucker S. Trollinger D. Galan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3965-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In contrast, SPI-2 TTSS is required for intracellular survival in macrophages and for systemic infection in the mouse model (36Ochman H. Soncini F.C. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7800-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 37Shea J.E. Hensel M. Gleeson C. Holden D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The complete genome sequence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 has revealed the presence of Dsb protein homologues (39McClelland M. Sanderson K.E. Spieth J. Clifton S.W. Latreille P. Courtney L. Porwollik S. Ali J. Dante M. Du F. Hou S. Layman D. Leonard S. Nguyen C. Scott K. Holmes A. Grewal N. Mulvaney E. Ryan E. Sun H. Florea L. Miller W. Stoneking T. Nhan M. Waterston R. Wilson R.K. Nature. 2001; 413: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Southern hybridization analysis has also demonstrated the wide distribution of a dsbA gene among Salmonella serovars (40Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dsbA gene cloned from the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium can restore the dsbA– phenotype in an E. coli strain (40Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that Salmonella disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA is functional, although the enzymatic activity of Salmonella DsbA seems to be different from that of E. coli (40Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a number of proteins affected by the dsbA mutation have been identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with comparison of periplasmic proteins expressed in the wild-type and dsbA mutant strains in S. enterica serovar Typhi (41Agudo D. Mendoza M.T. Castanares C. Nombela C. Rotger R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the presence of disulfide bonds in these proteins has not been determined. Thus, the membrane and secreted proteins, the folding of which is affected by DsbA in Salmonella, remain still obscure. In the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the Salmonella DsbA paralogue SrgA, encoded on the 94-kb virulence plasmid, functions as a disulfide oxidoreductase, whereas the enzymatic activity of SrgA is less efficient than that of DsbA when E. coli alkaline phosphatase is used as a substrate (42Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SrgA specifically oxidizes the disulfide bond of PefA, the major structural subunit of the plasmid-encoded fimbriae Pef, and thus the disulfide oxidoreductase activity of SrgA is required for the assembly of Pef on the bacterial surface (42Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, SrgA activity is dependent upon the presence of functional DsbB (42Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that, similar to DsbA, SrgA is recycled to an active oxidized form by DsbB. Recently, it has been shown that a Salmonella strain that contains a mutation in dsbA is highly attenuated in a systemic infection of mice (43Ellermeier C.D. Slauch J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A Salmonella dsbA mutant strain has also shown decreased SPI-1 and SPI-2 TTSS function in terms of the translocation of effector proteins into mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells (43Ellermeier C.D. Slauch J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between DsbA and the component proteins of SPI-1 and SPI-2 TTSS has not yet been determined. Thus, in order to obtain a more detailed understanding of the role of DsbA in Salmonella pathogenesis, we characterized the effect of DsbA on the activity of both SPI-1 and SPI-2 TTSS, and we identified a protein component of the SPI-2 TTSS apparatus affected by DsbA. Although we found no substrate for DsbA in the SPI-1 TTSS apparatus, we identified SpiA (also referred as SsaC), an outer membrane protein of SPI-2 TTSS, as a DsbA substrate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a second disulfide oxidoreductase, SrgA, also oxidizes SpiA in vitro. An analysis of in vivo mixed infections showed that a dsbA srgA double mutant strain was more attenuated than either single mutant strain, suggesting that DsbA acts in concert with SrgA in vivo.

The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Table II. E. coli and Salmonella strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar under selection for resistance to ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml for plasmid-containing strains, 5 μg/ml for chromosomal integrants), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml), or streptomycin (50 μg/ml), as required. A previously described intracellular salts-based minimal medium with limiting magnesium (MgM, pH 5.8) was used to induce SPI-2 gene expression (44Beuzon C.R. Banks G. Deiwick J. Hensel M. Holden D.W.

The PCR products were cloned into TA cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega) in order to produce pGEM-dsbA and pGEM-dsbC, respectively. Plasmids pMW-dsbA and pAC-dsbA, used to complement the dsbA mutant strain, were constructed by inserting the BamHI-XhoI fragment containing the dsbA gene from pGEM-dsbA into the BamHI-SalI sites of pMW118 (Nippon Gene) and pACYC184 (New England Biolabs), respectively. The srgA gene was amplified from the 94-kb virulence plasmid of strain SL1344 using the primers srgA-FW and srgA-RV, and the PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy. The fragment was then subcloned into pMW119 (Nippon Gene) at the SacI and SphI sites in order to generate pMW-srgA. The spiA gene was amplified by PCR with the primers spiA-FW1 and spiA-RV1, and strain SL1344 genomic DNA was used as the template. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy, and the fragments were subcloned into pMW118 at the SacI and SphI sites in order to generate pMW-spiA. The SpiA point mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pGEM-sipA as a template and the respective oligonucleotides using the Quikchange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides C133S-1 and C133S-2, and C152S-1 and C152S-2 were used to replace cysteine residues with serine residues at positions 133 and 152 in the SpiA protein, respectively. The mutated plasmids were transformed into E. coli XL10-Gold supercompetent cells (Stratagene), and the presence of a respective mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids obtained were designated as pGEM-spiAC133S and pGEM-spiAC152S, respectively. To construct FLAG-tagged fusion proteins, the target genes were amplified by PCR using the following primers: sipB-FW and sipB-RV for sipB; sipC-FW and sipC-RV for sipC; sseB-FW and sseB-RV for sseB; invG-FW and invG-RV for invG; and spiA-FW2 and spiA-RV2 for spiA, spiAC133S, and spiAC152S. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and BamHI and were cloned into the XhoI-BglII site of pFLAG-CTC (Sigma). To construct the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged SseJ fusion protein, DNA fragment containing sseJ and its promoter region was amplified by PCR using sseJ-Pro and sseJ-RV. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI and was ligated to the same site of pMW118, yielding pTM21. To insert the HA epitope into the C-terminal SseJ, pTM21 was amplified by reverse PCR using the primers HA-R1 and HA-R2. The PCR product was digested with StuI and then self-ligated, yielding plasmid pTM22, which encodes the SseJ-HA fusion protein. Construction of Mutant Strains—Nonpolar mutants of dsbA and dsbC were constructed by allele exchange using the temperature- and sucrose-sensitive suicide vector pCACTUS (47Morona R. van den Bosch L. Manning P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A disruption mutation was created by the insertion of the SmaI-digested Kmr-encoding gene (kan) cassette from pUC18K (48Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) or promoterless cat gene into a unique EcoRV site in the coding region of dsbA and dsbC on pGEM-dsbA and pGEM-dsbC, respectively. The disrupted gene was then subcloned using SalI and SphI into similarly digested pCACTUS, and the resulting plasmid was introduced into strain SL1344 by electroporation for allele exchange mutagenesis, which was carried out as described previously (47Morona R. van den Bosch L. Manning P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Chromosomal mutations were verified by PCR and DNA sequencing analyses. For the construction of mutant strains expressing point-mutated SpiA proteins, the SacI-SphI fragments from pGEM-spiAC133S and pGEM-spiAC152S were subcloned into similarly digested pCACTUS, and each resulting plasmid was introduced into strain SL1344 by electroporation. The gene replacement of spiA to a point-mutated spiA was confirmed by DNA sequencing and by restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR-amplified segments with BamHI for spiAC135S and PvuII for spiAC152S. The ssaV mutant was constructed by the Red disruption system (49Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar). The primers used for this series were ssaV-red-FW and ssaV-red-RV. Strain SH100 carrying pKD46 was used for gene disruption, as described previously (49Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar). The disrupted genes were transferred by phage P22 transduction into strain SL1344. To construct lacZ transcriptional fusions, the DNA fragments containing the hilA, invF, and ssrA promoter regions were amplified by PCR using the primers hilA-Pro and"

This proxy shows a steady decrease in Earth's reflectance from 1984 to 2000, with a strong climatologically significant drop after 1995. From 2001 to 2003, only earthshine data are available, and they indicate a complete reversal of the decline. Understanding how the causes of these decadal changes are apportioned between natural variability, direct forcing, and feedbacks is fundamental to confidently assessing and predicting climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2039790417,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multigenic, congenital disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 newborns and is characterized by the absence of neural crest–derived enteric ganglia in the colon1. One of the primary genes affected in HSCR encodes the G protein–coupled endothelin receptor-B (EDNRB)2,3. The expression of Ednrb is required at a defined time period during the migration of the precursors of the enteric nervous system (ENS) into the colon4. In this study, we describe a conserved spatiotemporal ENS enhancer of Ednrb. This 1-kb enhancer is activated as the ENS precursors approach the colon, and partial deletion of this enhancer at the endogenous Ednrb locus results in pigmented mice that die postnatally from megacolon. We identified binding sites for SOX10, an SRY-related transcription factor associated with HSCR5, in the Ednrb ENS enhancer, and mutational analyses of these sites suggested that SOX10 may have multiple roles in regulating Ednrb in the ENS."
https://openalex.org/W2097476078,"Of the four known globin genes that exist in the fresh-water crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, several are individually induced by hypoxia, lending pale normoxic animals a visible red color when challenged by oxygen deprivation. The promoter regions of the <i>Daphnia</i> globin genes each contain numerous hypoxia response elements (HREs) as potential binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). <i>Daphnia</i> HIF, bound to human HRE sequences, was detected in extracts from hypoxic (red), but not normoxic (pale), animals. Taking advantage of the phylogenetically conserved HIF/HRE recognition, we employed heterologous transfections of HIF-expressing human and <i>Drosophila</i> cells to model HIF signaling in <i>Daphnia</i>. These experiments revealed that three functional HREs within the promoter of the <i>D. magna</i> globin-2 gene cooperate for maximal hypoxic induction of a downstream luciferase reporter gene. Two of these three <i>cis</i>-elements, at promoter positions -258 and -107, are able to specifically bind human, <i>Drosophila</i>, or <i>Daphnia</i> HIF complexes <i>in vitro</i>. The same two sites are also necessary for maximal induction of reporter transcription under low oxygen tension in the presence of either endogenous human or overexpressed <i>Drosophila</i> HIF proteins. The third motif of the globin-2 gene promoter, a CACGTG palindrome at position -146, functions as a docking site for an unknown constitutive transcription factor. In human cells, this -146 complex interferes with HIF occupancy at the adjacent -107 HRE and thus controls the extent of HIF-mediated hypoxic activation of the downstream target."
https://openalex.org/W2096648955,"Sea anemones are an important source of various biologically active peptides, and it is known that ATX-II from Anemonia sulcata slows sodium current inactivation. Using six different sodium channel genes (from Nav1.1 to Nav1.6), we investigated the differential selectivity of the toxins AFT-II (purified from Anthopleura fuscoviridis) and Bc-III (purified from Bunodosoma caissarum) and compared their effects with those recorded in the presence of ATX-II. Interestingly, ATX-II and AFT-II differ by only one amino acid (L36A) and Bc-III has 70% similarity. The three toxins induced a low voltage-activated persistent component primarily in the Nav1.3 and Nav1.6 channels. An analysis showed that the 18 dose-response curves only partially fit the hypothesized binding of Lys-37 (sea anemone toxin Anthopleurin B) to the Asp (or Glu) residue of the extracellular IV/S3-S4 loop in cardiac (or nervous) Na+ channels, thus suggesting the substantial contribution of some nearby amino acids that are different in the various channels. As these channels are atypically expressed in mammalian tissues, the data not only suggest that the toxicity is highly dependent on the channel type but also that these toxins and their various physiological effects should be considered prototype models for the design of new and specific pharmacological tools.

As these channels are atypically expressed in mammalian tissues, the data not only suggest that the toxicity is highly dependent on the channel type but also that these toxins and their various physiological effects should be considered prototype models for the design of new and specific pharmacological tools. As voltage-gated Na+ channels are responsible for the conduction of electrical impulses in most excitable tissues in the majority of animals (with the exception of nematodes), they have become important targets for the toxins of venomous animals from sea anemones to mollusks, scorpions, spiders, and even fishes. The peptides found in these venoms constitute various tools by means of which physiologists and pharmacologists can study the structure/function relationships of channel proteins in detail (1Cestèle S. Catteral W.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The α-subunits of voltage-gated Na+ channels (Nav1.x) have been divided into at least nine subtypes based on their tetrodotoxin binding, tissue expression, and amino acid sequences (2Catteral W.A. Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. The IUPHAR Compendium of Voltage-gated Ion Channels. IUPHAR Media, Leeds, United Kingdom2002Google Scholar). Interestingly, the genes for four isoforms (Nav1.1, 1The abbreviations used are: Nav1.1, α-subunits of voltage-gated Na+ channel isoform; ApB, Anthopleurin B. 1The abbreviations used are: Nav1.1, α-subunits of voltage-gated Na+ channel isoform; ApB, Anthopleurin B. Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.7) are located in human chromosome 2. Other genes (Nav1.5, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9) are located on chromosome 3, and Nav1.4 and Nav1.6 are located on chromosomes 17 and 12, respectively (2Catteral W.A. Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. The IUPHAR Compendium of Voltage-gated Ion Channels. IUPHAR Media, Leeds, United Kingdom2002Google Scholar). During their evolution, different animals have developed a set of cysteine-rich peptides capable of binding different extracellular sites of the channel protein. A fundamental question concerning the mechanism of action of these toxins is whether they act at a common receptor site in Na+ channels when exerting their different pharmacological effects or at distinct receptor sites in different Nav channels subtypes whose particular properties lead to these pharmacological differences (1Cestèle S. Catteral W.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the putative ability of some peptides to distinguish the different Na+ channels subtypes (from Nav1.1 to Nav1.6) either by differing biophysical effects or by differing potency or both. We used three sea anemone toxins, which have a range of sequence similarity, that were purified from different animals: the well known Anemonia sulcata ATX-II peptide (3Béress L. Béress R. Wunderer G. FEBS Lett. 1975; 50: 311-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the Anthopleura fuscoviridis AFT-II peptide (4Sunahar S. Muramoto K. Tenma K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and the Bunodosoma caissarum Bc-III peptide (5Malpezzi E.L.A. Freitas J.C. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). They are all 47-48-aa-long and have three disulfide bonds; however, interestingly, two peptides (ATX-II and AFT-II) differ by only one amino acid, whereas Bc-III has only a 70% identity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the characterization of sea anemone toxins against such a wide range of sodium channel subtypes. Animal and Venom Collection—30 specimens of B. caissarum were collected during periods of low tide-free diving at different rocky shores of the São Sebastião Channel on the northern coast of São Paulo, Brazil. The animals were transported live and starved in an aquarium for 24 h to eliminate any gastrovascular contents. The venom was obtained directly by means of nematocyst discharge as described by Malpezzi et al. (5Malpezzi E.L.A. Freitas J.C. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein content was estimated by means of absorbance at 280 nm and the BCA method (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purification Procedures—The B. caissarum venom was fractionated in a Sephadex G-50 column (1.9 × 131 cm, Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted with 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) at room temperature (5Malpezzi E.L.A. Freitas J.C. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Lanio M.E. Morera V. Alvarez C. Tejuca M. Gómez T. Pazos F. Besada V. Martínez D. Huerta V. Padrón G. Chávez M.A. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At each run, ∼1.0-2.0 g of the lyophilized material (corresponding to ∼200 mg of protein content) was dissolved in 15 ml of the same buffer and injected into the column. Fractions of 10 ml volume were collected using an automatic Fraction Collector Frac-100 (Amersham Biosciences), absorbance (280 nm) was monitored by a Spectra/Chrom Flow Thru UV monitor/controller (Spectrum), and the elution profile was recorded by a Spectra/Chrom 1 channel recorder (Spectrum). Each corresponding peak was pooled and lyophilized, and the neurotoxic fraction (peak IIIa) was further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. After being diluted in Milli-Q water (Millipore Inc.), the same fraction was injected into an Ultrasphere octadecylsilyl column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Beckman Inc.) coupled to a Shimadzu high performance liquid chromatography purification system consisting of a UV-visible detector (SPD-10A VP), pumps (LC-10AD VP), and a system controller (SCL-10A VP, Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The peaks were obtained using a linear gradient of 5-50% buffer B containing 90% CH3CN and 10% buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) over 25 min. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and UV was monitored at 214 nm. Pure Bc-III was obtained by means of repurification using the same column under 28% buffer B and at a higher flow rate (1.2 ml/min). The Bc-III and AFT-II mass spectra were obtained using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass) in Qq-orthogonal time-of-flight configuration. An Ettan matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/Pro mass spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences) was also used with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Both machines were operated in positive mode. The amino acid sequence of Bc-III was confirmed by means of N-terminal determination using automatic Edman degradation and a PPSQ/230 gas-phase sequencer (Shimadzu Corp.). A search for peptide homology/similarity and multiple sequence alignment was performed using the BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Swiss-Prot databases (www.expasy.ch/sprot/sprot-top.html). The accession numbers are P01528 for ATX-II, P10454 for AFT-II, and A37435 for Bc-III. ATX-II was obtained from Sigma, and AFT-II was a kind gift from Dr. Koji Muramoto (Department of Biological Science at Tohoku University) (4Sunahar S. Muramoto K. Tenma K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of the chemicals were of the highest purity available, and double-distilled water was used throughout. LD50Determination—The LD50 of Bc-III was determined intraperitoneally using white BALB/C mice (Mus musculus) according to Meier and Theakston (7Meier J. Theakston R.D.G. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines stably expressing human Nav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6 (cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) were obtained by transfection with the corresponding pCIN5 expression vector (8Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and selection of G418-resistant clones. pCIN5-hNaV1.3 and 1.6 were generated as described previously (9Chen Y.H. Dale T.J.

Brain Res. 2002; 103: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pCIN5-hNaV1.2 was generated from the hNaV1.2 cDNA clone described in Xie et al. (11Xie X.M. Dale T.J. John H.L. Cater T.C. Peakman T.C. Clare J.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 441: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), pCIN5-hNaV1.1 was generated using a human NaV1.1 cDNA assembled from partial clones isolated from human adult cerebellum and medulla cDNA libraries, and pCIN5-hNaV1.5 was generated using a human NaV1.5 cDNA assembled from partial clones isolated from a cDNA library made from human heart. 2J. J. Clare, unpublished data. Nav1.4-expressing cells were obtained after transient transfection of a plasmid containing the hNav1.4 construct (a kind gift from Prof. Diana Conti-Camerino, University of Bari). Solutions and Drugs—The standard extracellular solution contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES-NaOH, and 5 d-glucose, pH 7.4. The standard pipette solution contained (in mm) 130 K+-aspartate, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA-KOH, and 10 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3. Known quantities of the toxins were dissolved in the extracellular solution immediately before the experiments. When contaminating potassium currents were seen, tetrodotoxin (Sigma) was used at 100 nm (on Nav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6 currents) and the resulting traces were subtracted from control traces to obtain the tetrodotoxin-sensitive currents. The Nav1.5 clone, which has a tetrodotoxin ID50 much higher than 100 nm, never showed significant potassium currents at the test potentials. The extracellular solutions were delivered through a 9-hole (0.6-mm) remote-controlled linear positioner with an average response time of 2-3 s that was placed near the cell under study. Patch Clamp Recordings and Data Analysis—The currents were recorded at room temperature by means of the MultiClamp 700A (Axon Instruments) as described previously (12Faravelli L. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 13-23Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with a pipette resistance of ∼1.5-2.2 megaohms. Cell capacitance and series resistance errors were carefully compensated for (85-90%) before each voltage clamp protocol was run to reduce the voltage errors to <5% of the protocol pulse. The P/N leak procedure was routinely used. Voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation was determined by means of a double-pulse protocol in which a conditioning pulse was applied from a holding potential of -80 mV to a range of potentials from -110 (or -130) to -10 (or -30) in 10- or 15-mV increments for 450 ms immediately followed by a test pulse to -10 (or -20) mV. The peak current amplitudes during the tests were normalized to the amplitude of the first pulse and plotted against the potential of the conditioning pulse. The data were fitted using two exponential terms and a constant value beginning at the current peak. When necessary, the time constant of the fast inactivating term was fixed to the average fast time constant obtained in control curves. Recovery from inactivation was determined using a three-pulse protocol, which began with conditioning depolarization from a holding potential of -120 to -10 (or -20) mV for 60 (or 100) ms that inactivated >95% of the channels. This was followed by an increasing recovery time interval at -80 mV and a test depolarization to -10 (or -20) mV. The time intervals in successive episodes were 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 ms (see details in the figure legends). pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 7 (Microcal Inc.) software were routinely used during data acquisition and analysis. Bc-III and AFT-II Purification, Amino Acid Sequence, and LD50—Gel-filtration chromatography of B. caissarum venom yielded six main peaks (I-VI). Peak IIIa (Fig. 1A) had the greatest neurotoxicity and was further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography steps, leading to the pure toxin Bc-III (Fig. 1B). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the molecular mass of Bc-III was 4.976 atomic mass units (4.973) (5Malpezzi E.L.A. Freitas J.C. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and that the determination of 25 N-terminal amino acid residues (GVACRCDSDGPTSRGNTLTGTLWLT) by automated Edman degradation confirmed the identity of the major toxin Bc-III (Table I) reported by Malpezzi et al. (5Malpezzi E.L.A. Freitas J.C. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The high purity of AFT-II was determined by mass spectrometry, and its molecular mass was also confirmed (4.941 atomic mass units). The intraperitoneal LD50 of Bc-III in mice was 600 μg/kg, very similar to that reported for AFT-II (450 μg/kg) (4Sunahar S. Muramoto K. Tenma K. Kamiya H. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Table IAmino acid sequence of ATX-II, Bc-III, and AFT-II compared with other similar sea anemone toxins (the numbers refer to ATX-II)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Basic Properties of Biophysical Effects of ATX-II on Nav1.5 and Data Analysis—As explained under “Materials and Methods,” all of the experiments were performed at fixed drug concentrations using the currents elicited before and during drug perfusion (for 25-40 s) at successively increasing concentrations. Recovery was always checked after the experiment. It is well known that the main action of sea anemone neurotoxins is to slow the inactivation process. Therefore, we mainly used protocols (double pulse, see Fig. 2A, inset) capable of deriving these properties and compared traces at the same test potential under the control conditions and during toxin perfusion. The action of ATX-II on the Nav1.5 channel was the starting point used to establish the protocols for recording the data and analyzing the results. Observation of the action of increasing toxin concentrations clearly showed in first approximation that the drug is in equilibrium at a fixed concentration with a fraction of the total number of channels on each cell. We checked this result several times and consequently analyzed the data on the assumption that each Na+ current trace is the sum of two exponential decaying components and a steady-state component. Under control conditions, the amplitude of the fast component was generally large and the other two components were normally very low or negligible. During toxin action, there was a large increase in the slow component and, in some cases (depending on the toxin type), an additional increase in a persistent component. We also systematically observed that the quality of fitting of the toxin-induced currents was not different whether we used a free or fixed (control value) fast time constant. This strongly suggests that the currents recorded in the presence of the toxin were always the sum of two types of currents: those deriving from toxin-bound channels (modified) and those deriving from toxin-free channels (not modified and thus equivalent to control channels). This is shown in Fig. 2, A-C, at 0, 10, and 200 nm [ATX-II]. In Fig. 2D, a single trace (continuous line) elicited at -20 mV in the presence of 5 nm toxin was dissected into a fast (○) and slow component (▵). The relative increase and decrease in these components is plotted in Fig. 2E for different concentrations (n = 4), which shows that the contribution of bound and unbound channels consistently changes in relation to the toxin concentration. Following this finding, we investigated the recovery from inactivation at -80 mV (see protocol below Fig. 2F) at the maximal concentration by superimposing the traces of the control (line), toxin (line), and toxin control (open circle). It can be seen that there was hardly any recovery of the slow component during times of the order of the time constants of recovery from inactivation in the control traces. The normalized voltage dependence of the slow component amplitudes at the various concentrations was plotted as a function of the preconditioning level and compared with the classical steady-state inactivation as shown in Fig. 2G. It can be observed that the toxin induced a net leftward shift of the slow component in comparison with the control inactivation. Moreover, comparison of the slow component at increasing concentrations indicates an increased time constant (from 14.5 to 33.2 ms, see Fig. 2G, inset), although this observation was not investigated further. The Effect of AFT-II and Bc-III on Nav1.5—The effects of the toxins AFT-II and Bc-III on Nav1.5 are shown in Fig. 3. In the six panels, the data are divided along the two columns for AFT-II (n = 4) and Bc-III (n = 4). The top row (Fig. 3, A and B) shows the control data (line) with the data observed at various concentrations (different symbols of the superimposed traces in a representative cell). The second row (Fig. 3, C and D) shows the data for the recovery from inactivation (traces from one representative cell are superimposed for the control (line), toxin (line), and the toxin-sensitive component (open squares). The third row (Fig. 3, E and F) shows the data for the voltage dependence of inactivation of the slow (○) and steady-state component (▵) under control conditions (▪) and at the highest concentration used. The insets show the superimposed recordings from a representative cell of the complete inactivation protocol under control conditions and at the highest concentration. These data suggest that the action of AFT-II is similar to that of ATX-II and that Bc-III has a lower affinity for this type of channel. Interestingly, the results obtained with these two new toxins differ from those obtained with ATX-II, insofar, as there was a small supplementary persistent component characterized by right-shifted inactivation curves. Similar procedures were used to analyze the data obtained with the three toxins acting on the Na+ currents in the different cell lines expressing the Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.4, and Nav1.6 sodium channel genes as described in the subsequent paragraphs. The effects of ATX-II, AFT-II, and Bc-III on Nav1.1—The results of experiments on cells expressing the Nav1.1 channel are shown in Fig. 4. In the nine panels, the data are divided in three columns for ATX-II (n = 3), AFT-II (n = 4), and Bc-III (n = 4). The first row (Fig. 4, A-C) shows the effect of different toxin concentrations (superimposed traces from a representative cell). The second row (Fig. 4, D-F) shows the data for the recovery from inactivation (superimposed traces from one representative cell in control, toxin, and the toxin-sensitive component). The third row (Fig. 4, G-I) shows the data for the voltage dependence of inactivation in the control (▪) and slow (○) and steady-state components (▵). The insets show the superimposed recordings from a representative cell for the complete inactivation protocol under control conditions and at the highest concentration used (note the break in the time axis). The average time constant of the slow component (shown in Table II) did not depend on the toxin concentration or the preconditioning voltage (in the range -110/-50 mV). During preconditioning at -35 and -20 mV, AFT-II and Bc-III induced currents that were almost persistent but not present in the control and that did not inactivate when tested at -20 mV. These persistent components had a right-shifted voltage-dependent curve in comparison with the control and slow component behavior.Table IIInactivation and time constantsτslow (msec)Voltage-dependent inactivationShift (Slow) (mV)Shift (SS) (mV)ATX-IIAFT-IIBc-IIIATX-IIAFT-IIBc-IIIATX-IIAFT-IIBc-IIINav 1.17 ± 1.113 ± 1.316 ± 2.1n.a.n.a.6 ± 0.49 ± 0.615 ± 1.530 ± 2.8Nav 1.212 ± 0.912.7 ± 1.113 ± 1.5n.a.n.a.n.a.15.2 ± 2.230 ± 313.2 ± 1Nav 1.37.8 ± 0.611 ± 1.217 ± 2.1−7 ± 1n.a.n.a.22 ± 3.534 ± 6.113 ± 2.6Nav 1.46.3 ± 0.84.5 ± 0.68.5 ± 1.6−6.1 ± 1−6.4 ± 0.9n.a.n.a.n.a.15.2 ± 2.5Nav 1.5Var18 ± 131 ± 1.8−11 ± 1n.a.n.a.n.a.30 ± 2.325 ± 1.8Nav 1.69.8 ± 0.616 ± 1.311 ± 0.9−8 ± 0.4−5 ± 0.5n.a.30 ± 2.940 ± 5.638 ± 7 Open table in a new tab The Effects of ATX-II, AFT-II, and Bc-III on Nav1.2—The results of experiments similar to those reported for Nav1.1 are shown in Fig. 5 for Nav1.2 channels. Once again, the action of ATX-II (n = 3) was seen at much lower concentrations than that of AFT-II and Bc-III (n = 4). Although at high concentrations ATX-II and Bc-III often led to a slight increase in peak currents with respect to control, the effect of AFT-II on peak currents was more marked (increase of the order of 60 ± 5.4% (n = 3)) and, in addition, a large persistent component was induced that was not inactivated at -20 mV (Fig. 5H, insets). The Effects of ATX-II, AFT-II, and Bc-III on Nav1.3—Similar experiments were also performed for the Nav1.3 channel (see Fig. 6). The three toxins were effective only at relatively higher concentrations. As noted for Nav1.2, only AFT-II induced a large increase in peak current (see Fig. 6H, insets). Persistent currents are typical of this channel. Only ATX-II led to a negatively shifted inactivation curve of the slow component. The Effects of ATX-II, AFT-II, and Bc-III on Nav1.4—The effect of the three toxins on the Nav1.4 channel are shown in Fig. 7. The inactivation time constant under control conditions was 0.5 ± 0.15 ms (n = 7), but this increased ∼10-fold following the application of the toxins. Nevertheless, the slow component time constants for Nav1.4 are the lowest among the subtypes tested (see Table II). It is worth noting that both ATX-II and AFT-II induced a non-parallel leftward shift of the inactivation curve that was more pronounced toward the most negative region and that the recordings were devoid of any persistent component. Only Bc-III generated a small steady-state component. The Effects of ATX-II, AFT-II, and Bc-III on Nav1.6—Unlike those observed for the Nav1.5 channels, the results obtained for Nav1.6 channels (see Fig. 8) are similar to those found for Nav1.3 channels including the appearance of a persistent component during activation, a remarkable right shift of voltage-dependent inactivation and the leftward shift of the slow component. This finding suggests that these effects are less characteristic of the toxins themselves but are probably more related to the structure of the specific channel subtype. The effects of ATX-II on peak currents were considerable, whereas AFT-II and Bc-III induced only minor increases. Comparative Effects of the Inactivation Process on the Whole NavSeries—In general (with the exception of Nav1.5), the time constants of the toxin-induced slow inactivation component did not vary as a function of toxin concentration (see first three columns of Table II). It can be seen that Bc-III produced the relatively highest time constant values, but Nav1.4 is an exception and Nav1.2 was affected to the same extent by all three toxins. The same table also shows the shifts (on the voltage axis) of the voltage-dependent inactivation curves for both the slow and the steady-state components. The shift of the slow component was almost always negative (with the exception of Bc-III on Nav1.1), whereas the shifts of steady-state components were always positive (note that Nav1.6 was greatly affected by the three toxins). Dose-response Curves—To quantify and compare the effects of the three toxins on the various Na+ channels, we evaluated the amplitude of the slow and steady-state toxin-induced components in relation to drug concentrations. All of the data were corrected for the amplitude of the slow component in the control recordings (normally <7-8%) and normalized to the control peak amplitude in each cell. The resulting dose-response curves (ATX-II (▪), AFT-II (□), and Bc-III (○)) are shown in Fig. 9. We sometimes were unable to reach the maximal effect when the toxin potency was too low, because there was insufficient toxin material. Steady-state components were not observed with some subtypes, and the fact that this always led to a marked rightward shift of the inactivation curves suggests that this is probably due to changes in the biophysics of the channel as a result of binding to sites other than those responsible for slowing the inactivation. Simple visual inspection indicated that some dose-response curves were not sufficiently good to fit the classical logistic equation reasonably; thus only an approximate EC50 is given. For all of the other data, the results of the fitting procedure are shown in Table III for the slow component and Table IV for the steady-state component.Table IIIDose-response curve data for the fractional increase in the slow componentATX-IIAFT-IIBc-IIINav1.1A0.56 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.02Estimated ∼ 0.6EC506.01 ± 0.46390.55 ± 30.75Estimated ∼ 300p1.86 ± 0.092.46 ± 0.24n.a.Nav1.2A0.64 ± 0.021.42 ± 0.220.65 ± 0.08EC507.88 ± 0.481998 ± 519.31449.17 ± 216.47p3.33 ± 0.411.31 ± 0.112.86 ± 0.64Nav1.3A0.96 ± 0.091.91 ± 0.070.4 ± 0.02EC50759.22 ± 99.9459.36 ± 48.131458.42 ± 128.52p2.13 ± 0.371.85 ± 0.122.93 ± 0.51Nav1.4A1.15 ± 0.030.91 ± 0.041.26 ± 0.09EC50109.49 ± 7.0130.62 ± 3.46820.84 ± 144.31p1.41 ± 0.121.64 ± 0.231.16 ± 0.13Nav1.5A1 ± 0.031.14 ± 0.041.02 ± 0.04EC5049.05 ± 3.3162.5 ± 4.05307 ± 32.5p1.52 ± 0.122.5 ± 0.421.72 ± 0.21Nav1.6AEstimated ∼ 0.9Estimated ∼ 0.65Estimated ∼ 1.4EC50Estimated ∼ 180Estimated ∼ 300Estimated ∼ 900pn.a.n.a.n.a.

In contrast AFT-II, which is only a single amino acid different, has only weak efficacy for these subtypes and has greatest efficacy for Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 (EC50 of ∼30 and 62 nm, respectively). AFT-II and ATX-II had similar efficacies at both Nav1.5 (∼55 nm) and at Nav1.6 (∼240 nm). Bc-III has the lowest efficacy of all of the toxins with the greatest effects being on Nav1.1 and Nav1.5 (EC50 values of ∼300 nm). In conclusion, the following EC50 rank order was found: ATX-II, Nav1.1-Nav1.2 ≪ Nav1.5 < Nav1.4 < Nav1.6 < Nav1.3; AFT-II, Nav1.4 < Nav1.5 < Nav1.6 < Nav1.3-Nav1.1 < Nav1.2; and Bc-III, Nav1.5-Nav1.1 < Nav1.4-Nav1.6 < Nav1.2-Nav1.3. The greatest efficacy (measured as the increase in the slow component) was obtained by AFT-II in the Nav1.3 channel, 1.91 (as against 0.67 in Nav1.1 and 1.42 in Nav1.2) with 0.6 for the steady-state component. The toxins also induced large increases in this component in Nav1.6. Pr"
https://openalex.org/W2031189145,"Cardiolipin (CL) is a dimeric phospholipid localized primarily in the mitochondrial membrane. Previous studies have shown that yeast cells containing a disruption of CRD1, the structural gene encoding CL synthase, exhibit temperature-sensitive colony formation and multiple mitochondrial defects. A recent report (Zhang, M., Su, X., Mileykovskaya, E., Amoscato, A. A., and Dowhan, W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 35204–35210) suggested that defects associated with CL deficiency may result from the reduced expression of PET56 in crd1Δ mutant backgrounds and should be reevaluated. In the current study, we present evidence that CL deficiency leads to mitochondrial DNA instability, loss of viability, and defects in oxidative phosphorylation at elevated temperatures. The observed mutant phenotypes are characteristic of crd1Δ mutant cells of both PET56 and pet56 backgrounds and are complemented by an episomal copy of CRD1 but not by expression of the PET56 gene. Phosphatidylglycerol is elevated in crd1Δ mutant cells when grown in the presence of fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources, although the extent of the increase is higher in nonfermentable medium. An increase in the ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine was also apparent in the mutant. These findings demonstrate that CRD1, independent of PET56, is required for optimal mitochondrial function and for an essential cellular function at elevated temperatures.

Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar). It plays a key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics by optimizing the activities of enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar), stabilizing the supercomplexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae respiratory chain complexes III and IV (2Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52873-52880Google Scholar), preventing rate-dependent uncoupling, and providing osmotic stability in yeast mitochondria (3Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Google Scholar). CL is also involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, possibly via assisting protein import into mitochondria (4Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Google Scholar) and maintaining optimal mitochondrial internal structure (5Kawasaki K. Kuge O. Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Rho M. Suzuki K. Nishijima M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1828-1834Google Scholar). Defective remodeling of CL is associated with Barth syndrome, a severe genetic disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and respiratory chain defects (6Vreken P. Valianpour F. Nijtmans L.G. Grivell L.A. Plecko B. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 378-382Google Scholar). The phenotype of Barth syndrome is dependent upon multiple factors that are not well understood (7Barth P.G. Scholte H.R. Berden J.A. Van der Klei-Van Moorsel J.M. Luyt-Houwen I.E. Van't Veer-Korthof E.T. Van der Harten J.J. Sobotka-Plojhar M.A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1983; 62: 327-355Google Scholar, 8Barth P.G. Van den Bogert C. Bolhuis P.A. Scholte H.R. van Gennip A.H. Schutgens R.B. Ketel A.G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 157-160Google Scholar). Elucidation of the functions of CL will help to clarify the abnormalities associated with this disorder. We have observed that the yeast crd1Δ mutant, which lacks CL synthase and has no detectable CL, loses cell viability during growth at elevated temperatures (4Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Google Scholar, 9Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Google Scholar). Crd1Δ mutant cells cannot form colonies at 37 °C from single cells seeded on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) plates (9Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Google Scholar). In addition, crd1Δ mutant cells grown in fermentable or non-fermentable carbon sources also segregate large numbers of petites (respiratory incompetent cells) after prolonged culture at elevated temperatures (4Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Google Scholar). CL is, thus, essential for maintaining mitochondrial DNA stability and cell viability in both fermentable and non-fermentable media. These phenotypes of crd1Δ cells are similar to those of the yeast phosphatidylserine decarboxylase mutant psd1Δ, which contain reduced mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine. Psd1Δ cells exhibit a high propensity for loss of mitochondrial DNA, markedly reduced growth on non-fermentable media, and temperature sensitivity at 37 °C, similarly to crd1Δ (10Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Google Scholar, 11Birner R. Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Google Scholar, 12Storey M.K. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 234-247Google Scholar). A recent study reported that the defects associated with the crd1Δ mutation were attributable to the presence of a pet56 mutation in the crd1Δ strain background (13Zhang M. Su X. Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35204-35210Google Scholar). Pet56p catalyzes the formation of 2′-O-methylguanosine at a specific nucleotide in the peptidyl transferase center of the RNA of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (14Sirum-Connolly K. Mason T.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1886-1889Google Scholar). Reduced expression of PET56 was found to slow growth, decrease mitochondrial DNA stability, and decrease cell viability at elevated temperatures (14Sirum-Connolly K. Mason T.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1886-1889Google Scholar, 15Rieger K.J. Kaniak A. Coppee J.Y. Aljinovic G. Baudin-Baillieu A. Orlowska G. Gromadka R. Groudinsky O. Di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1547-1562Google Scholar). It was suggested that the growth defects of crd1Δ, which resemble the phenotypes of pet56, were due to reduced PET56 expression rather than lack of CL (13Zhang M. Su X. Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35204-35210Google Scholar). However, as mitochondrial defects were observed in crd1Δ as compared with isogenic wild type cells, the presence of a pet56 mutation in both crd1Δ and wild type could not explain the mitochondrial defects. In the current study, we examined the effect of PET56 expression on temperature sensitivity, mitochondrial DNA loss, and respiratory function in the crd1Δ mutant. We determined that the mitochondrial defects observed in the crd1Δ mutant are independent of the pet56 mutation and that the expression of CRD1 but not PET56 complements all the defects. Materials—All chemicals used were reagent grade or better. [α-32P]UTP and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using the MasterTag kit from Eppendorf. The Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA purification system, the PGEM-T Easy Vector system, and riboprobe system kits were from Promega. All other buffers and enzymes were purchased from Sigma. Glucose, yeast extract, and peptone were purchased from Difco. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I.

The PCR reaction products were cloned into the pGEM-T EASY vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pGEM-1631, was digested with SpeI and EcoRI. The DNA fragment containing PET56 was cloned into the pRS415 vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid pRS415-PET56 contains the complete PET56 coding sequence with 245-bp upstream and 147-bp downstream sequences. To make the PET56 riboprobe, PGEM-1631 was digested with SphI and NdeI, and the coding sequence of PET56 between this two restriction sites was cloned into the pGEM-T EASY vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid pGEM-PET56 was linearized with NdeI for synthesis of the PET56 riboprobe. Northern Analysis—Cells were grown to the mid-logarithmic phase in YPD, and RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction (16Collart M.A. Oliviero S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.12.1-13.12.2Google Scholar), fractionated on an agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled PET56 riboprobes, followed by a riboprobe for the constitutively expressed actin filament protein gene ACT1 to normalize for loading variation. RNA probes for Northern analysis were synthesized using the Promega riboprobe system from plasmids linearized with restriction enzymes as follows (listed as plasmid, restriction enzyme, and RNA polymerase): (i) pGEM-PET56, NdeI, and T7 (PET56); and (ii) pPLg, BamHI, and SP6 (ACT1) (17Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Google Scholar). The results were quantitated by phosphorimaging. Measurement of Cell Viability and Petite Formation—Yeast cells from a 5-ml overnight pre-culture were inoculated into a 10-ml prewarmed YPD medium. Cultures were incubated with continuous agitation for 5–10 days. Aliquots were serially diluted, spread on YPD plates, and incubated at 30 °C. After colonies formed, cells were replicated to YPGE to assess mitochondrial function. Petite formation was calculated based on the number of colonies that grew on YPD (total viable cells) and YPGE (respiratory competent). Isolation of Mitochondria and Measurement of Oxidative Phosphorylation—Isolation of mitochondria was performed as described previously (18Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown in complex medium containing non-fermentable (3% glycerol or 3% glycerol/1% ethanol) carbon sources. The medium used for isolation was 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.1, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The final mitochondrial pellet was suspended in the isolation medium at ∼10 mg/ml protein. The reaction medium for oxidative phosphorylation used was 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.1, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.1, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. NADH (2 mm) was used as a respiratory substrate. Respiration rates were measured with the Clark-type electrode. Phosphorylation was estimated from ADP-stimulated respiration using total oxygen consumption. Steady State Phospholipid Determination—Phospholipid analysis of yeast strains was carried out essentially as described (2Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52873-52880Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD or YPGE media from a starting A550 of 0.025. Immediately after inoculation, cultures were supplemented with 10 μCi 32P ml–1 and allowed to grow for at least five or six generations to achieve steady state labeling as described (19Atkinson K. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the indicated growth phase and digested by zymolyase (1.5–2.5 mg/ml culture in 50 mm Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.2 m glycerol and 100 mm sodium thioglycolate) at room temperature for 15 min to yield spheroplasts. Phospholipid extraction was carried out in 20 volumes of 2:1 chloroform/methanol partitioned in sterile water and separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (20Leray C. Pelletier X. Hemmendinger S. Cazenave J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 420: 411-416Google Scholar) on LK5 silica gel 150-Å plates in chloroform/ethanol/water/triethylamine (30: 35:7:35; v/v). Phospholipids were identified by co-migration with known standards. 32Pi in individual phospholipids was visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The incorporation of radiolabel (32Pi) into an individual phospholipid is expressed as the percentage of radiolabel incorporated into total phospholipids. Temperature Sensitivity of crd1Δ Is Independent of pet56 —We examined colony formation in crd1Δ cells in both PET56 (BY4741) and pet56 (FGY3) strain backgrounds. Both strains have mutations in the HIS3 gene, which shares a common promoter with PET56. However, in BY4741 the HIS3 allele is his3Δ1, a 187-bp deletion of only the internal coding sequence of HIS3, leaving the promoter intact (21Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4951-4955Google Scholar). In contrast, FGY3 contains the his3Δ200 allele in which the common promoter region of PET56 and HIS3 is deleted. As seen in Fig. 1A, PET56 is fully expressed in wild type and isogenic crd1Δ cells in the BY4741 background but not in the FGY3 background. As expected, the transformation of FGY3 and isogenic crd1Δ cells with PET56 genomic DNA containing the complete promoter and coding sequence on a single copy vector restored PET56 expression to levels slightly higher than those observed in BY4741. Single cells of wild type (BY4741) and isogenic crd1Δ strains were plated on YPD or SCD medium and incubated at elevated temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1B, crd1Δ cells could not form colonies at elevated temperatures. On YPD, the mutant could not form colonies at 41 °C, a permissive temperature for the wild type. At 39 °C the mutant formed small colonies, all of which were petite (data not shown). On synthetic medium, colony formation was defective even at 39 °C. In summary, in a PET56 background the crd1Δ mutant exhibited defective colony formation at elevated temperatures. To determine whether the temperature-sensitive phenotype of crd1Δ was due to the lack of CL, the crd1Δ mutants were transformed with pRS415-CRD1, a single copy plasmid bearing the wild type CRD1gene expressed from its original promoter. In both PET56 and pet56 genetic backgrounds, the wild type CRD1 gene restored the growth of the crd1Δ mutant at elevated temperatures on YPD and SCD (Fig. 2). Expression of the wild type PET56 gene had no effect on temperature sensitivity. The crd1Δ mutant lost viability after prolonged growth in liquid culture (24 and 72 h in pet56 and PET56 backgrounds, respectively (Fig. 3). Viability was restored to wild type levels in mutant cells expressing a vector containing the CRD1 gene (but not empty vector) in both PET56 and pet56 strain backgrounds. Expression of the wild type PET56 gene did not affect viability.Fig. 3Expression of CRD1 but not PET56 protects crd1Δ from loss of viability following prolonged culture at elevated temperatures. The crd1Δ mutants and isogenic wild types FGY3 (pet56) or BY4741 (PET56) transformed with vector pRS415 pRS415-CRD1, or pRS415-PET56 were grown overnight in Leu–medium. Cells were inoculated into YPD at 106 cells/ml and incubated at the indicated temperatures. Viable cells were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Increased Petite Formation in crd1Δ Mutants at Elevated Temperatures Is Independent of pet56 —Petite formation was measured in crd1Δ cells in PET56 and pet56 backgrounds. As seen in Fig. 4, the percentage of petite cells in the crd1Δ mutant in the pet56 background was greater than among wild type cells. After prolonged growth (194 h) of cells at 37 °C, the majority of crd1Δ mutant cells had lost mitochondrial DNA, whereas the percentage of petites among the wild type cells was <10%. In the PET56 background as well, crd1Δ mutant cells exhibited a higher frequency of petite formation than did the wild type when grown at 39 °C. In both strain backgrounds, expression of CRD1 led to a reduction in the number of petite cells in the crd1Δ mutant to wild type levels, whereas the expression of PET56 had no effect. Uncoupled Oxidative Phosphorylation in crd1Δ Is Independent of PET56 —Mitochondrial function was assayed in crd1Δ mutant cells in the PET56 genetic background. Fig. 5 demonstrates oxygen consumption in wild type and mutant mitochondria at 25 and 40 °C under isotonic and hypotonic conditions. At 25 °C in isotonic conditions, crd1Δ mutant mitochondria were well coupled as indicated by a clear transition of respiration from state 3 to state 4. However, at 40 °C in isotonic medium, conditions in which wild type mitochondria were well coupled, oxidative phosphorylation in mutant mitochondria was completely uncoupled. Mutant mitochondria also exhibited defective coupling in hypotonic conditions, even at 25 °C. Therefore, in both pet56 (3Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Google Scholar, 15Rieger K.J. Kaniak A. Coppee J.Y. Aljinovic G. Baudin-Baillieu A. Orlowska G. Gromadka R. Groudinsky O. Di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P.

In cells expressing CRD1, coupling was restored at 40 °C and under hypotonic conditions. Increased PG Levels in crd1Δ Cells—Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was elevated in crd1Δ cells in both PET56 and pet56 backgrounds (Tables II and III). Consistent with previous reports (2Pfeiffer K.

This increase in the PE/PC ratio was more pronounced in YPGE (Table III) than in YPD (Table II) media and in crd1Δ cells in the pet56 background than in PET56, in which it was evident only in the mid-logarithmic phase in YPGE medium. The comparative phospholipid profile of crd1Δ and isogenic wild type cells showed that PG levels in crd1Δ are similar to CL in wild type.

Defective CL biosynthesis due to a mutation in the human G4.5 (TAZ) gene leads to the severe genetic disorder known as Barth syndrome (23Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 385-389Google Scholar). The severity of symptoms, including cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and neutropenia, is not strongly correlated with the degree of mutation in the TAZ gene, indicating that the phenotype is dependent on multiple factors that are, to date, not well understood (24Chen R. Tsuji T. Ichida F. Bowles K.R. Yu X. Watanabe S. Hirono K. Tsubata S. Hamamichi Y. Ohta J. Imai Y. Bowles N.E. Miyawaki T. Towbin J.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 319-325Google Scholar). An understanding of the function of CL may ultimately help to explain the varying degrees of severity observed in Barth syndrome. Several studies have shown that the yeast crd1Δ mutant, which has no CL, exhibits a variety of mitochondrial and cellular defects, including temperature sensitive growth, loss of mitochondrial DNA, decreased respiratory function and membrane potential, and defective import of proteins into the mitochondria (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar, 2Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol.

Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35204-35210Google Scholar) reported that several phenotypes in the CL-deficient mutant were exacerbated by reduced expression of PET56 and concluded that phenotypes associated with the crd1Δ mutant should be reevaluated. In this report, we examined the role of pet56 in crd1Δ mutant phenotypes and concluded the following. (i) Decreased viability and loss of mitochondrial DNA at elevated temperature are independent of pet56. Episomal expression of CRD1 but not PET56 complements the growth defects and restores mitochondrial DNA stability. (ii) Coupling and oxidative phosphorylation are defective in crd1Δ mutant mitochondria in PET56 and pet56 genetic backgrounds. Oxidative phosphorylation is completely uncoupled in the mutant at 40 °C or in the hypotonic reaction medium. (iii) The crd1Δ mutant exhibits increased PE and decreased phosphatidylcholine, especially in nonfermentable medium. This altered phospholipid profile is apparent in both PET56 and pet56 backgrounds, although it is more pronounced in the latter. In summary, all crd1Δ mutant phenotypes tested are independent of PET56. Yeast “wild type” strains differ greatly with respect to their degree of thermal tolerance. Among the strains used for the current study, wild type strain BY4741 tolerates significantly higher temperatures than does FGY3. Therefore, the temperature sensitivity of crd1Δ in the BY4741 genetic background is not apparent below 39 °C, a temperature that is permissible for growth of the wild type. This may explain why previous studies did not detect temperature sensitivity in the crd1Δ mutant. PET56, as well as other genes, may very well contribute to overall thermal tolerance, in which case the expression of this and other genes may suppress phenotypes associated with thermal sensitivity. The suppression phenotype underscores the importance of comparing mutants with isogenic wild type strains. The phenotypes reported previously for the crd1Δ mutant (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar, 2Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52873-52880Google Scholar, 3Koshkin V.

J. 2000; 347: 687-691Google Scholar) were all identified by comparison with an isogenic wild type strain, suggesting that the reduced expression of pet56 in these strains had no bearing on crd1Δ-associated phenotypes. The current study confirms this conclusion. We previously showed that PG was only slightly elevated in crd1Δ cells in YPD medium (4Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Google Scholar). Similar findings were reported by Tuller et al. (22Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Google Scholar), who did not detect any PG in crd1Δ cells grown in YPD medium. In contrast, Chang et al. (25Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (13Zhang M. Su X. Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35204-35210Google Scholar) showed that PG was elevated in the mutant in YPD medium. In all the above studies, measurements were taken at a single point in the growth phase. However, growth phase is known to regulate phospholipid levels (26Jakovcic S. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Google Scholar). This effect is specifically important for mitochondrial phospholipids (PG and CL), as mitochondrial development is subject to glucose-mediated repression, resulting in reduced mitochondria-specific phospholipids (22Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Google Scholar, 26Jakovcic S. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Google Scholar, 27Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, phospholipid analyses were carried out at different growth phases in two different crd1Δ strains by using a sensitive radiolabeling approach. CL and PG levels increased by >2-fold from the early logarithmic to the late stationary phase in YPD medium (Table II), whereas in YPGE medium the levels remained constantly high (Table III), which is consistent with previous reports (22Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Google Scholar, 26Jakovcic S. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Google Scholar). PG levels in crd1Δ cells were comparable with wild type levels of CL plus PG. However, because the wild type CL levels were almost two times higher in YPGE as compared with the YPD medium in the logarithmic phase, the elevation of PG in crd1Δ cells was more apparent in the nonfermentable medium (Tables II and III). Consistent with the previous report (22Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Google Scholar), the crd1Δ mutation resulted in a significant increase in the non-bilayer-forming lipid PE in the FGY3 (pet56) background and a somewhat smaller increase in the PET56 background (Table III). This result suggests that cells may require a critical amount of non-bilayer-forming phospholipids such CL and PE, and the increase in PE when CL is limiting may reflect a response to this need. In Escherichia coli, the increase in CL that accompanies decreased membrane PE may reflect this need as well (28Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Google Scholar). This suggests that a mechanism may exist to maintain a critical amount of non-bilayer-forming phospholipids in mitochondria. Molecular characterization of the increased rate of PE biosynthesis in CL mutants may help to elucidate this mechanism. Mutants in different steps of CL biosynthesis differ greatly with respect to temperature sensitivity. The pgs1Δ mutant, which lacks PG and CL, exhibits the most severe growth defects at elevated temperatures. The crd1Δ mutant, which can make PG but not CL, exhibits temperature-sensitive colony formation but can grow at elevated temperatures when cells are patched onto YPD plates. In the taz1Δ mutant, which can synthesize CL, CL levels are less than those in wild type and are lacking in unsaturated fatty acids typical of wild type CL. This mutant has the least severe temperature sensitivity; it grows normally on glucose or glycerol plus ethanol but not on ethanol alone at elevated temperatures (29Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F.M. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Google Scholar). Although thermal sensitivity of the bioenergetic functions may explain temperature sensitivity in non-fermentable medium, the reason for the loss of viability on glucose is not known. Identification of suppressors of this phenotype or synthetic lethal mutants may shed light on the essential functions of CL. These studies are in progress.

In this study, we found that the treatment of neurons with α2M* significantly increased the individual length (by 71%) and numbers (by 139%) of neurites of primary mouse cortical neurons. These effects were blocked by the LRP antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. We found similar neurite outgrowth with purified apoE3 and a tandem apoE peptide containing only the receptor-binding domain. To investigate the intracellular pathway of the LRP signaling involved in neurite outgrowth, we tested the effects of α2M* on the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). We found that 1) phospho-MAP kinase levels were altered within 30 min after treatment with α2M*, 2) the MAP kinase inhibitor, PD98059, specifically blocked the α2M*-induced neurite outgrowth, 3) manipulating intracellular calcium by BayK or BAPTA altered the neurite outgrowth and associated changes in the phospho-MAP kinase levels, which were blunted by α2M*, 4) α2M* promoted the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB through MAP kinase, and 5) LRP-specific antibodies increased levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase and phosphorylated CREB. The effects of α2M*, apoE3, and apoE peptides increased LRP levels in the cortical neurons, whereas LRP receptor-associated protein reduced dendritic LRP expression.

When α2M has been “activated” by protease or chemical modification (α2M*), it becomes a competent ligand for binding and clearance by LRP. Although α2M* can be a neurotrophic factor, little is known regarding the downstream signaling of α2M*. To assess the potential functions of α2M* in the central nervous system, we examined the short term and long term effects of α2M* exposure on an important neuronal function in the cortex of the brain, neurite outgrowth. Neuronal differentiation and axonal growth are controlled by a variety of factors (12Doherty P. Williams G. Williams E.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In a highly simplified model (12Doherty P. Williams G. Williams E.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the signals generated within peripheral domain and central domains of the growth cone have distinct functions in controlling growth cone motility. Signals generated in the peripheral domain, such as intracellular calcium, are instructive signals for growth and guidance, whereas those generated in the central domain, such as activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), are more likely to be permissive signals. However, in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, the factors that alter neurite outgrowth involving calcium MAP kinase cascade could promote degenerative processes leading to the neuritic dystrophy observed. Previous studies from our laboratory and others demonstrate that α2M* is involved in numerous central nervous system functions including up-regulation of LRP expression (13Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), calcium signaling (14Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T.

We found that the treatment of neurons with α2M* significantly increased the neurite outgrowth in a LRP receptor-associated protein (RAP)-blockable manner dependent on the phosphorylation of MAP kinase. In addition, the phosphorylation of MAP kinase depends on changes in calcium homeostasis altered by α2M* treatment and promotes the phosphorylation of CREB. Cell Culture—Cortical neurons from 16-day-old embryonic Swiss Webster mice were isolated by a standard enzyme treatment protocol (15Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol.

Cortices were dissociated in calcium-free saline and plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma) coated tissue culture dishes at the density of 5 × 104 cell/ml. The neurons were grown in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum with 25 μm penicillin-streptomycin. 1 h after plating, the medium with serum was replaced with medium containing the B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). Treatment with LRP Ligands—Primary neuronal cultures were treated with 500 nm α2M*. α2M* was added into B-27/neurobasal medium 24 h after plating. A similar treatment protocol was applied to other LRP ligands or drugs such as apoE (100 nm), tandem apoE peptide (100 nm), and RAP (500 nm). Polyclonal LRP antibodies raised against purified human LRP or against the cytoplasmic domain of LRP were a kind gift of Dr. Dudley Strickland (American Red Cross). Control cultures consisted of sister cultures, which were untreated with LRP ligands. The neurons were observed for 48–72 h in culture. In short term treatments, LRP ligands were added into medium for 30 min. Control cultures (sister cultures) were not treated with LRP ligands. The medium was replaced by physiological saline before calcium measurements were made. The composition of the physiological saline was (in mm): 140 NaCl; 3.5 KCl; 0.4 KH2PO4; 0.33 Na2HPO4; 2 MgSO4; 2.2 CaCl2; 10 glucose; and 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3. Neurite Outgrowth Analysis—Neurite outgrowth was assessed by checking the cell morphology using an MRC 1024 confocal microscope system. Microscopic images from random fields were captured and digitized by Bio-Rad software. α2M* and related treatments were added to the neuronal culture at 1 day in vitro. The length and numbers of neurites were measured 48–72 h after treatment with α2M*. The cortical cultures were washed, fixed, and immunostained overnight at 4 °C. Anti-MAP2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used as a neuronal marker. R829, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against LRP holoprotein (a kind gift of Dudley Strickland) was used to investigate LRP expression and distribution. MAP2 and LRP antibodies were detected with fluorescein-linked antimouse Ig and Cy3-linked anti-rabbit Ig, respectively. The length of neurites from all of the neurons within a field was stereologically quantified and expressed as the total length (in mm). The stereological analysis of neurite outgrowth was carried out using the computer-assisted microscope allowed for precise well defined movements along the x and y axes. Total neurite length was measured as described by Larsen (19Larsen J.O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 85: 105-118Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Berezovska et al. (20Berezovska O. McLean P. Knowles R. Frosh M. Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using a quadratic lattice randomly placed on the sampled neuron: b = π/2 × d × I (where d is the inverse line density and I is the number of intersections between the neurite and the grid line). Morphologically, the alterations of neurite outgrowth were compared between differentiation stages of primary neurons in the presence and in the absence of drug treatment. For example, the alterations of neurite outgrowth between the round cells and cells with short minor processes were assessed, such as cells with a single neurite or bipolar cells with processes no longer than approximately 4–5 diameters of the cell body or between cells with well developed ramified processes. The average length or number of neurites was obtained by dividing the total length by the number of cells within a given field or by dividing the total number of neurites by the number of cells within a given field. Western Blot Analyses—For analysis of active MAP kinase and CREB, cell lysates were prepared from the primary cortical neuronal cultures. The neuronal cultures were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 4 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The total cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant was analyzed by the immunoblot. Proteins were denatured, reduced, and separated by 4–12% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex, San Diego, CA). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 380 mA for 60 min, and the blotted membrane was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature. The blots were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against phospho-MAP kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) or phospho-CREB-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 containing 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. The phospho-MAP kinase detects the active form of MAP kinase dually phosphorylated at Thr183 and Tyr185. The phospho-CREB antibody recognizes the active form of CREB phosphorylated at Ser133. From the same blots, actin (AC-40, Sigma) was detected by specific monoclonal antibody to ensure that equal protein was present in each lane. Immunoreactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG developed with a chemiluminescent reagent and exposed to film. Analyses with a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer were recorded as the percentages of the sister cultures. Intracellular Calcium Measurement—Intracellular calcium was determined for individual cells using standard microscopic Fluo-3 digital imaging (15Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14458-14466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were loaded with 1 μm Fluo-3/AM, and live video imagines of selected microscopic fields were recorded with a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and digitized by computer with a Bio-Rad imaging time course software (Imaging Research Inc.). The somata of ∼5–10 cells in each microscopic field were individually measured. Intracellular calcium levels were estimated by converting fluorescent intensity to intracellular calcium concentration using the following formula: [Ca2+]i = Kd(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F). Calibration was done in vitro using Fluo-3 salt (100 μm) in solutions of known calcium concentrations (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and in vivo under saturating calcium concentrations facilitated by introducing extracellular calcium into cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 (Molecular Probes). The calcium calibration in vivo was consistent with calcium calibration in vitro, and the in vitro calibrations were applied in the current study. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (∼23 °C). Transfection of Neurons with LRP—Primary mouse cortical neurons were cultured in neurobasal medium with B-27 supplement. Transient transfection of the cells was performed using a calcium phosphate method (21Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Mikhailenko I. Rebeck G.W. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8354-8361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated into 4-well chambers 1 day before the transfection with an expression vector of LRP fused to EGFP, which was generated from ligating human LRP cDNA digested with restriction enzymes of XhoI and Bsu36I and synthetic oligomers of 5′-TGAGGACGAGATAGGGGACCCCTTGGCAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTGCCAAGGGGTCCCCTATCTCGTCC-3′ containing the last part of LRP without a stop codon and HindIII site. These then were inserted into the XhoI and HindIII sites of expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). A mixture of 8 μg of plasmid DNA, 9 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2, and 100 μl of water were made in 100 μl of HEPES buffered saline and left for 15–30 min at room temperature. 25 μl of this mixture then was added to the cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in each well. Cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after 20 min and maintained in the conditioned medium collected before transfection. LRP-EGFP expression in primary neurons was not detectable until 18 h after transfection. It was measured 48 h after transfection by confocal microscopy. Microscopic images of LRP-EGFP from random fields were captured and digitized by Bio-Rad software. Control cells transfected with vector alone demonstrated no fluorescence. Chemicals—Recombinant human α2M (Sigma) was activated with methylamine and stored at -20 °C for no more than 2–3 weeks. Recombinant human RAP was prepared from a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as described previously (22Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BayK 8644 (Research Biochemicals, Inc.) at 10 μm was used to increase the intracellular calcium by opening the calcium channels on the cell membrane. BAPTA-AM (Research Biochemicals Inc.) was used at 10 μm to chelate intracellular calcium. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Research Biochemicals Inc.) was used at 40 nm to activate protein kinase C. PD98058 (Calbiochem) was used at 50 μm to inhibit the activation of MAP kinase. Stock solutions of BAPTA-AM (50 mm), PD98058 (37 mm), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 μm) were prepared in Me2SO. The final concentration of Me2SO was not more than 0.025% in the cell bath solution at the final concentration. In control experiments, Me2SO had no effects by itself. Stock solutions of BayK were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mm. The final concentration of ethanol was not more than 0.01% in the cell bath solution. In control experiments, ethanol had no effects by itself. Recombinant apoE was purchased from Oxford Biomedical Research (Rochester Hills, MI). An apoE peptide consisting of a tandem repeat of apoE amino acids 141–149 including the receptor-binding domain (23Tolar M. Marques M.A. Harmony J.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5678-5686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Keith Crutcher (University of Cincinnati). Data Analysis—For calcium studies, each protocol consisted of two or three culture sets of cortical neurons in which 5–15 neuronal somata in each field were measured. For immunohistochemical, calcium, and biochemical studies, the data from several cultures were pooled for statistical analyses. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference. Effects of α2M* on Neurite Outgrowth and LRP Distribution in Cultured Cortical Neurons—Cortical neurons obtained from 16-day-old embryonic mice show distinctive developmental changes during the culture period, thus providing an accessible developmental model for analyzing neurite outgrowth. Neurons were treated with 500 nm α2M* for 48–72 h, and total neurite length and numbers were assessed. Fig. 1A shows the micrographs of α2M*-induced morphological changes. Microtubules in the primary neuronal cultures were detected by antibody MAP2 (in red). The expression of LRP in the primary neuronal cultures was detected by antibody R829 (in green). The individual length and numbers of neurites were substantially increased in α2M*-treated neurons. In addition, the expression of LRP was also increased and diffusely distributed on the neurites. The averaged data in Fig. 1B illustrate that the treatment of primary neuronal cultures with α2M* significantly increased neurite length (by 72%) and neurite numbers (by 139%). To test whether the increase in neurite outgrowth was because of α2M* binding to LRP, we co-incubated cultures with RAP, which blocks the interactions between LRP and its ligands. The α2M*-induced increase in neurite outgrowth was eliminated by co-incubation with RAP in primary neuronal culture (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the expression of LRP was restricted to the soma of neurons by RAP treatment. These data suggest that α2M* exerts its effect via binding to LRP, because α2M*-induced effects on neurite outgrowth could be eliminated by RAP. We hypothesized that LRP ligands might alter the turnover of LRP, contributing to their effects on neurite outgrowth. To investigate whether the distribution of LRP correlated with neurite outgrowth, we transfected primary cortical neurons with full-length LRP tagged with GFP and exposed neurons to LRP ligands for 48 h (Fig. 2). LRP expression in transfected primary neurons was substantially increased by α2M* and apoE3, which also promoted neurite outgrowth. Similar effects were obtained from a tandem apoE peptide (100 nm) containing only the receptor-binding region. Both purified apoE (24Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Fagan A.M. LaDu M.J. Yu L. Han X. Gross R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Qiu Z. Crutcher K.A. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and this tandem apoE peptide (23Tolar M. Marques M.A. Harmony J.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5678-5686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) interact with LRP. RAP treatment alone dramatically altered LRP expression, redistributing LRP from the neurites to the soma. This redistribution of LRP may contribute to the inhibitory effects of RAP in our sets of experiments. Time-dependent Effects of α2M* on the Levels of Phospho-MAP Kinase—To examine the role of MAP kinase in neurite outgrowth in response to α2M* stimulus, phospho-MAP kinase (Thr183/Tyr185) was measured in primary cortical neurons treated with α2M* with an antibody against this active form of MAP kinase. In both control- and α2M*-treated neurons, phospho-MAP kinase (p42/44) was detectable at all time points in cell lysates. α2M* increased the phospho-MAP kinase levels at 30 min, and this increase disappeared by 48 h (Fig. 3A). To test whether the LRP-mediated pathway was involved in the effects of α2M* on the levels of phospho-MAP kinase, we co-incubated cultures with RAP (500 nm) to block the interactions between LRP and α2M*. Surprisingly, RAP alone also increased the levels of phospho-MAP kinase at 5, 15, and 30 min and 48 h (Fig. 3B). However, there was no change in the phospho-MAP kinase level when the neurons were co-cultured with α2M* and RAP. These results suggest that the effect of α2M* on phospho-MAP kinase is a time-dependent process. To address whether these effects were because of binding to LRP or another member of the LDL receptor family, we treated cells with an antibody raised against holo-LRP. This antibody, but not the one directed against the LRP intracellular domain, increased the levels of phospho-MAP kinase (Fig. 3C). Thus, the activation of LRP alone can increase the levels of phospho-MAP kinase. The effect of PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation, was used to determine whether the enhancement in the levels of active MAP kinase was necessary for the α2M*-induced increase in neurite outgrowth. Fig. 4 shows the effects of PD98059 on the α2M*-induced increases in phospho-MAP kinase levels (panel A) and neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4, B and C). When the neurons were co-incubated with PD98059, α2M* did not induce a visible increase either in phospho-MAP kinase levels (Fig. 4A) or in neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that the changes in neurite outgrowth produced by α2M* required activation of MAP kinase in primary cortical neurons.Fig. 4The effects of α2M* on the neurite outgrowth are mediated by the activation of MAP kinase (MAPK). PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation, was used to determine whether the activation of MAP kinase was necessary for the increase in neurite outgrowth by α2M*. The representative immunoblot of the effects of α2M* on the levels of MAP kinase is shown in panel A in which the neurons were co-incubated with PD98059 (50 μm) for 30 min. Panels B is the representative micrograph of the effects of α2M* on neurite outgrowth in the presence and in the absence of PD98059. Microtubules were detected by antibody MAP2 (bar = 60 μm). The averaged data include neurite length (open bar) and neurite number (solid bar) from each group (panel C). Results were pooled from two to three sets of cultures, and each culture includes five fields containing 3–5 cells/field. *, p < 0.05 versus control; +, p < 0.05 versus α2M*-treated group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interaction of α2M*, Intracellular Calcium, and Phosphorylation of MAP Kinase—We have previously reported that α2M* altered calcium influx via the NMDA receptor (15Qiu Z.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14458-14466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), affecting both endogenous calcium oscillations and calcium influx after NMDA stimulation. Here we observed that calcium oscillations in the cortical cultures often were synchronized among several neurons in a microscopic field, suggesting that the network synaptic activity played a role in the generation of the oscillations. Bath application of tetrodotoxin, a treatment that blocks synaptic transmission in the neuronal cultures, blocked the intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (data not shown), consistent with a dependence of the oscillations on network synaptic activity. The synchronized calcium oscillations across neurons in a microscopic field depend on NMDA receptor activation (15Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14458-14466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and on calcium release from intracellular calcium stores. α2M* dramatically reduced the amplitude of spontaneous intracellular calcium oscillations in cortical neurons (Fig. 5A). This alteration of synchronized calcium oscillations by α2M* remained when neurons were co-cultured with RAP (Fig. 5B). Calcium transients encode information across a range of frequencies and direct neurite extension (26Berridge M.J. Rapp P.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1979; 81: 217-279PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tsien R.W.

Because of its unique physiological and biochemical properties, it serves as a potential target for development of novel antibacterial agents. In this study, we report the production, isolation, and structure determination of a family of structurally related novel lipoglycopeptides from a Streptomyces sp. as inhibitors of SPase I. Detailed spectroscopic analyses, including MS and NMR, revealed that these lipoglycopeptides share a common 14-membered cyclic peptide core, an acyclic tripeptide chain, and a deoxy-α-mannose sugar, but differ in the degree of oxidation of the N-methylphenylglycine residue and the length and branching of the fatty acyl chain. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that these peptides are potent and competitive inhibitors of SPase I with Ki 50 to 158 nm. In addition, they showed modest antibacterial activity against a panel of pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with minimal inhibitory concentration of 8–64 μm against Streptococcus pneumonniae and 4–8 μm against Escherichia coli.

Cleavage of precursors by SPase leads to the release of secreted proteins from the outer surface of cytoplasmic membrane. In bacteria, two major SPases, SPase I and SPase II with different cleavage specificities, have been identified. SPase I is responsible for processing the majority of secreted proteins (1Paetzel M.

Bacterol. 2001; 183: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The active domain of bacterial SPase I is exposed to the surface of cytoplasmic membrane as revealed by sequence and topological analysis (10Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moore K.E. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8806-8813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee J.I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus is accessible to potential inhibitors. In addition, SPases from bacteria and eukaryotic cells are different in composition, location, and possibly catalytic mechanism (13Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Black M.T. J.

These differences make it possible to identify selective bacterial SPase I inhibitors without toxicity to mammalian cells. SPase I belongs to a novel class of serine protease that utilize a serine and a lysine to form a unique catalytic dyad for peptide hydrolysis (14Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Black M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4957-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M.

Because of this unique catalytic mechanism, they are not sensitive to the classic protease inhibitors (2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M.

The first effective inhibitor of bacterial SPase I was described in 1994 by Kuo and colleagues (19Kuo D. Weidner J. Griffin P. Shah S.K. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8347-8354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), who reported that β-lactams could inhibit Escherichia coli SPase I in a pH- and time-dependent manner (19Kuo D. Weidner J. Griffin P. Shah S.K. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8347-8354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Certain β-lactams have also been shown to be effective irreversible inhibitors of a number of serine proteases and hydrolases, such as elastase (20Wilmouth R.C. Kassamally S. Westwood N.J.

Researchers at Smith-Kline Beecham have extensively studied β-lactam (or penem)-type inhibitors against E. coli SPase I (24Allsop A.E. Brook G. Bruton G. Coulton S. Edwards P.D. Hatton I.K.

Antibiot. 1996; 49: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, allyl (5S,6S)-6-((R)-acetoxyethyl)-penem-3-carboxylate (5S,6S-penem) is one of the most potent inhibitors of E. coli SPase I reported thus far. In previous studies, we cloned the gene encoding SPase I of Streptococcus pneumoniae and identified the precursor of streptokinase as a native substrate of the enzyme (9Peng S.B. Wang L. Moomaw J. Peery R.B. Sun P.M. Johnson R.B. Lu J. Treadway P. Skatrud P.L. Wang Q.M. J. Bacterol. 2001; 183: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consequently, we developed a fluorescent peptide substrate, KLTF-GTVK(Abz)PVQAIAGY(NO2)EWL and a continuous fluorimetric assay for this enzyme (26Peng S.B. Zheng F. Angleton E.L. Smiley D. Carpenter J. Scott J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this report we identify a family of novel lipoglycopeptides from a microbial source, which are potent inhibitors of bacterial SPase I and are able to inhibit the growth of clinically relevant bacteria. Bacterial Strains—S. pneumoniae R6 was an unencapsulated D39 derivative (27Hoskins J. Alborn Jr., W.E. Arnold J. Blaszczak L.C. Burgett S. DeHoff B.S. Estrem S.T. Fritz L. Fu D.J. Fuller W.

Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33592 was a gentamicin and methicillin-resistant, β-lactamase-producing strain (29Schaefler S. Jones D. Perry W. Ruvinskaya L. Baradet T. Mayr E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 13: 754-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 and S. aureus ATCC 13709 were commonly used bacterial strains for MIC studies. E. coli K12, EL683 (K12MG1655, envA1 zac3051::Tn10), and EL744 (K12MG1655, ΔtolC::kanr) were from our laboratory collection. Streptomyces sp. utilized for lipoglycopeptide production was deposited in ATCC (ATCC PTA-3546). Purification of S. pneumoniae SPase I—Recombinant S. pneumoniae SPase I was purified as described previously (9Peng S.B. Wang L. Moomaw J. Peery R.B. Sun P.M. Johnson R.B. Lu J. Treadway P. Skatrud P.L. Wang Q.M. J. Bacterol. 2001; 183: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purification of E. coli SPase I—The gene encoding E. coli SPase I was cloned by PCR. Two primers, 5′-GATCGTTCATATGGTTCGTTCATTTCTTTATGAACCCTTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGCTAACTCGAGGGCAGCGTGAACGATCATTTCATCACAG-3′, were synthesized according to the published sequence (10Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moore K.E. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8806-8813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vector pET15b-EcoliSPase was constructed by replacing the NdeI and XhoI fragments of pET15b with the PCR fragment. For expression of E. coli SPase I, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET15b-EcoliSPase, grown, and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (30Studier F.W. Rosenburg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Because overexpressed E. coli SPase I was aggregated in the inclusion body, the purification went through a denaturing and refolding process. Typically, 1 liter of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET15b-EcoliSPase were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and sonicated for 5 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was then sonicated for 5 min in 20 ml of denaturing buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 8 m urea. After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5 ml of pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column that was then washed with 120 ml of refolding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaC1, 15 mm imidazole) containing a continuous urea gradient from 6 to 1 m with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein was finally eluted with 30 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 1 m urea, and 100 mm imidazole), and 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We found that 1 m urea in the elution buffer increased the recovery of active enzyme, and did not influence the enzymatic activity (data not shown). HPLC Analysis of Peptide Substrate Cleavage by S. pneumoniae and E. coli SPase I—Previously described peptide substrates, KLTFGTVKPVQAIAGYEWL and KLTFGTVK(Abz)PVQAIAGY(NO2)EWL, were utilized for HPLC analysis (26Peng S.B. Zheng F. Angleton E.L. Smiley D. Carpenter J. Scott J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Typically, cleavage assay was performed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 μg of E. coli lipid extract, 0.05 μm SPase I, and 100 μm substrate. Reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by addition of an equal amount of 8 m urea. Cleavage of peptide substrate was determined by HPLC using a Hewlett Packard Series 1100 system equipped with an autosampler. Fermentation—An aliquot (100 μl) of Streptomyces culture (ATCC PTA-3546) was inoculated into 20 ml of a vegetative medium (31Zahn J.A. Higgs R.E. Hilton M.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and incubated at 30 °C at 165 rpm. After 72 h, 2 ml of the vegetative culture was transferred to 800 ml of fermentation medium (31Zahn J.A. Higgs R.E. Hilton M.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), incubated at 30 °C at 250 rpm, and harvested after 96 h. Isolation of Lipoglycopeptides—The cell pellet from 32 liters of broth was extracted 2× with 5 liters of CH3OH. The combined extracts were concentrated to 500 ml and partitioned with 500 ml of CH3OH and 2× 1 liter of EtOAc. The combined EtOAc layers were evaporated (49 g), suspended in 300 ml of 3:1 (v/v) CH3OH/H2O, and filtered. The filtrate was diluted with 600 ml of H2O and applied onto a 500 ml of TosoHaas Amberchrom CG161m column equilibrated with 3:1 (v/v) H2O/CH3OH. The column was sequentially eluted with 4× 500 ml of 3:1 (v/v) H2O/CH3OH, 4× 500 ml of 1:1 (v/v) H2O/CH3OH, and 8× 500 ml of CH3OH. The first 2 liters of CH3OH effluent were concentrated (2 g) and chromatographed over a Sephadex LH-20 column (7.5 × 39 cm, Amersham Biosciences) with CH3OH as the solvent. The effluent containing the lipoglycopeptides was evaporated (960 mg) and further chromatographed over a Waters SymmetryPrep C18 column (50 × 250 mm, 7 μm, flow rate 45 ml/min, 35–70% CH3CN gradient buffered with 0.05% NH4OAc over 48 min and holding at 70% CH3CN for 24 min). 45 ml of fractions were collected and combined to yield three fractions, A (172 mg), B (370 mg), and C (128 mg). Fraction C was further chromatographed over a PolyLC polyhydroxyethyl aspartamide column (25.4 × 250 mm, 12 μm, flow rate 25 ml/min, 95–70% CH3CN gradient buffered with 0.05% NH4OAc over 50 min and holding at 70% for 22 min) to yield two additional fractions, fraction D (40 mg) mostly containing lipoglycopeptides 1 and 2, and fraction E (12.5 mg) containing lipoglycopeptides 3, 4, and 5. Rechromatography of fraction D over a Waters SymmetryPrep C18 column (7.8 × 300 mm, 7 μm, flow rate 4.7 ml/min, 40–55% CH3CN gradient buffered with 0.05% NH4OAc over 60 min) produced 11.7 mg of lipoglycopeptide 1 and 4.1 mg of lipoglycopeptide 2. Repeated chromatography of fraction E twice as described above yielded 0.3 mg of lipoglycopeptide 3, 0.5 mg of lipoglycopeptide 4, and 3.2 mg of lipoglycopeptide 5. Fraction A was chromatographed over a PolyLC polyhydroxyethyl aspartamide column (95–65% CH3CN gradient over 48 min and holding at 65% CH3CN for 24 min) to furnish fraction F (90 mg) containing lipoglycopeptides 6 and 7, and fraction G (51 mg) containing lipoglycopeptide 8. Rechromatography of fraction F over a Waters SymmetryPrep C18 column (19 × 300 mm, 7 μm, flow rate 17 ml/min, 25–40% CH3CN gradient buffered with 0.05% NH4OAc over 48 min and holding at 40% CH3CN for 24 min) yielded 9 mg of enriched lipoglycopeptide 6 and 11 mg of enriched lipoglycopeptide 7. Each sample was re-purified as detailed above to yield 3.7 mg of lipoglycopeptide 6 and 2.3 mg of lipoglycopeptide 7. Similar chromatography of fraction G gave 6.4 mg of lipoglycopeptide 8. The purity of isolated peptides was determined by analytical chromatography over a Waters Symmetry C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm, flow rate 1 ml/min, 35–70% CH3CN gradient over 15 min). Amino Acid Analysis—Amino acid analysis of lipoglycopeptide 1 was performed as described (32Irvine G.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar). Deacylation of Lipoglycopeptides 7 and 8—A solution containing mostly lipoglycopeptides 7 and 8 (200 mg) in 20 ml of CH3CN/H2O/trifluororacetic acid (6:3:1) was stirred for 90 h at room temperature. The mixture was purified over a PolyLC polyhydroxyethyl aspartamide column (50.8 × 250 mm, 12 μm, flow rate 45 ml/min, 90–50% CH3CN gradient buffered with 0.05% NH4OAc over 72 min) to yield two fractions. These fractions were further purified independently over a CG161 column (85 ml) to yield 10.7 and 14 mg of glycopeptides 9 and 10, respectively. LC-MS Study—LC-MS analysis was carried out on a Waters Alliance 2690 Separations Module coupled with a Platform LCZ mass spectrometer. ESI spectra were collected with capillary and sample cone potentials set at 3000 and 50 V, respectively. Accurate mass determination was performed using a Micromass Q-TOF 1 quadrupole/orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Desvancosamine ion of vancomycin (m/z 1305.3434) was used as the lock mass in all accurate mass determinations. NMR Study—NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Inova spectrometer equipped with a pulse-field gradient module and a Nalorac Z-SPEC microdual 3-mm probe, operating at 500 MHz for 1H and 125.7 MHz for 13C. Proton and carbon chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solvent signal (CD3OH or CD3OD) at 3.30 and 49 ppm, respectively. Two-dimensional experiments including TOCSY, DQCOSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY were performed using Varian standard pulse sequences. IC50 Determination—IC50 was determined by fluorimetric assay as described (26Peng S.B. Zheng F. Angleton E.L. Smiley D. Carpenter J. Scott J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Standard reaction (50 μl) contained 50 nm of either E. coli or S. pneumoniae SPase I, 50 μm substrate and different concentrations of an inhibitor. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h for E. coli SPase I and 2 h for S. pneumoniae SPase I. IC50 was calculated using nonlinear regression method with GraphPad Prism Software. Kinetic Analysis—Kinetic analysis was performed with E. coli SPase I and the non-fluorescent peptide substrate, KLTFGTVKPVQAIAGYEWL by HPLC assay. Typically, a reaction (50 μl) containing 50 nmE. coli SPase I, different concentrations of the substrate and an inhibitor, was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and terminated by the addition of an equal amount of 8 m urea. The substrate cleavage was analyzed by HPLC. The initial rate, Ki, and type of inhibition were calculated with Sigma Plot 2000, version 6.2 with enzyme kinetics module. Determination of in Vitro Antibacterial Activity—In vitro antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution assay as recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (33National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically: Standard M7-A2. 2nd Ed. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Villanova, PA1990Google Scholar). The growth media utilized for MIC determination were cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth for S. aureus and E. coli strains, Todd-Hewitt broth for S. pneumoniae,or Haemophilus test medium for H. influenzae (33National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically: Standard M7-A2. 2nd Ed. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Villanova, PA1990Google Scholar). Bacterial strains used for antibacterial assay include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (S. pneumoniae R6, S. aureus ATCC13709, H. influenzae ATCC 49247, and E. coli strains EL683, EL744, and K12). Typically, a 2-fold serial dilution of the test compound was performed in a sterile 96-well microplate. The microplate was then incubated for 23–24 h at 37 °C. The MIC was determined by visual examination of the microplate with the aid of a magnifying mirror apparatus. MIC is the lowest concentration of compound that showed no visible sign of bacterial growth. β-Lactamase Secretion Assay—S. aureus ATCC 33592, a gentamicin- and methicillin-resistant, and β-lactamase-producing strain (29Schaefler S. Jones D. Perry W. Ruvinskaya L. Baradet T. Mayr E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 13: 754-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in a series dilution in brain heart infusion (from BD Biosciences, a semi-synthetic casein acid hydrolysate medium supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract) in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2 overnight. The cultures with A620 less than 0.3 were centrifuged and resuspended with fresh brain heart infusion to make the initial A620 to 0.15–0.2. The selected inhibitor at different concentrations was added to the mixture, which was then incubated for 2 h. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was saved for determination of secreted β-lactamase. The resultant pellet was washed once with fresh brain heart infusion medium and resuspended in same volume of fresh brain heart infusion medium. After 3 cycles of freeze-thaw, the mixture was used for measurement of retained β-lactamase. For determination of β-lactamase activity, typically, a 100-μl reaction containing 30 μl of supernatant or lysed cells was incubated with 250 μm nitrocefin in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 30–60 min. The absorbance at 482 nm (A482) was measured at the beginning and end of the reaction. The secreted and the retained β-lactamase activities were calculated based upon ΔA482. Production and Purification of Lipoglycopeptides—To identify novel inhibitors of bacterial SPase I, 50,000 pre-fractionated natural product samples were screened in a high-throughput screen using the fluorimetric assay (26Peng S.B. Zheng F. Angleton E.L. Smiley D. Carpenter J. Scott J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This led to the identification of a single sample derived from a microbial source with reproducible activity. Further fractionation of limited amounts of this sample resulted in the identification of two isomeric components responsible for the activity. UV-visible and MS-based literature searches revealed that the active components might be novel. To fully characterize and study their antibiotic properties, we undertook a large scale fermentation. Fermentation followed by chromatographic purification resulted in the isolation of eight closely related lipoglycopeptides 1–8. The purity of compounds, except lipoglycopeptide 3 (92%), used for structural and biochemical studies exceeded 98% as determined by HPLC. The purity was estimated based on evaporative light scattering detector response (data not shown). Structure Determination of Lipoglycopeptides—The two most abundant new isomeric lipoglycopeptides 1 and 2 showed identical molecular composition (C52H78N6O16) as determined by high resolution ESIMS (calculated 1043.5553 (M + H), observed 1043.5531 and 1043.5551, respectively). The structures were primarily deduced by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1). After trial and error, the optimum resolution of the amide proton signals of lipoglycopeptide 1 was observed at 10 °C in CD3OH solution. The NMR results of lipoglycopeptide 1 reported in Table I were obtained after a detailed analysis of 1H, 13C, DQCOSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and HMBC, which revealed the presence of four common amino acid residues, i.e. glycine, two alanines, and N-methylserine, in addition to two uncommon aromatic amino acid residues, i.e. a 3-substituted tyrosine and a 3,4,5-trisubstituted N-methylphenylglycine. Consistent with this observation, the amino acid analysis revealed the presence of glycine and alanine in a ratio of 1:2.Table I1H and 13C NMR chemical shift assignments of lipoglycopeptide 1 in CD3OHAAPositionδHMultiplicity (J Hz)δCaChemical shifts derived from HSQC and HMBC data.NMeSerN-CH33.09s33.7CO171.8α4.97dd (8,6)60.9β14.02dd (11.5,6)60.6β23.91dd (11.5,8)Ala-1NH8.33d (7.5)CO175.2α4.47Quint (7.5)50.4β1.38d (7.5)18.0GlyNH8.30t (5.5)CO171.5α 14.22dd (17,5.5)42.4α 24.07dd (17,5.5)Phe-GlyN-CH32.82s32.6CO171.8α6.25br s61.81132.426.77br s117.03151.64143.85135.766.47d (1.5)126.8Ala-2NH8.54d (8.5)CO173.4α4.79Quint (7.5)50.6β1.31d (7)19.2TyrNH8.35d (8)CO178.4α4.56m56.2β13.38dd (16.5,3)35.5β23.07dd (16,9)1130.126.86d (1.5)134.03127.54153.356.78d (8)117.367.03dd (8,1.5)130.7Sugar1′5.36Obsc103.92′4.26br m72.13′3.75dd (9.5,3)72.34′3.26t (9.5)73.25′3.19dq (9.5,6.5)71.46′0.64d (6.5)17.4Side chain1″176.92″2.44t (7)34.53″1.60Quint (7)26.04″1.31 obsc.30.65″-12″1.27s30.9 to 30.313″1.50m (7)29.014″1.15q (7)40.115″0.86d (6)23.016″0.86d (6)23.0a Chemical shifts derived from HSQC and HMBC data. Open table in a new tab The other prominent features in the NMR spectra of lipoglycopeptide 1 included resonances for a 6-deoxy sugar and a fatty acyl chain. In accordance with the proposed molecular formula and MS/MS, the number of carbons in the acyl chain was determined to be 16 (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, the NMR spectrum suggested that the acyl chain terminated with an isopropyl group in lipoglycopeptide 1 (δH 0.86, d, J = 6 Hz, 6 protons) and with a normal methyl group in lipoglycopeptide 2 (δH 0.89, t, J = 7 Hz, 3 protons), which, in fact, is the only structural difference between 1 and 2. The HMBC cross-peaks observed from the amide carbonyl carbon (δ 176.9) of N-methylserine to the CH2 protons (δ 2.44) of the acyl chain, N-CH3 protons (δ 3.09) of N-methylserine, and α proton (δ 4.97) of the N-methylserine strongly suggested attachment of the long fatty acyl chain on the N terminus of N-methylserine (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the HMBC correlations observed from the sugar anomeric proton (δ 5.36) and the mutually coupled phenylglycine protons (δ 6.47 and 6.77) to the same carbon (δ 143.8, C-4 of N-methylphenylglycine) clearly indicated that the 6-deoxysugar unit was attached to the 4 position of the phenylglycine through a glycosidic linkage (anomeric carbon resonance at δ 103.9). The HMBC data (13C–1H correlations between the carbonyl and the adjacent amino acid amide proton and/or proton attached to the α carbon) established the linear amino acid sequence as N-methylserine-alani"

Plants lacking PSI-O have a 50% reduction in state transitions indicating a role for PSI-O in the balancing of excitation energy between the two photosystems.

https://openalex.org/W1990835251,"To study how oligomerization may contribute to the thermostability of archaeon proteins, we focused on a hexameric protein, protein l-isoaspartyl-O-methyltransferase from Sulfolobus tokodaii (StoPIMT). The crystal structure shows that StoPIMT has a distinctive hexameric structure composed of monomers consisting of two domains: an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase fold domain and a C-terminal α-helical domain. The hexameric structure includes three interfacial contact regions: major, minor, and coiled-coil. Several C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed and characterized. The hexameric structure and thermostability were retained when the C-terminal α-helical domain (Tyr206-Thr231) was deleted, suggesting that oligomerization via coiled-coil association using the C-terminal α-helical domains did not contribute critically to hexamerization or to the increased thermostability of the protein. Deletion of three additional residues located in the major contact region, Tyr203-Asp204-Asp205, led to a significant decrease in hexamer stability and chemico/thermostability. Although replacement of Thr146 and Asp204, which form two hydrogen bonds in the interface in the major contact region, with Ala did not affect hexamer formation, these mutations led to a significant decrease in thermostability, suggesting that two residues in the major contact region make significant contributions to the increase in stability of the protein via hexamerization. These results suggest that cooperative hexamerization occurs via interactions of “hot spot” residues and that a couple of interfacial hot spot residues are responsible for enhancing thermostability via oligomerization.

Thermophilic organisms grow optimally at temperatures of >70 °C. The proteins isolated from these organisms are usually more thermostable than homologous proteins from mesophiles, despite the fact that they have similar three-dimensional structures and identical catalytic mechanisms to the mesophilic proteins as well as sequence homologies of 40-85% (1Chakravarty S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8152-8161Google Scholar). Extensive studies have focused on identifying key determinants or common factors responsible for the thermostability of thermophile proteins, and the following structural features have been proposed as responsible for the high thermostability: decreased solvent-exposed surface area (2Chan M.K.

The structures include an AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold, which is a modified Rossman fold consisting of a central seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices on both sides; this structure is common to the entire AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase family, including those having DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and small molecules as substrates for methyltransferase reactions (33Cheng X.

Some reports have shown correlations between oligomerization and the hyperthermostability of archaeon proteins (20Ogasahara K. Khechinashvili N.N. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3233-3242Google Scholar, 21Thoma R. Hennig M. Sterner R. Kirschner K. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 265-276Google Scholar). Oligomerization is usually through interfacial interaction (34Jaenicke R. Lilie H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 329-401Google Scholar, 35Schlunegger M.P. Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Adv.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 243-251Google Scholar), in which subunits cooperatively interact with each other in several ways (e.g. domain swapping and coiled-coil association). In this report, we first describe the crystal structure of StoPIMT at 2.8-Å resolution. The monomeric structure of StoPIMT consists of two domains, an AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold domain and a distinctive C-terminal α-helical domain. Six monomers associate into a hexamer, in which there are three contact regions per monomer, referred to as the major, minor, and C-terminal α-helical contact regions. We investigated whether and how oligomerization is correlated with enhancement of thermostability by constructing several deletion mutants; our results suggest the existence of “hot spot” residues in the subunit interfaces that function in cooperative oligomerization and in enhancing thermostability via oligomerization. On the basis of these observations, we discuss how oligomerization contributes to the thermostability of this protein. Materials—All enzymes used in genetic engineering were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was obtained from Wako Fine Chemicals Inc. (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were of biochemical research grade. Construction of Expression Vectors for StoPIMT, Various Deletion Mutants, and Mutated StoPIMT—The gene encoding StoPIMT was amplified by KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo), using S. tokodaii genomic DNA as a template and designed primers as follows. NcoI and BamHI sites were incorporated into the ST1123-reverse (5′-NNNNCCATGGCCAGTGAAAAAGAGGAAATATTGAGAAAG-3′) and ST1123-forward (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAAGTTTTCTTTACTAAATTATCTAATATTG-3′) sequences, respectively (restriction enzyme sites are underlined). The PCR products were inserted into the NcoI and BamHI sites of a pET15b-based vector (37Tsumoto K. Shinoki K. Kondo H. Uchikawa M. Juji T. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 219: 119-129Google Scholar, 38Tanaka Y. Tsumoto K. Nakanishi T. Yasutake Y. Sakai N. Yao M. Tanaka I. Kumagai I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 167-174Google Scholar). For construction of expression vectors for the deletion mutants StoPIMT-d205, -d204, -d203, -d202, -d199, and -d197, the primers ST1123-d205 (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAATCATCATAAAAACCGTAAAGACCTCCAATTC-3′), ST1123-d204 (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAATCATAAAAACCGTAAAGACCTCCAATTC-3′), ST1123-d203 (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAATAAAAACCGTAAAGACCTCCAATTCTTCCG-3′), ST1123-d202 (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAAAAACCGTAAAGACCTCCAATTCTTCC-3′), ST1123-d199 (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAAAGACCTCCAATTCTTCCGAACATAACTTC-3′), ST1123-d197 (5′-NNNGGATCCTTAAATTCTTCCGAACATAACTTCCCCTAGGTTC-3′) were synthesized and used instead of ST1123-forward. Other experimental conditions for construction of expression vectors were the same as above. Construction of the expression vector for the StoPIMT-WT-mutant, which is a T146A,D204A double mutant of StoPIMT, and for the StoPIMT-d205-mutant, which is the corresponding double mutant of the deletion mutant StoPIMT-d205, was achieved by PCR mutagenesis. For construction of expression vectors for the StoPIMT-WT mutant, ST1123-reverse, ST1123-forward, and the four synthesized primers described below were used (mutated sites are in italics): ST1123-T146A-reverse, 5′-GCAACAGCACCTGCGCTTCTTTGTAAACC-3′; ST1123-T146A-forward, 5′-GGTTTACAAAGAAGCGCAGGTGCTGTTGC-3′; ST1123-D204A-reverse, 5′-CTTTACGGTTTTTATGCTGATTATGATGATATTG-3′; and ST1123-D204A-forward2, 5′-CAATATCATCATAATC-AGCATAAAAACCGTAAAG-3′. For construction of expression vectors for the StoPIMT-d205 mutant, ST1123-reverse, ST1123-T146A-reverse, ST1123-T146A-forward, and the synthesized primer described below were used (restriction enzyme sites are underlined, and mutated sites are in italics). ST1123-D204A-forward was 5′-NNNGGATCCTTAATC-AGCATAAAAACCGTAAAGACCTCCAATTC-3′. The correctness of the DNA sequences of wild-type and mutants was confirmed by using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Expression and Purification of Wild-type StoPIMT Protein and Various Deletion and/or Point Mutants of StoPIMTs—A transformed Escherichia coli strain, BL21 (DE3) (39Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar), harboring expression vector encoding the protein gene, was grown at 37 °C in LB supplemented with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin until the early stationary phase. To induce expression of the desired protein, Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for 3 h at 37 °C. The selenomethionine derivative of StoPIMT was expressed in a methionine auxotroph, E. coli strain B834(DE3) (40Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Google Scholar), grown in M9 medium supplied with 0.1 mm selenomethionine. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl; and then resuspended in the same buffer. The suspension was sonicated, followed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap QXL column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and then the adsorbed protein was eluted with 100 ml of a 0-0.4 m gradient of NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl. Fractions eluting at 20-35 ml were further purified on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200-pg column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the desired protein were collected and used for further experiments. Crystallization of StoPIMT Proteins—Procedures for crystallization were in principle those followed by Tanaka et al. (38Tanaka Y. Tsumoto K. Nakanishi T. Yasutake Y. Sakai N. Yao M. Tanaka I. Kumagai I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 167-174Google Scholar). StoPIMT was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated to 20 mg ml-1. Initial crystallization conditions were screened by the sparse matrix method at 20 °C, using the Crystal Screen kit and Crystal Screen 2 kit (Hampton Research). Crystals of StoPIMT most suitable for further analyses could be grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.6, 0.8 m lithium sulfate, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. X-ray Diffractions—X-ray diffraction of selenomethionine-substituted StoPIMT was performed on the beamline BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan), under cryogenic conditions (100 K). For multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing, three wavelengths were chosen on the basis of the fluorescence spectrum of the selenium K absorption edge, corresponding to the maximum f″ (peak, 0.9793 Å), minimum f′ (edge, 0.9795 Å), and the reference point (remote, 0.9700 Å). The three-wavelength diffraction data set was collected to a resolution of 2.8 Å with a MAR Research CCD detector. The crystal of selenomethionine-substituted StoPIMT belongs to space group F23 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = c = 277.80 Å. The data were indexed and integrated with the program MOSFLM (41Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF_EAMBC Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992: 26Google Scholar) and were further scaled and merged with the program SCALA in the CCP4 package (42Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The initial phasing and subsequent phase improvement were done with the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (43Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar, 44Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Google Scholar, 45Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Google Scholar). First we performed multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing and phase improvement using the entire three-wavelength data set, which resulted in an uninterpretable electron density map. Therefore, the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion strategy in the program SOLVE was applied for structure solution using only the diffraction data collected at the peak wavelength. SOLVE identified 18 positions of 20 selenium sites and calculated the initial phases with an overall figure of merit of 0.48. A subsequent maximum likelihood density modification performed by RESOLVE increased the overall figure of merit from 0.48 to 0.67. RESOLVE automatically placed 588 of 924 residues (63.4%) in the symmetric unit, and the resultant electron density map was of sufficient quality to rebuild almost all of the chains of StoPIMT easily with the graphics program O (46Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Positional and individual B factor refinement was carried out with the program CNS (47Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), using reflections ranging from 15 to 2.8 Å. A random 10% of all observed reflections were set aside for cross-validation analysis and were used to monitor throughout the refinement by calculating the free R value (Rfree). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used, and the restraint weight was gradually decreased as model refinement progressed. The water molecules were automatically located by peak searching on the SIGMAA-weighted mFo - DFc map, and some water molecules, which occupied irrelevant positions, were deleted on the basis of their real space correlation coefficient and/or maximum density level using the procedure in the program CNS (47Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Finally, the crystallographic R and Rfree values converged to 19.8 and 24.5%, respectively. The stereochemical quality of the final refined model was analyzed with the program PROCHECK (48Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Size Exclusion Chromatographic Analyses of StoPIMT and Its Mutants—Size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad Superdex 200-pg column (16 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) was carried out for analysis of the extent of multimerization of StoPIMT and its mutants. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, and then 2 ml of purified protein was applied to the column at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min-1. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—All DSC measurements were carried out with a nanoDSC II calorimeter (Calorimetry Science Corp.). Proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline buffer (125 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl). The dialysis buffer was used as a reference solution for the DSC scan. Protein samples of 1.2-1.7 mg ml-1 were heated from 0 to 125 °C at a scanning rate of 1 K min-1. CD Spectrometry—To compare the tolerance to GdnHCl of StoPIMT and its mutants, purified and concentrated proteins were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing various concentrations of GdnHCl (0-8 m). After 24 h, CD spectra were measured in an AVIV circular dichroism spectrometer (Proteiron Co.): path length, 1.0 mm; resolution, 0.2 nm; average time, 4 s. The results are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity ([θ]), and [θ] values at 222 nm were plotted as a function of GdnHCl concentration. Crystal Structure of StoPIMT—The crystal structure of StoPIMT was determined at 2.8-Å resolution by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method (Table I). The asymmetric unit contains four StoPIMT monomers with a Matthews' coefficient (VM) value of 4.21 Å3 Da-1 and a solvent content of 70.6%. The monomeric structure was composed of seven β strands (β1-β7) and eight α-helices (α1-α8), forming two domains: the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold domain (blue to gold; Fig. 1A), which is common to all of the enzymes in this family (33Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Google Scholar), and a characteristic C-terminal α-helical domain (red; Fig. 1A). The former is described as a modified Rossman fold consisting of a central seven-stranded β-sheet (β1-β7) flanked by α-helices (α1-α7) on both sides. In contrast to the other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases from various species whose crystal structures have been published (28Skinner M.M. Puvathingal J.M. Walter R.L. Friedman A.M. Struct.

Bjerregaard J. Knapp J.E. Chavous D.A. Friedman A.M. Royer Jr., W.E. O'Connor C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12844-12853Google Scholar). The structure of StoPIMT reported here also included this rearrangement of two β strands (Fig. 1B), and therefore the StoPIMT structure can be superimposed well on the other PIMT structures from T. maritima, P. furiosus, humans, and Drosophila; the respective root mean square differences for superposition are 1.52 Å for 175 Cα atoms, 1.23 Å for 190 Cα atoms, 1.39 Å for 170 Cα atoms, and 1.42 Å for 163 Cα atoms. The C-terminal α-helical domain, which consists of a long loop and one α-helix (α8), protrudes from the methyltransferase fold, and the three α8-helices in three separate monomers related by the crystallographic 3-fold symmetry axis form a unique coiled-coil assembly (Fig. 1D; see “Hexameric Assembly of StoPIMT”). Such a coiled-coil assembly has not been identified in any other solved AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase. We should also note that the C-terminal 30 residues corresponding to this domain show no significant sequence similarity to any sequence in the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL data base (available on the World Wide Web at ca.expasy.org/). In the structure of P. furiosus PIMT, very clear electron density corresponding to the cofactor S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) was recognized (29Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N.

The MUC1 peptide core mediates firm adhesion of tumor cells to adjacent cells via binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). There is increasing evidence that MUC1 is involved in signaling, with current reports focusing on phosphorylation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail after indirect or artificial modes of stimulation.

The MUC1-induced signal appears to be distinct from those previously described, and may involve a Src family kinase, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C, and lipid rafts, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase. As calcium signaling has been associated with cytoskeletal change and motility, it is possible that the functions of MUC1 include heterotypic cell-cell adhesion followed by a calcium-based promigratory signal within tumor cells, thus facilitating metastasis.

Our laboratory has previously identified intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as a natural, endogenous ligand for MUC1 (13Regimbald L.H. Pilarski L.M. Longenecker B.M. Reddish M.A. Zimmermann G. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4244-4249PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kam J.L. Regimbald L.H. Hilgers J.H. Hoffman P. Krantz M.J. Longenecker B.M. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5577-5581PubMed Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is currently the only reported direct ligand for the MUC1 extracellular domain, and binding promotes adhesion of tumor cells to a simulated vessel wall construct under fluid flow conditions (15.Horne, G. (1999) The Role of Breast Cancer Associated MUC1 in Tumor Cell Recruitment to Vascular Endothelium during Physiological Fluid Flow. M.Sc. thesis, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, CanadaGoogle Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate a novel signaling paradigm, in which MUC1 participates in initiating intracellular calcium oscillations after direct stimulation by ICAM-1. As calcium signaling has previously been implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling and motility (16Feldner J.C. Brandt B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that this signal is involved in tumor cell migration. Thus, the MUC1/ICAM-1 interaction may facilitate extravasation of tumor cells after mediating binding to the blood vessel wall. Reagents—The CT2 antibody against the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain and the pC1Neo TR+ FLAG plasmid carrying the MUC1 gene were generously provided by Dr. Sandra Gendler, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ. The MUC1 gene was PCR amplified from the plasmid and inserted into the Clontech pEYFP-N1 plasmid at the BsrGI/NotI cut sites. A synthetic MUC1-specific signal sequence, TCGACTAGGCCTATGACACCGGGCACCCAGTCTCCTTTCTTCCTGCTGCTGCTCCTCACAGTGCTTACAGTTGTTACG, made by the DNA Core Services Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, University of Alberta, was inserted into the multiple cloning site. Fluo-3 was from Molecular Probes. Pluronic F-127, U-73122, U-73343, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, nystatin, wortmannin, MOPC C31 mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody, anti-tubulin B-5-1-2 antibody, and gelatin were from Sigma. PD98059 was from Calbiochem. PP2 and 2-APB were from Tocris. B27.29 antibody against the MUC1 extracellular domain was a gift from Biomira, Inc. ICR5 antibody against human ICAM-3 was a gift of ICOS Corp. Goat anti-mouse phycoerythrin secondary antibody was purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Goat anti-mouse or anti-Armenian hamster peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. ECL Plus was from Amersham Biosciences. FBS and culture media were from Invitrogen. Cells—293T human embryonic kidney epithelial cells were from the ATCC and were transfected with pEYFP-N1/MUC1. These were designated SYM followed by a number indicating subclone identity. For this particular study, five subclones were selected. Cells expressing the YFP tag were not sufficiently fluorescent to interfere with Fluo-3 imaging. T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and Hs578T human breast cancer cells were also from the ATCC. Mock- and ICAM-1-transfected NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were a generous gift of Dr. Ken Dimock, University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Calcium Oscillation Assay—3-cm glass-bottomed dishes were purchased from MatTek. The glass bottoms were coated with 100 μl of FBS (for untransfected cell lines) or a solution of 0.1% (w/v) gelatin in water (for 293T cells). 100 μl of untransfected cell suspension at 1 × 105/ml or MUC1-transfected 293T cells at 5 × 104/ml were plated onto coated cover glasses and allowed to equilibrate overnight. This generally resulted in ∼60% cell confluence the next day. The medium was aspirated from plated cells, and a 1:1 mixture of 5 mm Fluo-3 in Me2SO:20% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 in Me2SO, diluted 1/1000 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS was pipetted over the cells. The plated cells were then incubated with Fluo-3 for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Where indicated, cells were then incubated with 10 μm PD98059, PP2, U-73122, or U-73343, 15 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, 75 μg/ml nystatin, 2 μm wortmannin, or 100 μm 2-APB for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were washed once in 37 °C imaging buffer (152 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.2 (17Oosawa Y. Imada C. Furuya K. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1997; 15: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)), then left in imaging buffer at 37 °C for 30–45 min until imaged. For the antibody blockade experiments, this buffer contained either B27.29 (MUC1 block) or ICR5 (irrelevant block) at 120 μg/ml for 293T MUC1 transfectants and either B27.29 or MOPC C31 (irrelevant block) at 60 μg/ml for T47D cells. NIH 3T3 ICAM-1 or mock transfectants were trypsinized and resuspended in imaging buffer at ∼1.2 × 107/ml. Immediately before photographing, the imaging buffer was decanted, and if blocking antibodies were used, the cells were gently rinsed with warmed imaging buffer. The MatTek dish was then placed in a microscope stage warmer set to 37 °C on a Zeiss Axioscope Digital Imaging Microscope. Using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.), a DIC image was recorded, then 60 images at 3-s intervals were recorded under the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. 100 μl of NIH 3T3 cell suspension was added to the plated cells immediately after the first fluorescein isothiocyanate image was taken so that the calcium flux response of the plated cells was recorded in the remaining 59 images. A final DIC image was taken at the end of the time course to ensure that all plated cells had been covered by the NIH 3T3 cells. In the “reverse” model, NIH 3T3 mock- or ICAM-1-transfected cells were plated on the dish and grown to confluence. MCF-7 cells were loaded with Fluo-3 while in tissue culture flasks, then washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in imaging buffer at ∼5 × 105/ml. MCF-7 cells were then added to the NIH 3T3 cells during imaging. Data Analysis—Using Metamorph software, the images taken for each test condition were built into a stack, and 40 random cells per condition were circled (circled areas = regions of interest or ROI). The changes in average fluorescence intensity for each ROI were graphed over time and exported to MS Excel. Each condition was repeated at least three times, n = a minimum of 120. MS Excel was used to plot the data and calculate the “oscillation factors,” which are defined as the number of oscillation cycles multiplied by the “amplitude factor” for each ROI. The number of oscillation cycles was counted manually from the plotted data. The amplitude factors were calculated by plotting an Excel “LOGEST” trend line (y = intercept × slopex) through the oscillatory portion of the data, then calculating the absolute value of the difference between the actual plotted data and the trend line for each data point; the sum of these differences was defined as the amplitude factor (Fig. 1D). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (4Quin R.J. McGuckin M.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) and subjected to shearing with a 26-gauge needle. Insoluble materials were pelleted, and the supernatant was assessed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad DC assay kit. Equal amounts of protein for each test sample were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels. Resolved gels were transferred to Immobilon-P or PSQ membranes and probed with B27.29 or CT2 antibodies, respectively, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Specific labeling was visualized with ECL Plus, and imaged using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager and ImageQuant 5.2 Software (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were re-probed for tubulin as a loading control. Flow Cytometry—Cells were trypsinized, washed one time in FBS-containing medium, then divided into three aliquots, each of which was incubated with one of 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (BTT, unlabeled control), 5 μg/ml MOPC 31C in BTT (isotype control), or 5 μg/ml B27.29 in BTT, on ice for 1 h in a volume of 30 μl. Cells were washed in a 50× volume of cold PBS, then resuspended in 30 μl of BTT (unlabeled control) or 30 μl of phycoerythrin secondary, 2 μg/ml in BTT for a further 1 h in the dark on ice. Cells were again washed in a 50× volume of cold PBS, then resuspended in 300 μl of PBS and treated with final concentrations of 120 units/ml DNase I and 4.2 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were stored at 4 °C in the dark until analyzed by flow cytometry. At least 10,000 events were recorded on the FL2 (phycoerythrin) channel. As the cells were chilled, unfixed, and unpermeabilized, only surface MUC1 was stained. Statistical Analysis—The Newman-Keuls multiple range comparison was used to determine statistical differences in data sets where there were more than two conditions. Otherwise, the Student's t test was used. Intracellular Calcium in MUC1-positive Cells Increases and Oscillates on Contact with ICAM-1-positive Cells—293T cells, which express no endogenous MUC1, were transfected with the MUC1 construct shown in Fig. 1A, and a series of subclones designated as SYM were isolated. Fig. 1B (QuickTime movie links) shows that a calcium-based response in Fluo-3-loaded SYM1 cells was more intense and oscillatory when these cells came into contact with ICAM-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells, as compared with mock-transfected cells. In SYM3 cells, a subclone not expressing MUC1, the calcium-based responses did not have large oscillations regardless of the presence of ICAM-1. Tracings of the fluorescence intensities over time (Fig. 1C) show more clearly the difference in the SYM1 cells responses and also demonstrate that in SYM3 cells the calcium-based responses to the NIH 3T3 ICAM-1 or mock cells are similar to that seen in the SYM1 cells when ICAM-1 was absent. When observing several cells within a given trial, there were cell-to-cell variations in the oscillation responses, requiring that signals be averaged into oscillation factors (Fig. 1D) to facilitate comparisons between experimental conditions. 40 cells were selected for each trial, chosen randomly on the preexposure DIC image, or a summed stack of the fluorescent images captured over the entire time course. The oscillation factors for a total of 120 individual cells could then be averaged and compared with other test conditions. This overcame potential bias in selecting “representative” tracings in a non-synchronized cell population. Surface Expression of MUC1 Is Required to Induce an ICAM-1-triggered Oscillatory Calcium Signal—A series of human breast cancer cell lines showed a gradient of oscillatory responses when tested in the calcium oscillation assay (Fig. 2A). Two of these cell lines, T47D and MCF-7, displayed statistically significant differences in a t test comparing oscillation factors resulting from contact with NIH 3T3 ICAM-1 or NIH 3T3 mock transfectants (p < 0.0009). A reverse model, in which Fluo-3-loaded MCF-7 cells in suspension were added to adherent NIH 3T3 ICAM-1 or mock transfectants demonstrated that the MCF-7 cells oscillated only on contact with ICAM-1 expressing cells (data not shown); thus the cells did not need to be adherent to respond. A series of SYM (293T MUC1-transfected) cells expressing differing levels of MUC1 also showed higher oscillatory responses after contact with ICAM-1-expressing cells in comparison with mock transfectants (t test, p < 1.5–14; Fig. 2B). Western blotting for the total cellular levels of both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of MUC1 in all tested cell lines suggested that a trend between levels of MUC1 expression and oscillatory response was inconsistent (Fig. 2C); however, flow cytometry analysis without permeabilization showed that although the low oscillating subclone, SYM25, had high total cellular MUC1, surface expression was lower than that observed on SYM1 cells (Fig. 2D). This suggests that only surface MUC1 is able to interact with exogenous ICAM-1 to initiate the calcium signal, and there may be a cell-specific “threshold” of MUC1 expression necessary to elicit a response. The specificity of MUC1 in regulating the calcium-based signal was demonstrated by pretreating SYM or T47D cells with MUC1-blocking or irrelevant antibodies (Fig. 3). Pretreatment with B27.29, which has previously been shown to block MUC1/ICAM-1 interactions (13Regimbald L.H. Pilarski L.M. Longenecker B.M. Reddish M.A. Zimmermann G. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4244-4249PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kam J.L. Regimbald L.H. Hilgers J.H. Hoffman P. Krantz M.J. Longenecker B.M. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5577-5581PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited the oscillatory response, unlike cells pretreated with an irrelevant antibody. Mediators of the MUC1/ICAM-1 Calcium Signal—SYM1 cells were treated with PD98059 (inhibits MAPK), wortmannin (inhibits PI 3-kinase, MAPK, and myosin light chain kinase), or PP2 (inhibits Src family kinases) and compared with an untreated control in the calcium oscillation assay. Wortmannin and PP2, but not PD98059, could reduce the level of oscillations seen in the presence of both MUC1 and ICAM-1 to levels seen when one or both of the molecules were absent (Fig. 4A). 2-APB (inhibits inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum) and U-73122 (inhibits phospholipase C), but not U-73343 (inactive analogue of U-73122), also abrogated oscillatory responses (Fig. 4B). Disruption of lipid rafts by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin also inhibited ICAM-1-induced calcium oscillations in the SYM1 cells (Fig. 4C). The MUC1 glycoprotein is found in virtually all breast cancers, with tumor-specific variation in expression levels and cellular distribution. The tumor-specific form of MUC1 is also underglycosylated, exposing the protein core. Previous work in our laboratory (13Regimbald L.H. Pilarski L.M. Longenecker B.M. Reddish M.A. Zimmermann G. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4244-4249PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kam J.L. Regimbald L.H. Hilgers J.H. Hoffman P. Krantz M.J. Longenecker B.M. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5577-5581PubMed Google Scholar) has focused on the role of MUC1 in metastasis. We reported that tumor cell MUC1 can bind to endothelial cell ICAM-1 (13Regimbald L.H. Pilarski L.M. Longenecker B.M. Reddish M.A. Zimmermann G. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4244-4249PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kam J.L. Regimbald L.H. Hilgers J.H. Hoffman P. Krantz M.J. Longenecker B.M. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5577-5581PubMed Google Scholar) with sufficient strength to withstand shear stresses equivalent to physiologic blood flow (15.Horne, G. (1999) The Role of Breast Cancer Associated MUC1 in Tumor Cell Recruitment to Vascular Endothelium during Physiological Fluid Flow. M.Sc. thesis, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, CanadaGoogle Scholar), suggesting that the MUC1/ICAM-1 interaction could be involved in facilitating the extravasation of blood borne metastases out of the circulatory system. Our current study demonstrates that the MUC1/ICAM-1 interaction can trigger an intracellular oscillatory calcium-based signal in MUC1-expressing epithelial cells, an observation that held true whether MCF-7 cells were adherent or in suspension. The MUC1/ICAM-1 oscillatory calcium signal appears to differ from the previously described MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) phosphotyrosine-based signal(s) (2Wang H. Lillehoj E.P. Kim K.C. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13057-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) reported that the MUC1-CD is phosphorylated by EGFR after stimulation with EGF with subsequent activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. This activation was not associated with proliferation as assayed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen activation (9Schroeder J.A. Thompson M.C. Gardner M.M. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13057-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In other work, the same group has implicated the MUC1-CD in the disassembly of focal adhesions and increased cellular migration through a transwell membrane (10Schroeder J.A. Adriance M.C. Thompson M.C. Camenisch T.D. Gendler S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Since EGFR activation of MAPK/ERK has also been implicated in migratory processes (16Feldner J.C. Brandt B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the MUC1/ICAM-1 calcium signal may function in parallel with MUC1-CD phosphotyrosine-based signaling. It is significant that we are using ICAM-1 to induce calcium flux, since it is a plausible, physiologically relevant MUC1 ligand, and the oscillatory response is strongly suggestive of a definite signal, as the frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillations encode instructions to activate specific proteins (20Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Possible downstream calcium-sensitive targets of this signal may include gelsolin (21Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), calpain (22Perrin B.J. Huttenlocher A. Int. J. Biochem.

Sci. 2002; 47: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which are involved in cytoskeletal restructuring, focal adhesion disassembly, and cell contraction. Our use of a panel of enzyme-specific inhibitors suggested that this signal is mediated through the classic phospholipase C (PLC)-IP3 pathway (24Taylor C.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 767-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and involves Src, which may bridge MUC1 with calcium signal mediators, as Src reportedly physically associates with MUC1 (5Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6061-6064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and can be upstream of PI 3-kinase and PLCγ (25Ozdener F.

The data showing the dependence of this signal on lipid rafts is complementary, as cholesterol depletion has previously been shown to disrupt the function of Src (28Hur E.M. Park Y.S. Lee B.D.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that the MUC1/ICAM-1 interaction results in a calcium-based promigratory signal, expanding the repertoire of putative oncogenic actions of MUC1.

High-affinity peptide uptake was dependent on liganded substrate-binding protein OppA, which interacts with the translocator OppBCDF with higher affinity than unliganded OppA. Transport screening with combinatorial peptide libraries revealed that (i) the Opp transporter is not selective with respect to amino acid side chains of the transported peptides; (ii) any peptide that can bind to OppA is transported via Opp, including very long peptides up to 35 residues long; and (iii) the binding specificity of OppA largely determines the overall transport selectivity.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; SBP, substrate-binding protein; DDM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitriloacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; SBP, substrate-binding protein; DDM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitriloacetic acid. transporters belong to a large superfamily of membrane proteins that are abundantly present among all kingdoms of life. Members of this family share a common four-domain architecture composed of two transmembrane domains that span the membrane several times in α-helical conformation and two membrane-associated nucleotide-binding domains that fuel the translocation process at the expense of ATP. The existence and arrangement of this four-domain structure has been confirmed by the high-resolution crystal structure of the vitamin B12 ABC transporter BtuCD from Escherichia coli (1Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar). In addition, bacterial ABC importers use substrate-binding proteins (SBPs), located at the extracellular surface or in the periplasmic space, to scavenge for substrate and subsequent delivery to the translocator. The individual subunits of ABC transporters can be present as separate proteins or fused together in almost any possible combination (2Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Google Scholar, 3van der Heide T. Poolman B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 938-943Google Scholar). The oligopeptide transport system (Opp) from Lactococcus lactis is a five-component ABC transporter composed of a membrane-anchored SBP, OppA, two transmembrane proteins, OppB and OppC, and two nucleotide-binding domains, OppD and OppF (4Tynkkynen S. Buist G. Kunji E. Kok J. Poolman B Venema G Haandrikman A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7523-7532Google Scholar). OppA binds a peptide and delivers it to the translocator complex, where upon ATP hydrolysis the peptide is transported into the cell. In addition to nutrition of the cell, in microorganisms the Opp system is also involved in various signaling processes including regulation of gene expression, chemotaxis, competence development, sporulation, DNA transfer by conjugation, and virulence development (reviewed in Ref. 5Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Poolman B. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 245-258Google Scholar). In L. lactis (and other lactic acid bacteria), the Opp system is an essential part of the proteolytic system because it transports into the cell β-casein-derived peptides formed by the cell wall-associated protease PrtP, enabling the organism to grow in milk. On the basis of intracellular amino acid accumulation in peptide-containing media, the lactococcal Opp system has been proposed to transport peptides in the range of 4 to at least 18 residues (6Detmers F.J.M. Kunji E.R.S. Lanfermeijer F.C. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16671-16679Google Scholar). The mechanism of peptide binding to OppA has been examined in detail using combinatorial peptide libraries and fluorescence techniques (7Lanfermeijer F.C. Picon A. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14440-14450Google Scholar, 8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar, 9Lanfermeijer F.C. Detmers F.J.M. Konings W.N. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3649-3656Google Scholar). OppA from L. lactis binds oligopeptides as long as 35 residues and has the highest affinity for nonameric peptides. OppA is not able to completely enclose peptides longer than 6 amino acid residues. The remaining residues stick out and interact with the protein surface actively, thereby contributing to the peptide binding affinity. This mechanism of substrate binding by OppA is different from that proposed for other SBPs that, on the basis of crystal structures, are thought to enclose the substrate completely (10Tame J.R.H. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Neil T.K. Dodson G.G. Higgins C.F. Wilkinson A.J. Science. 1994; 264: 1578-1581Google Scholar). Recently, Charbonnel et al. (11Charbonnel P. Lamarque M. Piard J. Gilbert C. Juillard V. Atlan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14832-14840Google Scholar) concluded, on the basis of OppA sequence comparisons and peptide utilization patterns of six L. lactis strains, that OppA is not the main determinant of peptide transport specificity of Opp. However, in vivo peptide uptake experiments are often complicated by rapid breakdown of internalized peptides by peptidases, subsequent efflux of labeled amino acids, and binding of peptides to the cell wall (6Detmers F.J.M. Kunji E.R.S. Lanfermeijer F.C. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16671-16679Google Scholar, 12Kunji E.R.S. Mierau I. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 123-131Google Scholar). These complications prohibit any detailed analysis of transport kinetics, translocation mechanism, and substrate specificity of Opp. Here, we describe an in vitro system for the study of peptide uptake via Opp. The purification and functional reconstitution in artificial membranes of this five-component ABC transport system enabled the analysis of the interaction of liganded and unliganded OppA with OppBCDF and determination of the overall transport specificity of Opp. Using radiolabeled combinatorial peptide libraries, we now demonstrate that the transport selectivity of Opp matches the binding specificity of OppA. Bacterial Strain and Growth Conditions—Plasmid pAMP42 is a pNZ8048-derivative with a 3804-bp NcoI-BamHI insert containing the oppDFBC genes under control of the nisin A promoter, yielding OppD, OppF, OppB, and C-terminal His6-tagged OppC. 2A. Picon, unpublished data. L. lactis NZ9000 was used as a host for pAMP42. Cells were grown in 5% (w/v) whey-permeate, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) glucose, and 65 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, supplemented with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol in a volume of 10 liters in a fermentor with pH control (ADI 1065 fermentor; Applikon Dependable Instruments B.V., Schiedam, The Netherlands). The pH was kept constant at pH 6.5 by titrating with 2 m KOH. Transcription was induced at an OD660 of 2 by adding 1:1000 (v/v) of the culture supernatant of L. lactis NZ9700. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, resuspended in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, plus 20% (v/v) glycerol and stored at –80 °C. OppA was produced by L. lactis AMP2/pAMP31 as described (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar). Purification of Opp—Membrane vesicles were prepared by rupturing the cells with a high-pressure homogenizer (Kindler Maschinen AG, Zürich, Switzerland) in the presence of 20% (v/v) glycerol. OppBCDFcontaining membranes were resuspended to 5 mg/ml of total membrane protein in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A) and solubilized with 0.5% DDM. After 12 min of centrifugation at 280,000 × g, the supernatant was diluted five times with buffer A and incubated with nickel-nitriloacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) resin (0.05 ml/mg of total membrane protein) for 1.5 h at 4 °C while shaking. Subsequently, the resin was poured into a column and washed with 20-column volumes of buffer A, supplemented with 0.05% DDM and 10 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted with 100 mm histidine, 0.05% DDM in buffer A, pH 7.0. OppA was purified as described (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar), except that DDM was not exchanged for Triton X-100 during the washing and elution steps. Immunoblotting and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semidry electrophoretic blotting. Immunodetection was done using monoclonal antibodies raised against the six-histidine tag (Sigma) or polyclonal anti-OppD antibodies at titers of 1:3,333 and 1:10,000, respectively. Detection was performed by using the Western-Light chemiluminescence detection kit with CSPD as a substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was done by performing in-gel tryptic digestion in combination with CNBr cleavage as described previously (13Montfort B.A. van Doeven M.K. Canas B. Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 111-115Google Scholar). Membrane Reconstitution of the Opp System—Reconstitution of Opp was done in three steps. In step 1, liposomes (20 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0) of acetone/ether-washed E. coli lipid and l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk in a ratio of 1:3 (w/w) were extruded through 400-nm pore size polycarbonate filters, diluted to 4 mg/ml, and titrated using Triton X-100 (14Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Google Scholar). Purified OppBCDF in elution buffer was added at a 1:100 (w/w) protein:lipid ratio, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature while shaking gently. To remove the detergent, 40 mg/ml wet weight polystyrene beads (BioBeads SM2) was added, followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature. Biobeads SM2 were added four more times, and the incubation times were 15 min, 30 min, overnight and 1 h at 4 °C. After dilution five times with 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, proteoliposomes containing OppBCDF were collected by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 150,000 × g and 4 °C and stored in liquid nitrogen. In step 2, OppA was anchored to the liposomes via its lipid moiety, and the final concentration of OppA after membrane reconstitution was estimated from the binding of peptide, as described by Detmers et al. (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise (see the legend to Fig. 2), an OppA concentration of 0.35 nmol/m2 of membrane surface was used. In step 3, an ATP-regenerating system, composed of 9 mm ATP, 9 mm MgSO4, 24 mm creatine phosphate, and 2.4 mg/ml of creatine kinase, was included into Opp-containing proteoliposomes by two freeze-thaw cycles. After extrusion through 400-nm pore size polycarbonate filters, the proteoliposomes were washed twice and resuspended in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, to a concentration of 20 mg/ml of lipid. Uptake of Bradykinin—Transport assays were started by diluting proteoliposomes into 200 μl of 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0 (final lipid concentration, 4 mg/ml) containing [3H]bradykinin at various concentrations. Uptake experiments were performed at 30 °C. At given time points, 40 μl of samples were taken and mixed 1:1 with 200 μm unlabeled bradykinin in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0. The sample was then diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold 8% (w/v) PEG-6000, filtered over 0.15-μm pore size cellulose acetate (OE65) filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold 8% (w/v) PEG-6000. The amount of radioactivity retained on the filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The concentrations of bound and free bradykinin and of liganded and unliganded OppA were calculated from the total concentration of OppA, the total concentration of bradykinin, and the KD for bradykinin binding of 0.1 μm (7Lanfermeijer F.C. Picon A. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14440-14450Google Scholar, 8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar). For the calculation of peptide accumulation levels, an internal volume of 0.5 μl/mg of lipid was used, which corresponds to 50 μl/mg of OppBCDF. Screening of Combinatorial Peptide Libraries—Uptakes were done in a custom-built microwell filtration unit (8 × 6 wells, 300-μl volume each) which allowed a 4-fold scaling down of the assay volumes as compared with the setup described above. After filtration over 0.15-μm pore size cellulose acetate (OE65) filters (Schleicher & Schuell), samples were washed twice with 200 μ l of 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0. The amount of radioactivity retained on the filter was determined with gamma counting. Randomized peptide libraries used in this study have been described previously (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar, 15Uebel S. Kraas W. Kienle S. Wiesmüller K. Jung G. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8976-8981Google Scholar). Peptides were iodinated as described (16Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Google Scholar) using chloramine T, and free iodine was removed by DOWEX 1X8 (Serva). Concentration of OppA at the Membrane Surface—The two-dimensional concentration of lipid-anchored OppA (in nmol/m2) at the membrane surface was calculated from the lipid and OppA concentration and a lipid surface area of 0.6 nm2. For comparison of affinities with other SBP-dependent ABC transport systems, this two-dimensional concentration was converted into a local concentration of OppA (in μm). For this, a shell of ∼3.4 nm around the liposomal surface was used (estimated from the crystal structure of OppA from Salmonella typhimurium; 10Tame J.R.H. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Neil T.K. Dodson G.G. Higgins C.F. Wilkinson A.J. Science. 1994; 264: 1578-1581Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 165: 265-275Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptide concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). The concentrations of purified OppBCDF or OppA were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorption at 280 nm and using extinction coefficients of 0.990 and 1.605 (mg/ml)–1 cm–1, respectively. Purification of OppBCDF—The components of the oligopeptide translocator complex were amplified in L. lactis using the nisin expression system (18Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Google Scholar, 19Kunji E.R.S. Slotboom D. Poolman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 97-108Google Scholar). OppBCDF was overproduced to an estimated level of ∼5% of total membrane protein content after 2 h of induction (Fig. 1A). Membrane solubilization and purification were done with DDM as a detergent. Initial conditions for maintaining an intact OppBCDF complex during purification were screened for ionic strength (0–500 mm KCl) and pH (6.0–8.0) using 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% DDM, and 20% (v/v) glycerol as a basal medium. This did not lead to purification of the complete translocator but resulted in purification of the His6-tagged component OppC only (data not shown). However, when imidazole was omitted from the buffer during binding of the complex to the Ni2+-NTA resin, the OppBCDF proteins could be obtained in an approximate 1:1:1:1 ratio (Fig. 1B). Varying the glycerol concentration from 0 to 40% (v/v) did not have any effect on the domain stoichiometry obtained after purification (data not shown). The individual translocator subunits were identified by Western blotting, using monoclonal anti-His-tag or polyclonal anti-OppD antibodies for detection of OppC or OppD, respectively (data not shown). OppF was identified by peptide mapping with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using an in-gel digestion procedure developed for integral membrane proteins (13Montfort B.A. van Doeven M.K. Canas B. Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 111-115Google Scholar). The mass spectrum of the putative OppB band did not yield enough peaks to unambiguously confirm the identity of this protein. Functional Reconstitution of the Opp System—Membrane reconstitution of the oligopeptide transporter was done via a three-step procedure. First, the purified translocator complex OppBCDF was incorporated into Triton X-100 destabilized liposomes. Thereafter, purified OppA was anchored to the outside of OppBCDF containing liposomes via its N-terminal lipid modification by absorbing the purified protein in 0.05% DDM to the (proteo)liposomes and removal of residual detergent with BioBeads. This resulted in proteoliposomes that contained all five proteins of which the Opp system is composed. Next, after inclusion of ATP and the ATP-regenerating system into the vesicle lumen by two freezing-thawing cycles, bradykinin transport could be measured (Fig. 2A). Control experiments indicated that bradykinin does not interact aspecifically with the liposomes, and uptake was not observed when AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, was used instead of ATP, ruling out aspecific effects on the membrane of the components of the ATP-regenerating system (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar, 20Patzlaff J.S. van der Heide T. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29546-29551Google Scholar). To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, background binding of radiolabeled substrate to OppA was diminished by chasing with a large excess (∼100-fold) of unlabeled bradykinin. Chasing background binding did not lead to an increase of the amount of label inside or efflux of accumulated [3H]bradykinin from the proteoliposomes (Fig. 2A). The apparent Km of transport for bradykinin was 0.9 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 2B). To verify that bradykinin uptake had taken place, the accumulation level ([bradykinin]in/[bradykinin]out) was calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”). At a bradykinin concentration of 1.5 μm, the accumulation level was ∼50 after 4 min of uptake, indicating that the peptide was transported against the concentration gradient. Peptide Uptake as a Function of OppA Concentration—Because liganded OppA rather than the free peptide is the actual substrate of OppBCDF, the effect of increasing the amount of OppA on the transport rate was determined. For easy comparison with other ABC transporters that use a soluble SBP, the local concentrations of OppA at the membrane surface (in μm) were calculated as described in “Experimental Procedures.” A concentration of OppA in the assay of 0.36 μm equals 0.35 nmol/m2 of membrane surface, which corresponds to a local concentration at the membrane of ∼100 μm. At a bradykinin concentration of 1.5 μm (a concentration >10-fold above the KD for bradykinin binding; KD = 0.1 μm), the Km of the translocator OppBCDF for liganded OppA was ∼50 μm (Fig. 2C). At a low substrate concentration, i.e. with 0.1 μm bradykinin, the uptake rate increased linearly with the concentration of OppA, and no inhibition attributable to the large excess (up to 4-fold) of unliganded OppA was observed (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D shows how the ratio of liganded versus unliganded OppA varied in the titration and confirms that at the highest level of OppA, a 4-fold excess of unliganded over liganded OppA was present. These results indicate that the translocator has a much higher affinity for liganded than for unliganded OppA. Uptake of Randomized Peptides via Opp—Because unliganded OppA does not inhibit the uptake of peptides, at least under our experimental conditions, the specificity of Opp for peptides can be estimated directly from the rate of uptake. Because the peptide libraries were available in relatively small quantities, a microwell plate setup was used for these transport assays. The peptide libraries were used at concentrations ranging from 3.2 to 5.0 μm. Randomized peptides were labeled at tyrosine residues with tracer amounts of 125I to monitor the transport reaction. Control experiments showed that uptake and (a) specific binding of randomized peptides could be specifically blocked by the addition of 100 μm bradykinin (Fig. 3). The chase with a large excess of bradykinin allowed us to separate transport from possible nonspecific interaction of the peptides with the liposomes. Length Specificity—To determine the length dependence of transport, randomized peptide libraries ranging from 5 to 35 amino acid residues were used. All peptides, even the extremely long ones of up to 35 residues, were transported by the Opp system (Fig. 4A). The inhibition of bradykinin binding to OppA by the combinatorial peptide libraries, determined previously by Detmers et al. (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar), is shown for comparison. Peptides with nine amino acid residues showed the highest uptake rates and the best binding to OppA. Longer and shorter peptides were transported with slower rates compared with the X9 library, but overall, the longest and shortest peptides were transported better than expected on the basis of the binding data. Because partly translocated peptides might be trapped in the transporter (and not be chased by the excess of bradykinin), we calculated the uptake of the largest peptides in terms of accumulation levels and number of peptides translocated per transporter. The accumulation level of X35 ([X35]in/([X35]out) was 2.5, and at least 30 peptides were transported per translocator after 5 min of uptake (see “Experimental Procedures”). These numbers, and the fact that X35 uptake still increased linearly with time after 5 min (not shown), demonstrate that even the largest peptides could be fully translocated. Influence of d-Amino Acids—The effect of d-amino acids on transport was determined with randomized nonameric peptide libraries containing d-amino acids at a single position. The d-amino acid-containing peptides showed lower uptake rates compared with the all l-amino acid-containing X9 library (Fig. 4B). Whereas in previous binding assays the negative effect of the d-amino acids was significant for the positions 4, 5, and 6, the differences in transport were less pronounced. Transport of Peptides with Modified Termini—Randomized peptides with modified termini were used to test whether a free N or C terminus was required for transport via Opp. Uptake rates of octameric peptides (X8) with an acetylated N or amidated C terminus or both were compared with the uptake rate of the unmodified randomized octameric peptide. The results indicate that free N or C termini are not essential for transport (Fig. 5). Acetylation of the N terminus had no effect, whereas amidation of the C terminus reduced the uptake rate by a factor of two. In addition, a nonameric randomized peptide library with a formylated N-terminal methionine, fMX8, was transported equally well as MX8. Nonameric Randomized Peptides—Nonameric randomized peptide libraries were used in which amino acids at all but one position were random. This position contains one of 19 different amino acids (cysteine was excluded from the libraries). In this way, the effect of a single amino acid at a given position can be determined independently of the sequence context of the rest of the peptide. For comparison, the transport via Opp and binding to OppA were screened for two positions. Generally, the transport data differed little from the binding results (Fig. 6). All peptides tested were transported, and peptides that bound best to OppA showed the highest transport rates. At position one, bulky and hydrophobic amino acids were somewhat disfavored (His, Leu, Val, Trp, and Tyr). At position five, no clear differences between the binding specificity of OppA and the transport selectivity of the Opp system as a whole could be discerned. To investigate further whether the overall transport specificity differs from the binding selectivity of OppA, two amino acids, methionine and valine, were chosen for screening using randomized nonameric peptide libraries. These two amino acids showed almost no differences in binding specificity, irrespective of the position in the peptide (8Detmers F.J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Abele R. Jack R.W. Tampé R. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12487-12492Google Scholar). Transport specificity of the methionine-containing libraries matched perfectly with the binding selectivity (Fig. 7A). In the case of valine, some differences were observed (Fig. 7B), of which the negative effects of valine at positions 1, 4, and 9 on the transport rates were most pronounced. However, again all peptides could bind to OppA and were well transported by the Opp system. We developed an in vitro assay system for the analysis of the kinetics, mechanism, and specificity of peptide transport, and we present the unique selectivity properties of the oligopeptide (Opp) ABC transporter from L. lactis. Opp transporters in microorganisms are more complex than most other ABC systems because they are composed of five separate polypeptides, and this has hampered their purification and membrane reconstitution for many years. The translocator complex OppBCDF is embedded in the membrane, whereas the oligopeptide-binding protein is tethered to the external surface of the membrane. The Opp translocator was produced in L. lactis and purified as a complex using a single His6-tag on OppC. Although Ni2+-NTA-based purification protocols generally use low concentrations (5–30 mm) of imidazole in the protein binding to the resin and washing steps, imidazole severely compromised the stability of the translocator. All four proteins could be co-purified only when imidazole was absent in the binding step and histidine was used for the elution of the complex. Membrane reconstitution of Opp was done by inserting the OppBCDF complex into detergent-destabilized liposomes, after which OppA was anchored to the outside of the membranes via its N-terminal lipid modification. Because of the high affinity of OppA for the reporter substrate bradykinin (KD = 0.1 μm) and the use of relatively high concentrations of OppA, a ∼100-fold excess of unlabeled bradykinin was used to stop the transport reaction and chase all OppA-bound [3H]bradykinin. The bradykinin that accumulated inside of the proteoliposomes was not affected by the chase with unlabeled bradykinin, because the transporter functions unidirectionally. The affinity of the translocator for its substrate, liganded OppA, was determined by measuring uptake rates at increasing OppA concentrations at the membrane surface and of saturating amounts of bradykinin. The Km of the translocator for liganded OppA was ∼50 μm, which is in the same range as the values of ∼65 μm determined for the histidine system HisJQMP2 (21Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Google Scholar) and 25–50 μm for the maltose system MalEFGK2 (22Dean D.A. Hor L.I. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2033-2040Google Scholar). The translocator could already be saturated at relatively low absolute amounts of OppA because OppA is attached to the membrane. Even at an OppA concentration in the assay of only 0.36 μm, which corresponds to 0.35 nmol/m2 of membrane surface, the local concentration of OppA at the membrane could be as high as 100 μm. Inhibition of transport activity by unliganded SBP has been observed for the periplasmic binding protein-dependent histidine and maltose ABC transport systems (21Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Google Scholar, 23Merino G. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Bohl E. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 177: 171-179Google Scholar), and this has been ascribed to competition between unliganded and liganded SBP for the translocator. In the case of the histidine permease, it even was suggested that liganded and unliganded HisJ interact with equal affinity with the translocator complex (24Ames G.F.L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K. Nikaido K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Google Scholar). We observed no inhibition at low peptide concentrations, corresponding to local concentrations of 20 μm liganded and 80 μm unliganded OppA, which indicates that the affinity of the translocator for liganded OppA is much higher than for unliganded OppA. It is often assumed that the SBP of bacterial ABC transporters determines the overall transport selectivity of the system, but unlike Opp, the specificity of most systems is narrow, and binding and transport of only a few substrates have been compared. Recently, Charbonnel et al. (11Charbonnel P. Lamarque M. Piard J. Gilbert C. Juillard V. Atlan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14832-14840Google Scholar) proposed, by comparing the peptide utilization patterns of six different L. lactis strains, that OppA is not the main determinant of peptide transport specificity. It was claimed that the translocator OppBCDF plays an important role in determining the overall transport selectivity. It must be noted, however, that several of the strains used were not well characterized, and other factors (e.g. other peptide transporters or lack of certain peptidases) might have interfered with the observed peptide utilization patterns. The sequences of the opp genes of two of the strains used, L. lactis MG1363 and IL1403, differ for the transmembrane proteins OppB and OppC at only two positions (the system studied by us is from the MG1363 strain) (4Tynkkynen S. Buist G. Kunji E. Kok J. Poolman B Venema G Haandrikman A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7523-7532Google Scholar, 25Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorikin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Google Scholar). This makes it unlikely that the observed differences in peptide transport can be ascribed solely to different properties of the transmembrane moieties of the Opp systems. In a follow-up paper, Juillard and colleagues (26Helinck S. Charbonnel P. Foucaud-Scheunemann C. Piard J.-C. Juillard V. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2003; 94: 900-907Google Scholar) proposed that some peptides bind to OppA without subsequently being transported, but with the exception of one tetrapeptide, there is no real evidence for this notion. By using combinatorial peptide libraries, we now clearly show that the binding specificity of OppA compares well with the overall transport selectivity of the Opp system. For the specificity studies, we used saturating OppA concentrations, implying that substrate binding or delivery to the translocator is not rate-determining. This mimics the in vivo situation where overexpression of OppA in wild-type L. lactis cells increased the amount of peptide binding but did not affect the rate of uptake (27Picon A. Kunji E.R.S. Lanfermeijer F.C. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1600-1608Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Km for bradykinin transport in vivo (0.27 ± 0.03 μm) (27Picon A. Kunji E.R.S. Lanfermeijer F.C. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1600-1608Google Scholar) and in vitro (0.9 ± 0.2 μm) are in the same range. Thus, both in vivo and in vitro there is a large excess of OppA over OppBCDF, and the rate-determining step for bradykinin uptake is in translocation and not in peptide binding. A striking feature of the L. lactis Opp system is that it binds and transports exceptionally long peptides. Here, we show that the Opp ABC transporter is capable of transporting peptides as long as 35 residues. Peptides shorter or longer than 9 residues are transported relatively better than expected, solely on the basis of the binding data. This fits well with the observation made previously that small peptides are bound relatively poorly but transported rather well (6Detmers F.J.M. Kunji E.R.S. Lanfermeijer F.C. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16671-16679Google Scholar). On the basis of these experiments and pre-steady state peptide-binding kinetics, it was suggested that the dissociation rate constant (k–1) is an important determinant of the rate of transport. Tight binding to OppA was associated with low k–1 values, which might limit the transfer of peptide from OppA to the translocator and yield a low rate of transport. On the other hand, poorly binding peptides had a high k–1 and were transported relatively well. A similar explanation may hold for the difference in binding and transport of the penta- and hexameric peptides. In a previous report, we showed that there is no strict requirement for a free amino and carboxyl group for a peptide to bind to OppA (9Lanfermeijer F.C. Detmers F.J.M. Konings W.N. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3649-3656Google Scholar). Acetylation of the N-terminal amino group or amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl group of the peptide SLSQSLSQS decreased the binding affinity only 4- and 7-fold, respectively. Here, we show that a free amino or carboxyl group is also not essential for peptide transport by Opp. To further analyze the transport specificity of the Opp system, randomized nonameric peptides containing d-amino acids or a particular residue at one single position were used. The uptake rate of d-amino acid-containing libraries was 2–3-fold lower than the X9 library. This is in agreement with the binding studies in which a 5-fold higher peptide concentration had to be used to obtain similar levels of inhibition of bradykinin binding, as with all l-amino acid-containing libraries. Overall, there are only small differences between the binding and transport profiles. Positions 7 and 8 seem a little more selective than expected on the basis of the binding to OppA. The screening of positions 1 and 5 of the randomized nonameric libraries revealed little differences between binding and transport specificity. In general, it appears that any peptide that can bind to OppA can also be transported by Opp. There are no indications for any amino acid causing a peptide to be completely excluded from transport. The fact that some peptides with bulky and hydrophobic amino acids (His, Leu, Trp, and Tyr at position 1 and Val at positions 1, 4, and 9) show somewhat reduced uptake rates can be explained in two ways. Either these peptides bind relatively strongly to OppA, resulting in low k–1 values and consequently lower transport rates, or a peptide-binding site within OppBCDF disfavors these amino acids at the positions 1, 4, and 9. In conclusion, the affinity of OppBCDF for liganded OppA is in the same range as the corresponding interaction in other SBP-dependent ABC transporters, but because OppA is membrane-anchored, much lower amounts are needed to saturate the translocator than with soluble SBPs. The affinity of the transmembrane complex for liganded OppA is much higher than for unliganded OppA. The Opp system has the remarkable capacity to transport peptides ranging from 4 to 35 residues. Overall, the transport selectivity seems to be determined by the binding specificity of OppA.

This system catalyzes phosphorylation coupled to translocation of numerous simple sugars across the cytoplasmic membrane. The PTS is composed of two general cytoplasmic proteins, enzyme I (EI) and histidine phosphocarrier protein, HPr, which are used for all sugars, and, in addition, some sugar-specific components collectively known as enzymes II (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar). The glucose-specific enzyme II of Escherichia coli consists of two components: soluble enzyme IIAGlc (IIAGlc) and membrane-bound enzyme IICBGlc (IICBGlc). Thus, glucose transport in E. coli involves three soluble PTS components (EI, HPr, and IIAGlc, encoded by the ptsHIcrr operon) and one membrane-bound protein, enzyme IICBGlc (encoded by the ptsG gene). Glucose uptake entails sequential phosphoryl transfer via the PTS, as follows: phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) → EI → HPr → IIAGlc → IICBGlc → glucose. Components of the PTS also participate in several regulatory mechanisms (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar). Catabolite repression allows for the preferential utilization of sugars transported by the PTS. Consequently, when E. coli are cultured in a medium containing both glucose and a non-PTS sugar, the glucose is consumed first. The currently accepted mechanism for this effect is that, when PTS sugars are transported, the steady-state condition of IIAGlc is mainly in the dephospho-form. The unphosphorylated form of IIAGlc inhibits transport of non-PTS sugars such as lactose, maltose, melibiose, and raffinose by interacting with transporters for these sugars (a process termed inducer exclusion) (1Postma P.W.

Other allosteric regulatory functions of IIAGlc include inhibition of the phosphorylation of glycerol by binding to glycerol kinase (5Hurley J.H. Faber H.R. Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Pettigrew D.W. Remington S.J. Science. 1993; 259: 673-677Google Scholar) and either inhibition or activation of adenylyl cyclase (6Peterkofsky A. Reizer A. Reizer J. Gollop N. Zhu P.P. Amin N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Google Scholar). E. coli IIAGlc is a protein with a Mr, predicted from its amino acid sequence, of 18,250 and which is phosphorylated by P-HPr at the N-3 position of His-90. In E. coli, the level of phosphorylated IIAGlc reflects not only the availability of extracellular glucose but also the intracellular ratio of [PEP] to [pyruvate] (7Hogema B.M. Arents J.C. Bader R. Eijkemans K. Yoshida H. Takahashi H. Aiba H. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 487-498Google Scholar). In addition to the regulatory roles of IIAGlc listed above, we thought that there might be regulation of other physiological activities by IIAGlc in E. coli. This perspective stimulated us to embark on ligand-fishing experiments aimed at detecting other soluble protein(s) exhibiting high affinity binding to IIAGlc. In our previous study, employing ligand-fishing in E. coli extracts with surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and immobilized HPr as the bait, we discovered a high affinity binding of glycogen phosphorylase to HPr; thus, HPr mediates cross-talk between sugar uptake through the PTS and glycogen breakdown (8Seok Y.-J.

Koo B.-M. Sondej M. Peterkofsky A. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 385-393Google Scholar). In this study, ligand-fishing, using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, was also employed to search for a high affinity binding of IIAGlc to a protein in E. coli extracts. Consequently, we discovered a new IIAGlc-binding protein in E. coli extracts. The protein was purified and established to be the previously uncharacterized yafA gene product, which we now refer to as a fermentation/respiration switch protein (FrsA). This report also describes experiments aimed at deducing the locus of action of FrsA. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was used for routine bacterial growth except with strain GI698 and its derivatives. M9 salts-based rich medium (supplemented with 2% casamino acids and 1% glycerol) was used for routine culture of GI698 and its derivatives. DY330, GI698, and their derivatives were grown at 30 °C, while other strains listed in Table I were grown at 37 °C. For the overproduction of proteins using GI698 and the pRE1-based vector system, cells were grown in M9 salts-based induction medium (0.2% casamino acids, 1% glycerol, and M9 salts) at 30 °C. Tryptophan (final concentration: 100 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium when the culture reached an A600 = 0.4, and cells were harvested 18–20 h after induction.

The internal NdeI site located at codons 186 and 187 was removed by mutagenesis (CATATG to CACATG) so that this did not result in any amino acid changes. The PCR product, digested with NdeI and BamHI, was cloned into the vector pRE1 (11Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Google Scholar), resulting in the recombinant plasmid pKY103 for FrsA overproduction. To construct pKY513, in which FrsA expression is under the control of its own promoter, the sequence covering its own promoter and coding regions was amplified by PCR using mutagenic primers to create an EagI site (underlined) 432 nucleotides upstream of the frsA start codon (5′-TGCCGTAAGCCGTGGCGGCCGGGTACCGGG-3′) and a BamHI site (underlined) 39 nucleotides downstream from the TAA stop codon (5′-TATCTCCTGTTGGGATCCAACTGTTTTACC-3′). The PCR product, digested with EagI and BamHI, was cloned into the vector pBR322. Measurement of Protein-Protein Interaction—The interaction of IIAGlc and its binding factor was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection using a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB) as described previously (8Seok Y.-J. Sondej M. Badawi P. Lewis M.S. Briggs M.C. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26511-26521Google Scholar, 12Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H. Jeong J.-Y. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.-O. Ryu S. Seok Y.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Google Scholar). IIAGlc and IIBGlc were separately immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip. IIAGlc and IIBGlc (80 μl, 100 μg/ml) in coupling buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0) were allowed to flow over a sensor chip at 10 μl/min to couple the proteins to the matrix by a N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide reaction (80 μl of mix). Unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide was inactivated by injecting 80 μl of 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.0. Assuming that 1000 resonance units correspond to a surface concentration of 1 ng/mm2, the proteins IIAGlc and IIBGlc were immobilized to a surface concentration of 1.5 and 1.8 ng/mm2, respectively. The standard running buffer was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and all reagents were introduced at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The sensor surface was regenerated between assays by injecting 10 μl of 2 m NaCl to remove bound analyte. To examine the in vivo interaction between IIAGlc and FrsA, GI698 cells harboring pKY103 expressing FrsA or pKY103H expressing His-FrsA were grown in 200 ml of M9 salts-based rich medium to an A600 of 1.5, harvested, and washed with 30 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. The cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of the buffer in the presence of 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was disrupted in a French pressure cell and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the crude extract. The crude extract was incubated with 200 μl of BD TALON™ resin. After the mixture was loaded onto a Poly-Prep chromatography column (8 × 40 mm) (Bio-Rad), the column was washed twice with the wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with 300 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole. The proteins bound to the column were eluted with the wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue and Western blotting using anti-IIAGlc serum raised in mice. Identification of Coomassie Blue-stained Bands—Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands were excised and subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion with trypsin according to the method of Moritz et al. (13Moritz R.L. Eddes J. Hong J. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VI. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 311-319Google Scholar). Digests were subjected to LC-MS analysis on a previously described (14Jaffe H. Veeranna Shetty K.T. Pant H.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3931-3940Google Scholar) Michrom Bioresources Magic 2002 model microbore high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a model LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan) equipped with an electrospray interface utilizing a 0.3 × 150 mm Magic MS C18 column (Michrom Bioresources) eluted at 8 μl/min and 40 °C with a linear gradient of 2–65% Solvent B over 30 min. Solvent A was 10/10/980/1/0.005 CH3CN/1-PrOH/H2O/acetic acid/hexafluorobutyric acid (v/v/v/v/v) and Solvent B was 700/200/100/0.9/0.005 CH3CN/1-PrOH/H2O/acetic acid/hexafluorobutyric acid (v/v/v/v/v). Column effluent was monitored at 215 nm. The mass spectrometer was operated in the “Top Five” mode in which the instrument was set up to automatically acquire (a) a full scan between m/z 300 and m/z 1300 and (b) tandem MS/MS spectra (relative collision energy = 35%) of the five most intense ions in the full scan. MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the Bioworks software package (Finnigan). Individual uninterpreted MS/MS spectra were searched against the non-redundant data base utilizing the SEQUEST program (by J. Eng and J. Yates, University of Washington, Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Seattle, WA). Search parameters were set to a static modification of +71 atomic mass units to allow for acrylamide alkylation of cysteine and enzyme specificity was set to “no enzyme.” Fragment ions were labeled using the Bioworks software. Purification of Overexpressed Proteins—The steps of purification were followed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). E. coli GI698 harboring pKY103 was used for overexpression of FrsA. Cell culture and induction of protein overexpression was done as described previously (15Seok Y.-J. Lee B.-R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Google Scholar). The cell pellet obtained from 500 ml of culture containing overexpressed FrsA was resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl) and then passed three times through a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The lysate was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The soluble fraction was chromatographed through a DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) column (2.5 × 10 cm) using a gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl (220 ml). The fractions containing substantial amounts of FrsA were pooled and concentrated in a 3 K Macrosep centrifugal concentrator (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The concentrated pool was further purified on a hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column (1.5 × 10 cm) using a gradient of 0–500 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (80 ml). Fractions containing FrsA were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated fraction was chromatographed on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prepgrade column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Finally, a Mono Q 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column was used with 15 volumes of NaCl gradient (50–300 mm) to obtain homogeneous FrsA (>98% pure). The yield of pure FrsA from 500 ml of culture was ∼2 mg. EI, HPr, IIAGlc, and EIIBGlc were purified as described previously (12Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H. Jeong J.-Y. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.-O. Ryu S. Seok Y.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Google Scholar, 15Seok Y.-J. Lee B.-R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gel Filtration Chromatography of IIAGlc-FrsA Complex—Gel filtration chromatography was performed in a AKTA-FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). One-ml samples containing either 4 mg of IIAGlc or 4 mg of FrsA or both proteins in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl were incubated for 10 min on ice and injected through a Superose 12 column (25 × 500 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Filtration was performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 3 ml were collected. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Mobility shifts of FrsA due to its interaction with IIAGlc were demonstrated in a nondenaturing 4–20% gradient gel (Novex). Tris·glycine, pH 8.3, was used as the running buffer. A binding mixture (20 μl) of 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml FrsA, and 50 μg/ml IIAGlc was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. This mixture was combined with 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.5 m Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol) and electrophoresed in the gel for 2 h at 100 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Measurement of Glucose Concentration—Glucose concentrations were measured using a glucose assay kit (Sigma) following the supplier's instruction with some modifications as described previously (9Koo B.-M. Seok Y.-J. J. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 24-30Google Scholar). Cells were withdrawn every 2 h and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant solutions were used to determine glucose remaining in the culture medium. To determine glucose in the medium, each aliquot of culture broth was diluted 100-fold in water, and 20 μl of diluted solution was mixed with 200 μl of combined enzyme-color reagent solution and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After color development, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To prepare the combined enzyme-color reagent solution, 200 mg of enzyme mixture containing 100 units of Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase, 20 Purpurogalin units of horseradish peroxidase, and buffer salts was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water, and mixed with 320 μl O-dianisidine dihydrochloride solution (2.5 mg/ml in distilled water). Disruption of frsA—The frsA gene was disrupted using electroporated linear DNA amplified by PCR and E. coli DY330 as described previously (17Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Google Scholar). The frsA gene (nucleotides 7–1164 from the start codon) was replaced by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat). cat was amplified from SR702 (ptsG::cat) with the following primers; forward primer, 5′-GCGGGTTACA ATAGTTTCCA GTAAGTATTC TGGAGGCTGC ATCCATGACA GAGAAAAAAA TCACTGGATA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GATTTCCTGA AGACCTTTGT CAAAATTCCG ATACACCGGG TTAAATGGGA CGCCCCGCCC TGCCACTCAT-3′. MG1655 ΔfrsA (BM101) and GI698 ΔfrsA (BM201) were constructed by P1 transduction of the Cmr region of BM100. Disruption of the frsA gene was confirmed by PCR. Analysis of Metabolic Products by NMR Spectroscopy and Measurement of Acetate Concentration—Cells were grown in 200 ml of M9 salts medium containing 0.5% glucose or other indicated sugars and 0.2% casamino acids supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Aliquots of culture were taken at the indicated time and were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant solutions were used to analyze the extracellular metabolic products. The cell-free culture solutions (0.9 ml each) taken at 12 h after inoculation were mixed with D2O (0.1 ml) and subjected to the NMR experiments. The spectra were recorded at a 1H resonance frequency of 500 MHz by use of a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer. The concentration of acetate in culture supernatants was measured as described previously (18Clarke P.M. Payton M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 402-405Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The assay mixture contained in a final volume of 3 ml (final concentration in parentheses): potassium phosphate, pH 7.6 (150 mm), MgCl2 (20 mm), PEP (0.5 mm), NADH (0.5 mm), ATP (5 mm), pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (4.4 and 6.0 units/ml, respectively), and samples or 10–150 μm sodium acetate to make a standard curve. The reagents were mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min at 37 °C. After noting the absorbance at 365 nm (A1), 20 μl of acetate kinase was added to a final concentration of 1.5 units/ml. The reagents were mixed again and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min before noting the final absorbance at 365 nm (A2). The change in absorbance (ΔA = A1 – A2) was calculated and related to concentration by reading from a standard plot. Immobilized IIAGlc Complexes with a Factor in E. coli Extracts—The technique of ligand-fishing by SPR (8Seok Y.-J. Sondej M. Badawi P. Lewis M.S. Briggs M.C. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26511-26521Google Scholar) was used to search for a protein that might interact with and be regulated by IIAGlc. SPR detects a change in refractive index resulting from the interaction of a soluble protein with another protein covalently linked to a surface. IIAGlc, immobilized on a CM-5 sensor chip (see “Experimental Procedures”), was used as the bait. To minimize nonspecific interactions between the crude extract and IIAGlc, a cytoplasmic crude extract from a stationary phase culture of an E. coli strain (TP2811) carrying a deletion of the pts operon (see “Experimental Procedures”) (19Levy S. Zeng G.Q. Danchin A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 27-33Google Scholar) was chromatographed through a Mono Q 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl (80 ml total volume). Each fraction was allowed to flow over the immobilized IIAGlc for 10 min; we found that fractions eluting near 100 mm NaCl showed a detectable increase in SPR response (Fig. 1A). Since IIAGlc interacts with glycerol kinase, it seemed possible that the detected interaction might be due to formation of the glycerol kinase-IIAGlc complex. However, when purified glycerol kinase (120 μlof10 μg/ml protein) was allowed to flow over the immobilized IIAGlc in the absence of Zn2+ (20Pettigrew D.W. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4875-4883Google Scholar) for 10 min, no interaction was detectable (data not shown). Furthermore, because the ptsHIcrr operon is deleted in strain TP2811 (19Levy S. Zeng G.Q. Danchin A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 27-33Google Scholar), the possibility of interaction of HPr and IIAGlc was also excluded. This result prompted us to purify this new IIAGlc-binding protein. Purification of the Factor Interacting with IIAGlc—The approach to purification of the factor that interacts with IIAGlc was based on SPR analysis; fractions from each purification step were examined for binding to immobilized IIAGlc using the BIAcore (Fig. 1). E. coli strain TP2811 was grown to stationary phase in 6 liters of Luria broth at 37 °C. The harvested cell pellet was washed and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl); this suspension was passed three times through a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the soluble cytoplasmic fraction. This fraction was chromatographed through a DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) column (8 × 30 cm) using a linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl (2 liters total volume). Fractions eluting around 100 mm NaCl demonstrated interaction with immobilized IIAGlc; these fractions were pooled and concentrated in a 3 K Macrosep centrifugal concentrator (Pall Gelman Laboratory). The concentrated pool was further purified on a hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column (1.5 × 10 cm) using a linear gradient of 0–500 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (80 ml total volume). Fractions eluting around 100 mm potassium phosphate demonstrated interaction with immobilized IIAGlc, and these fractions were pooled and concentrated as described above. The concentrated pool was chromatographed on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Once again, the eluted fractions were analyzed using SPR, and fractions showing affinity toward immobilized IIAGlc were pooled and concentrated as described for previous steps. As a final purification step, a Mono Q 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) was used with a 15-volume NaCl gradient (50–300 mm) in buffer A. The fractions eluting near 100 mm NaCl, showing interaction with IIAGlc, were pooled, and the protein was precipitated by adding acetone to a final concentration of 80% after BSA (1 mg/ml) was added to assist in recovery. The IIAGlc-binding Protein Is the yafA Gene Product—The precipitated proteins were solubilized in SDS-loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Staining of the gel with Coomassie Blue revealed a protein band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of ∼47 kDa in addition to a band corresponding to BSA. The bands in the vicinity of the 47-kDa protein were cut out of the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion. Digests were analyzed by LC/MS/MS (see “Experimental Procedures”) to identify proteins. Protein in the slower migrating (presumptive BSA) band was identified as BSA on the basis of the following tryptic peptides: (K)SEIAHR, (K)DLGEEHFK, (R)FKDLGEEHFK, (K)HLVDEPQNLIK, (R)KVPQVSTPTLVEVSR, and (K)TSESGELHGLTTEDK. Protein in the faster migrating band was identified as a mixture of BSA on the basis of the following tryptic peptides: (K)HLVDEPQNLIK, (R)KVPQVSTPTLVEVSR, (R)RPCFSALTPDETYVPK, (K)LVNELTEFAK, (R)RHPEYAVAVLLR, (K)LGEYGFQNAILVR, and (K)TSESGELHGTLTTEDK and YAFA_ECOLI (P04335) on the basis of the following tryptic peptides: (R)LGMHDASDEALR, (K)GDDLAEQAQALSNR, (R)VAAFGFR, (R)TDDDLYDTVIGYR, and (M)TQANLSETLFKPR (see Fig. 1B). On the basis of the sequence analyses, we concluded that the BSA sequence was a carryover from the added protein (see above) and that the YAFA_ECOLI sequence was likely to correspond to the IIAGlc-binding factor. The correspondence of the apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE of the IIAGlc-binding protein with the calculated molecular mass of YAFA_ECOLI (47,008 Da) was consistent with this prediction. Overexpression and Purification of the frsA Gene Product—To further explore the possibility that the IIAGlc-binding protein corresponded to the product (YAFA_ECOLI) of the yafA gene (we refer to yafA as frsA, since we report here that its gene product (FrsA) acts as a fermentation/respiration switch), the gene was cloned into an expression vector so that sizeable amounts of the pure protein could be produced. For overexpression of FrsA, we constructed the pRE1-based recombinant plasmid, pKY103. In this plasmid, genes are under the control of the strong λPL promoter-cII ribosome binding site combination (11Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17:"
https://openalex.org/W1979606761,"The glycine receptor is a target for both alcohols and anesthetics, and certain amino acids in the α1 subunit transmembrane segments (TM) are critical for drug effects. Introducing larger amino acids at these positions increases the potency of glycine, suggesting that introducing larger residues, or drug molecules, into the drug-binding cavity facilitates channel opening. A possible mechanism for these actions is that the volume of the cavity expands and contracts during channel opening and closing. To investigate this hypothesis, mutations for amino acids in TM1 (I229C) and TM2 (G256C, T259C, V260C, M263C, T264C, S267C, S270C) and TM3 (A288C) were individually expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The ability of sulfhydryl-specific alkyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds of different lengths to covalently react with introduced cysteines in both the closed and open states of the receptor was determined. S267C was accessible to short chain (C3–C8) MTS in both open and closed states, but was only accessible to longer chain (C10–C16) MTS compounds in the open state. Reaction with S267C was faster in the open state. I229C and A288C showed state-dependent reaction with MTS only in the presence of agonist. M263C and S270C were also accessible to MTS labeling. Mutated residues more intracellular than M263C did not react, indicating a floor of the cavity. These data demonstrate that the conformational changes accompanying channel gating increase accessibility to amino acids critical for drug action in TM1, TM2, and TM3, which may provide a mechanism by which alcohols and anesthetics can act on glycine (and likely other) receptors.

To study and identify water accessible residues of ion channels, such as those in drug binding pockets, methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents may be used as structural probes using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (9Karlin A.

MTS reagents rapidly react to form disulfide bonds with cysteines in the presence of water, and an irreversible change in receptor function is taken as evidence of disulfide bond formation. By use of this method, residues accessible in the presence and/or absence of neurotransmitter to sulfhydryl-specific reagents have been determined for TM2 in GABAA and acetylcholine receptors and for TM3 and the TM2–TM3 loop for GABAA receptors (10Bera A.K.

Clinically relevant concentrations of ethanol, longer chain alcohols, and volatile anesthetics enhance the function of the glycine receptor (and the homologous GABAA receptor) in heterologous expression systems (25Krasowski M.D. Koltchine V.V.

As mediators of inhibition in the nervous system, glycine receptors may be involved in the sedative and anesthetic effects of alcohol, a hypothesis supported by a recent study showing decreased alcohol effects in transgenic mice expressing a mutant, alcoholresistant, α1 subunit (32Findlay G.S.

The glycine receptor is one of the most credible candidates for mediating immobility caused by volatile anesthetics (33Sonner J.M. Antognini J.F. Dutton R.C. Flood P. Gray A.T. Harris R.A. Homanics G.E. Kendig J. Orser B. Raines D.E. Rampil I.J. Trudell J. Vissel B. Eger 2nd, E.I. Anesth. Analg. 2003; 97: 718-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These studies raise the question of the mechanism by which occupation of this protein cavity by alcohols, anesthetics, or MTS reagents facilitates activation (or prevents inactivation) of the channel. It is established that channel gating causes tertiary structural rearrangements within receptor subunits (34Spencer R.H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), so we were interested in how channel gating causes changes in accessibility to the alcohol and anesthetic binding pocket. We propose that the volume of this cavity, bounded by amino acids in TM1, TM2, and TM3, is larger in the open state of the channel than in the closed state. This would provide a mechanism by which occupation of the cavity by diverse small molecules can change receptor function. Our experiments expand on previous work (10Bera A.K. Chatav M. Akabas M.H. J.

To map the shape and organization of this binding cavity, we introduced cysteines at nine positions in transmembrane segments 1, 2, and 3. We studied the ability of MTS reagents of different lengths to covalently react with these nine positions in both the open and closed conformations of the glycine receptor. Mutagenesis and Expression of Human GlyR α1 Subunit cDNA—Site-directed mutagenesis in the human GlyR α1 subunit was performed on cDNA subcloned into pBK-CMV N/B-200 or pCIS2 vectors using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Point mutations were verified by partial sequencing of the sense and antisense strands. As previously described (35Colman A. Hanes E.B. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. Oxford Press, Washington, D. C.1984: 49-69Google Scholar), Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and injected with 1 ng of wild-type GlyR α1 cDNA or the following α1 subunit mutants: I229C, G256C, T259C, V260C, M263C, T264C, S267C, S270C, or A288C. Injected oocytes were singly stored in incubation media and incubated at 15 °C. Incubation media is composed of modified Barth's solution (MBS) containing in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.82 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.91 CaCl2, and 0.33 Ca(NO3)2 (Sigma), adjusted to pH 7.5, and supplemented with 10 mg/liter streptomycin, 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, 90 mg/liter theophylline, and 220 mg/liter pyruvate. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological measurements were made 1 to 10 days after injection with previously published methods (26Mascia M.P. Machu T.K. Harris R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Oocytes were perfused with MBS at a rate of 2.0 ml/min and clamped at -70 mV using a Warner Instruments OC725C (Hamden, CT) oocyte clamp. Currents were continuously plotted using a Cole-Parmer chart recorder (Vernon Hills, IL). Oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant receptors were perfused for 90 s with a 50 μm solution of propyl MTS, hexyl MTS, octyl MTS, decyl MTS, dodecyl MTS, hexadecyl MTS, benzyl MTS, or para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS-) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, ON) in either the absence of glycine or in the presence of 1 mm glycine (Bio-Rad). All MTS applications were for 90 s, unless otherwise specified as this gave a steady-state reaction with S267C. MTS compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted in MBS to a final Me2SO concentration not exceeding 0.05% (for hexadecyl MTS the final concentration was 0.1%). These concentrations of Me2SO did not affect GlyR function. MTS solutions were prepared immediately before application to prevent degradation in all experiments (unless otherwise noted). For each oocyte tested, responses to the EC5–10 of glycine (i.e. concentration of glycine producing peak currents equal to 5 to 10% of the 1 mm glycine maximal current) were determined before and 10, 20, and 30 min after application of MTS. During co-applications of MTS reagents with 1 mm glycine, the voltage clamp circuit on the oocyte was inactivated to prevent cell damage and run down of the glycine current. For G256C, T259C, V260C, and A288C, 10 mm glycine was used as the maximum glycine concentration for labeling and to determine the EC5–10 because 10 mm glycine induced a maximal response in the concentration-response curves for these mutants (Table III).Table IIIAmino acid positions (50Miller C.

This was followed by an application of 50 μm propyl MTS (in MBS) and measurement of the glycine response. Responses to the initial EC5–10 of glycine were measured 10 min after each MTS application. We also tested the stability of propyl MTS in room temperature MBS. We observed no change in effectiveness of 1-h old 50 μm propyl MTS solutions compared with freshly prepared solutions on S267C. The rate of reaction of propyl MTS (50 μm) with S267C was determined in four conditions: 1) no glycine; 2) no glycine plus 0.6 mm isoflurane; 3) 1 mm glycine; and 4) 1 mm glycine plus 0.6 mm isoflurane. For conditions 1 and 3, the EC5–10 of glycine was first determined for each oocyte. After 10 min, propyl MTS (50 μm) was applied for 15 s in the absence of glycine (10-s applications in the presence of glycine because the cumulative reaction time was shorter). Ten minutes following the propyl MTS application (or 15 min for MTS applications with glycine to allow time for receptor recovery from desensitization), the original EC5–10 of glycine was re-applied. This procedure was repeated until the glycine response reached a steady state. For conditions 2 and 4, the application procedure was identical and 0.6 mm isoflurane was co-applied with propyl MTS in the presence and absence of glycine. All MTS and isoflurane solutions were prepared immediately before each application to ensure that a uniform concentration of these compounds reached the oocytes. The normalized responses for each oocyte were fit to a one-phase exponential association curve to determine the time and rate constants of each curve. These time constants were then averaged and presented with their standard errors and the second-order rate constants were calculated by dividing the averaged rate constants by the concentration of MTS applied. The rates of reaction of hexyl and decyl MTS were determined in the same manner. Ten-second applications of 50 μm hexyl MTS were applied in the closed state, and 10-s applications of 5 μm hexyl MTS (or 1 μm decyl MTS) were applied in the presence of 1 mm glycine until a steady state response was reached. To differentiate the receptor states in which MTS reacts, the potentiation by 0.8 mm isoflurane was measured following decyl MTS reaction with S267C receptors in the closed (as a control), desensitized, and open/desensitized states. The isoflurane potentiation of the EC5–10 glycine current was measured for each condition and compared with that of unlabeled receptors. As shown previously, receptors that could be labeled by MTS would have eliminated or reduced isoflurane potentiation (19Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Receptors were labeled (90 s) in the closed state (50 μm decyl MTS) and the open/desensitized state (50 μm decyl MTS + 1 mm glycine). Desensitized receptors were labeled after a 10–14-min application of 1 mm glycine that left only 1–5% of the maximal current activable. Then the oocyte was washed in MBS (30 s), followed by application of 50 μm decyl MTS in MBS to label in either the desensitized or closed state. For all of the above conditions, the isoflurane potentiation was determined 15 min after MTS labeling. Potentiation was calculated by dividing the drug-induced current by the average EC5–10 glycine-induced currents applied 10 min before and after each drug application. For the control, unlabeled receptors, the isoflurane potentiation was determined as above. Isoflurane (Ohmeda Caribe Inc., Liberty Corner, NJ) was dissolved in MBS or glycine solutions immediately prior to each experiment. Samples of bath solutions of isoflurane reaching the oocyte were measured by gas chromatography to have a 50% loss from the prepared vial solutions. Thus, we prepared a vial solution of 1.6 mm to produce a bath concentration at the oocyte of 0.8 mm isoflurane (∼2.4 times the anesthetic EC50) (36Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.02 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego CA). The software was used to fit concentration-response curves with non-linear regression curve fitting and to define significance of the glycine responses measured, either following MTS reagent applications or responses modulated by drugs, versus the control EC5–10 glycine responses using the paired Student's t test. For the rate of reaction experiments, the response of each oocyte was fit to a one-phase exponential association curve to determine the time and rate constants. These values were averaged and presented with their standard errors. Molecular Volume Calculations and Modeling—The volumes of the MTS reagents, the volumes of the corresponding alkyl thiols that functionally react with the substituted cysteine residue, and the volumes of the amino acids cysteine and serine were calculated using Spartan 5.0 (Wavefunction, San Diego, CA). Molecular modeling of the alcohol and anesthetic binding site was conducted as previously described (37Trudell J.R. Bertaccini E. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A model of the four transmembrane segments of a glycine receptor was built by threading the primary sequence of GlyR α1 over a template of a four-helix bundle found in the high-resolution structure of the cytochrome c oxidase (Protein Data Bank code 2OCC). An initial constraint on the model was that amino acid residues known to modulate anesthetic potency were in direct proximity to one another (Ile229 (TM1), Ser267 (TM2), and Ala288 (TM3)). A second set of constraints was that the pore-facing and lipid-facing residues identified in the literature should have appropriate positions. The entire structure was subjected to restrained molecular mechanics energy optimization with the CFF91 force field using Insight II (version 2000.1, Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The model revealed that other residues in TM2 might be in proximity to Ser267 and could be accessible to MTS reagents (Gly256, Thr259, Val260, Met263, Thr264, and Ser270). The positioning of hexyl MTS was based on forming the disulfide bond and then re-optimizing the GlyR model with harmonic restraints (100 kcal/Å2) on all the backbone atoms of the subunit to illustrate a likely orientation and show the scale of the molecule relative to the subunit. We used a homology model of the GlyR α1 to predict residues to mutate and to interpret the data (37Trudell J.R. Bertaccini E. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, for these purposes we also evaluated a model for ligand-gated ion channels based on cryoelectron micrographs of the Torpedo nAChR (Protein Data Bank code 1OED) (38Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). We have previously aligned GlyR α1 Ser267 with nAChR L257 (Glu266 in Protein Data Bank code 1OED) and GlyR α1 Ala288 with nAChR Leu279 (Glu288 in Protein Data Bank code 1OED) (39Bertaccini E. Trudell J.R. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, the corresponding residue in GABAA receptor α1 (A291) was aligned with nAChR Met278 (Glu287 in Protein Data Bank code 1OED) (40Bali M. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), so we included that residue in the evaluation. We measured the distance between pairs of Cα carbons on the backbone chain using the Viewer module of Insight II. As a second independent evaluation of Protein Data Bank code 1OED, we highlighted two critical residues in a nAChR α subunit that were identified in a tryptophan scanning mutagenesis study (41Guzman G.R. Santiago J. Ricardo A. Marti-Arbona R. Rojas L.V. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12243-12250Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We rendered those residues with space filling surfaces to visualize their orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer and the center of the subunit. We first tested the ability of MTS reagents of different lengths to covalently react with a cysteine introduced at amino acid residue 267 (S267C). Propyl MTS irreversibly potentiated the glycine response after being applied in both the absence of glycine (Fig. 1A) and in the presence of 1 mm glycine (Fig. 1B). In contrast, decyl MTS failed to irreversibly potentiate the S267C response following application in the absence of glycine (Fig. 1C), but could react and enhance S267C when applied in the presence of glycine (Fig. 1D). We extended these observations by testing a series of MTS compounds of different sizes ranging from C1 (methyl) to C16 (hexadecyl) to determine their ability to react with S267C. These neutral MTS reagents have structural similarities to alcohols and anesthetics. Exposure to MTS reagents was carried out in the absence of glycine (closed state) and in the presence of a maximal concentration of glycine (1 mm, open and desensitized states). Methyl MTS did not cause receptor enhancement after application in either the closed or open state. We found that MTS compounds of shorter chain lengths (propyl to octyl MTS) reacted with S267C when applied in both the presence and absence of glycine, but the longer chain MTS compounds (decyl to hexadecyl MTS) were able to irreversibly react and alter the glycine response only when applied in the presence of glycine (Fig. 1E). In all cases, except hexyl MTS, the enhancement observed was greater after the MTS reagent was applied in the presence of glycine, but the enhancement values by hexyl MTS in the open and closed states were not significantly different. In addition to the n-alkyl MTS compounds, we observed that benzyl MTS and the negatively changed pC-MBS- both caused enhancement of S267C after application in both conditions, but had no effect on the wild-type (Table I).Table IGlycine responses, expressed as percent of control, of wild-type (WT) and GlyR α1(S267C) receptors following application of sulfhydryl-specific reagents of different sizes Glycine responses of receptors 20 min following a 50 μm application of MTS compounds or pCMBS- in either the absence of glycine or presence of 1 mm glycine.

https://openalex.org/W1979994693,"Although hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIFα) subunit-specific hydroxylation and proteolytic breakdown explain the binary switch between the presence (hypoxia) and absence (normoxia) of HIFs, little is known of the mechanisms that fine-tune HIF activity under constant, rather than changing, oxygen tensions. Here, we report that the Drosophila HIFα homolog, the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS protein Sima (Similar), in hypoxic cultures of SL2 cells is expressed in full-length (fl) and splice variant (sv) isoforms. The following evidence supports the role of flSima as functional HIFα and the role of SL2 HIF as a transcriptional activator or suppressor. The pO2 dependence of Sima abundance matched that of HIF activity. HIF-dependent changes in candidate target gene expression were detected through variously effective stimuli: hypoxia (strong) > iron chelation, e.g. desferrioxamine (moderate) >> transition metals, e.g. cobalt ≃ normoxia (ineffective). Sima overexpression augmented hypoxic induction or suppression of different targets. In addition to the full-length exon 1–12 transcript yielding the 1510-amino acid HIFα homolog, the sima gene also expressed, specifically under hypoxia, an exon 1–7/12 splice variant, which translated into a 426-amino acid Sima truncation termed svSima. svSima contains basic helix-loop-helix and PAS sequences identical to those of flSima, but, because of deletion of exons 8–11, lacks the oxygen-dependent degradation domain and nuclear localization signals. Overexpressed svSima failed to transactivate reporter genes. However, it attenuated HIF (Sima·Tango)-stimulated reporter expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, svSima has the potential to regulate Drosophila HIF function under steady and hypoxic pO2 by creating a cytosolic sink for the Sima partner protein Tango. Although hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIFα) subunit-specific hydroxylation and proteolytic breakdown explain the binary switch between the presence (hypoxia) and absence (normoxia) of HIFs, little is known of the mechanisms that fine-tune HIF activity under constant, rather than changing, oxygen tensions. Here, we report that the Drosophila HIFα homolog, the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS protein Sima (Similar), in hypoxic cultures of SL2 cells is expressed in full-length (fl) and splice variant (sv) isoforms.

The pO2 dependence of Sima abundance matched that of HIF activity. HIF-dependent changes in candidate target gene expression were detected through variously effective stimuli: hypoxia (strong) > iron chelation, e.g. desferrioxamine (moderate) >> transition metals, e.g. cobalt ≃ normoxia (ineffective). Sima overexpression augmented hypoxic induction or suppression of different targets. In addition to the full-length exon 1–12 transcript yielding the 1510-amino acid HIFα homolog, the sima gene also expressed, specifically under hypoxia, an exon 1–7/12 splice variant, which translated into a 426-amino acid Sima truncation termed svSima. svSima contains basic helix-loop-helix and PAS sequences identical to those of flSima, but, because of deletion of exons 8–11, lacks the oxygen-dependent degradation domain and nuclear localization signals. Overexpressed svSima failed to transactivate reporter genes. However, it attenuated HIF (Sima·Tango)-stimulated reporter expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, svSima has the potential to regulate Drosophila HIF function under steady and hypoxic pO2 by creating a cytosolic sink for the Sima partner protein Tango. Oxygen homeostasis depends upon sensing variations in oxygen tension (pO2) and signal transduction, leading to physiologically appropriate changes in gene expression. Virtually all aerobic prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved various mechanisms for regulating genes during times of oxygen deprivation (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Particularly in hypoxia-tolerant species, i.e. those capable of surviving and even thriving in environments with little (hypoxia) or no (anoxia) oxygen present, these changes in gene expression, together with drastically reduced steady-state ATP levels, are critical determinants of the resilience of the organism to low oxygen (2Hochachka P.W. Buck L.T. Doll C.J. Land S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In contrast to most endothermic vertebrates (birds and mammals), invertebrates are often hypoxia-tolerant (3Hochachka P.W.

For example, embryos and adult stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster possess a rich and varied repertoire of survival strategies endowing them to withstand and fully recover from even hour-long exposure to anoxia (N2 atmosphere) (6Haddad G.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These responses vary once oxygen levels have declined to 1.6–3%, the critical pO2 of the species (7Csik L. Z. Vgl.

The following strategies are employed by fruit fly embryos and adults when faced with hypoxic/anoxic challenges: (a) ability to sense falling pO2 within seconds via a nitric oxide signaling pathway (11Wingrove J.A.

Another important oxygen-sensitive response in insects is the long known hypoxic stimulation of outgrowth and proliferation of tracheal termini for improved supply of limiting amounts of O2 to tissues (17Wigglesworth V.B.

This hypoxia-induced ramification of insect breathing tubes poses intriguing parallels to the O2 response in mammalian angiogenesis (21Klagsbrun M. Knighton D. Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 110-114PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar, 23Levy A. Levy N. Wegner S.

A wide range of animals, from mammals to fruit flies to nematodes, share a common pathway that links sensing of changes in pO2 to transcriptional regulation. Central to hypoxia-mediated gene expression are hypoxia-inducible (transcription) factors (HIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; HRE, hypoxia response element; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation domain; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; DFO, desferrioxamine; RT, reverse transcription; ORF, open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; svSima, splice variant Sima; flSima, full-length Sima.

Brain Res. 1999; 73: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), HIF is a heterodimer of α- and β-subunits that specifically recognizes short cis-regulatory E-box motifs called hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the promoter and/or enhancer regions of a number of genes (38Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wenger R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional HREs, i.e. those capable of oxygen-dependent binding of HIF proteins in vitro and transactivating reporter genes in vivo, can be summarized in the following consensus sequence: 5′-B(A/G)CGTGVBBB-3′ (where B is all bases except A and V is all bases except T) (40Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central 4-base core (underlined) is critical for the binding of any HIF complex, be it mammalian, insect, or crustacean (see accompanying article (87Gorr T.A. Cahn J.D. Yamagata H. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36038-36047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Oxygen-dependent activation of HIF is, in cell culture, controlled primarily at the protein level through specific oxidative modifications of the α-subunit (41Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The HIF oxygen sensor is a novel prolyl hydroxylase (42Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A.

Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Once hydroxylated, HIF-1α binds rapidly to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor product, enabling ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the proteasome (46Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 47Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicking agents such as transition metals (e.g. Co2+) and iron chelators (e.g. desferrioxamine) (42Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J.

The HIF dimer then translocates into the nucleus, where it activates target genes containing HRE-binding sites. This scheme for activation of HIF extends from mammals to invertebrates (42Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A.

In contrast, little is known about the means utilized by hypoxic cells to regulate HIF function. In D. melanogaster, hypoxia-specific HIF-like DNA-binding activity was first demonstrated in so-called SL2 cells cultured from late embryos of the fruit fly (50Nagao M. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Subsequently, structural homologs of HIF subunits were cloned in the form of the bHLH/PAS proteins Sima (Similar; HIF-1α homolog) (34Nambu J.R. Chen W. Hu S. Crews S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Tango (Drosophila ARNT; HIF-1β homolog) (Refs. 35Ohshiro T. Saigo K. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3975-3986PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4571-4582PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ma E. Haddad G.G. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 73: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; see Ref. 27Crews S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar for review). As expected for HIF proteins, Sima and Tango transcripts are ubiquitously expressed throughout embryogenesis and in nearly all tissues of Drosophila (34Nambu J.R. Chen W. Hu S. Crews S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4571-4582PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as in mammals, Sima stability and Drosophila HIF activity seem to be regulated in an O2-dependent fashion. Functionality of homologous amino acid motifs in Sima, predicted to confer normoxic instability (51Srinivas V. Zhang L.-P. Zhu X.-H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), was confirmed by hypoxic inductions of luciferase reporter plasmids through Sima-Gal4 fusion constructs (52Bacon N.C.M. Wappner P. O'Rourke J.F. Bartlett S.M. Shilo B.-Z. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249 (N. C. M.): 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fact that this transactivation was observed in mammalian cells indicates that Sima is able to functionally substitute for human HIF-1α and provides evidence for the close conservation of these signaling pathways between mammals and insects. Recent work on transgenic flies by Lavista-Llanos et al. (53Lavista-Llanos S. Centanin L. Irisarri M. Russo D.M. Gleadle J.M. Bocca S.N. Muzzopappa M. Ratcliffe P.J. Wappner P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6842-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) showed that in vivo HIF activity is most pronounced in developing tracheal cells, wherein proliferation is hypoxia-stimulated (see above). Both Sima and Tango are absolutely required for regulating the transcription of HRE-reporter constructs within tracheae of hypoxic fly embryos. Other α-like bHLH/PAS proteins known to also heterodimerize with Tango in a tissue-specific manner (54Ward M.P. Mosher J.T. Crews S.T. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1599-1608PubMed Google Scholar) were unable to elicit this hypoxic response (53Lavista-Llanos S. Centanin L. Irisarri M. Russo D.M. Gleadle J.M. Bocca S.N. Muzzopappa M. Ratcliffe P.J. Wappner P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6842-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These include the neurogenic factor Sim (Single-minded) (55Nambu J.R. Lewis J.O. Wharton Jr., K.A. Crews S.T. Cell. 1991; 67: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and, most notably, Trh (Trachealess), the master regulator that drives early tracheal development (56Isaac D.D. Andrew D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 57Wilk R. Weizman I. Shilo B.-Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Ss (Spineless), the Drosophila aryl hydrocarbon receptor homolog, and Dys (Dysfusion), another tracheogenetic bHLH/PAS factor, are two additional partner proteins for Tango (58Emmons R.B. Duncan D.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) by coexpressed Tango partners, the signaling pathways mediated by each α-like bHLH/PAS protein are maintained and controlled. To address the control and maintenance of Drosophila HIF signaling, we utilized SL2 cells (Schneider cells, line 2), which were originally cultured from late 20–24-h-old Drosophila embryos (63Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), a time of maximal HIF activity during Drosophila development (53Lavista-Llanos S. Centanin L. Irisarri M. Russo D.M. Gleadle J.M. Bocca S.N. Muzzopappa M. Ratcliffe P.J. Wappner P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6842-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The fact that Sim and Trh, potential Tango competitors, are not expressed in this cell line (36Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4571-4582PubMed Google Scholar) makes our investigations less complicated. Thus, SL2 cells are well suited as a model for investigating the function and control of Drosophila HIF. Cell Culture—SL2 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1963) or received as generous gifts from Drs. A. Michelson and N. Perrimon. The cells were cultured as described in the accompanying article (87Gorr T.A. Cahn J.D. Yamagata H. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36038-36047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SL2 cells were grown at 22 °C in air either as monolayer or suspension cultures. Standard hypoxic challenge comprised 16-h exposure at 22 °C to 1 or 4% oxygen (balance N2) using an Espec BNP-210 incubator (Tabai Espec Corp.). Hypoxic exposures that differed from these standard conditions are specified below. In addition, SL2 cells were exposed for 16 h to each of the known mammalian HIF-stabilizing agents CoCl2 and desferrioxamine (DFO) at 100 μm (42Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S.

RNA Isolation, Northern Blotting, and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Experiments—Total RNA was isolated from normoxic, hypoxic (1 and 4% pO2), cobalt-treated, or DFO-treated SL2 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 25-μg aliquots of RNA were size-separated on denaturing 6% formaldehyde and 1% agarose gels, in which the 18 S rRNA and the processed half-molecules of the 28 S rRNA (i.e. 28 Sa and 28 Sb) (65Long E.O.

Next, RNA was blotted in 20× SSC buffer onto positively charged nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C with 20–30 ng of the following RT-PCR-isolated and 32P-labeled cDNA probes: (a) Similar (FlyBase symbol Sima and ID FBgn0015542), a 531-bp KpnI/SacI fragment between exons 1 and 3 (amino acid 1–174); (b) Tango (FlyBase symbol Tgo and ID FBgn0015014), 670-bp PstI fragment between amino acids 43 and 267 (the tango gene contains an intronless open reading frame (ORF)); (c) ribosomal protein L29 (FlyBase symbol RpL29 and ID FBgn0016726), 256 bp of the entire ORF; (d) globin-1 (FlyBase symbol Glob1 and ID FBgn0027657), 477 bp of the entire ORF; (e) lactate dehydrogenase (FlyBase symbol ImpL3 and ID FBgn0001258), 514-bp ClaI/BamHI fragment between exons 1 and 2 (amino acid 51–224); (f) CG11652 (ID FBgn0036194), 624-bp XbaI/EcoRI fragment between exons 1 and 2 (amino acids 244–454 = C terminus); and (g) DNA (cytosine 5)-methyltransferase-2 (FlyBase symbol Mt2 and ID FBgn0028707), a 785-bp BtgI fragment between amino acids 36 and 299 (the mt2 gene contains an intronless ORF). Membranes were washed the following day with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS solution at 55 °C and exposed to phosphoimager screens. Following stripping of the membranes, the loading control was assessed through the constitutive expression of the rpL29 gene, which encodes a structural polypeptide of the large (60 S) ribosomal subunit. Relative changes in expression between normoxic (control) and hypoxic or hypoxia-mimicking (Co2+, DFO) (64Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) conditions were quantified by background-subtracted object-average densitometry of the signal bands (ImageQuant Mac Version 1.2 software, Amersham Biosciences). For RT-PCR experiments, first strand cDNA templates, derived from normoxia/hypoxia/cobalt/DFO-treated total RNAs, were amplified using gene-specific primers that mostly spanned from the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) sequences across the ATG start codon into the ORF (forward primer) and from the ORF across the stop codon into the 3′-UTR nucleotides (reverse primer) (see Supplemental Table 1 for compilation of all primers used in this study). A typical PCR protocol used ExTaq polymerase (PanVera) and continued for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for up to 4 min. PCR products were TA-cloned into the pCR2.1/Topo cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced for validation. Empirical determination of the formation of normoxic and hypoxic PCR products after various numbers of cycles helped define the exponential amplification phase for each cDNA individually. This approach was used as a second screen to monitor differential gene expression and will be referred to as RT-PCRexp. In general, RT-PCRexp yielded relative expression levels in excellent agreement with Northern data, yet with greater sensitivity. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)— Following 16-h exposures to normoxic, various hypoxic (0–10% oxygen), cobalt, or DFO treatments, SL2 nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared and used in EMSAs as described in the accompanying article (87Gorr T.A.

We used the following wild-type HRE oligonucleotide (W18) of the 3′-enhancer of the human erythropoietin gene (67Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell.

A large excess of the following M18 mutant oligonucleotide (0.75–1.5 μg) was also used in these binding reactions to minimize nonspecific (but not HIF) binding to the W18 probe: 5′-AGCTTGCCC(TAAAAGCT)GTCTCAG-3′ (where the mutated core bases are underlined). Cloning of Full-length and Splice Variant Sima cDNAs into pAc5.1— Dr. S. Crews kindly donated a pAc5/Tango expression construct containing the full-length 1.9-kb cDNA (start-to-stop codon) of the Drosophila tango gene. Overexpression and cotransfection experiments of Drosophila HIF necessitated the cloning of the bHLH/PAS protein Sima as the functional fly HIFα homolog (52Bacon N.C.M. Wappner P. O'Rourke J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2050426138,"Brain drain, the international migration of scientists in search of better opportunities, has been a long-standing concern, but quantitative measurements are uncommon and limited to specific countries or disciplines. We need to understand brain drain at a global level and estimate the extent to which scientists born in countries with low opportunities never realize their potential. Data on 1523 of the most highly cited scientists for 1981-1999 are analyzed. Overall, 31.9% of these scientists did not reside in the country where they were born (range 18.1-54.6% across 21 different scientific fields). There was great variability across developed countries in the proportions of foreign-born resident scientists and emigrating scientists. Countries without a critical mass of native scientists lost most scientists to migration. This loss occurred in both developed and developing countries. Adjusting for population and using the U.S. as reference, the number of highly cited native-born scientists was at least 75% of the expected number in only 8 countries other than the U.S. It is estimated that approximately 94% of the expected top scientists worldwide have not been able to materialize themselves due to various adverse conditions. Scientific deficit is only likely to help perpetuate these adverse conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1966580641,"β-Catenin is an example of a typical molecule that can be translocated bidirectionally through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) on its own in a facilitated manner. In this work the nuclear import and export of β-catenin were examined to compare the sequence requirement of this molecule and to determine whether molecular interactions required for its bidirectional NPC passage are distinct or not. Deletion analysis of β-catenin revealed that armadillo repeats 10–12 and the C terminus comprise the minimum region necessary for nuclear migration activity. Further dissection of this fragment showed that the C terminus tail plays an essential role in nuclear migration. The region of β-catenin required for export substantially overlapped the region required for import. Therefore, the NPC translocation of β-catenin is apparently reversible, which is consistent with findings reported previously. However, different translocating molecules blocked nuclear import and export of β-catenin differentially. The data herein indicate that β-catenin shows an overlapping sequence requirement for its import and export but that bidirectional movement through the NPC proceeds through distinct molecular interactions."

Here we show that MTA3 gene regulation by ER is influenced by dynamic changes in levels of nuclear coregulators. MTA3 promoter has a functional ER element half-site with which MTA1 and HDACs interact under basal conditions. Upon estrogen stimulation, these corepressors are derecruited with concomitant recruitment of ER, leading to increased MTA3 transcription and expression. Genetic inactivation of MTA1 pathway promotes the ability of ER to up-regulate MTA3 expression, whereas knockdown of ER enhances MTA1 association with MTA3 gene. Modulation of ER functions, by corepressors (i.e. MTA1 and MTA1s) or coactivators (i.e. AIB1 and PELP1/MNAR), alters ER recruitment to MTA3 chromatin, MTA3 transcription, and expression of downstream epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition components. These studies provide novel insights into the transregulation of the MTA3 gene and reveal novel roles of upstream determinants in modifying the outcome of MTA3 axis and cell differentiation.

The development of human breast cancer is promoted by estrogen stimulation of mammary epithelial cell growth. Estrogen receptor-α (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor-α; MTA, metastatic tumor antigen; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ERE, estrogen response element; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PR, progesterone receptor; HDAC, histone deacetylase. is the major estrogen receptor in the human mammary epithelium. The binding of estrogen to ER triggers conformational changes that allow ER to bind to the 13-base-pair palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) in the target gene promoters and stimulates gene transcription thereby promoting the growth of breast cancer cells. The transcriptional activity of ER is affected by a number of regulatory cofactors including chromatin-remodeling complexes, coactivators, and corepressors (1Belandia B. Parker M.G.

The MTA1 gene is shown to correlate well with the metastatic potential of several human cell lines and cancers, including breast cancers (8Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar) have shown that MTA1 interacts with ER and represses ER transcription by recruiting HDAC to the ERE-containing target gene chromatin in breast cancer cells. MTA1-overexpressing breast cancer cells exhibit aggressive phenotypes (13Mahoney M.G. Simpson A. Jost M. Noe M. Kari C. Pepe D. Choi Y.W. Uitto J. Rodeck U. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2161-2170Google Scholar). MTA1s, another family member, is a naturally occurring variant of MTA1 that contains a novel sequence of 33 amino acids with one potential nuclear receptor binding motif, LRILL. MTA1s inhibits ER nuclear signaling by sequestering ER in the cytoplasm but enhances ER cytoplasmic signaling and thus promotes tumor-igenesis (14Kumar R. Wang R. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar). One of the principal phenotypic changes in breast cancer metastasis is the increased tendency of the cancer cells to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition that is characterized by reduced expression and consequently, functions of cell-adhesion components such as E-cadherin (15Imai T. Horiuchi A. Wang C. Oka K. Ohira S. Nikaido T. Konishi I. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1437-1447Google Scholar, 16Mercer J.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 309-314Google Scholar, 17Conacci-Sorrell M. Simcha I. Ben-Yedidia T. Blechman J. Savagner P. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol,. 2003; 163: 847-857Google Scholar). The zinc finger transcriptional repressor, Snail, mediates the repression of E-cadherin expression and leads to the inhibition of Snail function in epithelial cells, thus, restoring the expression of E-cadherin as well as cell-to-cell junctions (18Fearon E.R. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 307-310Google Scholar, 19Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia de Herreros A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Google Scholar). Recently, Fujita et al. (20Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Google Scholar) identified MTA3 as an ER-regulated gene and showed that MTA3 up-regulation prevents EMT by directly repressing Snail and thereby up-regulating E-cadherin. Although these observations highlight the significance of EMT in breast cancer invasiveness and suggest a complex role for MTA family members in modifying ER functions in breast cancer cells, the precise mechanism by which ER regulates MTA3 expression and the putative nature of upstream determinants of MTA3 expression remain poorly understood. Here we show that MTA3 contains an ER element half-site and that both ER and MTA1 are recruited to the same site in the MTA3 promoter chromatin. Further, estrogen stimulates MTA3 promoter activity in a corepressor-sensitive manner. In addition, modulation of ER functions by corepressors (i.e. MTA1 and MTA1s) or coactivators (i.e. AIB1 and PELP1/MNAR) results in the suppression or stimulation of ER recruitment to the MTA3 chromatin and consequently affects the expression of EMT components. Together, these studies reveal that the dynamic changes in the levels of ER coregulators influence ER regulation of MTA3 and reveal a novel role for nuclear coregulators in modifying the outcome of MTA3-mediated EMT. Cell Lines and Reagents—MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cervical cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MCF-7 clones stably expressing MTA1, MTA1s, and PELP1 have been described earlier (12Mazumdar A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22119-22127Google Scholar). Steroid hormone E2, tamoxifen, and charcoal-stripped serum (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide serum) was purchased from Sigma. ICI-182, 780 was purchased from Tocris, Ellisville, MO. Antibodies against MTA1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and T7 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was procured from Novagen (Milwaukee, WI). Antibodies for E-Cadherin were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and ER antibody was purchased from UBI. The Snail antibody used here has been described before (22Dominquez D. Montserrat-Sentis B. Virgos-Soler A. Guaita S. Grueso J. Porta M. Puig I. Baulida J. Franci C. Garcia de Herreros A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5078-5089Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-peptide against MTA3 was generated against the mouse MTA3 amino acids 420-438 (sequence SDEEKSPSPTAEDPRARSH). The MTA3·GST fusion protein was run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter. The blot was stained with Ponceau S, and the region of the blot with the GST·MTA3 fusion protein was cut. The GST-MTA3 blots were incubated in 10 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin for 3-4 h at 4 °C to block nonspecific sites. The bovine serum albumin-treated nitrocellulose pieces were incubated with diluted rabbit antiserum in cold overnight. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose pieces were washed 4× in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 for 5 min each and transferred to Eppendor tubes, and the bound MTA3 antibody was eluted by sequential incubation with 300 μl of monoclonal antibody purification system buffer, pH 3.0, for 5 min. Immediately after elution, 200 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 9.5, was added to prevent denaturation of the antibody. The eluates were pooled and stored -20 °C. Cloning of MTA3 Promoter and MTA3 cDNA—To clone the MTA3 promoter, we first identified the BAC clone (number RP11-314A20) containing the MTA3 genomic region using human genome sequence information. We then purchased the BAC clone from BACPAC Resources (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). Two fragments (1078 and 735 bp) of the MTA3 promoter region were amplified by PCR. The amplified products were cloned into the PGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using SacI and XhoI sites. The sequence of the construct was verified by comparing its sequence with that in the human genome data base. PCR based cloning was used to generate the deletion construct and point mutation of the 1078 bp MTA3 promoter. PCR product of MTA3 cDNA was cloned at pcDNA3.1A using KpnI and XhoI sites (see Table I for primer sequences).Table IPrimer and siRNA sequences used in the studyMTA3 promoter cloningMTA3-pro1988FtgtcagagagctcttggtgggatctctggtaMTA3-pro3066RgagcctcgaggctctagggccaggaaMTA3-pro2331FttatttgagctctttgcctcagctatgcaMTA3-pro3066RgagcctcgaggctctagggccaggaaMTA3 promoter deletion/mutationMTA3pro2073FtgacacagagctcagaatttgacacacMTA3pr-mut-F2acgaggaaacagagcatagagtcaMTA3pr-mut-R2tgactctatgctctgtttcctcgtMTA3 reverse transcriptase-PCR FaccctcgtgttagaagtcacgtgtMTA3 reverse transcriptase-PCR RgcagcataattaatagcaacaaaggMTA3 cDNA cloningMTA3-startgcgggtacccatggcggccaacatgtaccgggtMTA3-stopcaacatctcgagttaagaatttaaaagcatctMTA3 ChIP primersMTA3ChIPF1ggaatagagagaagggacctaacgcMTA3ChIPR1tgagcctcaagaggggttacaaMTA3ChIPF2cataagcaatttctcctccttcgaaMTAChIPR2tcacgtccccattttatagacgagMTAChIPR3acacagctgtgtgctgtcgactMTAChIPF4tggtttctaggtggcttttgMTAChIPR4tggtggcttgtttggaatgtMTA1 siRNAMta1siRNA-1aaccctgtcagtctgctataaMta1siRNA-2aagaccctgctggcagataaaMta1siRNA-3aagattttctcccgtggaagtMta1siRNA-4aagaagcgcggctaacttattControl siRNANonspecific pooled duplex control catalog number SD-001206-13-80 Open table in a new tab Reporter Assays—For the reporter gene transient transfections, cells were cultured for 24 h in minimal essential medium without phenol red containing 5% N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide serum. The MTA3-luciferase reporter constructs were transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with E2 for 16 h. The cells were then lysed with a passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase assay was performed using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The total amount of DNA used in the transfections was kept constant by adding a parental vector. Each transfection was carried out in six-well plates in triplicate wells. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Approximately 106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration, v/v) for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link histones to DNA. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (12Mazumdar A. Wang R. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Yarmand R.B. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar). An ER-α-specific antibody, MTA1 mAb, or T7 mAb were used for the immunoprecipitation of protein-bound chromatin, and precipitated DNA was amplified by PCR using primers flanking the proximal half-ERE site (see Table I for primer sequences). The amplified fragment was sequence-verified. Gene Knockdown by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—ER-α-specific siRNA and control nonspecific siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. For MTA1 knockdown, 4-for-Silencing siRNA Duplexes were designed using a Qiagen program and synthesized at Qiagen. siRNA transfections were carried out using 20 μm pooled siRNA duplexes and by using 4 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in six-well plates. After 72 h, cells were prepared for ChIP assay or Western blotting. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Studies—The cellular location of proteins was determined using indirect immunofluorescence, as described previously (14Kumar R. Wang R. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar). In brief, MCF-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips in six-well culture plates. When the cells were 50% confluent, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold methanol for 6 min, and then processed for immunofluorescence staining of endogenous MTA3, E-Cadherin, or Snail. Cells were counterstained with ToPro3 to visualize the nucleus. Slides were further processed for imaging and confocal analysis using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope and a 40× objective. Cloning and Regulation of MTA3 Promoter by Estrogen—To delineate the mechanism of ER regulation of MTA3 expression, we first analyzed the sequence of the putative MTA3 promoter region (GenBank™ genomic sequence accession number NT_022184) for the presence of ER-responsive elements using Matinspector (Genomatix). This program did not reveal any consensus 13-bp ERE sites. However, we found that the MTA3 promoter contains three potential ERE half-sites (TGACC) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, all the three ERE half-sites were localized in the vicinity of AP1 binding sites. Because a number of ER-responsive genes have been shown to be regulated via ERE half-sites in conjunction with either AP1 or SP1 sites (23Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Google Scholar), we examined the potential involvement of these ERE half-sites in the regulation of MTA3 expression by ER. To explore the recruitment of ER to the endogenous MTA3 promoter, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with or without estrogen and subjected to ChIP assays using an anti-ER antibody. We found that ligand-activated ER is recruited to the endogenous MTA3 promoter at the ER element half-site from positions -1256 to -1245 but not to the other two potential sites (Fig. 1B). To verify these results, we next designed a pair of primers that encompass proximal as well as the middle potential ERE half-sites. Results showed estrogen-induced recruitment of ER to the MTA3 promoter region of expected 714 bp (Fig. 1B, right panel). To ascertain that the detected 239-bp band indeed represents the regulatory region corresponding to the proximal ERE half-site, the PCR-amplified DNA fragment was cloned into a TOPO vector and confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). Estrogen-induced recruitment of ER to the MTA3 promoter chromatin was effectively blocked by the inclusion of anti-estrogen ICI-182780 suggesting that estrogen-activated recruitment of ER to the MTA3 gene was specific. Because ER recruitment to the MTA3 promoter was also inhibited by the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 1C), it appears that this event requires new protein synthesis, and the noted effects could be mediated via an indirect mechanism. This appears to be consistent with the notion that ER action through an ERE half-site requires an associated factor and that direct interaction with DNA may not be involved (21Balasenthil S. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22119-22127Google Scholar). Given that it has been demonstrated previously that estrogen up-regulates both its own receptor, ER, as well as ER coactivators expression (21Balasenthil S. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22119-22127Google Scholar, 24Tata J.R. Baker B.S. Machuca I. Rabelo E.M. Yamauchi K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 105-119Google Scholar), it seemed likely that sufficient quantities of ER and its coactivators were necessary for up-regulation of MTA3 expression by estrogen. To test this hypothesis, we looked at the levels of ER under the same experimental conditions and did not find changes in ER amounts in the cell for any of the conditions. To further study the regulation of the MTA3 promoter via the ERE half-site, a MTA3 promoter fragment was amplified from the BAC clone and DNA fragments of desired sizes, 1078 and 735 bp, were obtained. The MTA3 promoter fragments were cloned into a pGL3-luciferase reporter system. The functionality of MTA3-luciferase vectors was tested in MCF-7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Estrogen treatment of the cells stimulated the MTA3-regulatory element-driven reporter activity from the 1078-bp fragment (-1528 to -450, contains two ERE half-sites, at -1459 and at -1241) but not from the 735-bp fragment (-1185 to -450, lacks -1241-bp ERE half-site) (Fig. 2B), and therefore, the MTA3 1078-bp luciferase construct was used in the subsequent studies. Estrogen-stimulated MTA3 promoter activity was effectively blocked by tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, which also had a modest inhibitory effect on basal MTA3 promoter activity (Fig. 2, C and D). To validate the proximal ERE half-site (at -1241) in the estrogen stimulation of MTA3 promoter, we created a point mutation up to -1241 and deletion at -1450 of the 1078-bp MTA3 promoter. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, the point mutation at the proximal ERE half-site abolished the estrogen stimulation, whereas deletion of the middle ERE half-site did not affect estrogen stimulation as compared with the 1078 bp fragment. Together, these findings confirm that the observed recruitment of ligand-activated ER to the MTA3 promoter chromatin is accompanied by increased MTA3 promoter activity. Regulation of MTA3 Expression and EMT by MTA1—Because MTA1 and MTA1s are natural inhibitors of ER functions (12Mazumdar A. Wang R. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Yarmand R.B. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar, 14Kumar R. Wang R. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar, 25Kumar R. Wang R. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 30-37Google Scholar), we next tested whether the deregulation of these proteins may influence MTA3 expression and functions. Using breast cancer cells stably expressing T7-MTA1 (12Mazumdar A. Wang R. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Yarmand R.B. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar) or T7-MTA1s (14Kumar R. Wang R. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar), we found that the repression of ER function by MTA1 or MTA1s abolished the ability of estrogen to promote the recruitment of ER to the MTA3 gene chromatin (Fig. 3, A and B). Because both MTA1 and MTA1s had similar effects, we used only MTA1 to repress the functions of ER in subsequent studies. Overexpression of MTA1 in breast cancer cells also resulted in the inability of estrogen to induce MTA3 mRNA (Fig. 3C). The observed inhibition of MTA3 expression by MTA1 was at the level of transcription, as coexpression of MTA1 inhibited both the basal and estrogen-induced stimulation of MTA3 promoter activity (Fig. 3D). In MTA1 overexpressing conditions without estrogen stimulation, expression of the MTA3 protein was not inhibited, whereas MTA3 promoter activity did show repression. Based on these results, one could speculate that there could be additional regulatory elements that may be involved in MTA3 basal expression in the physiological setting. It could also be possible that the basal repression observed in the promoter-reporter analysis is due to an inherent limitation of the assay system, because it reflects the regulation of the promoter area largely in isolation and under artificial conditions. Results from confocal scanning microscopy also demonstrated that MTA1 deregulation leads to a significant reduction in the levels of nuclear MTA3, up-regulation of Snail and consequent down-regulation of E-cadherin as compared with the levels of MTA3, Snail, and E-cadherin in control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4). All of the above findings suggest that the inhibition of ER transactivation functions by MTA1 could impair the ability of ER to up-regulate MTA3 expression.Fig. 4Expression of MTA3 and its downstream effectors in MTA1 overexpressing cells by confocal microscopy. Confocal analysis of E-cadherin (top panel), MTA3, and Snail in MCF-7 cells expressing pcDNA (middle panel) and MTA1 (bottom panel). In the top panel, E-cadherin was stained red and in the bottom panel, MTA3 was stained green, and Snail was red. The nuclei were visualized using Topro3 (blue). The cells were all cultured in 10% serum containing medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Modulation of MTA3 Chromatin by ER Coregulators—Because MTA1 prevented the recruitment of ligand-activated ER to the MTA3 promoter, we next investigated the possibility of MTA1 recruitment to the MTA3 promoter chromatin. MCF-7 cells were treated with or without estrogen, and chromatin lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MTA1 antibody. We found that MTA1 associates with the MTA3 promoter in unstimulated MCF-7 cells but not in estrogen-stimulated cells (Fig. 5A). MTA1 association with the MTA3 promoter was found to be at the proximal ERE half-site, which was also immunoprecipitated in the ER ChIP assay. These observations suggest that MTA1 associates with the basal MTA3 promoter chromatin and upon estrogen treatment is derecruited with simultaneous recruitment of ER to the ER element half-site in the MTA3 promoter chromatin. Because MTA1 has been shown to physically interact with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (6Toh Y. Kuninaka S. Endo K. Oshiro T. Ikeda Y. Nakashima H. Baba H. Kohnoe S. Okamura T. Nicolson G.L. Sugimachi K. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 19: 105-111Google Scholar), we next examined whether the HDACs also interact with the basal MTA3 promoter. Results from ChIP studies using anti-HDAC antibodies show the association of the HDACs with the MTA3 promoter that, like MTA1, were also derecruited from the MTA3 promoter upon estrogen treatment (Fig. 5B). These findings raise possibility that the basal MTA1 association with the MTA3 promoter might influence the status of EMT components presumably because of the inhibitory effect of MTA1 on the ER transactivation functions. To test this notion, we silenced endogenous MTA1 expression using siRNA and examined the status of MTA3 target genes, as well as ER target genes in MCF-7 cells. Results indicated that inhibition of MTA1 expression leads to the down-regulation of Snail and the up-regulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, there was also significant up-regulation of progesterone receptors PR-A and PR-B, well established ER target gene products, thus suggesting enhanced ER transactivation functions due to reduced levels of MTA1 and, consequently, loss of corepressor functions of MTA1. Consistent with these findings, a reduction in the levels of MTA1 by siRNA was accompanied both by an increased basal expression of MTA3 and the enhanced ability of estrogen to up-regulate MTA3 expression (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, there was also increased estrogen-induced stimulation in the levels of ER in MTA1 knockdown cells (data not shown) implying that in the absence of MTA1, ligand-induced up-regulation of ER might participate in the amplification of ER regulation of MTA3 expression. Regulation of MTA3 Gene by the Endogenous MTA1—To determine whether the above changes in the levels of MTA3 and its targets in MTA1 knockdown MCF-7 cells were because of a modification of the MTA3 chromatin in the vicinity of the ER element half-site, we next performed ChIP analysis of ER recruitment on the MTA3 chromatin under conditions of MTA1 knockdown (Fig. 6A). We found that the suppression of endogenous MTA1 expression leads to detectable basal association of ER with the MTA3 promoter, which as expected was further enhanced upon estrogen signaling. The above result was corroborated in a luciferase assay system where the knockdown of MTA1 resulted in a significant increase in both basal and estrogen-induced MTA3-luciferase activity (Fig. 6B). Consistent with these results, silencing of the endogenous MTA1 in MCF-7 cells resulted in a substantial decrease in the recruitment of HDACs to the MTA3 promoter segment, and estrogen stimulation led to complete dissociation of the HDACs from the MTA3 promoter (Fig. 6C). To further support the notion that MTA1 and ER might be competing for the ER element half-site in the MTA3 promoter, we next knocked down the endogenous ER in MCF-7 cells by siRNA, as assessed by the levels of ER and the ER target gene products, PR-A and PR-B (Fig. 6D). As before, cells were also treated with a control siRNA. Next we performed a ChIP assay to analyze the status of MTA1 recruitment on the MTA3 promoter under the conditions of ER knockdown. We found that ER silencing indeed leads to a significantly increased association of endogenous MTA1 with the basal MTA3 chromatin. Results also suggest that estrogen stimulation was unable to trigger derecruitment of MTA1 from the MTA3 promoter region (Fig. 6E). Together, these experiments establish that the MTA3 promoter is a target of MTA1 and that manipulation in the levels of MTA1 expression influences the recruitment pattern of ER to the MTA3 promoter chromatin in a significant manner. In conformity with a recent report (20Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Google Scholar), we found that estrogen signaling increases MTA3 protein levels (Fig. 7B) in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. 7A shows Western blot analysis carried out to characterize the MTA3 antibody and indicates the abundant amounts of MTA3 protein in MCF-7 cells. Because the ER-mediated activation of transcription involves recruitment of coactivators to the promoter area, we next examined the potential role of ER coactivators in the regulation of MTA3 expression. Using previously characterized MCF-7 cells stably expressing T7-PELP1 (also known as MNAR) (26Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Google Scholar), we showed that estrogen stimulation leads to enhanced recruitment of PELP1/MNAR to the MTA3 promoter chromatin (Fig. 7C), implying a role of coactivators in the regulation of MTA3 expression by ER. To determine the impact of MTA1 in the recruitment of coactivators to the MTA3 promoter chromatin, we next used MCF-7 cells expressing T7-MTA1 and examined the ability of estrogen to recruit AIB1, another ER-coactivator (27Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar, 28Liao L. Kuang S.Q. Yuan Y. Gonzalez S.M. O'Malley B.W. Xu J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 83: 3-14Google Scholar), to the MTA3 promoter chromatin. As illustrated in Fig. 7D, upon estrogen stimulation, we found significant recruitment of endogenous AIB1 to the MTA3 promoter chromatin in MCF-7/vector cells. Deregulation of MTA1 completely abolished the noticed AIB1 interaction with the MTA3 promoter chromatin. To further understand the mechanistic participation of ER coactivators in the regulation of MTA3 expression, we next examined the ability of PELP1 and/or AIB1 to stimulate MTA3 transcription using promoter assays (Fig. 7E). We observed a substantial induction of the MTA3 promoter activity by PELP1/MNAR or AIB1 in comparison with the vector-cotransfected cells. Coexpression of both PELP1/MNAR and AIB1 further augmented transcriptional activity of the MTA3 promoter as compared with expression of the individual coactivators by themselves. Interestingly, overexpression of MTA1 completely inhibited the ability of PELP1/MNAR and/or AIB1 to stimulate MTA3 transcription. In brief, these observations suggest that the MTA3 chromatin segment, containing the bona fide ER recruitment site, represents a highly dynamic surface for ER as well as ER interacting coactivators and corepressors. The resulting transcriptional activity may be tightly regulated by the dynamic interplay of ER coregulators. Fujita et al. (20Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Google Scholar) made an interesting observation that each of the MTA family members could be essential components of distinct subsets of the Mi-2·NuRD complexes that have unique functional properties. MTA1 repression of MTA3 expression could presumably be a mechanism by which the cell type-specific transcription is controlled. We hypothesize that the levels of MTA1 in the cell would determine which subset of the Mi-2·NuRD complex would be active to carry out its specialized function. Because MTA1 has been shown to be associated with more metastasis and invasiveness in tumors, regulation of MTA3 gene expression by MTA1, both under basal conditions as well as in the presence of estrogen, assumes importance. In this context, MTA1 overexpression, leading to the down-regulation of MTA3 and E-cadherin expression, would give the tumors survival and metastatic advantage over other cells. In our model cell lines, the overexpression of MTA1 resulted in non-responsiveness of these cells to estrogen in terms of induction of MTA3 gene by ER. It could be speculated that this could be one of the mechanisms by which tumors eventually stop responding to estrogen and consequently, anti-estrogen therapy. Furthermore, it is also possible that MTA1 may also repress gene expression of both ER and its coactivators in these situations. If it does so, then MTA1 could be targeted for therapeutic intervention to sensitize the tumor cells to anti-estrogen therapies, which could have tremendous clinical impact. We thank Dr. Myles A. Brown for AIB1 antibodies, and Dr. Antonio Garcia de Herreros for helpful comments about this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1977597059,"The 300-kDa cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) plays a critical role in the trafficking of newly synthesized mannose 6-phosphate-containing acid hydrolases to the lysosome. The receptor contains two high affinity carbohydrate recognition sites within its 15-domain extracytoplasmic region, with essential residues for carbohydrate recognition located in domain 3 and domain 9.

In addition, expression of truncated forms of the CI-MPR demonstrated that domain 9 can be expressed as an isolated domain, retaining high affinity (Kd ∼ 1nm) carbohydrate binding, whereas expression of domain 3 alone resulted in a protein capable of only low affinity binding (Kd ∼ 1 μm) toward a lysosomal enzyme. In the current report the crystal structure of the N-terminal 432 residues of the CI-MPR, encompassing domains 1–3, was solved in the presence of bound mannose 6-phosphate.

The structure reveals the unique architecture of this carbohydrate binding pocket and provides insight into the ability of this site to recognize a variety of mannose-containing sugars. The biogenesis of lysosomes, which are key components of the degradative machinery of eukaryotic cells, requires the action of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). 1The abbreviations used are: MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CI-MPR, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CD-MPR, cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; Man-6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Two MPRs, the 300-kDa cation-independent MPR (CI-MPR) and the 46-kDa cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR), participate in the intracellular delivery of ∼50 different lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome by diverting these soluble acid hydrolases from the secretory pathway and delivering them from the trans Golgi network to endosomal compartments (1Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Unlike the CD-MPR, the CI-MPR has been shown to function in the binding and internalization of ligands at the cell surface. The higher capacity of the CI-MPR than the CD-MPR in sorting lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome is due in part to the ability of the CI-MPR at the cell surface to re-capture lysosomal enzymes that may have been secreted, resulting in their internalization and delivery to endosomal compartments (2Stein M. Zijderhand-Bleekemolen J.E. Geuze H. Hasilik A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Sohar I. Sleat D. Gong Liu C. Ludwig T. Lobel P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to lysosomal enzymes, the repertoire of extracellular mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)-containing ligands has expanded in recent years to include a diverse spectrum of proteins including the precursor form of transforming growth factor-β and renin, proliferin, granzymes A and B, CD26, and herpes simplex viral glycoprotein D (4Dahms N.M. Hancock M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 317-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated the interaction of these ligands with the CI-MPR at the cell surface as being essential to their activity and/or function (5Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Griffiths G.M. Isaaz S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Saris J.J.

Burke R.L. Hoflack B. Ludwig T. Dingwell K.S. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3517-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus expanding the role of the CI-MPR from solely an intracellular protein carrier to a cell surface signaling molecule via its lectin activity. The CI-MPR is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein. Its large 2269-residue extracytoplasmic region is composed of 15 domains that display limited sequence identity (14–38%), similar size (∼150 residues), and cysteine distribution to each other and to the CD-MPR (9Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CI-MPR contains two high affinity carbohydrate binding sites (10Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with essential residues localized to domain 3 and domain 9 (11Westlund B. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the two carbohydrate binding sites of the CI-MPR are structurally and functionally quite distinct from each other. Expression of truncated forms of the CI-MPR demonstrated that domain 9 could be expressed alone, folding into a high affinity (Kd ∼ 1 nm) carbohydrate recognition domain, whereas the domain 3 alone construct exhibited ∼1000-fold lower affinity binding toward a lysosomal enzyme. Furthermore, expression of domains 1–3 resulted in a high affinity binding site, suggesting that residues in adjacent domains (domains 1 and/or 2) are important either directly or indirectly for optimal binding by domain 3 (13Hancock M.K. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47205-47212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Binding studies have also demonstrated that, like the CD-MPR, domain 9 is specific for phosphomonoesters, whereas domains 1–3 are more promiscuous in that they can recognize mannose 6-sulfate and phosphodiesters with only a 10–20-fold lower affinity than Man-6-P (14Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have recently solved the crystal structure of domains 1–3 of the CI-MPR, which demonstrated that each domain exhibits similar topology, consisting of a flattened 9-stranded β-barrel, to each other and to the CD-MPR (15Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and revealed the unique, compact arrangement of the three domains (16Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of phosphomannosyl recognition by the CI-MPR was not clear since this protein (domains 1–3) contained within its carbohydrate binding pocket a non-phosphorylated oligosaccharide from a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice (16Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We now report the crystal structure of domains 1–3 of the bovine CI-MPR in complex with Man-6-P. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant protein encoding residues 1–432 (domains 1 (residues 1–124), 2 (residues 125–281), and 3 (residues 282–432); domains 1–3) of the mature bovine CI-MPR was expressed in Trichoplusia ni 5B1–4 cells and purified as described previously (14Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, media containing the secreted protein was dialyzed extensively against buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.7, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate before loading on a pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose column. The protein was eluted from the column with the imidazole buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P (Sigma). Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein was concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml before use in crystallization studies. Protein crystals were grown by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of precipitating solution (0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.35, 25% polyethylene glycol 4000). The drops were allowed to equilibrate over 500 μl of precipitating solution at 19 °C, and thin, rectangular plate-shaped crystals appeared typically within 3–7 days. Crystals were soaked for 15 min in a cryoprotection solution containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.35, 28% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 20% glycerol before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. A native data set and an osmium-soaked data set of domains 1–3 were collected using an R-AXIS IIC image plate equipped with a Rigaku RU200 generator, a Rigaku/MSC X-stream cooling system operating at -175 °C, and Osmic blue confocal mirrors. The osmium derivative crystal was prepared by soaking a crystal in the precipitating solution with an additional 3% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 10 mm K2OsCl6. Although different preparations of the domains 1–3 protein were purified in the same manner and crystallized under the same conditions, the crystals obtained belong to two different crystal forms, one monoclinic (space group, P21) and the other orthorhombic (space group, P212121), that were dependent upon the protein preparation batch. Because the orthorhombic form diffracted to a higher resolution (1.8 Å), its structure was solved first (16Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the resulting structure of the orthorhombic form revealed that, although Man-6-P was present in the crystallization medium, it was not found in the crystal structure. Consequently, in an attempt to elucidate the Man-6-P binding mode of domains 1–3, the structure determination of the monoclinic form was initiated. The monoclinic asymmetric unit contains two molecules of domains 1–3 with a calculated Matthews coefficient of 2.29 Å3/Da and a solvent content of ∼45%. Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Therefore, the osmium-soaked crystal was treated as “native” and hereafter is referred to as “Native 1.” The molecular replacement method was employed using the refined crystal structure of the orthorhombic form of domains 1–3 as the search model (Protein Data Bank code 1Q25). Two distinct solutions corresponding to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit were found using the molecular replacement protocol in the CCP4 (18Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) version of AmoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were then subjected to 20 rounds of rigid body refinement in which each molecule was treated as a rigid unit. The resulting Rfree was 35.6% using 40–2.1-Å data. This model was further refined using CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

Cross-validation, bulk solvent correction, and anisotropic B-factor scaling were used throughout. Initial rounds of refinement consisting of positional refinement, slowcool-simulated annealing, and restrained B-factor refinement were alternated with manual fitting of the model into the electron density maps using Turbo-Frodo (21Roussel A. Inisan A.G. Knoops-Mouthuy E. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo, The Manual. Marseille, France2002Google Scholar). In the final stages of fitting and during the addition of water molecules, the simulated annealing step was omitted. The resulting structure revealed one osmium bound near residue Arg-200 in each molecule with a relatively high B value (61.1/77.4 Å2), suggesting a low occupancy. To ensure that the osmium-soaking did not perturb any local structure, a subsequently obtained native data set (“Native 2”) was used for the “real” native structure determination. Because the native crystal and the osmium-soaked crystals were isomorphous, the structure determination was carried out in the same manner as outlined above, except that the molecular replacement procedure was omitted (Table I). A representative region of the Fo - Fc omit map from the native data set (Native 2) is shown in Fig. 1. The two structures are virtually the same (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.), 0.50 Å), and therefore, unless stated otherwise, the structure discussed in this paper is that generated from the osmium data set. Overall Structure—The N-terminal 432 residues of the bovine CI-MPR, comprising three of the 15 domains of the receptor extracellular region (Fig. 2A), was expressed and purified from the medium of T. ni 5B1–4 insect cells (14Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The purified protein was crystallized in the presence of Man-6-P, and the structure has been refined to 2.1 Å with good geometry (Table I). There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit with the noncrystallographic symmetry axis located between the adjacent carbohydrate ligands. Molecule A has two regions of noncontinuous density and is composed of residues 7–82, 88–307, and 312–432. In contrast, molecule B has three regions of discontinuous density, and the model is composed of residues 7–82, 87–228, 234–309, and 311–432. In both molecules A and B, two of the three potential glycosylation sites (Asn-76 and Asn-365) show density for the attached oligosaccharides (Table I). Although no density is detected for an oligosaccharide attached to Asn400 in either molecule, there is ample room in the crystal packing to accommodate several sugar residues. Domains 1, 2, and 3 each fold into a flattened 9-stranded β-barrel composed of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1-β4) with its strand direction orthogonally oriented over a five-stranded β-sheet (β5-β9) in which β9 interjects between β7 and β8 (Fig. 2B). Each domain contains four disulfide bridges. The domains are joined together through linker regions composed of flexible coils and two short anti-parallel β-strands (-2β and -1β). The overall fold of the two molecules is the same (r.m.s.d. is 0.71 Å for all Cα-atoms) as are the corresponding individual domains (the r.m.s.d. is 0.77, 0.65, and 0.42 Å for domains 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The current structure is also similar to the previously reported structure of domains 1–3 bound to a nonphosphorylated oligosaccharide of a crystallographic neighbor (16Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with r.m.s.d. of 0.67 and 0.68 Å for molecules A and B, respectively, for all Cα atoms. The previously reported structure (16Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was solved from crystals belonging to an orthorhombic space group (P212121) compared with the monoclinic space group (P21) presented here. These results support the conclusion that the three-dimensional arrangement observed between domains 1, 2, and 3 of the CI-MPR is not the result of crystal packing but is likely the most stable structure in solution. Carbohydrate Binding Site—Although the crystal structure of the CD-MPR in the presence of phosphomannosyl residues has provided much information concerning the mechanism of carbohydrate recognition by this dimeric receptor (15Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the molecular basis for carbohydrate binding by the CI-MPR has been unclear. To predict which residues of the CI-MPR are involved in high affinity ligand binding, a structure-based sequence alignment of the CI-MPR with the CD-MPR was performed followed by site-directed mutagenesis of single residues. These studies demonstrated that substitution of Gln-348, Arg-391, Glu-416, Tyr-421, or Ser-387 within domain 3 resulted in a decrease in the receptor affinity for a lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, by greater than 1000-fold (12Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Four of these residues, Gln-348, Arg-391, Glu-416, and Tyr-421, are also conserved in the CD-MPR and in domain 9 of the CI-MPR (Fig. 2A) and are positioned to directly interact with Man-6-P (Fig. 3, A and B). Glu-416 and Tyr-421, which are located on β-strands 8 and 9, respectively (Fig. 2A), are within hydrogen-bonding distance of the 4- and 3-hydroxyl groups of the mannose ring, whereas Gln-348 and Arg-391, which are located on β-strands 3 and 7, respectively (Fig. 2A), are within hydrogen-bonding distance to the 2-OH of the mannose ring (Fig. 3, A and B). Qualitative and quantitative binding studies demonstrated that substitution of Tyr-324 or Ser-386 within domain 3 resulted in a partial (<∼100-fold) inhibitory effect on carbohydrate recognition by domains 1–3 of the CI-MPR (12Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that Tyr-324 interacts with the 1-hydroxyl group of the mannose ring, whereas Ser-386 (both backbone nitrogen and side-chain hydroxyl) interacts with phosphate oxygens and a water molecule (W1), which is one of the three conserved water molecules found in the binding pocket of both molecules A and B (Fig. 3). Comparison of the two molecules of the asymmetric unit reveals that the distances measured between residues of the CI-MPR and Man-6-P are the same within the limit of error (Fig. 3B), indicating a stable binding pocket geometry. The relative positioning of these four amino acids (Gln-348, Arg-391, Glu-416, and Tyr-421) observed in the current structure is the same as that found in our previously reported structure containing a non-phosphorylated oligosaccharide in the binding pocket (16Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and is also conserved in the CD-MPR (see below and Fig. 4C). Taken together, the current structure demonstrates that Gln-348, Arg-391, Glu-416, and Tyr-421 carry out their essential role in phosphomannosyl recognition by serving as direct hydrogen-bonding partners to the hydroxyl groups of mannose.Fig. 4Similarity between the carbohydrate binding site of the CD-MPR and domain 3 of the CI-MPR.A, stereo view of the solvent-accessible surface of domain 3 of the CI-MPR (green) in complex with Man-6-P (gold).

Surfaces in the region for domain 1 (blue) and domain 2 (pink) are also included for clarity. Surfaces were generated using GRASP (32Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). B, stereo view of the solvent-accessible surface of the CD-MPR (purple) in complex with Man-6-P (gold).

Loop D has been highlighted for clarity (dark purple, CD-MPR; silver, domain 3). The disulfides are shown in yellow: CD-MPR (Cys-106–Cys-141) and domain 3 (Cys-385–Cys-419). Man-6-P (gold ball-and-stick model) is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ser-387, located within loop C (between β-strands 6 and 7) of domain 3, was also identified as a residue critical for Man-6-P recognition; substitution of Ser-387, which is not conserved in domain 9 or in the CD-MPR (Fig. 2A), resulted in a >1200-fold decrease in binding affinity compared with that of the wild-type receptor (12Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, unlike the other four essential residues (Gln-348, Arg-391, Glu-416, and Tyr-421), Ser-387 does not interact directly with any of the atoms of Man-6-P (Fig. 3). However, the structure reveals that the hydroxyl group of Ser-387 participates in a hydrogen-bonding network that appears to be an integral part of the binding pocket (Fig. 3). Ser-387, which structurally is in the same location as Cys-106 of the CD-MPR (see Fig. 4C), makes a hydrogen bond contact with the phosphate group of the ligand through a conserved bridging water (W1) (Fig. 3). Ser-387 also participates in tethering loop D; the hydroxyl group of Ser-387 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to another conserved water (W3), which bridges the backbone carbonyl group of Asp-418 of loop D. The backbone carbonyl of Asp-418 in turn interacts with the side-chain nitrogen of Lys-98 in domain 1, which in turn makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Val-417 (Fig. 3C). Thus, substitution of Ser-387 with alanine would disrupt this intricate hydrogen-bonding network, resulting in a perturbation of the binding pocket and interdomain contacts (see below and Fig. 5). Furthermore, with the exception of a substitution of Arg for Ser at position 386 in the wallaby CI-MPR, Lys-98, Tyr-324, Gln-348, Ser-386, Ser-387, Arg-391, Glu-416, Asp-418, and Tyr-421 are conserved among all species of the CI-MPR sequenced to date (12Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), supporting the critical role these residues play in the formation of a high affinity carbohydrate binding site. Comparison to the Carbohydrate Binding Site of the CD-MPR—The sole members of the P-type family of lectins, the CI-MPR and the CD-MPR, are distinguished from all other lectins by their ability to recognize phosphorylated mannose residues. Our previous crystal structures of the CD-MPR in the presence of Man-6-P (15Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or a phosphorylated oligosaccharide (22Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or in the absence of ligand (23Olson L.J. Zhang J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10156-10161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have provided much information concerning the mechanism of ligand binding by the homodimeric CD-MPR. Sequence analyses of the two MPRs, which demonstrated significant sequence homology, similar size, and cysteine distribution between the 15 domains of the CI-MPR and the extracellular region of the CD-MPR, led to the proposal that the receptors arose from duplication of a single ancestral sequence (24Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and suggests that the mode of carbohydrate recognition is also conserved between the two receptors. The current structure now allows us to determine whether the mechanism of phosphomannosyl recognition has been conserved by comparing the carbohydrate binding site of the CD-MPR with that of the N-terminal binding site of the CI-MPR. The overall shape of the binding pocket is clearly different between the two MPRs, with domains 1–3 of the CI-MPR forming a much more shallow and open binding site (Fig. 4A) than that observed in the CD-MPR (Fig. 4B). This is particularly apparent when comparing the solvent inaccessibility of the bound ligand; in the case of the CD-MPR, 80% of the phosphate moiety is solvent-inaccessible compared with 45% for domains 1–3 of the CI-MPR. The openness of the binding pocket of domains 1–3 is consistent with the ability of domains 1–3, but not the CD-MPR, to bind phosphodiesters (14Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Distler J.J. Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21687-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate binding pocket of the MPRs can be viewed as having two functional regions; one region (“base”) interacts with the sugar ring, and the other region (“lid”) interacts with the phosphate moiety. The binding pocket of domain 3, like that of the CD-MPR (15Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is composed of four finger-like regions. β-Strands 1 and 2 and β-strands 3 and 4 make up two of the finger-like regions. These four strands form a β-sheet, and in conjunction with residues adjacent to loop D (joins β-strands 8 and 9) form the base of the binding pocket. Residues that interact with the mannose ring (Gln-348, Arg-391, Glu-416, Tyr-421) are conserved between the CD-MPR and domain 3 of the CI-MPR and are located in a strikingly similar position, forming the same contacts with the ligand (Fig. 4C). As observed with domains 1–3 of the CI-MPR (12Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), substitution of these residues has shown that each is critical for high affinity Man-6-P recognition by the CD-MPR (26Olson L.J.

This uptake is mediated by oligosaccharide receptors including the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the mannose receptor. We have sought to exploit alternative receptor systems that are independent of glycosylation but allow for efficient delivery to the lysosome. Fusions of the human lysosomal enzymes α-l-iduronidase or acid α-glucosidase with the receptor-associated protein were efficiently endocytosed by lysosomal storage disorder patient fibroblasts, rat C6 glioma cells, mouse C2C12 myoblasts, and recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing individual members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. Uptake of the fusions exceeded that of phosphorylated enzyme in all cases, often by an order of magnitude or greater. Uptake was specifically mediated by members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor protein family and was followed by delivery of the fusions to the lysosome. The advantages of the lipoprotein receptor system over oligosaccharide receptor systems include more efficient cellular delivery and the potential for transcytosis of ligands across tight endothelia, including the blood-brain barrier.

Enzyme replacement therapy for lysosomal storage disorders relies on the efficient delivery of recombinant enzyme to all of the affected tissues of the patient (1Kakkis E.D. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Uptake of enzyme from the blood following intravenous administration requires specific oligosaccharides on the enzyme itself and corresponding oligosaccharide receptors on target cells. Examples include the binding of phosphorylated high-mannose oligosaccharides on α-l-iduronidase by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) 1The abbreviations used are: MPR, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; RAP, receptor-associated protein; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; rhIDU, recombinant human α-l-iduronidase; rhGAA, recombinant human acid α-glucosidase; CHOΔL, LRP-null CHO cell line; 4-MUI, 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-l-iduronide; sLRP2, recombinant ligand-binding domain 2 of LRP1; RAP-IDU, fusion of RAP and IDU; RAP-GAA, fusion of RAP and GAA; Bis-7, oligomannose 7 bisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; FACE, fluorophoreassisted carbohydrate electrophoresis; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and binding of high-mannose oligosaccharides on glucocerebrosidase by the mannose receptor (2Zhao K.W.

The former system is the basis for treatment of patients with Hurler syndrome, the latter for Gaucher syndrome. Factors that limit uptake by these systems include the extent to which the recombinant enzyme is modified with the necessary oligosaccharides and the density of the oligosaccharide receptors on different tissues. The absence of quality control mechanisms for oligosaccharide modifications in the secretory pathway can lead to poorly modified recombinant enzymes. This deficiency has been addressed, with varying success, by post-secretory modification of recombinant enzymes with glycosidases or glycosyltransferases (4Murray G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 149: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another solution to the problem is to utilize alternative uptake mechanisms that rely on protein-based, rather than oligosaccharide-based, targeting determinants. Some studies have focused on the use of small, basic peptides, like human immunodeficiency virus TAT, for this purpose (5Green I. Christison R. Voyce C.J. Bundell K.R. Lindsay M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 213-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Xia H. Mao Q. Davidson B.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach using insulin-like growth factor-2, a peptide ligand for the MPR (7LeBowitz J.H. Grubb J.H. Maga J.A. Schmiel D.H. Vogler C. Sly W.S. Proc.

The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family is one of the most widely distributed and intensively utilized receptor types in the body (8Argraves W.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D406-D416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 10Herz J.

The LDLR family consists of a diverse group of trans-membrane, cell-surface receptors that bind to a wide variety of different ligands. A number of LDLR family members, including the LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) and megalin/LRP2, are professional endocytic receptors that mediate uptake of bound ligands into cells with subsequent delivery to the lysosome (12Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Megalin also mediates transcytosis of some of its ligands across epithelial cell layers, including the brain capillary endothelium, kidney proximal tubule epithelium, and thyroid epithelium (13Marino M.

All members of the LDLR family except for LDLR itself are bound with high affinity by the receptor-associated protein (RAP), a 39-kDa resident of the endoplasmic reticulum (17Li Y. Lu W. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4921-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Bu G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 209: 79-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Bu G. Curr.

RAP acts as a chaperone, preventing association of LDLR family members with their physiological ligands in the secretory pathway, a function that permits proper folding of the receptors prior to their transport to the cell surface. LRP ligand-binding domains are made up of arrays of cysteine-rich, calcium-binding modules called complement-type repeats (20Andersen O.M. Christensen L.L. Christensen P.A. Sorensen E.S. Jacobsen C.

RAP binds to particular pairs of these repeats with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range (21Andersen O.M. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C.

Whereas undetectable in circulating plasma, intravenous injection of RAP results in rapid, receptor-mediated uptake into tissues (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This report describes fusions between RAP and two human lysosomal enzymes, α-l-iduronidase (IDU) and acid α-glucosidase (GAA). IDU is the deficient enzyme in Hurler/Scheie syndrome; GAA is the deficient enzyme in Pompe syndrome. These fusion proteins have been characterized with respect to enzyme activity, glycosylation, LRP binding, and receptor-dependent uptake into cells. We have determined that the fusions retain the receptor binding ability of RAP as well as the catalytic activity of the lysosomal enzyme. Our evidence supports uptake of the fusions into cells followed by delivery to the lysosome and degradation of the RAP moiety, leaving the lysosomal enzyme cargo intact. This system represents a highly efficient alternative to oligosaccharide receptor-dependent delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the cells of affected patients, and offers the possibility of transport of lysosomal enzymes across endothelial cell layers connected by tight junctions, such as those that make up the blood-brain barrier. Materials—Human fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository. Rat C6 glioblastoma cells and mouse C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Recombinant human RAP, expressed in bacteria, was purified as previously described (25Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol.

All chromatography media were from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with purified preparations of rhIDU, rhGAA, or RAP. Polyclonal antisera were analyzed for antibody titer and antigen specificity. Antibodies were found to be highly specific for their respective antigens. For Western blotting, proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer containing 2% (w/v) dry milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. For detection of rhIDU antigen, anti-rhIDU antiserum (BP13, BioMarin) was diluted 25,000-fold into blocking buffer. For detection of GAA antigen, anti-rhGAA antiserum (BP32, BioMarin) was diluted 2,500-fold into blocking buffer. For detection of RAP antigen, purified anti-RAP IgG (BP41/42, BioMarin) was diluted to 0.022 μg/ml into blocking buffer. Bound primary antibodies were detected with affinity purified alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Promega) diluted 5,000-fold in blocking buffer. Blots were developed with Western Blue™ colorimetric substrate (Promega), rinsed with distilled water, and scanned. Fusion Expression Constructs—The human RAP coding sequence, encompassing amino acids 35–353, was amplified from human liver cDNA using PfuTurbo™ polymerase (Stratagene) and the primers RAPF (5′-GCGATAGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAGAAGAACCAGCCCAAGCCGTCCCCGA-3′) and RAPR (5′-GCGATAAACCGGTTTCTGCCTCGGCGCGAGCTCTGGAGATCCTGCCGGACAGGTCCT-3′). This por tion of the RAP coding sequence includes neither the signal peptide nor the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (HNEL). The RAP sequence encoded by the amplified fragment was identical to that previously reported (GenBank™ accession NM_002337). The 5′-RAP primer incorporates an in-frame BamHI site at the 5′-end. The 3′-RAP primer adds sequence encoding a six amino acid spacer (AEAETG), which also includes an in-frame AgeI site at the 3′-end. The modified RAP sequence was ligated into an expression vector as an in-frame fusion with either human IDU (amino acids 27–652) or human GAA (amino acids 70–952). Both lysosomal enzyme sequences lacked their signal peptides and, in the case of GAA, the propeptide sequence as well. Both IDU and GAA sequences were modified by PCR to include in-frame 5′-AgeI sites and 3′-XhoI sites. The human IDU sequence was amplified with primers: IDUfuseF, 5′-GCGATAACCGGTGAGGCCCCGCACCTGGTGCATGTGGACGCGGCCCGCGCGCTGTGG-3′; and IDUfuseR, 5′-GCGATACTCGAGTCATGGATTGCCCGGGGATGGGGGCCCTCTTGGCACAGGGACC-3′. The amplified IDU fragment was sequenced and found to be identical to the equivalent portion of the IDU cDNA used to manufacture the rhIDU used in these studies (26Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The human GAA sequence was amplified with primers: GAAfuseF, 5′-GCGATAACCGGTGCACACCCCGGCCGTCCCAGAGCAGTGCCCAC-3′; and GAAfuseR, 5′-CTCGAGTCAACACCAGCTGACGAGAAACTGCTCTCCCATCAACAGC-3′. The amplified GAA fragment was sequenced and found to encode a protein sequence identical to that previously published (GenBank accession NM_0001520). The BamHI-AgeI-digested RAP and AgeI-XhoI-digested IDU or GAA fragments were ligated into a BamHI-XhoI-digested expression vector based upon pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The vector was modified to include the rabbit β-actin IVS2, the rat preproinsulin transcript leader sequence, and the first 18 amino acids (signal peptide) of human melanotransferrin. The melanotransferrin signal peptide contained a 3′-BamHI site allowing in-frame fusion to RAP. Plasmid vectors were linearized with AclI and transfected into an LRP1-null CHO-K1 line (CHOΔL) using Cytofectene™ (Bio-Rad). Transfections were performed exactly as specified by the manufacturer's protocol. Clones were selected by limiting dilution in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 and screened for expression using fluorescent monosaccharide substrates for the respective lysosomal enzymes. Clones expressing RAP-IDU (CHOΔL-RI7) and RAP-GAA (CHOΔL-RG20) were selected for further studies. Expression of RAP Fusions—CHOΔL-RI7 and CHOΔL-RG20 were cultured in T-flasks using a protein-free medium (JRH) supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Production was carried out in the absence of serum in pH, oxygen, and temperature-controlled 3L Applikon bioreactors. Cells were grown on Cytopore 1™ microcarrier beads (Amersham Biosciences) for the production phase. Microcarriers were retained during perfusion using an internal settler device. Bioreactor perfusion rates were determined by monitoring residual glucose in the medium. Purification of RAP Fusions—RAP fusion-containing cell culture media was clarified by passage through Sartopore 1.2-μm depth filters (Sartorius) and then sterilized by sequential passage through 0.45- and 0.2-μm PES membrane filters. The protease inhibitors l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were included in the media prior to filtration to mitigate proteolysis of the RAP portion of the fusions. The sterile, clarified medium containing the RAP-IDU fusion was pH adjusted to 6.5 and then sequentially resolved on Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, Phenyl-Sepharose HP, and SP-Sepharose Fast Flow. Enzymatically active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and when necessary, diafiltered using a 50-kDa molecular mass cut-off mini-TFF membrane (Vivascience). RAP-GAA was purified with an initial DEAE Fast Flow flow-through step. The fusion was then sequentially resolved on Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and Phenyl-Sepharose HP. In-process and final eluates were treated as described for RAP-IDU. Both purified RAP fusions were formulated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 150 mm NaCl. Expression and Purification of RhIDU and RhGAA—Human lysosomal α-l-iduronidase and acid α-glucosidase were expressed and purified essentially as previously described (26Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Van Hove J.L. Yang H.W. Oliver L.M. Pennybacker M.F. Chen Y.T. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

The purified enzymes were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme Activity Assays—Enzyme activities were determined by the hydrolysis of small fluorigenic monosaccharide substrates in a 96-well plate format. Specifically, IDU activity was measured by serially diluting samples in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 5.8, containing 200 μg/ml BSA. Diluted samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to adding substrate. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-α-l-iduronide (4-MUI, Toronto Research Chemicals) was then added as a 5 mm stock solution in 400 mm sodium formate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The final 4-MUI concentration was 2.5 mm. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to quenching with stop solution at pH 11. Fluorescence was measured with a microplate fluorimeter (Molecular Devices) using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and an emission wavelength of 446 nm. GAA activity was measured by serially diluting samples in 62 mm sodium citrate, 77 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 4.0. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucoside was diluted from an ethylene glycol monomethyl ether stock solution into the same buffer and added to the diluted samples to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before quenching with stop buffer at pH 11. Assay results represent the mean of at least four dilutions giving values in the linear range. All samples were run in duplicate. Standard deviations of assay samples did not exceed 6% of the mean value. One milliunit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone produced per min at 37 °C. Kinetic Analysis of RhIDU and RAP-IDU—RhIDU and RAP-IDU at final concentrations of 1 nm were incubated at 22 °C for 5 min in PBS, pH 5.8, containing 200 μg/ml BSA and 0.016, 0.031, 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm 4-MUI. Assays were otherwise performed as described above. Results were plotted as milliunits of IDU activity per min for each substrate concentration. Curves were fitted using GraphPad Prism software.

The latter were obtained using ProtParam software. Degradation of RAP Fusions by Lysosomal Proteases in Vitro—Lysosomal proteases cathepsin B, D, and L (Calbiochem) were reconstituted in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, and stored frozen. For the digests, 1 μg of each fusion protein was incubated with an equimolar mixture of cathepsins, ∼80 nm final concentration for each, in 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 4.5, for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) followed by the addition of 2% SDS sample loading buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved on 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Characterization of Oligosaccharides by Fluorophore-assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis (FACE)—FACE analysis was performed essentially as described (30Starr C.M. Masada R.I. Hague C. Skop E. Klock J.C. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 720: 295-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Hague C. Masada R.I. Starr C. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 2612-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins (200–400 μg) were denatured and treated with N-glycanase (Prozyme) to release N-linked oligosaccharides. Isolated oligosaccharides were then fluorescently labeled by reductive amination with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfate and resolved on polyacrylamide gels with fluorescence detection. Band identity was inferred by measuring mobility relative to known oligoglucose standards. When necessary, oligosaccharide identities were confirmed by additional FACE analysis after digestion with specific exoglycosidases. Characterization of Oligosaccharides by Isoelectric Focusing—Purified fusions were treated with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, at 37 °C for 1 h. Treated samples and untreated controls were analyzed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) on pH 3–9 Phastgel™ gradient gels (Amersham Biosciences). Characterization of Oligosaccharides by Digestion with Endo H and N-Glycanase—Following digestion with cathepsins as described, samples were incubated with Endo H (New England Biolabs) or N-glycanase (Prozyme) using the manufacturer's protocols and resolved on 4–20% gradient Tris glycine SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie Blue staining. Ligand Blots—Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) were pre-wet in methanol and then equilibrated in PBS (11.9 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Membranes were then mounted in a Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus. The second ligand-binding domain of LRP1 (sLRP2, 1 μg/well) was applied to the membrane by vacuum filtration. The membrane was then cut into sections that were placed in separate wells of a 24-well plate. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 5 mm CaCl2 and 3% nonfat dry milk for 30 min. Test proteins were incubated with each membrane spot for 2 h at room temperature. Individual spots were washed twice for 5 min with blocking buffer and then incubated with anti-RAP or anti-IDU antibodies in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature to detect binding of the ligand to sLRP2. Stability of RAP Fusions in Serum and Plasma—RAP-IDU was diluted to 150 μg/ml in human serum and plasma, both adjusted to pH 7.4 with 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. Diluted samples were assayed for volumetric IDU activity (milliunits/ml) and integrity by Western blotting prior to incubation in a 37 °C dry incubator for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 7 h. Following incubation, samples were assayed again for both volumetric IDU activity and integrity on Western blots. For comparison, RAP-IDU was incubated for similar intervals in the final formulation buffer, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 150 mm NaCl. Uptake of RAP Fusions into Cell Lines—Fibroblasts and myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS; C6 glioma cells were grown in Ham's F-10 supplemented with 15% horse serum in addition to 2.5% FBS. For the determination of the half-life of GAA in fibroblasts, the FBS used in the cell culture medium was treated to inactivate endogenous GAA activity by adjusting to pH 10 with NaOH, incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, and then readjusting to pH 7.4 with HCl. For each uptake experiment, appropriate test proteins were diluted into serum-free growth media containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA and incubated with cells, in duplicate, for various intervals up to 2 h. Uptake experiments were performed in 12-well tissue culture plates. Test protein concentrations were determined from A280 measurements and theoretical extinction coefficients based on amino acid composition. Following incubation, cells were rinsed with PBS, and trypsinized. Cell pellets were collected by low-speed centrifugation, washed with cold PBS, and lysed by freezing at -80 °C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The soluble lysate fractions were assayed in duplicate for enzyme activity as described and for total protein using the Pierce bicinchonic acid (BCA) method. In some cases, lysate samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting as previously described. Uptake of RAP-IDU into Fibroblasts in the Presence of Serum— Experiments were done exactly as described above except that the uptake medium contained 50% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific catalog number 3000A). Uptake of RAP Fusions into Cells Expressing Specific LRP Receptors—RAP-GAA was labeled with Na125I using Iodogen beads (Pierce). Unincorporated label was removed by gel filtration on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). An aliquot of the labeled fusion was trichloroacetic acid precipitated and specific activity was calculated. CHO LRP-null cells stably expressing different LDLR family receptors or Brown Norway rat yolk sac cells expressing megalin (100,000 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates 1 day prior to the experiment. Cells were then incubated with 125I-RAP-GAA (5 nm) for 4 h at 37 °C in minimal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 6 mg/ml BSA. Each cell type was tested in triplicate with and without 500 nm unlabeled RAP. After incubation, conditioned medium was removed and proteins were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. Remaining soluble counts were measured in a γ-counter. Cells were washed with PBS, lysed with 1 n NaOH, and total protein determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay (12Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J.

Prevention of Glycosaminoglycan Accumulation in Hurler Fibroblasts by Incubation with IDU or RAP-IDU—Human GM1391 Hurler fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Four days prior to the experiment, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 250,000 cells per well. On the day of the experiment, cells were fed with sulfate-free medium (Irvine Scientific), 15% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm CaCl2 for 1 h and then the same medium was supplemented to 4 μCi/ml with [35S]sodium sulfate and 5 nm of either RAP-IDU or rhIDU alone. Cells were incubated in this medium for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air. Cell layers were rinsed three times with PBS before and after trypsinization. Pellets were lysed in 0.5 n NaOH and neutralized with 1 m HCl. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Bradford assay in 96-well plates. Radioactivity in the lysates was counted in Beckman ReadyCaps™. Expression of Fusion Proteins—RAP fusions were configured such that the RAP coding sequence was located N terminal to the lysosomal enzyme coding sequence. The order of the sequences was based on previously published studies demonstrating that GST-RAP fusions, in which RAP is located C-terminal to GST, had up to 10-fold lower affinity for LRP than RAP alone (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 2We have subsequently observed that reversing the order of RAP and IDU in the fusion blocks the ability of RAP to bind to LRP on filters, data not shown. A CHO-K1 mutant (CHOΔL) was chosen for production of the RAP fusions (33FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J.

Irradiation of DNA with ultraviolet (UV) light produces various damaged bases, leading to cellular transformation and cell death (1Setlow R.B. Nature. 1978; 271: 713-717Google Scholar, 2Suzuki F.

One of the major products formed by UV irradiation is the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. (Fig. 1), from the photo [2 + 2] cycloaddition of the 5,6-double bond of two adjacent pyrimidine nucleotides. Organisms have a variety of enzymes playing crucial roles in repair-systems for damaged DNA, including nucleoside excision repair systems and photoreactivation (4Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 91-405Google Scholar). CPD photolyases, which function as members of the DNA repair systems, restore the CPD to normal pyrimidines by photoreactivation. To elucidate the mechanism of DNA repair by CPD photolyase, various biological and spectroscopic experiments have been performed. This enzyme has a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as an essential cofactor (5Sancar A. Sancar G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 223-227Google Scholar). The FAD is excited by light, and then transfers one electron to the CPD bases (6Eker A.P.M. Hessels J.K.C. van de Velde J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1758-1765Google Scholar, 7Johnson J.L.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2673-2679Google Scholar). After the electron transfer, the cyclobutane ring splits and then one electron is transferred back to the FAD (9Kim S.T. Heelis P.F. Sancar A.

In order to understand the mechanism based on structural analyses, the crystal structures of the CPD photolyases from Escherichia coli, Anacystis nidulans, and Thermus thermophilus have been solved without the substrates, i.e. CPD-containing DNAs (11Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Google Scholar, 12Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A. de Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P. Miki K. Nat. Struct.

The x-ray studies revealed that the enzymes share a similar global fold, which consists of an α/β domain and a helical domain. The helical domain is composed of clusters I and II, and a cavity is formed between the clusters, where the FAD is deeply buried. It has been suggested that the cavity is used for the CPD binding, because the asymmetric polarity of the cavity fits well with that of the CPD (11Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Google Scholar, 12Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A. de Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P. Miki K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 887-891Google Scholar, 13Komori H.

Based upon the crystal structures without the substrates, two research groups have proposed computer models of the DNA-CPD photolyase complex, in which the relative orientations of the DNA chain are different from each other (11Park H.W.

However, no crystallographic or NMR structure information on the complexes is presently available.Here, we report NMR analyses of the DNA recognition mechanism by T. thermophilus CPD photolyase with a molecular weight of 48 kDa. Initially, we analyzed DNA complexed with the CPD photolyase and its mutants by 31P NMR. These analyses revealed the orientation of the bound DNA relative to the enzyme. Next, more detailed analyses of the CPD lesion, utilizing stable isotope-labeled DNA, revealed that the CPD base is buried in the cavity in the DNA-CPD photolyase complex, and that the CPD is flipped out of the DNA helix in the complex. We discuss the correlation between the structural information and activity on the basis of the present NMR data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Oligonucleotides and CPD Photolyase from T. thermophilus—Oligonucleotides labeled with 13C and 15N were prepared according to a published method (16Smith D.E. Su J.Y. Jucker F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 245-253Google Scholar). The other oligonucleotides without the CPD lesion were purchased from ESPEC Oligo Service Corp. d(CGCAAT[CPD]TAAGCCG) was chemically synthesized as previously reported (17Torizawa T. Yamamoto N. Suzuki T. Nobuoka K. Komatsu Y. Morioka H. Nikaido O. Ohtsuka E. Kato K. Shimada I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 944-951Google Scholar). The other oligonucleotides containing CPD lesions were prepared by UV irradiation (0.9 J/cm2) with a FUNA-UV-LINKER FS-800 (Funakoshi) and were purified in the same way as previously reported (17Torizawa T. Yamamoto N. Suzuki T. Nobuoka K. Komatsu Y. Morioka H. Nikaido O. Ohtsuka E. Kato K. Shimada I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 944-951Google Scholar). The CPD photolyases from T. thermophilus HB27 and its mutants were prepared, according to an established procedure (18Kato R. Hasegawa K. Hidaka Y. Kuramitsu S. Hoshino T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6499-6503Google Scholar). The enzymes labeled with 2H were also obtained in the same way, except that the E. coli strains expressing them were cultured for 24 h in M9 medium containing d-glucose-2H7 and 2H2O instead of d-glucose and H2O, respectively.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—The binding constants of the CPD photolyase and its mutants to d(GTAT[CPD]TATG), containing a biotin at the 5′-end, were determined using a BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore AB) in the same way as reported previously (17Torizawa T. Yamamoto N. Suzuki T. Nobuoka K. Komatsu Y. Morioka H. Nikaido O. Ohtsuka E. Kato K. Shimada I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 944-951Google Scholar), except that the enzyme concentration range was 10-100 nm.NMR Measurements—Four different buffers were used for the NMR measurements. Buffer I: 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 200 mm NaCl, and 3 mm NaN3 in 2H2O. Buffer II: Buffer I plus 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% ethylene glycol, with the 2H2O reduced to 10%. Buffer III: Buffer I plus 10 mm dithiothreitol-2H10 and 5% ethylene glycol-2H6 with a 100 mm concentration of NaCl. Buffer IV: the pH of Buffer III was changed to 6.5, and the 2H2O was reduced to 10%. The experiments to assign the 31P resonances of the oligodeoxynucleotides in the absence of the enzymes were carried out at a concentration of 0.5-2 mm in 420 μl of Buffer I, in the same way as reported previously (19Torizawa T.

Buffer II was used for one-dimensional 31P NMR measurements in the absence and presence of the enzymes and for 31P-31P exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) experiments.

In these experiments, the NMR samples were dissolved in Buffer III. The measurements described above were performed at 37 °C. The other experiments described below were carried out at 30 °C, and the samples were dissolved in Buffer IV. One-dimensional 1H, 1H-15N HSQC, and 15N NOESY-HSQC (20Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem.

The binding constants of the enzyme were measured under conditions with various salt concentrations (Table I).

(e.g. R134A is a mutant, with the replacement of Arg with Ala at position 134.) It was confirmed that the global folds and the structures around the FAD for all mutants were not affected by the introduction of the mutations, by their 1H NMR spectra, and UV/visible absorption spectra, respectively (data not shown). The binding constants of the mutants are summarized in Table II. The binding of R311A, R366A, and W353A for the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was not detected under our experimental conditions. The binding constants of K240A, R141A, R201A, R376A, and W247A were 7.4 × 106, 1.1 × 107, 9.4 × 106, 9.8 × 106, and 8.0 × 106m-1, respectively; which are all less than half of that of the wild type.

Assignments of 31P resonances derived from the ss7mer in the free form were accomplished through the analyses of 1H-31P HSQC spectra, along with total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and rotational Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) spectra, via a sequential assignment methodology (spectra not shown) (19Torizawa T. Kato K. Kimura Y. Asada T. Kobayashi H. Komatsu Y. Morioka H. Nikaido O. Ohtsuka E. Shimada I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 157-161Google Scholar). The established assignments of the 31P resonances are indicated in Fig. 2a.Fig. 231P NMR analysis of the CPD photolyase-ssDNA complex.31P NMR spectra of d(TAT[CPD]TATG) (ss7mer) in the absence (a) and presence (c) of 1.5 molar equivalents of the wild-type CPD photolyase. b, 31P-31P EXSY spectrum of the ss7mer in the presence of a 0.67 molar equivalent of the wild type.

All of the free resonances could be connected with the bound ones, by observations of the exchange peaks (Fig. 2b). A comparison between the 31P NMR spectra of DNA in the free and bound forms (Fig. 2, a and c) revealed that the P-1, P0, P1, and P2 resonances in the bound form were significantly broad and showed drastic chemical shift changes, upon the addition of the CPD photolyase. In a similar way, the 31P NMR spectra of d(GTAT[CPD]TATG) and d(GTAT[CPD-]TATGC) were measured in the absence and presence of the CPD photolyase, and all of the resonances were assigned. In the spectra of d(GTAT[CPD]TATG) and d(GTAT[CPD-]TATGC), the P-1, P0, P1, and P2 resonances were also significantly perturbed, in terms of both the chemical shift and the line width, upon complex formation with the CPD photolyase (spectra not shown).To determine which residues of the CPD photolyase interact with each phosphate of the DNA, we also measured the 31P NMR spectra of the ss7mer complexed with the CPD photolyases mutants. Fig. 2d shows a 31P NMR spectrum of the ss7mer in the presence of 1.5 molar equivalents of R201A. Compared with the spectrum of the wild-type complex (Fig. 2c), the P0 and P-1 resonances have different chemical shifts, whereas the other resonances remained the same. In a similar manner, we determined the positions of the phosphate groups with resonances that were perturbed by the mutations in the ss7mer-CPD photolyase complex, as follows: P -2, P-1, and P0 by K240A, P-2 by R141A, P1, P2, and P3 by R376A, P2 and P3 by R407A, P-2 and P-1 by E244A, P0 and P1 by W247A, and P2 by L372A. On the other hand, the 31P spectra of the ss7mer in the presence of K397A, R134A, R142A, R196A, R203A, R232A, R233A, R239A, R382A, and R419A were identical to that in the presence of the wild type. These results are summarized in Table II.Detection of Resonances Derived from CPD—To detect the resonances derived from the CPD lesion, we prepared d(AT[CPD]TAC), in which the CPD lesion was labeled with 13C and 15N (ss5mer), and measured the 1H-13C HSQC spectra (spectra not shown). In the spectrum, only the resonances originating from the CPD lesion were selectively observed. The resonances were assigned by using HCCH-type experiments (21Kay L.E. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 888-889Google Scholar), in which the 1H-13C cross-peaks from the deoxyribose rings and the cyclobutane ring were connected within each ring. HCN spectra (22Sklenar V. Peterson R.D. Rejante M.R. Feigon J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 721-727Google Scholar) were useful for the connection of the resonances from the 1′-positions of the deoxyriboses and the resonances from the 6-positions of the bases via the 1-positions, which were labeled with 15N. The 5′ to 3′ orientation was determined by the HCP spectra (23Marino J.P. Schwalbe H. Anklin C. Bermel W. Crothers D.M. Griesinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6472-6473Google Scholar). Thus, all resonances involving the damaged bases were unambiguously assigned, by using the throughbond connectivities.Fig. 3, a-c show panels of the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of the ss5mer upon the addition of a substoichiometric amount of the CPD photolyase labeled with 2H. Both of the resonances originating from the free and bound forms were observed in the spectrum. The established assignments of the resonances from the free form are indicated in Fig. 3a. Assignments of the resonances derived from the methyl groups of the CPD bases in the complex (Fig. 3c) were performed by observations of the exchange-peaks between the resonances from the free and bound forms in the 13C HSQC-NOESY spectra. The assignments of the other bound resonances were carried out, based on their chemical shifts (Fig. 3, a and b). The resonances derived from the 2′-position of the deoxyriboses could not be identified, due to line broadening. The assignments revealed that the chemical shifts of the CPD resonances were shifted upon complexation of the CPD photolyase (Fig. 3, a-c). Among them, the chemical shifts of the resonances from the bases, i.e. the methyl groups and the 6-position, were markedly shifted upfield along the 1H dimension upon complexation of the CPD photolyase (Fig. 3, b and c). There are two possibilities for these significant chemical shift changes. One is the ring current effect of the aromatic groups of the CPD photolyase in the binding site, and the other is that of the nucleotides adjacent to the CPD.Fig. 3NMR analysis of 13C-labeled DNA in complex with the CPD photolyase.1H-13C HSQC spectra of d(AT[CPD]TAC) containing 13C-labeled CPD (ss5mer) after the addition of about 1 molar equivalent of the wild type (a, b, and c) and W247A (d). a, deoxyribose region; b, 6-position region; c and d, methyl regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the effect of the aromatic groups in the CPD binding site, the 1H-13C HSQC spectra of the ss5mer in the presence of the CPD photolyase mutants were measured. In the spectrum of the ss5mer-W247A complex, the chemical shifts of the resonances from the CPD, including the methyl resonances (Fig. 3d), were shifted downfield in comparison with those of the ss5mer-wild type complex. The methyl resonance of the 5′-side showed an especially large chemical shift difference, and its chemical shift was similar to that of the free form (Fig. 3d).We measured the 1H NMR spectra of pT[CPD]Tp, which is a CPD analog bearing a phosphate group, but lacking nucleotides on either side of CPD, and the ss5mer complexed with the wild type (Fig. 4, a and b). In the spectrum of the pT[CPD]Tp-wild-type complex, two characteristic resonances (∼-0.8 ppm and -1.3 ppm) were observed (Fig. 4b), with chemical shifts quite similar to those of the methyl proton resonances from the ss5mer-wild type complex (Fig. 4a).Fig. 41H NMR spectra of ssDNA in complex with the deuterated CPD photolyase.a, d(AT[CPD]TAC) (ss5mer) in complex with the wild-type CPD photolyase; b, pT[CPD]Tp in complex with the wild type; and c, ss5mer in complex with W247A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)NMR Analyses of CPD-containing dsDNA Bound to the CPD Photolyase—To detect the base pair resonances of a DNA duplex, we prepared d(CGGCTTAATTGCG) labeled with 15N, which is complementary to an unlabeled CPD-containing ssDNA, i.e. d(CGCAAT[CPD]TAAGCCG). After the formation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the dsDNA in the free and bound forms were recorded at 30 °C (Fig. 5). In these spectra, the cross-peaks from the imino protons of guanines and thymines from the non-damaged strand were selectively observed. The imino resonances in the free form were assigned, using the NOEs between imino protons observed in the 15N NOESY-HSQC and 1H-1H NOESY spectra. Assignments of the bound resonances were carried out, using the 1H NOE difference spectra. The 15N chemical shifts that were characteristic of each guanine and thymine imino groups were helpful for the assignments. The cross-peaks from Nos. 3, 4, 9, 11, and 12 were clearly observed in the spectra of the bound form. A weak cross-peak from either No. 5 or 8 was also detected.Fig. 5NMR spectra of imino protons in the dsDNA-CPD photolyase complex.a, imino region of a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of d(CGCAAT[CPD]TAAGCCG)/d(CGGCTTAATTGCG), in which the strand without CPD was labeled with 15N in the free form. b, imino region of a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the dsDNA in complex with the wild-type CPD photolyase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To investigate the environment of the CPD lesion in the dsDNA-CPD photolyase complex, we measured the 1H NMR spectrum of the dsDNA complexed with the deuterated wild-type CPD photolyase (Fig. 6a). Two resonances with chemical shifts almost identical to the methyl group resonances of the ss5mer-wild type complex (Figs. 3c and 4a, indicated by arrows in Fig. 6a), were observed in the high field region of the spectrum. Fig. 6b shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the dsDNAW247A complex. A resonance with a chemical shift identical to that of the 3′-side methyl group in W247A-ss5mer CPD (Figs. 3d and 4b, indicated by an arrow in Fig. 6b) was observed in the high field region of the spectrum.Fig. 61H NMR spectra of dsDNA in complex with the deuterated CPD photolyase.a, d(CGCAAT[CPD]TAAGCCG)/d(CGGCTTAATTGCG) in complex with the wild-type CPD photolyase; b, the dsDNA in complex with W247A.

The 31P NMR analysis showed that P-1, P0, P1, and P2 were perturbed, in terms of both the chemical shift and the line broadening, upon the addition of d(TAT[CPD]TATG) (Fig. 2, a and b). These results indicate that a phosphate group of the CPD, and one phosphate group flanking at the 5′-side and two flanking at the 3′-side of CPD, are responsible for binding to CPD photolyase.In order to investigate the basic residues that are involved in the electrostatic interaction, we determined the affinities of the mutants with substitutions of the basic residues, especially the Arg residues, to Ala (Table II). Fig. 7 shows the mapping of the affected residues identified in the mutant experiments on the crystal structure of the CPD photolyase from T. thermophilus without the substrates (13Komori H. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13560-13565Google Scholar). The mapping indicates that the residues that participate in the binding are located in the region surrounding the cavity formed by clusters I and II, which could be a possible binding pocket for the CPD (13Komori H.

According to the affinities of the mutants determined by SPR (Table II), the residues subjected to the mutations are classified into three types: the binding constants of the mutants are nearly equal to that of the wild type (cyan), are less than half of that of the wild type (yellow), and the responses were not observed for the mutants (red).

https://openalex.org/W2044183610,"The regulation of cell growth is one of the most important effects of type I interferons (IFNs). This response may involve a cytostatic effect or the induction of apoptosis depending on the cell context. Often the growth-inhibitory response of type I IFNs is studied in tumor cell lines carrying mutations of tumor suppressor genes, and therefore, the growth-inhibitory effect can be influenced by inactivation of these important regulators of cell proliferation. In this report, we explored the role of the ARF-p53 pathway in the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs. We found that p53 is only induced in cells that express p14ARF (p19ARF in mouse cells). Surprisingly, mouse embryonal fibroblasts that are null for p19ARF or P53, even after transformation with oncogenic RAS, respond as well as wild type to the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs. Similarly, human ARF–/– U2OS and P53–/– SAOS-2 cells show a significant decrease in cell proliferation. However, only SAOS-2 or U2OS reconstituted with inducible p14ARF undergo apoptosis in response to IFNβ treatment, and this effect was not inhibited by expression of dominant negative p53. These data suggest that (i) at least in specific cell types, the induction of apoptosis by type I IFNs requires an ARF pathway that is p53-independent and (ii) the cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects of type I IFNs employ different pathways.

Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186Google Scholar). Malignant transformation always involves deregulation of the restriction point by either the absence of functional RB, the amplification of cyclin D or CDK4, or the loss of p16INK4a (1DiCiommo D. Gallie B.L. Bremner R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 255-269Google Scholar, 4Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 3301-3312Google Scholar). However, additional events are required for the emergence of a malignant phenotype, because hyperproliferative signals trigger built-in safety mechanisms that result in cell cycle arrest/senescence or apoptosis. The main effector of this safety mechanism is the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway. For instance, the absence of RB triggers not only the transcription of S phase genes but also p19ARF, which in turn inhibits MDM2, allowing p53 to stop cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis or senescence (7Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Google Scholar, 8Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Google Scholar, 9Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Google Scholar). The ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway is also a safety net for the activation of oncogenes such as RAS, MYC, v-Abl, and E1A. These mechanisms explain why most tumors not only have alterations of the RB pathway (i.e. either inactivation of tumor suppressors RB or INK4A, or amplification of cyclin D or CDK4/6) but also mutations in P53 or ARF that allow cells to escape cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Thus, it is not surprising to find in many cancers the INK4A locus, which encodes both p16 and p19ARF deleted and inactivated by methylation and/or mutated (10Kamijo T. Bodner S. van de Kamp E.

Binding of type I IFNs to their receptors results in the activation of kinases of the Jak family (Jak1 and Tyk2), which are responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors designated as signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2). Phosphorylated STAT1, STAT2, and a protein of the IRF family, p48/IRF9, form the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) F3 complex, which translocates to the nucleus where it binds specific promoter regions (interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE)) to regulate gene transcription. Type I IFNs also induce the formation of STAT1-STAT1 and STAT1-STAT3 dimers that bind to specific DNA elements (IFNγ-activated sequence and c-sis-inducible element, GAS and SIE, respectively) (24Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Google Scholar, 25Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev.

Although the integrity of the Jak-STAT pathway is required for the antiviral effect (24Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Google Scholar, 26Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Schreiber R.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13547-13553Google Scholar), STAT activation does not appear to be required for the growth-inhibitory effect in some cell types (28Gil M.P. Bhon E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B.

The regulation of cell proliferation by type I IFNs is more complex than expected because it can involve a cytostatic effect or induction of apoptosis (29Yano H. Iemura A. Haramaki M. Ogasawara S. Takayama A. Akiba J. Kojiro M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1708-1717Google Scholar, 30Roos G. Leanderson T. Ludgren E. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2358-2362Google Scholar, 31Rodríguez-Villanueva J.

Interestingly, most studies dealing with the characterization of the signaling events that lead to the antiproliferative effect were performed in tumor cell lines with alterations of tumor suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes, which could affect cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Therefore, it should not be surprising to find that type I IFNs have different effects on cell proliferation depending on the cell context. For example, type I IFNs can induce G1 arrest in some responsive cell lines by inducing p21, p27, and INK4D or decreasing expression of cyclin D3 and cdc25A (33Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grandér D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Google Scholar, 34Matsuoka M. Tani K. Asano S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2075-2086Google Scholar, 37Tieferbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffmann I.

Heyman M. Einhorn S. Grandér D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 575-582Google Scholar). In other cases, IFNα2 and IFNβ induce apoptosis (27Gamero A.M. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13547-13553Google Scholar, 31Rodríguez-Villanueva J. McDonnell T.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 110-114Google Scholar, 32Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Castro J. Heiden T. Einhorn S. Grandér D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 343-352Google Scholar). In this scenario, the genotype of a particular tumor could determine whether IFN induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or no response. Although a recent report indicates that p53 is involved in the antiproliferative and antiviral effects of type I IFNs, the role of one of the most important activators of p53, ARF, is not addressed (40Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanal H. Stolber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 424: 516-523Google Scholar). Because most oncogenic agents such as RAS and MYC stabilize p53 via ARF, we sought to determine whether the ARF-p53 pathway was involved in the antiproliferative response triggered by type I IFNs. We found that type I IFNs up-regulate p53 via ARF, as demonstrated by the absence of p53 induction in ARF–/– mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) and in ARF null human U2OS cells. Yet IFNα or IFNβ significantly reduced the proliferation rate in ARF- and p53-deficient MEFs and human ARF–/– U2OS cells. In these cells, the growth-inhibitory effect was characterized by a cytostatic response without signs of apoptosis. Surprisingly, reconstitution of ARF–/– U2OS with an inducible form of ARF allowed type I IFNs to induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. These results demonstrate that (i) at least in some cell types such as U2OS, ARF is responsible for the induction of apoptosis in a p53-independent manner and (ii) the apoptotic and cytostatic effects of type I IFNs do not share the same linear pathway. Cell Lines and Reagents—Wild type MEFs were prepared from 13.5-day embryos (C57B6) (41Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Google Scholar). P53–/– and ARF–/– MEFs were kindly provided by Drs. S. Jones (University of Massachusetts Medical School, North Worcester, MA) and M. Roussel and C. Sher (St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN), respectively. The MEFs were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) and split following a 3T3 protocol (41Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Google Scholar). NARF2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Gordon Peters (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). Murine IFNα4 (muIFNα4, specific activity 1 × 106 units/ml), huIFNα2 (specific activity 2.2 × 108 units/mg), and huIFNβ (specific activity 4.7 × 107) were gifts from Drs. Dirk Gewert (QT Genetics, Cambridge, UK), Ronald Bordens (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ), and Ed Croze (Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-p21 (F-5 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 (FL-393 and DO-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ARF (p14ARF Ab-2 from Lab Vision-NeoMarkers; p19ARF ab80 from Abcam), and anti-tubulin (Ab-4 from Lab Vision-NeoMarkers). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were treated as indicated under “Results” and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C. For direct immunoblotting, 200 μg of cell lysate were directly electrophoresed into 8% or 4–15% gradient gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—Cell proliferation was assessed by performing MTT assays (42Mossman T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar) and cell counts using an automated cell counter. Briefly, the cells were seeded at 10,000 and 2,000 cells/well in 24- and 96-well plates, respectively, and treated with the indicated concentrations of IFNs. The numbers of cells/well were determined by trypsinization and counting of duplicate wells in a Coulter Counter. MTT assay was performed by adding 50 μl of a 5 mg/ml MTT solution for the last 4 h of the experiment. Experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. Apoptosis was studied using Hoechst, trypan blue, and annexin V (Alexis Corp., Lausanne, Switzerland) staining, scoring at least 150 cells in random fields. Induction of ISGs—Total RNA was isolated from SAOS-2 and U2OS cells treated with or without 10,000 units/ml huIFNβ with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). A total of 5 μg from each sample was reverse transcribed using the cloned avian myeloblastosis virus first-strand cDNA synthesis kit from Invitrogen following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Following reverse transcription, the samples were processed for PCR using the MultiGene-12 reverse transcriptase-PCR profiling kit for human interferon response genes (SuperArray, Frederick, MD) following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The PCR program consisted of an initial incubation at 94 °C for 5 min to denature the samples followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. After completion of PCR, 10 μl of each sample was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained and scanned as a digital image using a CCD camera. The levels of the reverse transcriptase-PCR gene expression profile were quantified by NIH Image (version 1.62). Normalized values are represented as -fold increases. Type I IFNs Induce p53 via ARF in MEFs—The ample variability among cancer cell lines to the antiproliferative effect of type I IFNs raises the question as to whether the integrity of specific tumor suppressor genes, which are commonly altered during the oncogenic process, influences the outcome of IFN treatment. Because activation of the ARF-p53 tumor suppressor pathway by oncogenic insults leads to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, which are also attributes of the growth-inhibitory response of IFNs, we sought to determine whether type I IFNs activated this tumor surveillance pathway. To avoid the presence of mutations commonly observed in tumor-derived cell lines, these experiments were performed using wild type primary MEFs maintained in culture following a typical 3T3 protocol (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that p19ARF is induced 24 h (lane 3) after muIFNα4 treatment (1,000 units/ml) and is still expressed at high levels at 48 h (lane 4) in early passage MEFs (P2, passage 2). The induction of p19ARF is still detected above the elevated base-line levels present in late passage MEFs (Fig. 1C, lane 2). As expected, the increase in p19ARF was accompanied by a concomitant increase in p53 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5). The requirement of p19ARF for the induction of p53 in MEFs was confirmed by finding that ARF–/– MEFs stimulated with muIFNα4 for 48 h did not up-regulate the expression of p53 (Fig. 1D). However, muIFNα4 induced p19ARF in P53–/–MEFs indicating that type I IFNs require p19ARF for the induction of p53. It was not surprising that the induction of ARF in p53–/– MEFs was not as pronounced as in wild type MEFs, because it has been reported previously that higher levels of ARF are normally detected in cells that lack p53 (43Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Google Scholar, 44Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Google Scholar). To determine whether ARF was also required for p53 induction in human cells, we treated NARF2 cells with huIFNα.2. NARF2 cells correspond to ARF–/–P53+/+ U2OS cells in which expression of human p14ARF is induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (43Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Google Scholar, 45Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that IFNα2 fails to increase the amount of p53 above base-line levels in NARF (lanes 4 and 5), whereas IPTG induces significant amounts of p14ARF, p53, and its downstream target, p21 (lane 2). Identical results were observed when the experiments were performed with huIFNβ (data not shown). The combination of IFNα2 and IPTG did not further increase the levels of either ARF or p53 (Fig. 2A, lane 3). However, IFNβ was able to induce p14ARF (Fig. 2B) but not p53 in SAOS-2 cells (ARF+/+P53–/–). The data obtained with MEFs and NARF2 cells indicate that p53 induction by type I IFNs requires functional ARF. The Growth-inhibitory Effect Promoted by Type I IFNs Is Not Altered by the Lack of ARF and p53 or by Transformation with Oncogenic RASV12—We next determined the role of the ARF-p53 pathway in the cell growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs. Wild type MEFs derived from independent embryos show significant growth inhibition after treatment with muIFNα4 (Fig. 3A). This growth-inhibitory response corresponded to a cytostatic effect, because no significant increase in apoptotic cells was observed (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, Fig. 3B shows that cells that lack p53 or ARF respond to muIFNα4 with the same efficiency as wild type cells. This result suggests that either there are redundant pathways that compensate for the absence of ARF and p53 or that these tumor suppressors are not required for the cytostatic component of the growth-inhibitory effect of IFNα in MEFs. Because oncogenic RASV12 can transform P53–/– and ARF–/– MEFs in the absence of MYC, we next tested whether RAS transformation affected the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFN of ARF–/– or P53–/– MEFs. To address this question, ARF or p53 null MEFs were infected with either empty pBabe-hygromycin vector or vector encoding RASV12 selected with hygromycin B, and the surviving cells were kept as a pool to avoid the variability that could be observed when individual clones are isolated. The expression of oncogenic RAS in ARF–/– and P53–/– MEFs was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D shows that ARF–/– and P53–/– MEFs transformed with oncogenic RAS respond to muIFNα4 (1,000 units/ml) just as well as or even better than control cells. Although muIFNα4 induced slightly more apoptosis in retrovirus-transduced cells than in wild type controls, treatment with muIFNα4 did not significantly increase the number of apoptotic cells in either ARF–/– and P53–/– MEFs expressing oncogenic RASV12 compared with vector controls (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that the cytostatic component of the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs is not affected by oncogenic RAS or the null mutation of either ARF or p53. ARF (but Not p53) Contributes to Type I IFN-induced Apoptosis in Human Cells—The lack of requirement of either ARF or p53 for the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs in MEFs raised the possibility that these tumor suppressors could be important in the growth-inhibitory effect in cells other than MEFs. Therefore, we next determined the role of ARF and p53 in the IFN response in human cells. We first studied the effect of IFNβ on U2OS (ARF–/–P53+/+) and SAOS-2 (ARF+/+P53–/–) cells because they lack ARF and p53, respectively. Although both human cell lines showed a good response to huIFNβ treatment (Fig. 4), SAOS-2 cells were more sensitive, and after a few days in culture, the presence of floating dead cells was evident. The study of apoptosis by annexin V staining confirms that almost 50% of SAOS-2 (but not U2OS) cells undergo cell death after 3 days of treatment with 1,000 units/ml IFNβ (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that although a growth-inhibitory response to type I IFNs can be observed in the absence of ARF or p53 in human osteosarcoma cell lines, apoptosis was only observed in ARF+/+ SAOS-2 cells. To determine whether ARF plays a role in type I IFN-induced apoptosis through a pathway that is independent of p53, we used NARF2 cells stably expressing either dominant negative p53 (NARF-DNp53) or empty vector (NARF-Puro). To confirm the inactivation of wild type p53 by the DNp53, we studied the induction of p53 and its downstream target, p21, by ARF in control and NARF-DNp53 cells. Fig. 5 shows that IPTG induces ARF, p53, and p21 in control NARF-Puro cells (lane 2). Treatment with 1,000 units/ml IFNβ alone or in association with 1 mm IPTG did not affect the induction of ARF, p53, or p21 observed with IPTG treatment alone (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Although in NARF-DNp53 the levels of p53 are significantly elevated even in the absence of ARF, the induction of p21 is almost completely obliterated, demonstrating that DNp53 effectively inhibits the function of the endogenous wild type p53 protein. We next determined whether IFNβ would induce cell death in NARF cells in the presence of ARF. Trypan blue or annexin V staining (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively) showed that treatment with IPTG and IFNβ for 3 days induced higher levels of apoptosis than either drug alone in NARF-Puro cells. Interestingly, the presence of DNp53 did not inhibit the apoptotic effect of IFNβ plus IPTG, suggesting that the induction of ARF, rather than p53, was responsible for this effect. Surprisingly, NARF-DNp53 was consistently more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by IFNβ (Fig. 6B, compare treatment with 100 units/ml IFNβ alone and plus IPTG). The reason for this higher sensitivity could be the low levels of ARF present in the absence of IPTG (leaky promoter), which cannot be detected by Western blotting. Alternatively, it could be because of other factors, as recently reported for NARF cells expressing the human papilloma virus E6 protein, which showed increased sensitivity to ARF-mediated apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor (46Rocha S. Campbell K.J. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 15-25Google Scholar). Finally, we determined whether the induction of apoptosis correlated with higher levels of the induction of ISGs. To achieve this goal, we performed semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR after stimulation of SAOS-2 and U2OS with 10,000 units/ml IFNβ for 24 h. Fig. 7 shows the fold increase over control in the level of expression of guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1), interferon-induced protein 35 (IFI35), interferon-inducible 56-kDa protein (IFIT1), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), and oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). As observed, there are marginal differences in the fold induction of GPB1 and IFI35 between SAOS-2 and U2OS. However, the fold induction of IFIT1, IRF7, and OAS1 was substantially greater in SAOS-2 than in U2OS. These data suggest that ARF may modulate the expression of select ISGs such as OAS1, which is required for the induction of apoptosis by type I IFNs in some cell lines (47Castelli L.J.

Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Google Scholar). One of the most important biological effects of type I IFNs is the regulation of cell proliferation either through cytostatic or pro-apoptosis mechanisms (29Yano H. Iemura A. Haramaki M. Ogasawara S. Takayama A. Akiba J. Kojiro M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1708-1717Google Scholar, 30Roos G. Leanderson T. Ludgren E. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2358-2362Google Scholar, 31Rodríguez-Villanueva J.

This property was the basis for the use of type I IFNs for the treatment of different malignancies (49Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1198-1205Google Scholar). However, there is ample variability in the response to type I IFN treatment in the clinical setting and even among tumor cell lines in vitro. One possible explanation for this variability is that genes that are commonly mutated in cancers, such as tumor-suppressor genes, may be required for the antiproliferative effect of IFNs. ARF and p53 are commonly activated by oncogenic viruses and genotoxic agents, respectively, and therefore constitute an important safety mechanism against tumor development (19Serrano M. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 865-869Google Scholar, 50Hinds P.W. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 135-141Google Scholar, 51Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat.

Therefore, it is not surprising to find that a large proportion of cancers contain mutations of ARF or p53. To test the hypothesis that ARF or p53 could be important in the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs, we first studied the induction of these proteins in wild type MEFs to avoid the presence of mutations of these genes. We found that type I IFNs induce ARF and p53 in wild type but not in ARF–/– MEFs, supporting the concept that the induction of p53 is via ARF. Similarly, IFN was unable to induce p53 in human NARF cells in which endogenous ARF had been inactivated, confirming that a similar mechanism for the induction of p53 is employed in human cells. Surprisingly, the absence of ARF or P53 did not impair the antiproliferative effect of type I IFNs in MEFs. Additionally, transformation of ARF–/– or P53–/– MEFs by oncogenic RAS did not reduce the response to type I IFNs. These findings raised different possibilities. First, the activation of the ARF-p53 pathway was not required for the antiproliferative effect, or second, there are redundant mechanisms that can compensate for the absence of ARF and p53. Alternatively, the role of ARF and/or p53 could be cell type-specific. To address the latter possibility, we characterized the role of ARF and p53 in the type I IFN response in human cells. These studies also revealed that a significant antiproliferative response could be obtained in P53–/– SAOS-2 cells or in ARF–/– U2OS cells. Surprisingly, the type I IFN response in ARF+/+ SAOS-2 cells (but not in ARF–/– U2OS cells) involved the induction of apoptosis, raising the possibility that the presence of ARF was responsible for this effect. Interestingly, select ISGs were substantially induced in SAOS-2 compared with U2OS after IFN treatment. Among the ISGs profiled, OAS1 may play a critical role in apoptosis. Previous work has shown that splice variants of OAS have pro-apoptotic functions (48Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Google Scholar). Although the role of ARF in the induction of ISGs is unclear at this time, our data demonstrate an increase in the expression of select ISGs in SAOS-2 cells, which express p14ARF. Further studies performed in NARF cells, which contain IPTG-inducible ARF, demonstrate that the presence of ARF allowed IFNβ to induce apoptosis. Moreover, the apoptotic effect was not blocked by dominant negative p53, supporting the concept that IFN induces apoptosis via a p53-independent pathway. The data obtained with MEFs do not contradict a previous report indicating that the induction of p53 by type I IFNs plays a role in tumor suppression (40Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanal H. Stolber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 424: 516-523Google Scholar). For example, the authors reported that the effect of IFNβ via p53 was only observed when MEFs were previously challenged with human papilloma virus E6 or a DNA-damaging agent, whereas we assessed the effect of p53 under normal culture conditions. Moreover, different methods were used to assess the growth-inhibitory effect of IFNβ (soft agar assays versus growth curves in tissue culture plates). More importantly, Takaoka et al. (40Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanal H. Stolber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 424: 516-523Google Scholar) did not address the long term effect of IFNβ treatment (beyond 6–9 h) or the role of ARF in the induction of p53. It is possible that an initial direct effect on the p53 promoter is responsible for an early induction of the protein, whereas the sustained induction of p53 requires ARF. Altogether, our data demonstrate that (i) the cytostatic effect of type I IFNs does not require ARF or p53 in MEFs or human osteosarcoma cell lines; (ii) the antiproliferative effect of type I IFNs is not inhibited by oncogenic RAS; (iii) the induction of apoptosis requires ARF (but not p53) in U2OS or SAOS-2 cells, and (iv) there are clear differences in the roles of the IFN-ARF pathway among cell types, because primary MEFs did not undergo cell death after type I IFN treatment even though ARF and p53 were induced, whereas apoptosis was induced in human osteosarcoma lines. It remains to be established what targets play a critical role in the cytostatic effect of type I IFNs. It has been reported that type I IFNs can affect other cell cycle regulators such as p27, INK4D, cyclin D3, and CDC25A (33Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grandér D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Google Scholar, 34Matsuoka M. Tani K. Asano S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2075-2086Google Scholar, 37Tieferbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffmann I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A.

Grandér D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 575-582Google Scholar). However, an important question not yet addressed is whether the changes induced by type I IFNs on some cell cycle regulators are a consequence or are directly responsible for the antiproliferative effect. For example, the increase in the level of expression of p27 may only reflect an exit of the cell cycle rather than being responsible for the growth inhibition. The use of knock-out models for those genes believed to be involved in the growth-inhibitory effect of IFNs will help to settle these issues. We are grateful to Drs. S.

Protein kinase B (PKB) 1The abbreviations used are: PKB, protein kinase B; PH, pleckstrin homology; PtdIns-P, inositol phospholipid; TCL1, T-cell leukemia-1; p14TCL1, the 14-kDa protein product of the TCL1 gene; p13MTCP1, the 13-kDa product of the MTCP1 gene; PDB, Protein Data Bank; R2, relaxation rate; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. is a 60-kDa member of the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine kinases composed of a amino-terminal PH domain and linked to a kinase domain by a 30 amino acid linker. PKB is frequently called Akt, because it is a mammalian homologue of v-Akt, a viral oncogene isolated from the Akt8 virus that causes T-cell leukemia in mice (4Staal S.P. Hartley J.W. Rowe W.P. Proc.

Actually, the PKB family comprises three members, PKBα, PKBβ, and PKBγ (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3), all of which display, despite some idiosyncrasies, a high level of functional redundancy (Fig. 1) (8Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Protein kinase B is a central component of phosphoinositide 3′-kinase signaling pathways and has emerged as a pivotal regulator of many cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (3Pekarsky Y.

Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). PKB activation in response to growth factors and other extracellular stimuli involves membrane recruitment of PKB triggered by inositol phospholipid (PtdIns-P) binding of its amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. At the membrane, PKB is activated by a partially defined process involving lipid-mediated dimerization and phosphorylation of two critical residues, Thr308/Thr309/Thr305 in the kinase activation segment and Ser473/Ser474/Ser472 in the COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif, on PKBα, PKBβ, and PKBγ, respectively (6Bellacosa A.

Residue Thr308/Thr309/Thr305 is phosphorylated by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, whereas the mechanism responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser473/Ser474/Ser472 has not been resolved (8Brazil D.P.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The PH domain of PKB (PKB-PH) has been shown to be essential for mediating the targeting and co-activation of PKB by proteins of the T-cell leukemia-1 (TCL1) family (18Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Pekarsky Y. Koval A. Hallas C. Bichi R. Tresini M. Malstrom S. Russo G. Tsichlis P. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Normally, the cellular expression of TCL1 family genes (TCL1, TCL1b, and MTCP1) is mainly restricted to the lymphoid cell lineage and to the early stages of embryogenesis (20Narducci M.G. Fiorenza M.T. Kang S.M. Bevilacqua A. Di Giacomo M. Remotti D. Picchio M.C. Fidanza V. Cooper M.D. Croce C.M. Mangia F. Russo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11712-11717Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) where they co-activate PKB, possibly to promote a growth advantage during development through PKB-stimulated cell survival (3Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Croce C.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5638-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, in certain T-cell malignancies, chromosomal translocations lead to changes in the expression patterns of TCL1 family genes. Thus the TCL1 oncogene was identified because of characteristic chromosomal translocations and inversions at 14q32.1 in clonal T-cell proliferations and malignancies (21Virgilio L. Narducci M.G. Isobe M. Billips L.G. Cooper M.D. Croce C.M. Russo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12530-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Repositioning of T-cell receptor α/δ or β-chain control sequences next to the TCL1 coding region yields deregulated T-cell-specific expression. The product of the TCL1 gene is a 14-kDa protein (p14TCL1) that has been shown to localize in the cytoplasm and nucleus of expressing cells (22Fu T.B. Virgilio L. Narducci M.G. Facchiano A. Russo G. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6297-6301PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies indicated that p14TCL1 exhibits a novel β-barrel structure (23Hoh F. Yang Y.S. Guignard L. Padilla A. Stern M.H. Lhoste J.M. van Tilbeurgh H. Structure. 1998; 6: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A similar structure was found for the 13-kDa product of the MTCP1 gene (p13MTCP1) (23Hoh F. Yang Y.S. Guignard L. Padilla A. Stern M.H. Lhoste J.M. van Tilbeurgh H.

The MTCP1 gene, located in the Xq28 chromosomal region, was the first gene to be identified in the heterogeneous group of uncommon T-cell leukemias presenting a mature phenotype (26Stern M.H.

It is involved in the translocation t(X;14)(q28;q11), recurrently associated with this type of T-cell proliferations. In addition to structural similarity, p13MTCP1 exhibits high sequence homology (40% identity, 61% similarity) with p14TCL1 and with p14TCL1b (36% identity, 63% similarity), the product of the newly identified TCL1b oncogene (27Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Isobe M. Russo G. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2949-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Evidence confirming a tumorigenic role for aberrant TCL1 and MTCP1 expression has been obtained from transgenic mice (28Gritti C. Dastot H. Soulier J. Janin A. Daniel M.T. Madani A. Grimber G.

Functionally, the association of TCL1 proteins with PKB, which is mediated by its PH domain, enhances the phosphorylation of PKB on Thr308/Thr309/Thr305 and Ser473/Ser474/Ser472, increases PKB-mediated phosphorylation of its substrates glycogen synthase kinase-3β and Bc12-antagonist cell of death, and allows PKB to enter the nucleus (18Laine J.

It was suggested that TCL1 proteins mimic PtdIns-P binding to PKB-PH (30Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), facilitate PKB trans-phosphorylation by the formation of heterotrimeric complexes with PKB (18Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol.

Identification of TCL1 and PKB-PH binding surfaces is an important step in deciphering these complex mechanisms. A putative site of interaction at the TCL1 surface was previously proposed from a mutational analysis of p14TCL1 and molecular modeling (31Kunstle G. Laine J. Pierron G. Kagami Si S. Nakajima H.

Teitell M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6376-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the region(s) on PKB-PH that contribute to the interaction are unknown. Advances toward identifying this interaction site were provided recently by the resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the PKB-PH domain (α-and β-isoforms) and the delineation of the binding site of the PtdIns-P (33Thomas C.C.

Here, we used a combination of biophysical techniques (fluorescence anisotropy, NMR, and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS)) to determine the structural basis of the interaction between PKBβ-PH and p13MTCP1/p14TCL1. Based on our experimental data, a molecular model of the complex formed between PKBβ-PH and p14TCL1 is proposed. Our analysis gives insights into how TCL1 family proteins promote their array of cellular effects.

All of the NMR experiments were carried out at 10 °C on a 500-MHz BRUKER AVANCE spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm z-gradient 1H-13C-15N triple-resonance cryoprobe.

Auge-Senegas M.T. Stern M.H. Noguchi M. Roumestand C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this particular case, the single Hahn echo experiment was preferred to the classical CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) experiment for R2 measurements because of its increased sensitivity to exchange contributions (44Wang L. Pang Y. Holder T. Brender J.R. Kurochkin A.V. Zuiderweg E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). R2 were measured for 15N-p13MTCP1 and 15N-PKBβ-PH “free” in solution and compared with the ones measured for the same protein in the presence of a predetermined amount from titration experiments of unlabeled partner (15N-p13MTCP1 ·PKBβ-PH (1:1), 15N-PKBβ-PH ·p13MTCP1 (1:1), and 15N-PKBβ-PH ·p13MTCP1 (5:1)). In these experiments, the total (labeled plus unlabeled) protein concentration was fixed to 0.5 mm for all of the samples in order to avoid any parasitic contribution from viscosity changes. Fluorescence Anisotropy Experiments—Proteins were labeled at pH 8.0 at 4 °C for 2 h, conditions under which labeling ratios are far from unity and that favor unique labeling of the amino terminus. The labeling ratio for the PKBβ-PH proteins was 16%, and that for the p13MTCP1 protein was 10%. Concentrations for the target protein were calculated for total protein, such that the concentration of fluorophore was in both cases considerably lower. Binding assays were performed with a Beacon 2000 polarization instrument (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) at 4 °C using either Alexa488-labeled PKBβ-PH at a total concentration of 32 nm or Alexa488-labeled p13MTCP1 at a total concentration of 100 nm. The buffer used in the assay was 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 300 mm NaCl. Anisotropy profiles were obtained in the dilution format. In this approach, data points were taken at equilibrium starting from 240 μl of a 0.1 mm solution of p14TCL1 containing 32.5 nm Alexa488-PKBβ-PH or 0.5 mm solution of PKBβ-PH containing 100 nm Alexa488-labeled p13MTCP1. For each subsequent measurement, 60-μl aliquots of solution were removed from the initial solution and replaced by 60 μl containing 32.5 nm Alexa488-PKBβ-PH or 100 nm Alexa488-labeled p13MTCP1 only. Anisotropy values were recorded as a function of time, and the final five or six values after stabilization were averaged. Anisotropy data were fit using a 1:1 association mass action law in a 99% confidence interval using a GraphPad Prism Fitter. SAXS—SAXS data were recorded on beamline D24 at LURE (Orsay, France) at a wavelength of 1.49 Å using a linear 512 channel detector and sample-detector distances of 1.872 and 0.880 m. For data acquisition, the samples were kept in a quartz capillary of ∼1.5 mm in diameter maintained at a temperature of 10 °C. Protein samples were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl and 300 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 and filtered through 0.22-μm pores prior to data recording. Sample concentrations were adjusted to 0.6 mm. For each detector distance, eight frames of 200 s each were averaged for both the protein samples and corresponding buffer. The individual frames did not show signs of x-ray damage and were averaged and scaled to transmitted intensity. The buffer contribution was subtracted from the protein-scattering curve. The data were merged and processed using the programs Primus and Gnom (45Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Dammin and Gasbor were used for ab initio form determination (45Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SAXS envelopes determined by these programs showed P2 symmetry. This symmetry constraint was imposed for subsequent ab initio shape determinations. Ten of the obtained ab initio models were averaged to obtain the most likely molecular envelope (using Damaver (45Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). The χ2 values of atomic models against SAXS data were calculated with Crysol (45Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) using default parameters. Molecular Modeling—Manual modeling of the PKBβ-PH ·p14TCL1 complex was carried out using the program O (46Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) for visualization of atomic models and SAXS envelopes. Computational docking was carried out with the program FTDock (47Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A total of 37,000 possible orientations of PH relative to p14TCL1 or p13MTCP1 were tested by FTDock for combinations of the x-ray structure of PKBα-PH and NMR structure of PKBβ-PH with x-ray structures of p14TCL1 and p13MTCP1 and an NMR structure of p13MTCP1. This initial set of orientations was filtered to suffice the constraint that residues of the interface of both partners are <6 Å away from the other molecule. The best-scored models from FTDock were submitted to rigid body and side chain refinement by the program MultiDock (48Jackson R.M. Gabb H.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 265-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). An alternative approach using the HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven DOCKing) (49Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar) program provided us with the means to dock the TCL1 proteins separately onto PKBβ-PH. The chemical shift perturbation data resulting from NMR-mapping experiments were used as ambiguous interaction restraints to drive the docking process. An ambiguous interaction restraint is defined as an ambiguous distance among all of the residues shown to be involved in the interaction. According to established criteria of the HADDOCK program, the “active” residues are those that have been shown to alter the HSQC spectra and also have a high solvent accessibility. The “passive” residues correspond to the residues that are surface neighbors of the active residues and also have a high solvent accessibility calculated with NACCESS program. Therefore, PKBβ-PH residues Lys64, Glu66, and Arg67 in strand β5 and Met100, Arg101, Gln104, Met105, Asn108, and Ser109 in the COOH-terminal helix are considered to be active residues. Five neighboring PKBβ-PH residues, Leu62, Met63, Pro70, Gly97, and Lys111, are considered to be passive residues. For the p14TCL1 protein, residues Asp16, Arg17, Trp19, Glu29, Lys30, Gln31, Ile74, Gln77, and Ser87 are considered active residues when the Asp13, His32, Leu58, Pro61, Pro64, Tyr79, and Asp88 are passive residues. The default HADDOCK parameters were used with the except that only the 300 initial complex structures were generated, the best 50 solutions in terms of intermolecular energies then were refined in water, and the 20 final structures were analyzed. All of the molecular images were produced with Aesop 2M. E. M. Noble, unpublished data. or PyMOL (50DeLano W.L. PyMOL Reference Manual. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2003Google Scholar). Affinities of the PKB-PH-p13MTCP1/p14TCL1 Interactions— The affinity of PKBβ-PH for p14TCL1 was determined using fluorescence anisotropy. In this experiment, the PKBβ-PH protein was labeled with an amine-reactive fluorescent dye (Alexa488) under conditions that favor the selective labeling of the amino terminus. A solution of this labeled protein at a concentration of 32 nm in the presence of a high concentration of unlabeled p14TCL1 was sequentially diluted with a solution containing only the labeled protein and at each point the fluorescence anisotropy was measured (see “Materials and Methods”). The total change in the anisotropy was 50 millianisotropy units from a value of 185 at very low concentrations of p14TCL1 into 235 millianisotropy units at saturating p14TCL1. The raw data were fit to a model of simple binding of one dimer of p14TCL1 to PKBβ-PH, and the normalized change in anisotropy is plotted along with the normalized fit of the raw data (Fig. 2, squares). The fit was satisfactory as evidenced by a low relative value of χ2 and random residuals and yielded a KD value of 5.7 μm. We note that, since the total concentration of the labeled PKB-PH protein was quite low in order to ensure true equilibrium binding, the probability of populating a complex containing more than one PKB-PH protein per p14TCL1 dimer was infinitely small. The binding of PKB-PH to p13MTCP1 was also measured by fluorescence anisotropy using a p13MTCP1 sample labeled in the same manner by Alexa488 to maximize the total anisotropy change. The labeled p13MTCP1 at a concentration of 100 nm was titrated by unlabeled PKB-PH (Fig. 2, triangles). The total change in anisotropy was from a value of 110 millianisotropy units at low concentrations of PKBβ-PH to a value of 210 millianisotropy units at the highest concentration available, which was determined by the limit of solubility of the used PKBβ-PH construct. The data were fit to the same simple binding model, and the normalized data and fit are plotted also in Fig. 2. It is clear from the lack of high concentration plateau that the affinity of the complex between PKB-PH and p13MTCP1 is significantly lower than that formed by PKB-PH and p14TCL1. The fit of the raw data allowing the undetermined plateau value to float yields a KD value of 537 μm, ∼100-fold of that found for p14TCL1. We also carried out NMR titration experiments of PKB-PH (isoform β; PKBβ-PH) by p13MTCP1 or p14TCL1. These measurements are not redundant with fluorescence anisotropy measurements, because they are indicative of the exchange regime between the free and bound states with regard to the NMR time scale under the conditions of the NMR study. This information is mandatory for the choice of the NMR methods to be used for delineating the binding interfaces. Of course, the NMR titrations are expected to yield less accurate KD values than fluorescence anisotropy because of the relatively high concentration of the labeled target and especially because different mechanisms can participate to the line broadening of resonances belonging to residues located on the binding interface (see below), leading to an underestimation of the apparent KD. Nevertheless, only a few residues are expected to belong to this category, such that only a small bias should be observed in the average result over all of the residues. Adding increasing amounts of unlabeled p13MTCP1 or p14TCL1 to a solution of 15N-labeled PKBβ-PH causes a progressive line broadening in the [1H-15N]HSQC spectrum of PKBβ-PH, indicative of an intermediate-to-slow-exchange process. Under such limiting conditions, it has been shown that a dissociation constant can be estimated from progressively disappearing resonances (51Zuiderweg E.R. Hamers L.F. Rollema H.S. de Bruin S.H.

https://openalex.org/W2142423918,"The transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain is an 11-amino acid positively charged peptide that has been shown to pull diverse molecules across cell membranes in vitro and in vivo. Fusion proteins constructed with TAT rapidly enter and exit cells and have been shown to cross intracellular membranes as well. Electrostatic interactions between TAT and the cell membrane have been implicated as a part of the mechanism of transduction. Here, we report that TAT transduction causes membrane phospholipid rearrangement as evidenced by detection of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the cell membrane. Furthermore, these rearrangements can be blocked by positively charged polylysine, further implicating electrostatic interactions as a part of the mechanism. Neither apoptosis nor necrosis is induced in these cells after exposure to TAT. We conclude that the process of TAT·GFP transduction causes phosphatidylserine to translocate from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. These results provide insight into the mechanism of TAT protein transduction domain transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1986869476,"During reverse transcription of viral RNA, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) encounters RNA stem-loop structures that require displacement synthesis activity in which RT disrupts the RNA helix to access the template strand. A primer extension assay was developed to assess HIV-1 RT RNA displacement synthesis activity in vitro. Initial results revealed that HIV-1 RT performs only limited amounts of RNA displacement through long stretches of RNA duplex, with the majority of synthesis stalling at sequence-dependent pause positions. DNA displacement synthesis through the same sequence, however, proceeded rapidly to the end of the template. The RNA folding algorithm mfold indicated that the presence of an unpaired nucleotide, or bulge, along the RNA duplex would promote helix melting ahead of the DNA primer terminus to create a small gap of nondisplacement synthesis. Primer extension assays using substrates possessing single-nucleotide bulges in the nontemplate strand near pause sites resulted in diminished pausing at positions within the predicted melted region. Surprisingly, the bulges also reduced pausing distal to the bulge at positions that are expected to remain base-paired. Further analysis revealed that stalling during RNA displacement synthesis results from the displaced RNA re-annealing to the template strand thus forcing the primer terminus to become unpaired and, therefore, not extendable. Introduction of a bulge facilitates displacement synthesis through distal regions by increasing RT processivity in the vicinity of a bulge and reducing the impact of branch migration on primer extension."

This paper concerns two unusual properties of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase from Escherichia coli: 1) its ability to interact specifically with enzymes encoded by the virulent bacteriophage T4 and 2) its roles in regulating metabolism of the host cell. By means of optical biosensor analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, immunoprecipitation, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, we have shown that E. coli NDP kinase interacts directly with T4 thymidylate synthase, aerobic ribonucleotide reductase, dCTPase-dUTPase, gene 32 single-strand DNA-binding protein, and deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase. The interactions with ribonucleotide reductase and with gp32 are enhanced by nucleoside triphosphates, suggesting that the integrity of the T4 dNTP synthetase complex in vivo is influenced by the composition of the nucleotide pool. The other investigations in this work stem from the unexpected finding that E. coli NDP kinase is dispensable for successful T4 phage infection, and they deal with two observations suggesting that the NDP kinase protein plays a genetic role in regulating metabolism of the host cell: 1) the elevation of CTP synthetase activity in an ndk mutant, in which the structural gene for NDP kinase is disrupted, and 2) the apparent ability of NDP kinase to suppress anaerobic growth in a pyruvate kinase-negative E. coli mutant. Our data indicate that the regulatory roles are metabolic, not genetic, in nature. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, nucleoside diphosphate kinase is a multifunctional protein, with well defined functions in ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate biosynthesis and more recently described functions in genetic and metabolic regulation, signal transduction, and DNA repair.

Our data indicate that the regulatory roles are metabolic, not genetic, in nature. Like other large virulent DNA phages, bacteriophage T4 encodes nearly all of the enzymes and proteins needed not only for its own DNA replication but for biosynthesis of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The enzymes of dNTP 1The abbreviations used are: dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate; gp, gene product; NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; HMase, hydroxymethylase. 1The abbreviations used are: dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate; gp, gene product; NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; HMase, hydroxymethylase. synthesis play two functions in T4 infection: 1) replacing the dCTP pool by 5-hydroxymethyl-dCTP, which gives rise to the novel phage-specific pyrimidine DNA base, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and 2) increasing the total rate of dNTP synthesis, necessary to sustain DNA accumulation at rates up to 10-fold higher per cell than the preinfection rate. In 1963 Bello and Bessman (1Bello L.J. Bessman M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 647-652Google Scholar) showed that the level of one dNTP-synthesizing enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, did not change appreciably after T4 infection. As studied in extracts of T4-infected Escherichia coli, the specific activity of NDP kinase in either uninfected or infected E. coli is much higher than that of the phage-coded enzyme deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate kinase (gp1), which converts dNMPs to the dNDP substrates used by NDP kinase for dNTP synthesis (2Bello L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1777-1787Google Scholar, 3Duckworth D.H. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2877-2885Google Scholar). This suggests that NDP kinase of the host cell carries out the conversion of dNDPs to dNTPs for phage DNA synthesis. That the activity of NDP kinase is so high should perhaps not be surprising, because the enzyme is also responsible for ribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis, and rNTP pools in E. coli and in other cells are much higher than those of dNTPs. We have argued that to sustain high rates of DNA accumulation, the infected cell needs not only increased levels of dNTP-synthesizing enzymes but a mechanism to maintain saturating dNTP concentrations at replication sites in the face of the enormous local dNTP pool turnover accompanying replication. Our laboratory (4Reddy G.P.V. Stafford M.E. Singh A. Mathews C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3152-3156Google Scholar) and that of G. R. Greenberg (5Flanegan J.B. Greenberg G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3019-3027Google Scholar) have proposed that the enzymes of dNTP synthesis form a multienzyme complex and that this “dNTP synthetase” complex is juxtaposed with the replisome, so as to allow direct channeling of dNTPs to replication sites. Considerable evidence supports this model (7Allen J.R. Lasser G.W. Booth D.A. Goldman D.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5746-5753Google Scholar, 8Moen L.K. Howell M.L. Lasser G.W.

Mathews, submitted for publication. If the model is correct, then E. coli NDP kinase, which catalyzes the last reaction in dNTP synthesis, occupies a strategic position in the flow of nucleotides from the dNTP synthetase complex to the associated replisome. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that the enzyme behaves as if associated with the dNTP synthetase complex, as shown both by sedimentation analysis (4Reddy G.P.V. Stafford M.E. Singh A. Mathews C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3152-3156Google Scholar, 7Allen J.R. Lasser G.W. Booth D.A. Goldman D.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5746-5753Google Scholar) and kinetic experiments on catalysis of multi-step reaction pathways (4Reddy G.P.V. Stafford M.E. Singh A. Mathews C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3152-3156Google Scholar, 8Moen L.K. Howell M.L. Lasser G.W. Mathews C.K. J. Mol. Recognit. 1988; 1: 48-57Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme associates, directly or indirectly, with about a half-dozen phage-coded proteins of dNTP and DNA metabolism, as shown by analysis of T4 proteins retained on columns of immobilized recombinant NDP kinase (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar). On the other hand, it perhaps is surprising that an enzyme of the host cell interacts so specifically with proteins encoded by a virus whose goal is destruction of that bacterium. In this paper we investigate at the level of purified proteins some of the interactions involving NDP kinase, trying to distinguish direct interactions from indirect associations, in which the associated proteins interact with a common protein but not with each other. Even more unexpected was the finding in the laboratory of M. Inouye (10Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Google Scholar) that E. coli NDP kinase is dispensable for successful T4 infection. This stemmed from the observation that site-specific disruption of ndk, the structural gene for NDP kinase, had little or no effect upon the ability of the bacteria to support T4 growth. This led to the finding by Lu and Inouye (11Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Google Scholar) that under some circumstances adenylate kinase, another host cell enzyme, can catalyze sufficient dNTP synthesis to support T4 infection. Evidence presented elsewhere (7Allen J.R. Lasser G.W. Booth D.A. Goldman D.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5746-5753Google Scholar) indicates that adenylate kinase is also a component of the T4 dNTP synthetase complex. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells NDP kinase is a complex protein that evidently plays important roles unrelated to nucleoside triphosphate synthesis. For instance, in mammalian cells, one isoform of the enzyme is a metastatic tumor suppressor (12Lacombe M.-L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Google Scholar, 13Hartsough M.T. Steeg P.S. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 301-308Google Scholar), and another isoform is a transcription factor, evidently with the c-myc gene as one of its targets (14Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 277-284Google Scholar). Both pro- and eukaryotic forms of the enzyme have been reported to have associated DNA binding and nuclease activities (15Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Google Scholar, 16Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levitt M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Google Scholar, 17Levitt M.N. Abramczyk B.M. Stock J.B. Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5163-5167Google Scholar). In addition the E. coli enzyme has been reported to possess three activities of a base excision repair pathway, including uracil-N-glycosylase (18Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13247-13252Google Scholar), although that latter conclusion has been challenged (19Bennett S.E. Chen C.-Y. Mosbaugh D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6391-6396Google Scholar). While analyzing, in collaboration with the Inouye laboratory, the unusual phenotypes of E. coli ndk mutants, we made two observations suggesting that the protein might function as a genetic regulator of bacterial metabolism (20Zhang X. Lu Q. Inouye M. Mathews C.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4115-4121Google Scholar). In this paper we explore these possibilities. Bacteria and Plasmids—E. coli strains and their relevant genotypes are as follows: B (wild type), JC7623 (ndk+pykA+pykF+), QL7623 (ndk–pykA+pykF+), HW1387 (ndk+pykA–pykF–), and QL1387 (ndk–pykA–pykF–). The ndk– strains contain a site-specific disruption of the ndk gene that inactivates NDP kinase (10Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Google Scholar). E. coli contains two pyruvate kinase isoforms, encoded by genes pykA and pykF. In some figures the term pyk is used to show that both pyruvate kinase genes are inactive. E. coli QL1387 was transformed with pKT8P3 containing wild-type ndk cloned into pUC9 (21Hama H. Almaula N. Lerner C.G. Inouye S. Inouye M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 31-36Google Scholar) and also transformed with a plasmid expressing inactive NDP kinase, prepared as described below. Construction of H117G Mutant of E. coli NDP Kinase—With pKT8P3 as template, we amplified a 2.4-kb fragment lying between a unique KpnI site adjacent to codon 117 that encodes the active site histidine and a HindIII site in the vector. One of the primers for this amplification was designed to alter codon 117 from CAC, encoding a histidine, to GGC, encoding a glycine. The resulting PCR product was digested with KpnI and HindIII. pKT8P3 was treated with KpnI and HindIII, and the two resulting fragments were separated on a preparative gel. The larger fragment was recovered from the gel and then ligated to the PCR product carrying the altered codon to obtain pndkH117G. Cloning and Expression of the ndk Gene—For improved expression of NDP kinase, the ndk gene was amplified from E. coli B genomic DNA by PCR using primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Following ligation of the NdeI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites of pET-9a (Novagen), the resulting pET9ndk construct was transformed into NovaBlue Singles Competent cells (Novagen). After PCR analysis of the transformants, the plasmid from one was sequenced and subsequently transformed into Tuner(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). Cultures of these bacteria carrying the pET9ndk plasmid were incubated in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the cells reached an A600 of 0.8, the overexpression of NDP kinase was induced by the addition of 200 μm IPTG. After 2–3 h of induction at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was frozen in liquid N2. Purification of Recombinant E. coli NDP Kinase—The pellet was resuspended in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, and aprotinin. Following sonic oscillation and the addition of 10 μg/ml DNase I, the lysate was centrifuged at 92,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The pellet from the 40–60% cut was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, desalted on an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then applied to a POROS 10 HQ anion exchange column (4.6 × 100 mm) for fractionation on a BioCad 700E perfusion chromatography work station (Applied Biosystems). Following a 2-min wash step in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, NDP kinase was eluted with a 5-min linear gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The flow rate for the entire run was 5.0 ml/min. The major peak was concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Millipore) at 4 °C and further purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in degassed 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. The purified NDP kinase was stored on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The yield was about 1.5 mg/g of cell paste, and the product was electrophoretically homogeneous, suggesting a purity of at least 98%. Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis using E. coli NDP Kinase Antibodies—Total proteins in E. coli overexpressing a recombinant T4 gene of interest were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar)2 for 30 min during induction of the enzyme under study. An extract of the radiolabeled cells was incubated for 2 h either with antibodies against E. coli NDP kinase, purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized NDP kinase, or with preimmune serum. Incubation, on ice, was carried out in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.1 m potassium glutamate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.15 m NaCl). Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was rocked at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 s. The supernatant was removed, and the protein A pellets were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. Each protein A pellet was resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and each sample was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min and then used for one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis GST Pull-down Analysis—A GST-NDP kinase fusion protein was prepared by first amplifying gene ndk from E. coli genomic DNA, using primers containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI. The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and ligated into pGEX-5x-1 (provided by Dr. Terri Lomax, Oregon State University). Restriction and sequencing analysis of recombinants yielded a plasmid, pGEX-ndk, that was transformed into the Origami(DE3) E. coli strain. Expression of NDP kinase fused to glutathione S-transferase was induced in super broth with 0.5 mm IPTG, when the cell culture reached an A600 of 0.7–0.8. The identity of the fusion protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis with E. coli NDP kinase antibodies. To examine the interaction of E. coli NDP kinase with T4 aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and dCMP hydroxymethylase (dCMP HMase), E. coli Origami (DE3), Origami(DE3)/pGEX, Origami(DE3)/-pGEX-ndk, Origami(DE3)/pnrdAB (expressing T4 RNR), and Origami-(DE3)/pT7–42 (expressing T4 dCMP HMase) were cultured in super broth to an A600 of about 0.8, and then protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG. The induction temperature was 30 °C for Origami(DE3)/pnrdAB and 37 °C for the other strains. The cells were harvested after 2 h of induction and then resuspended in 2 volumes of resuspension buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). Next was added 0.1 volume of egg white lysozyme, 10 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Brief sonic oscillation caused nearly total cell lysis, and this was followed by the addition of DNase I to 10 μg/ml. Total protein concentrations in the cell lysates were adjusted to the same value. The lysates containing expressed ribonucleotide reductase and dCMP hydroxymethylase were mixed separately with equal volumes of the lysates of the Origami(DE3) strains either with no plasmid, with the pGEX vector alone, or with the pGEX-ndk, expressing the GST-NDP kinase fusion protein. Pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and each mixture was next rocked for 2 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm. The glutathione beads were washed three times each in resuspension buffer. After washing, the proteins bound to the beads were eluted with glutathione elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm glutathione). The eluates were mixed with 1 volume each of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 2 min. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then identified by immunoblotting, using antisera against the respective proteins. Cloning and Expression of pyrG—The pyrG gene encoding E. coli CTP synthetase was amplified from E. coli B genomic DNA by PCR using primers containing NdeI and Eco31I/BamHI restriction sites. The PCR product was ligated into an EcoRV-digested Bluescript vector. Following the transformation of DH5α cells, this construct was purified, digested with Eco31I (yielding a free BamHI end) and NdeI, and then ligated into pET-9a. The resultant pET9pyrG construct was transformed into DH5α cells. After PCR analysis of the transformants, the plasmid from one was sequenced and subsequently transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. For expression, cultures of BL21 (DE3)pLysS cells carrying the pET9pyrG plasmid were incubated in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the cells reached an A600 of 0.8, the overexpression of CTP synthetase was induced by the addition of 400 μm IPTG. After 2–3 h of induction at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was frozen in liquid N2. Purification of Recombinant E. coli CTP Synthetase—The pellet was resuspended in a buffer of 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 20 mm glutamine, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, and aprotinin. Following sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 92,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation (28.5 g/100 ml of supernatant) (22, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 23Anderson P.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3285-3292Google Scholar). The resulting pellet was redissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mml-glutamine, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, desalted on an Econo-Pac 10DG column equilibrated with the same buffer, and then applied to a POROS 10 HQ anion exchange column (4.6 × 100 mm) for purification on the BioCad 700E work station. Following a 2-min wash step in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, CTP synthetase was eluted with a 5-min linear gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The flow rate for the entire run was 5.0 ml/min. The major peak was concentrated in a Centriprep-10 at 4 °C and further purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column in degassed 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. Purified CTP synthetase was stored on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The yield was 5–8 mg of electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme/liter of bacterial culture. The enzyme was used to prepare rabbit polyclonal antiserum by methods described previously (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar, 24Bernard M.A. Ray N.B. Olcott M.C. Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 259-267Google Scholar). Other Proteins and Enzymes—E. coli thymidylate synthase was kindly provided by Drs. Frank and Gladys Maley. T4 thymidylate synthase, gp32, gp56 (dCTPase/dUTPase), dihydrofolate reductase, and aerobic ribonucleotide reductase were purified as described previously (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar). In some cases an additional gel filtration step was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column to improve final purity. Other Procedures—Fluorescence spectra were recorded in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Luminescence Spectrometer LS50. All of the proteins were in KGMT buffer (150 mm potassium glutamate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the spectra were recorded from 290 to 450 nm. Procedures for optical biosensor analysis, protein affinity chromatography, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and GST pull-down analysis were as described in previous papers from this laboratory (9Wheeler L.J.

In bacteriophage T4 infection NDP kinase is even more distinctive, as one of very few enzymes in DNA metabolism that is not encoded by the virus; adenylate kinase also falls into this category (7Allen J.R. Lasser G.W. Booth D.A. Goldman D.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5746-5753Google Scholar, 11Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Google Scholar). In our earliest publications on the T4 dNTP synthetase complex, we reported that E. coli NDP kinase is both physically and kinetically linked to phage-coded enzymes of dNTP biosynthesis (4Reddy G.P.V. Stafford M.E. Singh A. Mathews C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3152-3156Google Scholar, 7Allen J.R. Lasser G.W. Booth D.A. Goldman D.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5746-5753Google Scholar, 8Moen L.K. Howell M.L. Lasser G.W. Mathews C.K. J. Mol. Recognit. 1988; 1: 48-57Google Scholar). Later we carried out protein affinity chromatography with immobilized NDP kinase and found (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar) that a column of this material retained several T4 enzymes of dNTP synthesis, including dihydrofolate reductase and ribonucleotide reductase large subunit; and several replication/recombination proteins, including products of genes 32, 45, 61, and uvsY. Comparable experiments are described in a more recent paper,2 where we identified several phage proteins that are coimmunoprecipitated by antiserum to E. coli NDP kinase in the presence and absence of the gene 32 single-strand DNA-binding protein. Although the above approaches support the concept of a physical linkage between the apparati for dNTP synthesis and DNA replication, neither technique is able to distinguish direct protein-protein interactions from secondary associations, in which two proteins are joined because of their common linkage to a third protein. To understand the evidently specific associations of a cellular enzyme with several virus-coded proteins, it seemed important to identify those associations that represent direct protein-protein interactions. This has been done after carrying out extensive purification of the relevant enzymes as recombinant proteins. Fig. 1 depicts experiments involving fluorescence spectroscopy. NDP kinase contains no tryptophans and hence is nonfluorescent. Fig. 1A shows the fluorescence of an equimolar mixture of NDP kinase and T4 aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (T4 RNR) to be enhanced relative to the fluorescence expected if the proteins do not interact. Fig. 1B involves a similar experiment with NDP kinase and T4 thymidylate synthase; here an enhancement of fluorescence was also seen but smaller than that observed by mixing NDP kinase with T4 RNR. Because the enhancement by NDP kinase of T4 RNR fluorescence was so small and because significant amounts of protein are needed for the fluorescence assays, we turned our attention to optical biosensor analysis, a much more sensitive technique, which generates useful data from minute amounts of protein. Both the IAsys biosensor, which we used, and the BIAcore instrument measure minute changes in refractive index that occur at the interface between a protein in solution and a protein immobilized in a thin layer. Fig. 2 presents data from an experiment with immobilized NDP kinase and several T4 proteins, including T4 thymidylate synthase, aerobic ribonucleotide reductase, and the multifunctional dCTPase/dUTPase encoded by gene 56. All three of these enzymes have been assigned roles in the T4 dNTP synthetase complex, and all display significant affinity for NDP kinase, as judged by the rapid initial association rates. Significant association was seen also with gp32, the single-strand DNA-binding protein of T4. This is important, because we have proposed that gp32 plays a role in recruiting enzymes of the dNTP synthetase complex to replication sites (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar), and further evidence for our model is presented elsewhere.2Fig. 2 also shows two negative controls, one with purified E. coli CTP synthetase and, strikingly, one with purified E. coli thymidylate synthase. It is somewhat surprising that NDP kinase of the host cell interacts with thymidylate synthase of the phage destined to destroy that cell but not (by the criteria used here) with the host cell's own thymidylate synthase. The interaction between NDP kinase and gp32 was investigated further by following to equilibrium the binding reaction between gp32 in solution and immobilized NDP kinase at a range of gp32 concentrations. From these data (Fig. 3) we calculated an apparent dissociation constant of about 2 μm. gp32 has been estimated to accumulate in T4-infected bacteria to about 10,000 molecules/cell (27Alberts B.M. Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Google Scholar). From the average volume of a T4-infected bacterium (28Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7430-7438Google Scholar), this number yields an estimate of 15 μm for the intracellular concentration of gp32. Even though we do not have an estimate for the molar concentration of NDP kinase, the data suggest that the association of these two proteins within the cell is significant. Effects of Nucleotides on Protein-Protein Interactions—Several observations over the years in our laboratory suggest that small molecules: substrates, coenzymes, allosteric modifiers, influence the protein-protein associations that stabilize the T4 dNTP synthetase complex. Most striking are first, the pronounced stimulatory effect of allosteric effectors on interaction of the R1 and R2 proteins of aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (29Hanson E.S. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30999-31005Google Scholar), and second, the strong effects of ATP upon retention of T4 proteins by a column of immobilized aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (9Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows an experiment carried out at the purified protein level.

By comparing the behavior of the double- and single-ring structures in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, we elucidate steps in the ATP-driven reaction cycle at which there is conformational coupling between the rings. Remarkably, the parting of the rings has little effect either on the thermodynamic properties of ATP binding or on the ATP-induced conformational changes prior to hydrolysis. However, there is a marked effect on the rate-limiting process in the steady-state cycle; a step that is coincident with bond cleavage in ATP. The effect of the ring-ring interaction is to increase its activation enthalpy from 42.0 to 94.2 kJ/mol. These results show that the major conformational coupling step, where structural rearrangements in one ring are propagated to the other, is the slowest process the ATPase cycle of GroEL.

Chaperonins are molecular chaperones that enhance the folding efficiency of substrate protein (1Ellis R.J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). They are generally classified on the basis of sequence comparison as members of one of the two families. The first family is represented by the group I chaperonins (e.g. GroEL from Escherichia coli) and is found in eubacteria as well as in organelles of eubacterial descent, such as mitochondria and plastids. The second chaperonin family is referred to as group II and comprises the chaperonins from Archaea (e.g. TF55/56 from Sulfolobus shibatae (2Trent J.D. Nimmesgern E. Wall J.S. Hartl F.U. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and Thermosome from Pyrodictium occultum (3Phipps B.M. Hoffmann A. Stetter K.O. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)) as well as from the eukaryotic cytosol (CCT from various organisms (4Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). The group I and II chaperonins have the same domain organization within each subunit, namely an equatorial, ATP-binding domain that is linked by an intermediate hinge domain to an apical, substrate-binding domain (5Carrascosa J.L. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Micron. 2001; 32: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, all chaperonins have closely related quaternary arrangements. They are oligomers consisting of two seven-membered rings (GroEL), two eight-membered rings (CCT and the thermosome), or two nine-membered rings (TF55/56) stacked back-to-back to form a double toroid cylinder that contains the two cavities encircled by each of the rings (5Carrascosa J.L. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Micron. 2001; 32: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). No chaperonin has yet been isolated that is capable of progressing through its functional cycle without forming doublering structures. There may be exceptions to the rule, although, the Thermoanaerobacter brockii thermosome, which has initially been believed to be a genuine single-ring species (7Truscott K.N. Hoj P.B. Scopes R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to assemble into a double-ring structure during its functional cycle (8Todd M.J. Walke S. Lorimer G. Truscott K. Scopes R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Haloarcula marismortui thermosome, which assembles into a single-ring species variably comprising between 8 and 10 subunits (9Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Ebel C. Gagnon J. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29906-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as well as the three single-ring mutants of GroEL (SR-T522I, SR-D115N, and SR-A399T), which have been shown to rescue GroEL-deficient E. coli (10Sun Z. Scott D.J. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), may well form double-ring structures in the presence of nucleotide. Hence, across the whole of biology, chaperonins are double-ring structures. The defining difference between the group I and II systems is that the former require a separate co-protein capable of capping the toroidal cavities, whereas the latter have 25-Å long helical protrusions emanating from the core of the apical domains that serve the same function (11Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The necessity for communication between the two rings has been highlighted by several studies on the GroE system, the most widely scrutinized of the chaperonins (12Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 730-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Walter S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1589-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein folding in the presence of the whole GroE chaperonin system proceeds by a reaction cycle that comprises the binding of substrate protein, its encapsulation by GroES, a dwell period in the folding cavity and subsequent ejection into the bulk solution (14Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L.

Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because each heptamer acts as a protein-binding unit, a full cycle is completed in the manner of a two-stroke machine and involves binding of substrate, nucleotide, as well as GroES to one ring of the complex followed by the same steps on the opposite ring (19Jackson G.S.

Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Inter-ring communication is of pivotal importance, as it mediates the structural asymmetry that imposes alternating functions on the two GroEL rings. Indeed, it has been shown that while positive cooperativity governs the binding of ATP, it is negative cooperativity that regulates the communication between rings (23Horovitz A. Fridmann Y. Kafri G. Yifrach O. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This led to the development of the nested model of cooperativity (24Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereby ATP binding within a ring follows a concerted system of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (25Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar), and the negative cooperativity between rings follows the sequential Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model (26Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). To elucidate conformational rearrangements within and between rings induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis, we constructed a tryptophan-containing variant of GroEL by inserting a single tryptophan residue in position 485 in place of tyrosine (27Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Y485W-GroEL. Residue 485 lies within the equatorial domain on the ring interface, on a loop that is connected by a helix to the ATP binding pocket and is well positioned to report intra-ring communication as well as the inter-ring communication required for negative cooperativity. The response of this probe to nucleotide binding revealed a series of cooperative transitions in structure and showed how the system behaved when one or two rings were loaded with ATP or when the mixed-ring ADP-ATP complex was formed (27Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the work reported here we extend this study by probing structural rearrangements in a simplified system, namely a single-ring version of GroEL. Horwich and colleagues constructed this variant by introducing four mutations (R452E, E461A, S463A, and V464A), which delete the major contacts between the rings (16Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M.

Despite the apparently drastic procedure of halving the molecule, the functional properties of SR1 are remarkably similar to those of the parent GroEL structure: it is capable of sequestering unfolded proteins, binding GroES, and assisting the folding of substrates as successfully as the wild type (16Weissman J.S.

It cannot, however, eject GroES, and thus does not allow the substrate to undergo cycles of protein binding and release (16Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The fact that SR1 retains most of the essential properties of the parent structure prompted us to use the 485 probe in the context of the single ring to compare its behavior with that of wild-type GroEL. It was hoped that a comparison of the kinetic responses of the double- and single-ring structures (i.e. Y485W-GroEL and Y485W-SR1) would reveal the steps at which interring coupling occurred in the whole molecule. The surprising finding is that only one step displays highly divergent thermodynamic properties in the SR1 species. The specificity of the effect allows us, at least in part, to deduce the mechanism of information transfer between the rings in the nucleotide-driven reaction cycle. The standard reaction buffer in all experiments, except where stated otherwise, was 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 20 mm MgCl2. GroEL Tyr to Trp variants were constructed as described (28Gibbons D.L. Hixson J.D. Hay N. Lund P. Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31989-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and purified from E. coli strain TG2 bearing the plasmid pTrc99a. The purification was undertaken by using the method described previously (22Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except for the following two modifications. First, the Q-Sepharose column (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) was followed by an additional Q-Sepharose column equilibrated either in 25% methanol, 50 mm BisTris 1The abbreviation used is: BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. (pH 6.0) in the case of Y485W-GroEL or 12% methanol, 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.0) in the case of Y485W-SR1. Second, the Q-Sepharose column was followed by an additional gel filtration step on a Sepharose-S300 column equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Analytical size-exclusion gel chromatography on a Superose-6 column was used to ascertain that there was no contamination of the single ring tryptophan variant with wild-type GroEL of chromosomal origin. The concentrations of the proteins were estimated spectrophotometrically by the UV absorption of aromatic residues. A molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of ϵ280 nm = 12,800 m–1 cm–1 per Trp485-containing subunit of either Y485W-GroEL or Y485W-SR1 was employed in the calculations. In addition, the Y485W-GroEL and Y485W-SR1 absorbance spectra were corrected for intrinsic light scattering of the solution because of the particle size of the protein complexes. Concentrations of Y485W-GroEL and Y485W-SR1 given in the text and figure legends refer to the oligomer (i.e. 14-mer and heptamer, respectively). The proteins were stored in reaction buffer at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm NaN3 and used within 4 weeks after purification. ATP was obtained from Roche AG. Nucleotide concentrations were confirmed spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 15,300 m–1 cm–1 for adenine at 260 nm. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were from BDH and were analytical grade. Linked ATPase Assay—ATP hydrolysis was measured using a coupled enzymatic assay as described previously (29Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 30Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20424-20430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), except that the reaction mixture was left to equilibrate with all components apart from the chaperonin (either Y485W-GroEL or Y485W-SR1) to allow for the mopping up of unwanted ADP by pyruvate kinase. The reaction mixture contained ATP at a final concentration of 400 μm. The addition of chaperonin to a final concentration of 0.2 μm to the temperature-equilibrated reaction mixture initiated the measurement of the ATPase rate. The linking enzymes used were pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (31Finzi A. Nyvold S. El Agroudi M. J. Appl. Rabbit Res. 1992; 15: 745-750Google Scholar, 32Sutherland G.B. Trapani I.L. Campbell D.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1958; 12: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and purchased from Sigma (P-0294). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated as described (29Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured in a thermostatted PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda-2 spectrophotometer. Radioactive Orthophosphate Formation Assay—The assay for the hydrolysis of ATP by Y485W-SR1 was carried out under single turnover conditions (i.e.[SR1]subunit = [ATP]), and under multiple turnover conditions (i.e. [SR1]subunit ≪ [ATP]). Specifically, we used [SR1]subunit = 140 μm = [ATP] for the single turnover, whereas for the multiple turnover we used [SR1]subunit = 140 μm and [ATP] = 700 μm. These experiments were performed as described (19Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, the required concentrations of nucleotide (containing about 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and Y485W-SR1 were mixed, and aliquots were removed at various times over the course of the reaction. Each aliquot was quenched by addition of 10 volumes of 40 mm HCl containing 30 mg/ml acid-washed charcoal at the time of removal. The protein unfolds and releases the bound nucleotides as well as the products of the ATP hydrolysis. Any unhydrolyzed ATP and ADP bind to the charcoal leaving hydrolyzed 32Pi groups in solution. After removal of charcoal (and therefore of ADP und uncleaved ATP) by centrifugation, the amount of 32Pi in the supernatant was assayed by Cerenkov radiation counting. The background activity derived from spontaneously hydrolyzed phosphate in the original radioactive [γ-32P]ATP preparation was subtracted from all results. The Cerenkov counts were related to the amount of ATP hydrolyzed by measuring the radioactivity of an identical assay sample not treated with charcoal. This method measures the total product formed, whether it is free in solution or bound to the enzyme. All stopped-flow experiments were performed in the standard buffer using a thermostatted Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow fluorimeter. Tryptophan-containing mutants were excited by monochromatic light at 295 nm and the resulting fluorescence was selected with a WG320 filter that cuts off all light below 320 nm. At least five fluorescence transients were averaged for any data point. All data fitting was carried out using Grafit 3.0 (Erithacus software). The dependence of the rates of reaction on the temperature was analyzed by plotting the natural logarithm of the rate (ln kobs) versus the inverse thermodynamic temperature (1/T) in classical Arrhenius fashion; the resultant linear graph, ln kobs = f(1/T), was fitted by linear regression. The slope m of the resultant straight line was then used to calculate the apparent energy of activation Ea according to the relationship R·m = Ea, where R = 8.314 J/mol·K (33Kohl B. Hofmann K.P. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 271-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Gavish B. Werber M.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Cornish-Bowden A. J. Biosci. 2002; 27: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The sigmoidal graphs generated by plotting the fluorescence amplitude versus the ATP concentration were fitted directly to the Hill equation to yield the equilibrium binding constant K½ (27Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The dependence of the equilibrium dissociation constant K½ on the temperature was analyzed on the basis of the van't Hoff isotherm dln K½/dT = ΔHvH/RT2; the natural logarithm of the dissociation constant (ln K½) was plotted against the inverse thermodynamic temperature (1/T) and fitted by linear regression. The slope m of the ensuing straight line fit is m =–ΔHvH/RT (36Case A. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3335-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For all the linear fits in this study the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.99. The data of the single turnover measurement was fitted to a monoexponential function of the form f(t) = a·(1-exp{–kobs· t}), where a represents the amplitude and signifies the total amount of ATP that has been hydrolyzed in the reaction, and kobs is the apparent rate constant. The data of the multiple turnover measurement was fitted to a straight line of the form f(t) = m·t, where the slope m is related to the steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis by m = a·kobs (19Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). SR1 was originally cloned in pTrc99a (Amersham Biosciences) expression vector. The SR1 clone was a kind gift from Arthur Horwich (Yale University). Mutagenesis was carried out by the “megaprimer” method of site-directed mutagenesis (37Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler. In the interest of readability, throughout the following section we refer to the single-tryptophan mutant of the doublering, wild-type GroEL (Y485W-GroEL (27Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) as “GroEL” and to the single-tryptophan mutant of the single-ring variant SR1 (Y485W-SR1) as “SR1.” Conformational Response to ATP Binding: a Comparison of SR1 and GroEL—Shown in Fig. 1a is the transient kinetic response of the Trp485 probe in SR1 when the protein is challenged with ATP in a stopped-flow fluorimeter. The reaction exhibits four kinetic phases across the ATP-concentration range: a rapid enhancement (a), two easily resolved quench phases (b and c), and finally, a slow enhancement (d). Although this last phase has a rate constant of only 0.76 (±0.03) s–1, this value is still six times faster than the steady-state rate of hydrolysis in these conditions (kcat ∼0.12 s–1), showing that these rearrangements precede the ATP-cleavage step. This behavior is strongly reminiscent of the four-phase behavior of the “wild-type,” double-ring structure when reported by the same optical signal (27Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To emphasize this close relationship the data for GroEL and SR1 are directly compared in Fig. 1b. Despite this similarity of pattern, the fact that rate constants are roughly co-incident in two different systems does not demonstrate that the underlying physical processes are the same. However, Fig. 2 shows that the temperature responses of the readily measurable phases (b–d) are identical. Such a result leads us to conclude that there is little difference in the pre-hydrolytic behavior of SR1 and GroEL. Hence, by these thermodynamic criteria, coupling between rings at this stage in the nucleotide-driven reaction cycle cannot be strong. The above conclusion is strengthened by comparing the equilibrium binding affinities of ATP in the pre-hydrolytic phase. These can be measured by recording the fluorescence amplitude response as a function of ATP concentration on a time scale shorter than that of bond cleavage. Such a measurement is sensitive to the forward and reverse rates of all steps that precede hydrolysis and, although there is a small shift in K½ values between GroEL and SR1 (e.g. from 8.0 (±0.4) to 13.4 (±0.6) μm at 25 °C), the temperature sensitivity is the same (see Fig. 3). In addition, the tightening of the interaction at high temperatures implies that the net binding energy of ATP arises from hydrophobic interactions consistent with displacement of water from non-polar surfaces. Thermodynamic Properties of the Hydrolytic Step—When the rate of ATP hydrolysis is measured by orthodox steady-state kinetics, we see a profound divergence of behavior between the single- and double-ring structures (see Fig. 4). The Arrhenius activation enthalpy for GroEL (94.2 (±3.3) kJ/mol) is more than twice that of SR1 (42.0 (±0.7) kJ/mol). In view of the close similarity of all other measured parameters, this striking difference is worthy of attention. The most immediate issue is to question whether we are measuring the same step in the process of binding, rearrangement, bond cleavage, and product release in the steady-state SR1 cycle as we are in that of GroEL. In other words, does this radical change in the temperature dependence of the maximal rate signify a change in the nature of the rate-determining step? In the case of wild-type GroEL it has been shown that neither the dissociation of ADP and Pi nor the fluorescence-detected steps following binding of ATP limit the rate of the steady-state process (19Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows this also to be the case for SR1; the first-order rate constant for the single-turnover reaction and the per-site steady-state rate of the multiple turnover reaction are the same, i.e. there is no rapid phase in the latter that reveals a mechanism in which the off-rate plays a part in the maximal rate of steady-state hydrolysis.Fig. 5Single turnover and multiple turnover of ATP by Y485W-SR1. The assay for the hydrolysis of ATP by Y485W-SR1 was carried out at 25 °C under standard conditions. Conditions for the single turnover were [SR1]subunit = 140 μm = [ATP]. Conditions for the multiple turnover were [SR1]subunit = 140 μm and [ATP] = 700 μm. The single turnover rate profile fits to a single exponential function with an observed rate constant of hydrolysis of kobs = 0.103 (±0.006) s–1. The multiple turnover rate profile (inset, superimposed) is linear with a slope that corresponds to a maximum steady-state rate of hydrolysis of kobs = 0.093 (±0.002) s–1: it does not exhibit a burst phase. Within error, both rates are identical. In the inset, the two profiles are super-imposed and show the linear plot to be the tangent to the single exponential curve in the point t = 0 (i.e. origin). The multiple turnover experiments track the transient formation of both enzyme-bound and free (released) products, so that a potential (pre-steady-state) burst phase of the magnitude of one turnover worth of products could be detected in addition to the subsequent steady-state rate process. Had the dissociation of ADP and Pi from the enzyme complex been rate-limiting, a burst phase with an amplitude of 140 μm Pi would have been observed under multiple turnover conditions. Also, the observed rate extracted from the single-exponential function would not have been identical to, but significantly higher than, the observed maximum steady-state rate hydrolysis constant (kcat ∼ 0.12 s–1). Quoted errors are S.E. calculated from least-squares fits to the data. The compound errors of the Cerenkov counts and the initial rate calculations were less than 1% in all cases. Therefore, the error bars are smaller than the plot symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SR1 as a Paradigm for the Study of Ring-Ring Communication in GroEL—For SR1 to be useful in studying ring-ring communication it must retain structural and functional integrity. It has been shown previously that the Hill constant, which measures the degree of positive cooperativity within a GroEL ring, is hardly disturbed in SR1 showing that the communication between subunits within the heptamer is not strongly influenced by its contact with the other ring (38Poso D. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Second, the rate constants for conformational shifts induced by ATP binding are the same across a wide temperature range; there is thus no change in thermodynamic parameters associated with the series of structural rearrangements following binding but preceding hydrolysis. We therefore conclude that halving the GroEL molecule has not led to a significant perturbation of either the structural or functional manifestations of inter-subunit contacts at the heptameric level of oligomeric organization. This view is further supported by Horwich and colleagues (17Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), who have demonstrated that SR1 remains a highly competent molecule because neither its ability to bind to GroES nor its capacity to sequester and refold substrate proteins appear to be impaired when compared with the wild type. All of the above reflects the crystallographic finding that inter-ring contacts are much less extensive than intra-ring contacts (6Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 39Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). This view has most recently been underscored by electron microscopic studies on the effect of temperature on the size of the gap between the two rings of GroEL in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system. As the temperature is increased there is a concomitant increase in inter-ring spacing that is thought to reflect the weakening of inter-ring interactions (40Llorca O. Galan A. Carrascosa J.L. Muga A.

We have previously selected ribozyme variants for their activity in cleaving an mRNA substrate from a pool of ribozymes containing randomized sequences. In this study, one of the variants was used to target the mRNA encoding thymidine kinase (TK) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The variant exhibited enhanced cleavage and substrate binding and was at least 30 times more efficient in cleaving TK mRNA in vitro than the ribozyme derived from the wild type sequence. Our results provide the first direct evidence to suggest that a point mutation at nucleotide 95 of RNase P catalytic RNA from Escherichia coli (G95 → U95) increases the rate of cleavage, whereas another mutation at nucleotide 200 (A200 → C200) enhances substrate binding of the ribozyme. A reduction of about 99% in TK expression was observed in cells expressing the variant, whereas a 70% reduction was found in cells expressing the ribozyme derived from the wild type sequence. Thus, the RNase P ribozyme variant is highly effective in inhibiting HSV-1 gene expression. Our study demonstrates that ribozyme variants increase their cleavage activity and efficacy in blocking gene expression in cells through enhanced substrate binding and rate of cleavage.

Each of these approaches has its own advantages and limitations in terms of targeting efficacy, sequence specificity, toxicity, and delivery efficiency in vivo. Further studies, such as constructing new and more effective ribozymes, would significantly facilitate the development of these approaches for gene-targeting applications. RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for processing tRNA by catalyzing a hydrolysis reaction to remove a 5′ leader sequence from the precursor tRNA (ptRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ptRNA, precursor tRNA; GS, guide sequence; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus 1; TK, thymidine kinase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ptRNA, precursor tRNA; GS, guide sequence; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus 1; TK, thymidine kinase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. to form a mature tRNA molecule (9Altman S.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, RNase P consists of a catalytic RNA subunit (M1 RNA) and a protein subunit (C5 protein) (11Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that the structures of the substrates, rather than their specific sequences or nucleotides, dictate the recognition and cleavage by the enzyme (12Gopalan V. Vioque A. Altman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6759-6762Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, for any given sequence that satisfies the structural requirements, M1 RNA can be used to target the sequence for a specific and irreversible cleavage. Indeed, Altman and colleagues proposed that M1 RNA can be used to cleave an mRNA sequence if a custom-designed external guide sequence is constructed to hybridize to the target mRNA and guide M1 RNA for the specific cleavage (see Fig. 1A) (13Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Google Scholar). Furthermore, M1 RNA can be covalently linked to a guide sequence (GS) that is complementary to a target mRNA sequence (14Frank D. Harris M. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10800-10808Google Scholar, 15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar). The resulting ribozyme, M1GS RNA, can bind the mRNA substrate through Watson-Crick base pairing interaction between the guide sequence and the mRNA (Fig. 1A). Thus, the intrinsic catalytic activity of M1GS, in principle, can be used to target virtually any known mRNA sequence. In this reaction, the ribozyme uses its guide sequence to bind to its mRNA substrate through base pairing interactions and then docks the substrate into the active site, followed by cleavage and finally by product dissociation. We have previously shown that M1GS ribozymes cleaved the mRNA sequences of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and human cytomegalovirus (16Trang P. Hsu A.W. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4590-4597Google Scholar, 17Hsu A.W. Kilani A.F. Liou K. Lee J. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3105-3116Google Scholar, 18Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1235-1247Google Scholar) and inhibited viral gene expression in cultured cells (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Google Scholar). For example, a M1GS ribozyme that cleaved the mRNA sequence (TK mRNA) that encodes HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) was constructed (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar, 18Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1235-1247Google Scholar). A reduction of 70–75% in the expression levels of TK mRNA and protein was observed in cells that expressed the ribozyme. Targeted cleavage of mRNA by RNase P ribozyme provides a unique approach to inactivate any RNA of known sequence expressed in vivo. To develop this ribozyme for practical use both as a research tool and as a therapeutic agent for gene-targeting applications, further studies, such as genetic engineering of the ribozymes for efficient enzymatic activity and investigating how ribozymes interact with mRNA substrates and achieve efficient cleavage, are needed to improve M1GS RNA catalytic efficiency in vitro and its efficacy in vivo. Using a nuclease footprint analysis and a site-specific UV cross-linking approach, we have previously mapped the regions of the ribozymes that are in close contact with an mRNA model substrate (16Trang P. Hsu A.W. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4590-4597Google Scholar, 17Hsu A.W. Kilani A.F. Liou K. Lee J. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3105-3116Google Scholar, 18Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1235-1247Google Scholar). Moreover, using an in vitro selection procedure, we have recently isolated M1GS ribozyme variants that are more efficient in cleaving a specific mRNA sequence than that derived from the wild type M1 RNA (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar). Little is currently known about how these variants increase their activity in cleaving the target mRNA substrate. Further characterization of these variants will provide insight into the mechanism of how RNase P ribozymes cleave an mRNA substrate efficiently and generate general guidelines for construction of highly active ribozymes for gene targeting applications. In the present study, we used one of these ribozyme variants to target the HSV-1 TK mRNA sequence and investigated its activity in cleaving the target mRNA in vitro and its efficacy in inhibiting TK gene expression in cultured cells that were infected with HSV-1. Our results indicate that the variant is at least 30-fold more efficient in vitro than the ribozyme derived from the wild type M1 sequence. More importantly, a reduction of about 99% in TK mRNA and protein expression was observed in cells that expressed the variant. Biochemical characterization of the variant suggests that a point mutation at nucleotide position 95 of M1 RNA (G95 → U95) may increase the rate of cleavage and another mutation at nucleotide position 200 (A200 → C200) enhances substrate binding of the ribozyme. Our results provide the direct evidence that RNase P ribozyme variant is highly effective in inhibiting HSV-1 gene expression and furthermore, demonstrate the utility of M1GS RNAs as a new class of gene-targeting ribozymes for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Generating highly active ribozymes and understanding the mechanism of how these ribozymes achieve their cleavage activity in vitro and in cell culture will provide insight into developing RNase P ribozymes for gene-targeting applications. Antibodies, Viruses, and Cells—The monoclonal antibodies against human actin and HSV-1 ICP27 were purchased from Sigma, Inc. and the Goodwin Institute of Cancer Research, Inc. (Plantation, FL), respectively. The polyclonal antibody against HSV-1 TK was kindly provided by Dr. William Summers (Yale University). Vero, PA317, and ψCRE cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as described previously (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar). The propagation of HSV-1 (strain F) was carried out in Vero cells, as described previously (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar). Generation of Ribozymes—Plasmid pFL117, pV41, and pC102, which contain the DNA sequences encoding M1 RNA, variant V41, and mutant C102, respectively, have been described previously (18Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1235-1247Google Scholar, 22Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 613-623Google Scholar). Variant constructs pM95 and pM200 were generated by changing G95 → U95 and A200 → C200 in the M1 sequence of pFL117, respectively. C102 contains several point mutations (e.g.347AC348 → 347CU348 and 353CCCG356 → 353GGAU356) at the catalytic domain (P4 helix) of the M1 RNA sequence (22Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 613-623Google Scholar). The DNA sequences that encode ribozymes M1-TK, V41-TK, M95-TK, M200-TK, and C-M1-TK were constructed by PCR using pFL117, pV41, pM95, pM200, and pC102 as the templates, respectively, with OliT7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as the 5′ primer and Oligo31 (5′-GTGGTGTCTGCGTTCGACTATGACCATG-3′) as the 3′ primer. Similarly, the DNA sequences that encode C-V41-TK, C-M-95-TK, and C-M200-TK were generated by PCR using oligonucleotide AF25 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as the 5′ primer, Oligo31 as the 3′ primer, C-V41, C-M95, and C-M200 DNAs as the templates, respectively. The DNA sequences that encoded ribozymes C-V41, C-M95, and C-M200 were generated by PCR using oligonucleotide AF25 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as the 5′ primer, oligonucleotide C102 (5′-TATGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTCAGGTGAAACTGACCGAGAATCATCCTGCTAGCGTGGACAGTCA-3′) as the 3′ primer, pV41, pM95, and pM200 as the templates, respectively. Construction of RNA Substrates—Plasmid pFL120 contains the DNA sequences that encode the RNA substrate stk. The DNAs that code for stk3 were generated by PCR to replace the entire 13-nucleotide-long 3′ tail sequence of stk with a thymidine nucleotide. The DNA sequences that code for RNA stk5 and stk3 were constructed by PCR using pFL120 as the template, AF25 as the 5′ primer, and oligonucleotides olistk5 (5′-CCGCGCAGCCTGGTCGAACGCAGACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′) and olistk3 (5′-AGTCGAACGCA-3′) as the 3′ primers, respectively. Construction of Retroviral Plasmids and Ribozyme-expressing Cells—Retroviral constructs RvM1-TK, RvC-M1-TK, RvC-M200-TK, RvC-V41-TK, RvM200-TK, and RvV41-TK were constructed by placing the DNA sequences that code for M1-TK, C-M1-TK, C-M200-TK, C-V41-TK, M200-TK, and V41-TK under the control of the U6 promoter in the LXSN retroviral vector, respectively (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar, 23Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990Google Scholar). Cells containing the M1GS-retroviral DNA sequence were generated as described previously (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar, 23Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990Google Scholar). The retroviral vector DNAs that contained the ribozyme sequence were transfected into amphotropic PA317 cells using a mammalian transfection kit purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). At forty-eight hours post-transfection, culture supernatants that contained retroviral vector particles were collected and used to infect ψCRE cells (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar). At 48–72 h post-infection, neomycin (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 600 μg/ml. Cells were subsequently selected in the presence of neomycin for 2 weeks and neomycin-resistant cells were cloned. The level of M1GS RNA expression in individual cell clone was determined by Northern analysis. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions from M1GS-expressing cells were isolated as described previously (21Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Google Scholar, 24Liu F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5149-5156Google Scholar), and then separated in gels that contained formaldehyde, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, hybridized with the 32P-radiolabeled DNA probe that contained the DNA sequence coding for M1 RNA, and finally analyzed with a STORM 840 PhosphorImager. The radiolabeled DNA probe used to detect M1GS RNAs was synthesized from plasmid pFL117, by using a random primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Only those cell clones that expressed similar levels of ribozymes were used for subsequent experiments. Viral Infection and Assays for TK Expression—Approximately 106 cells in a T25 flask were either mock infected or infected with HSV-1 in 1.5 ml of Medium 199 (Invitrogen) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) as specified under “Results.” Cells were harvested at 8–16 h post-infection. Total cellular RNA and protein samples were prepared from the cells as described previously (21Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Google Scholar, 24Liu F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5149-5156Google Scholar). The RNA probes used to detect TK mRNA and the transcripts of the α47, Us10, and Us11 genes were synthesized from pTK129 and pTK141, and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar). The protected RNA products were separated in 8% urea/polyacrylamide denaturing gels, and quantitated with a STORM 840 PhosphorImager. The denatured, solubilized polypeptides from cell lysates were separated on 9% (v/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels cross-linked with N,N″-methylenebisacrylamide (25Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1397-1406Google Scholar). The separated polypeptides were transferred electrically to nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with the antibodies against HSV-1 TK or ICP27. The membranes were subsequently stained with a chemiluminescent substrate with the aid of a Western chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with a STORM 840 PhosphorImager. Quantitation was performed in the linear range of RNA and protein detection (e.g. 2-fold changes in RNA and protein samples result in a 2-fold change in signal bracketing the range of experimental values). Single-turnover Kinetic Analyses—The cleavage reactions of substrate stk by different ribozymes were carried out in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NH4Cl; 100 mm MgCl2) and single-turnover kinetic analyses to determine the values of the observed cleavage rate (kobs) were performed as described previously (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar, 26Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Google Scholar). Analyses were performed with a trace amount of radioactive substrate and an excess of ribozyme. Variations in the amount of substrate did not affect the observed cleavage rate (kobs) at a fixed excess ribozyme concentration, and the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The concentrations of ribozyme tested ranged from 0.05 to 5 nm, and the concentration of radioactive substrate was less than 0.01 nm. Pseudo-first-order rate constants of cleavage (kobs) were assayed at each ribozyme concentration by the slope of a plot –ln[(Ft – Fe)/(1 – Fe)] versus time using KaleidaGraph program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Ft and Fe represent the fraction of the substrate at time t and the end point (>10 h) of the experiments, respectively. The values of the overall cleavage rate (kcat/Km)s were calculated by the slope of a least-squares linear regression (KaleidaGraph) of a plot of the values of kobsversus the concentrations of the ribozymes (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar, 26Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Google Scholar). Determination of Apparent Reaction Rate Constant kapp—The experimental procedures to determine the apparent reaction rate constant kapp were carried out as described previously (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of substrates and ribozymes were incubated in buffer B (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm CaCl2) at 37 °C for 10 min to allow binding. At pH 6.0 and in the presence of CaCl2, the active ribozyme-substrate complexes can be formed, but the cleavage rate is significantly reduced (16Trang P. Hsu A.W. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4590-4597Google Scholar, 19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar, 27Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Google Scholar, 28Smith D. Burgin A.B. Haas E.S. Pace N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2429-2436Google Scholar, 29Loria A. Pan T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8612-8620Google Scholar, 30Kurz J.C. Fierke C.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 553-558Google Scholar). After binding, the bound ribozyme-substrate complexes were separated from the unbound substrates using G-50 Sephadex gel filtration columns (Roche Applied Science). The eluted samples were examined in 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels for the presence of labeled ribozyme-substrate complexes, and the concentrations of the complexes were quantitated by a STORM 840 PhosphorImager. Ribozyme-substrate complexes were then diluted in different concentrations (2–70 nm) and incubated in buffer C (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures at regular intervals (from 0 to 120 min). The cleavage products were separated on 15% denaturing gels, autoradiographed, and quantitated with a STORM 840 PhosphorImager. The apparent rate constant, kapp, was calculated by the slope of the plot of ln(S0/St) versus time, where S0 equals the initial substrate concentration and St equals the substrate concentration at a given time point. The values obtained were the average of three experiments. Binding Assays and Determination of Binding Dissociation Constant (Kd)—The procedures to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of complexes of the ribozymes and the substrates were modified from Pyle et al. (31Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Google Scholar). Various concentrations of M1GS RNAs were preincubated in buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm CaCl2, 3% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 10 min before mixing with an equal volume of different concentrations of substrate RNA preheated under identical conditions. The samples were incubated for 10–120 min to allow binding, then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 10 watts. The electrophoresis running buffer contained 100 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 (31Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Google Scholar). The value of Kd was then extrapolated from a graph plotting the percentage of product bound versus M1GS RNA concentration. The values were the average of three experiments. Efficient Cleavage Activity of the Engineered RNase P Ribozymes in Vitro—Because most mRNA species inside cells are associated with proteins and are present in a folded conformation, it is essential to choose a targeted region that is accessible to binding of M1GS ribozymes. We have used an in vivo mapping approach with dimethyl sulfate (15Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Google Scholar, 32Ares M. Igel A.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2132-2145Google Scholar, 33Zaug A.J. Cech T.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 363-374Google Scholar) to determine the accessible regions of TK mRNA. A position, 29 nucleotides downstream from the translation initiation site of TK gene, was chosen as the cleavage site for the M1GS ribozyme. The targeted region is one of the sequences most accessible to dimethyl sulfate modification and is likely to be accessible to ribozyme binding (data not shown). We have previously employed an in vitro selection procedure to isolate M1GS RNA variants that are more efficient in cleaving the TK mRNA sequence than the ribozyme derived from the wild type M1 RNA (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar). The objective of the study was to generate highly active RNase P ribozyme variants that can be used to target an mRNA and to study the variants to understand the catalytic mechanism of RNase P ribozymes in cleaving mRNA substrates. However, little is currently known about the mechanism of how some of these active variants increase their cleavage activity in vitro. We chose variant 41 (designated as V41) for the study, because the ribozymes derived from this variant are among the most active M1GS RNAs in cleaving the TK as well as the mRNA sequence encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in vitro (Table I).Table IThe overall cleavage rate (kcat/Km)s and binding affinity (Kd) in reactions of substrates stk and stk3 with RNase P ribozyme variants and the ribozyme (M1-TK) derived from the wild type M1 RNA sequenceEnzymeSubstrate(kcat/Km)sKdμm-1 min-1nmM1-TKstk0.34 ± 0.080.25 ± 0.05stk30.16 ± 0.040.98 ± 0.21V41-TKstk10.5 ± 1.10.010 ± 0.002stk30.80 ± 0.180.95 ± 0.17M95-TKstk1.8 ± 0.20.27 ± 0.06stk30.82 ± 0.091.0 ± 0.3M200-TKstk2.8 ± 0.50.012 ± 0.002stk30.16 ± 0.040.99 ± 0.20C-M1-TKstk<5 × 10-60.26 ± 0.04C-M200-TKstk<5 × 10-60.010 ± 0.002C-V41-TKstk<5 × 10-60.011 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab Ribozyme V41-TK was constructed by covalently linking the 3′ terminus of V41 RNA to a guide sequence of 13 nucleotides that is complementary to the targeted mRNA sequence. V41 contains point mutations G95 → U95 and A200 → C200 (Fig. 1C) (19Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Google Scholar). Little is known about the functional role of G95 in M1GS RNA cleavage, whereas our recent UV cross-linking and nuclease footprint analyses suggest that A200 is in close proximity to the 3′ tail sequence of a mRNA substrate and is probably involved in binding the mRNA substrate (16Trang P. Hsu A.W. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4590-4597Google Scholar, 17Hsu A.W. Kilani A.F. Liou K. Lee J. Liu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3105-3116Google Scholar, 18Kilani A.F. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1235-1247Google Scholar). To study the function of these two mutations in the cleavage of the TK mRNA sequence, we constructed two additional ribozymes, M95-TK and M200-TK, which were derived from M1 RNA and contained the mutations G95 → U95 and A200 → C200, respectively. Two other M1GS ribozymes, M1-TK and C-M1-TK, were also constructed in a similar way and included in the study. M1-TK was derived from the wild type M1, whereas C-M1-TK was derived from C102 RNA, a M1 mutant that contains several point mutations at the P4 catalytic domain and is catalytically inactive (22Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 613-623Google Scholar). RNA substrate stk contains the targeted TK mRNA sequence of 46 nucleotides (Fig. 1B). Cleavage of stk was observed in cleavage buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NH4Cl; 100 mm MgCl2) in the presence of V41-TK, M95-TK, M200-TK, and M1-TK (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3, and Table I). In contrast, cleavage of the same substrate by C-M1-TK was barely detected due to the point mutations at the catalytic center region (Fig. 2, lane 4). To determine whether the variant is more active in cleaving the TK mRNA sequence, cleavage of stk by the ribozymes was assayed and the overall cleavage rate (kcat/Km)s of the reactions was determined using kinetic analyses under single turnover conditions. Ribozyme V41-TK, M95-TK, and M200-TK were about 30, 5, and 8 times more active than M1-TK that was derived from the wild type M1 RNA sequence (Table I), indicating that ribozyme variants are much more efficient in cleaving TK mRNA than that derived from the wild type M1 RNA sequence. Increased Rate of Cleavage of the Ribozyme Variant—The values of (kcat/Km)s obtained under single-turnover conditions may reflect the rates of substrate binding and cleavage of the substrate. Accordingly, experiments were carried out with the variant to determine whether a change in the rates of these steps contributed to the increased (kcat/Km)s values. To determine whether the mutations affect the rate of cleavage, substrate stk was allowed to form active complexes with the ribozymes in the presence of divalent ions, and the apparent reaction rate constant, kapp, for the complexes was measured. We mixed equimolar amounts of ribozymes and substrate stk in binding buffer B (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm CaCl2), in the presence of CaCl2 and under the buffer condition at pH 6.0, and separated the ribozyme-stk complexes from the unbound substrates using G-50 Sephadex columns. The buffer condition at pH 6.0 and in the presence of CaCl2 in buffer B, compared with that in regular cleavage buffer A (pH 7.5 and in the presence of MgCl2), was used to significantly reduce the rate of cleavage while allowing proper folding of the ribozymes and substrates and preserving the interactions between the ribozyme and the substrate in an active ribozyme-substrate complex (14Frank D.
