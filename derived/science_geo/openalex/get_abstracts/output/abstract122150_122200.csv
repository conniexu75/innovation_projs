An international consortium was organized to develop and map gene-based sequence tagged site markers on a set of two radiation hybrid panels and a yeast artificial chromosome library. More than 16,000 human genes have been mapped relative to a framework map that contains about 1000 polymorphic genetic markers. The gene map unifies the existing genetic and physical maps with the nucleotide and protein sequence databases in a fashion that should speed the discovery of genes underlying inherited human disease.

https://openalex.org/W2066812102,"Caveolin is a 22-kDa membrane protein found associated with a coat material decorating the inner membrane surface of caveolae. A remarkable feature of this protein is its ability to migrate from caveolae directly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when membrane cholesterol is oxidized. We now present evidence caveolin is involved in transporting newly synthesized cholesterol from the ER directly to caveolae. MA104 cells and normal human fibroblasts transported new cholesterol to caveolae with a half-time of ∼10 min. The cholesterol then rapidly flowed from caveolae to non-caveolae membrane. Cholesterol moved out of caveolae even when the supply of fresh cholesterol from the ER was interrupted. Treatment of cells with 10 μg/ml progesterone blocked cholesterol movement from ER to caveolae. Simultaneously, caveolin accumulated in the lumen of the ER, suggesting cholesterol transport is linked to caveolin movement. Caveolae fractions from cells expressing caveolin were enriched in cholesterol 3-4-fold, while the same fractions from cells lacking caveolin were not enriched. Cholesterol transport to the cell surface was nearly 4 times more rapid in cells expressing caveolin than in matched cells lacking caveolin.

Cholesterol transport to the cell surface was nearly 4 times more rapid in cells expressing caveolin than in matched cells lacking caveolin. Caveolae are sphingomyelin/cholesterol-rich membrane domains (1Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-808Google Scholar, 2Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Google Scholar) first discovered as membrane invaginations on the surface of endothelial (3Palade G.E. J. Appl. Phys. 1953; 24: 1424Google Scholar) and epithelial (4Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Google Scholar) cells. One class of proteins that collect in caveolae are those linked to the membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (5Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.-S. Kolhouse J.F. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 637-649Google Scholar). The association of these proteins with caveolae requires cholesterol (6Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Google Scholar, 7Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Google Scholar). Furthermore, the characteristic coat structure that decorates the inside membrane surface of fibroblast caveolae is disassembled by cholesterol binding drugs such as nystatin and filipin (8Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar). These two observations, together with the finding that invaginated caveolae are reduced in cholesterol-depleted cells (7Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Google Scholar), suggest cholesterol plays an important role in caveolae structure and function (9Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Google Scholar, 10Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Google Scholar). Caveolin is a membrane protein that may be involved in regulating caveolae cholesterol. It is an acylated (11Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Google Scholar), integral membrane protein (8Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar) associated with the caveolae coat material (8Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar). When normal human fibroblasts are incubated in the presence of cholesterol oxidase, caveolin rapidly appears in the Golgi region of the cell (12Smart E.J. Ying Y.-U. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it reaches this location by migrating directly from caveolae to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. before moving through the lumen of the Golgi-ER intermediate compartment on to the Golgi apparatus. Once cholesterol oxidase is removed from the medium, caveolin returns to the cell surface. This appears to be a normal traffic pattern for caveolin that is blocked by microtubule poisons (13Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1424-1433Google Scholar).

Newly synthesized cholesterol made in the ER appears to get to the cell surface by a novel vesicular route that does not involve the Golgi apparatus (14DeGrella R.F. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14256-14262Google Scholar, 15Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Google Scholar, 16Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Google Scholar). Cholesterol also can move directly from the plasma membrane to the ER (17Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Google Scholar). The compartment involved in cholesterol inward and outward flux may be caveolae (18Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Google Scholar). Since caveolin can move between the plasma membrane and the ER, bind cholesterol (19Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Google Scholar) as well as fatty acids (21Trigatti B.L. Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22621-22625Google Scholar), 2B. L. Trigatti, R. G. W. Anderson, and G. E. Gerber, submitted for publication. and preferentially incorporate into liposomes containing cholesterol (19Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Google Scholar, 22Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Google Scholar), there may be a role for this protein in cholesterol traffic. We now present direct evidence that caveolin is involved in the rapid movement of cholesterol from the ER to the cell surface. Medium 199 with Earls salts minus folic acid was prepared in the laboratory by standard methods. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), glutamine, trypsin-EDTA, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Hazleton Research Products, Inc. (Lenexa, KS). The analytical silica gel thin-layer chromatography plates, heptane, petroleum ether, ethyl ether, acetic acid, and 2-propanol were from J.T. Baker, Inc. [3H]Acetate (specific activity 4.13 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont. [3H]Folic acid (specific activity 27 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (City of Industry, CA). The sulfuric-dichromate spray was from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). The Bradford assay kit was from Bio-Rad. Percoll was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. OptiPrep was from Life Technologies, Inc. The anti-caveolin IgG was from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY), and anti-folate receptor IgG (Mov19) was from Centocor, Inc. (Malvern, PA). The caveolin expression construct was developed in the laboratory. Human lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared as described (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). Buffer A consisted of 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tricine, pH 7.8. Buffer B consisted of 0.25 M sucrose, 6 mM EDTA, 120 mM Tricine, pH 7.8. Buffer C was 50% OptiPrep in Buffer B. Buffer D consisted of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20. Buffer E consisted of 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, NaCl, 0.15 M, 1% Triton X-100, and 60 mM octylglucoside. Buffer F (5 × sample buffer) was 0.31 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.125% bromphenol blue. Normal human fibroblasts were obtained by skin biopsy, cultured in a monolayer, and set up according to a standard format (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). On day zero, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes with 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The medium was changed on day 3 and day 5. The day 5 medium contained 10% (v/v) human lipoprotein-deficient serum. The cholesterol pool was radiolabeled by changing the medium on day 6 or day 7 to DMEM plus 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, adding [3H]acetate (50 μCi/dish) to the dish, and was incubated for the indicated times. All experiments were carried out on day 7. MA104 cells were also grown according to a standard format (24Kamen B.A. Wang M.-T. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13602-13609Google Scholar). On day zero, 3.0 × 105 cells were seeded into a T-75 culture flask and cultured for 5 days in folate-free medium 199 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cholesterol pool was labeled as described for human fibroblasts. For [3H}folate uptake assays, the cells were used directly on day 5 as described previously (25Kamen B.A. Capdevila A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5983-5987Google Scholar). L1210-JF cells (kindly provided by Dr. Bart Kamen) are a murine lymphocyte cell line expressing the folate receptor (26Fan J. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14862-14865Google Scholar). On day zero, 5 × 106 cells were seeded into T-75 flasks in RPMI medium 1640 plus glutaMax I (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 25 mM Hepes with 10% bovine serum. Transfected cell medium also contained 300 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells were grown for 5 days. On day 5 the medium was changed to the same medium containing 10% (v/v) human lipoprotein-deficient serum, and on day 6 or day 7 the cholesterol pool was labeled as for the human fibroblasts. Thin-layer chromatography was used, as described previously (27Smart E.J. Foster D.C. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 307-313Google Scholar), to measure the amount of [3H]cholesterol in membrane fractions from cells incubated in the presence of [3H]acetate. Fractions (0.65 ml) were adjusted to 1 ml (final volume) by adding 0.33 ml of 30% taurodeoxycholate and 0.02 ml Buffer A before mixing with 2 ml of Dole reagent (78:20:2; 2-propanol:heptane:water) and 1 ml of heptane. The samples were vortexed and spun in a table-top centrifuge for 10 min (3000 × g). The heptane phase (upper) containing lipids was saved for the thin-layer chromatography plates. The heptane phase was dried under N2 and suspended in 50 μl of the solvent system (80:20:1; petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid). Pure cholesterol and pure cholestenone were dissolved in the solvent system and used as standards (5 μg/spot). Lipids were visualized by charring with sulfuric acid-dichromate and heating at 180°C for 10 min. Unlabeled cholesterol and cholestenone were added to each fraction to facilitate visualization. The appropriate spots were scraped and the amount of radiation quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The caveolae were isolated as described previously (28Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Google Scholar) and modified (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1169-1177Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4°C. A plasma membrane fraction was first prepared from 10 100-mm dishes or T-75 flasks of confluent tissue culture cells (8-10 mg of total protein). A post-nuclear supernatant fraction (∼4 mg of total protein) was layered on the top of 23 ml of 30% Percoll in Buffer A, and centrifuged at 84,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti 60 rotor. The cytosol corresponded to the top two fractions of the Percoll gradient, the plasma membrane was a 1-ml fraction (a visible band) taken ∼5.7 cm from the bottom of the centrifuge bottle, and the internal membrane fraction was the bottom 21 1-ml fractions in the gradient. The plasma membrane, which contained ∼0.6 mg of protein, was collected with a Pasteur pipette, adjusted to 2.0 ml with Buffer A and placed in a Sorvall TH641 centrifuge tube on ice. The membrane was sonicated before mixing with 1.84 ml of Buffer C and 0.16 ml of Buffer A (final OptiPrep concentration, 23%) in the bottom of the same TH641 tube. A linear 20-10% OptiPrep gradient (prepared by diluting Buffer C with Buffer A) was poured on top of the sample and then centrifuged at 52,000 × g, 90 min in a Sorvall TH641 swinging bucket rotor. Fourteen fractions were collected from this first OptiPrep gradient. The top seven fractions contain the bulk of the caveolae membrane markers but very little protein, while the bottom seven fractions contain low concentrations of caveolae markers but the bulk of the membrane protein (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1169-1177Google Scholar). Caveolae were prepared from the top seven fractions of the first OptiPrep gradient as described previously (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1169-1177Google Scholar). Cells that had been preincubated for 3 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide were washed extensively in PBS and subjected to the indicated treatments, all in the presence of cycloheximide. At the end of the treatments, cells were fractionated as described above. The appropriate samples were incubated with 300 μg of trypsin or trypsin plus 0.5% SDS for 30 min on ice. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (300 μg) was then added before caveolin was immunoprecipitated. Protein A-Sepharose beads were first blocked by incubating them for 4 h at 4°C with human fibroblast cell lysate (200 μg/ml) plus 30 mg/ml BSA in Buffer E. Blocked beads were used to preclear each experimental fraction after it had been adjusted to 1% Triton X-100 and 60 mM octylglucoside. Precleared fractions were then incubated for 19 h at 4°C with a 1:400 dilution of anti-caveolin monoclonal antibody before adding blocked, Protein A-Sepharose beads and incubating an additional 2 h at 4°C. Beads were removed by centrifugation, dissolved in Buffer F (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and proteins separated by electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitated caveolin was detected by immunoblots with a polyclonal anti-caveolin IgG. The [3H]folic acid internalization assay was carried out as described previously (31Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 929-938Google Scholar). MA104 cells grown for 5 days in low folate medium were washed with PBS and then subjected to the indicated experimental treatments. All L1210-JF cells were grown without serum for 18 h in folate-free medium before incubation in the presence of 5 nM [3H]folic acid for 1 h at 37°C. After treatment the cells were chilled on ice for 20 min and washed twice with cold PBS. Surface-bound folate corresponded to the amount of [3H]folic acid released when cells were incubated on ice for 30 s in the presence of acid saline (0.15 M NaCl, adjusted to pH 3.0 with glacial acetic acid). Internalized folate was the amount of [3H]folic acid remaining associated with the acid-saline-treated cells. The latter was collected by adding 0.1 N NaOH to the flask to dissolve the cells. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using a Tri-carb 1900A liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instruments Co., Downers Grove, IL). Nonspecific binding, which was measured by adding 100-fold excess unlabeled folic acid, was less than 5% of specific binding. A full-length human caveolin cDNA was subcloned into pJB20 vector using EcoRI sites. This vector contains an SV40 promoter and a neomycin-selectable marker. Twenty-four hours before transfection, ∼106 cells were seeded per 100-mm dish. On the day of transfection, 5 μg of plasmid DNA (either vector alone or vector with full-length insert) was diluted in 200 μl of serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. In a separate tube, 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was diluted in 200 μl of serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. The diluted DNA and the LipofectAMINE were then gently mixed and incubated at 25°C for 30 min. After the incubation, 6 ml of serum-free Ham's F-12 medium was added to the DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture, mixed, then placed onto cells that had been rinsed with serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 37°C. Without washing, 3.6 ml of Ham's F-12 medium containing 20% serum was added. The cells were grown for 24 h. The medium was removed, and Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% serum and 1.5 mg/ml Geneticin was added. Selected cells were grown under constant selection in medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin. Samples were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and washed in acetone. Pellets were suspended in Buffer F containing 1.2%β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95°C for 3 min before being loaded onto gels. Samples that were immunoblotted with anti-folate receptor IgG did not contain β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The separated proteins were then transferred to nylon. The nylon was blocked in Buffer D that contained 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in Buffer D that contained 1% dry milk and incubated with the nylon samples for 1 h at room temperature. The nylon was washed four times, 10 min each in Buffer D + 1% dry milk. The second antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, or rabbit anti-goat IgG all conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) was diluted 1/30,000 in Buffer D + 1% dry milk and incubated with the nylon for 1 h at room temperature. The nylon was then washed and the bands visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Each experiment was conducted at least three times. Although the absolute numbers varied between experiments, the results were the same. Representative experiments are shown. For the quantification of radiation in the OptiPrep gradients, 50 μl from each fraction was measured. Each fractionation experiment was conducted at least four times with similar results. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). A 100-μl sample of each gradient fraction was mixed with 5 ml of diluted (1:4) Bradford reagent and the absorbance measured at 595 nm. OptiPrep interfered with other standard protein determination methods including the micro-Bradford assay. For ultrastructural analysis, cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812. Sections were stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate before viewing with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. Quantitative analysis of progesterone-treated cells was carried out by direct quantification of randomly photographed EM negatives. Caveolae in L1210-JF cells were quantified directly in the electron microscope by counting the number of cells that had caveolae. Each “cell” corresponds to the portion of the cell captured within individual squares of the EM grid. Previous measurements of caveolae cholesterol were made on detergent-resistant caveolae separated from soluble plasma membrane by sucrose gradient centrifugation (12Smart E.J. Ying Y.-U. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Google Scholar). In the current study we used a new detergent-free method of purification that retains resident molecules removed by detergents (28Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Google Scholar). In addition we made measurements on both MA104 cells and normal human fibroblasts (Table I). Cells were incubated overnight in the presence of [3H]acetate before the [3H]cholesterol content of different fractions was measured. Most of the labeled cholesterol was in the plasma membrane (∼80% for fibroblasts and ∼92% for MA104 cells). A substantial portion of this cholesterol was in the caveolae fraction (16% for fibroblasts and 21% for MA104 cells). When normalized for the amount of protein, caveolae were significantly enriched in cholesterol relative to the remainder of the plasma membrane (3.18-fold for fibroblasts and 4.16-fold for MA104 cells).Table ISubcellular cholesterol profileCell typeFractionsProteinCholesterol × 10−5Chol/mg proteinMembrane cholesterolEnrichmentmgdpmdpm%-foldNormal Human FibroblastPNS3.21490466Cyto2.617.86.8IM0.31219706PM0.2712004444NCM0.2310604608CM0.0141981414216.53.18MA104 cellPNS4.21800428Cyto3.46.61.9IM0.3682277PM0.3516704771NCM0.3313304030CM0.01835719833214.16 Open table in a new tab Cholesterol synthesized at 14°C is largely retained in the ER (16Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Google Scholar). Shifting the temperature to 37°C allows this cholesterol to migrate to the cell surface. To see if caveolae in MA104 cells were involved in transport of newly synthesized cholesterol, we incubated cells in the presence of [3H]acetate for 1 h at 14°C before adding excess unlabeled acetate and shifting the temperature to 37°C for various times. We measured the amount of radiolabeled cholesterol in the plasma membrane, non-caveolae, and caveolae fractions (Fig. 1A). The pattern of transport was similar in human fibroblasts (data not shown). A small amount of labeled cholesterol was in the plasma membrane (▵) at the end of the pulse but all of this cholesterol was in the caveolae fraction (□). During the first 10 min at 37°C, most of the labeled membrane cholesterol was in the caveolae fraction (compare ▵ with □). The level of label in the caveolae fraction peaked at 10-20 min and then declined while the amount in the non-caveolae fraction steadily increased after 10 min (∘). Membrane and non-caveolae membrane cholesterol reached a plateau as the amount in the caveolae fraction declined to zero. Therefore, newly synthesized cholesterol appears at the cell surface first in caveolae and then in non-caveolae membrane. Another way of looking at the dynamics of caveolae cholesterol is to uniformly label the plasma membrane cholesterol pool before removing the label and measuring the amount of labeled cholesterol in the various fractions during a chase period (Fig. 1B). MA104 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of [3H]acetate at 37°C, washed, and then chased for the indicated times. Initially we found ∼400 × 105 dpm of [3H]cholesterol in the caveolae fraction (□). During the chase period, the amount of label declined to zero and a corresponding amount disappeared from the plasma membrane (▵). The labeled cholesterol pool in non-caveolae membrane remained unchanged. The loss of [3H]cholesterol from the caveolae fraction, either during a pulse-chase (A) or a chase (B), suggests cholesterol flows from the ER through caveolae on its way to the surrounding membrane. Progesterone interrupts two-way traffic of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and internal membranes (17Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Google Scholar). It also inhibits cholesterol synthesis. If cholesterol movement to the plasma membrane involves caveolae, then progesterone should block the appearance of radiolabeled cholesterol in this fraction. We labeled the cholesterol pool by culturing MA104 cells for 24 h in the presence of [3H]acetate (Fig. 2A). Progesterone was added to the dish without removing the [3H]acetate and the cells further incubated for various times before preparing cell fractions. The presence of progesterone caused a rapid decline in the level of [3H]cholesterol in the caveolae fraction (□). The plasma membrane fraction (▵) also lost [3H]cholesterol during the incubation, while the non-caveolae membrane (∘) did not change. The effect of progesterone further indicates cholesterol first appears in caveolae after leaving the ER. Cholesterol returned to caveolae after progesterone was removed (Fig. 2B). Uniformly labeled MA104 cells were incubated in the presence of progesterone for 1 h. The progesterone was removed, and either caveolae fractions were prepared immediately (0 min) or the cells were incubated an additional 1 h (60 min) in the presence (striped bar) or absence (solid bar) of 100 μM compactin before caveolae were isolated. The amount of [3H]cholesterol in the caveolae fraction (solid bar) rose from 0 to 311 × 105 dpm within 60 min after progesterone was removed. The presence of compactin completely blocked the appearance of radiolabeled cholesterol (60 min, striped bar), indicating a requirement for new cholesterol biosynthesis. This suggests that [3H]cholesterol does not accumulate in internal membranes during the exposure to progesterone, nor does non-caveolae [3H]cholesterol from contiguous plasma membrane migrate back into caveolae when transport to the cell surface is blocked. Previously we found that internalization of folate by caveolae is reduced in cells starved of cholesterol (7Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Google Scholar). This treatment, however, has too many side effects to ever be a useful experimental tool for studying caveolae function. Progesterone should have a similar effect to cholesterol depletion with the advantage of being rapid and reversible (Fig. 3). MA104 cells were incubated in the presents of different concentrations of progesterone for 1 h at 37°C before [3H]folic acid was added to the dish and the cells further incubated for 1 h (A). At the end of the incubation, the amount of internal (□) and external (∘) bound [3H]folic acid was measured (24Kamen B.A. Wang M.-T. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13602-13609Google Scholar). In the absence of any progesterone, the cells had equal amounts of internal and external bound [3H]folic acid, indicating normal caveolae function. As little as 10 μg/ml progesterone caused a dramatic relocation of the internal receptor pool (□) to the external receptor pool (∘). Higher concentrations of progesterone had similar effects. Progesterone, therefore, appears to prevent folate receptor internalization. Inhibition by progesterone occurred coordinately with the loss of cholesterol from caveolae (Fig. 3B). Cells were incubated in the presence of [3H]folic acid at 37°C for 1 h to label both internal and external receptors (B). Progesterone (10 μg/ml) was then added to the dish and the cells further incubated for the indicated time. Within 20 min, most of the internal receptors (□) became exposed at the cell surface (∘), which matches closely the time it takes for cholesterol to leave the caveolae fraction (Fig. 1B). In other experiments (data not shown), we found that it took 60-90 min for the receptor ratio to returned to normal after progesterone was removed. Lowering the cholesterol content of caveolae can have two effects: (a) prevention of caveolae internalization along with reducing the number of invaginated caveolae (7Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Google Scholar) and (b) unclustering of folate receptors (6Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J.

We used fibroblasts to determine if progesterone changed the number of invaginated caveolae because these cells respond to progesterone exactly the same as MA104 cells (data not shown). Cells were prepared for electron microscopy after they had been incubated in the presence or absence of progesterone for 1 h (Table II). Progesterone caused a 32-36% decline in the number of invaginated caveolae. We then used the caveolae isolation procedure to assess how progesterone affected the surface distribution of the folate receptor (Fig. 4). Plasma membranes were isolated from untreated cells, sonicated, and separated on the first OptiPrep gradient (Control). Immunoblots of total protein in each fraction showed most of the folate receptor to be in the light membrane fractions (1Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J.

https://openalex.org/W1989300612,The western equatorial Pacific warm pool is subject to strong east-west migrations on interannual time scales in phase with the Southern Oscillation Index. The dominance of surface zonal advection in this migration is demonstrated with four different current data sets and three ocean models. The eastward advection of warm and less saline water from the western Pacific together with the westward advection of cold and more saline water from the central-eastern Pacific induces a convergence of water masses at the eastern edge of the warm pool and a well-defined salinity front. The location of this convergence is zonally displaced in association with El Niño-La Niña wind-driven surface current variations. These advective processes and water-mass convergences have significant implications for understanding and simulating coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
https://openalex.org/W2036443538,"Recently we have identified angiostatin, an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor of 38 kDa which specifically blocks the growth of endothelial cells (O'Reilly, M. S., Holmgren, L., Shing, Y., Chen, C., Rosenthal, R. A., Moses, M., Lane, W. S., Cao, Y., Sage, E. H., and Folkman, J. (1994) Cell 79, 315-328; Folkman, J. (1995) Nat. Med. 1, 27-31). Angiostatin was shown to represent an internal fragment of plasminogen containing the first four kringle structures. We now report on the inhibitory effects of individual or combined kringle structures of angiostatin on capillary endothelial cell proliferation. Recombinant kringle 1 and kringle 3 exhibit potent inhibitory activity with half-maximal concentrations (ED50) of 320 nM and 460 nM, respectively. Also, recombinant kringle 2 displays a significant inhibition, although decreased compared with both kringle 1 and kringle 3. In contrast, kringle 4 is an ineffective inhibitor of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. Among the tandem kringle arrays, the recombinant kringle 2-3 fragment exerts inhibitory activity similar to kringle 2 alone. However, relative to kringle 2-3, a marked enhancement in inhibition is observed when individual kringle 2 and kringle 3 are added together to endothelial cells. This implies that it is necessary to open the cystine bridge between kringle 2 and kringle 3 to obtain the maximal inhibitory effect of kringle 2-3. An increased (<2-fold) inhibitory activity is observed for the kringle 1-3 fragment (ED50 = 70 nM) compared with kringle 1-4 (ED50 = 135 nM). These data indicate that the anti-proliferative activity of angiostatin on endothelial cells is shared by kringle 1, kringle 2, and kringle 3, but probably not by kringle 4 and that more potent inhibition results when kringle 4 is removed from angiostatin. Thus, in view of the variable lysine affinity of the homologous domains, it would appear that lysine binding capability does not correlate with the relative inhibitory effects of the kringle-containing constructs. However, as we also demonstrate, appropriate folding of kringle structures is essential for angiostatin to maintain its full anti-endothelial activity.

Observations of the lunar south pole yield a same-sense polarization enhancement around beta = 0. Analysis shows that the observed enhancement is localized to the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole. Radar observations of periodically solar-illuminated lunar surfaces, including the north pole, yielded no such enhancement. A probable explanation for these differences is the presence of low-loss volume scatterers, such as water ice, in the permanently shadowed region at the south pole."

The present study shows that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), a mitogen that promotes the propagation of cancers through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, increases the expression of mRNA for VEGF and production of VEGF protein by COLO 205 colon carcinoma cells. IGF-I also induces expression of VEGF mRNA in SW620, LSLiM6, and HCT15 colon carcinoma cells showing that this is a common response to IGF-I. Whereas IGF-I induced VEGF mRNA in each cell line examined (2.3-12-fold), it induced proliferation only in COLO 205 and LSLiM6 cells. Thus, the proliferative response induced by IGF-I and its ability to induce VEGF occur through distinguishable mechanisms. IGF-I increases the cellular content of VEGF mRNA by increasing the rate of transcription (5-fold after 4 h) and also by increasing the half-life of VEGF mRNA (0.6 ± 0.07 h in control cells to 2.0 ± 0.37 h in IGF-I-treated cells). Monoclonal antibody (αIR3) directed against the type 1 IGF receptor significantly attenuated the ability of IGF-I to promote expression of VEGF mRNA. Interestingly, by itself αIR3 acted as a weak agonist and induced a modest increase in the cellular content of VEGF mRNA. αIR3 also promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit of the IGF-I receptor, and the magnitude of this response was comparable with that induced by IGF-I. These observations point to a nonlinear relationship between activation of the IGF-I receptor and induction of VEGF mRNA. Thus, in addition to its direct, growth stimulatory effect on transformed cells, IGF-I induces the expression of VEGF which can promote the progression of cancer by regulating the development of new blood vessels.

We now present evidence that growth factor activation of FG cells leads to induction of cell surface uPA·uPAR that appears to be required for the αvβ5-dependent FG cell motility on vitronectin. The specificity of this migration response is demonstrated, since αvβ3 or α2β1-directed migration of these cells is independent of uPA·uPAR expression.

Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle washing, and remaining adherent cells were quantified using a colorimetric cell titer assay (CellTiter 96; Promega, Madison, WI). Each data point was calculated from assays performed in triplicate. Nonspecific adhesion as determined by attachment to BSA-coated wells has been subtracted. Cell migration assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers with a 6.5-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness, porous (8.0 μm) polycarbonate membrane separating the two chambers (Transwell®; Costar, Cambridge, MA). The under surface of the membrane was coated with vitronectin or collagen (10 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 for 2 h at 37°C. Excess ligand was removed, and the lower chamber was filled with 0.5 ml of FBM-BSA. Cells were harvested as for the adhesion assay, resuspended at 106 cells/ml in FBM-BSA, stimulated with PMA (5 ng/ml) for 1 h, and washed, or cells were stimulated with TGF-α (100 ng/ml) in 100 μl FBM-BSA and allowed to migrate for various times at 37°C in 6% CO2. Monoclonal antibodies to various integrins (50 μg/ml) or to uPAR (50 μg/ml) as well as other antibodies or reagents tested in migration assays were added to both upper and lower chambers and incubated with the cells for the entire migration period. At the end of the assay, the upper surface of the membrane was wiped with a cotton-tipped applicator to remove nonmigratory cells and the migrant cells on the under surface fixed and stained for 20 min with 1% crystal violet in 0.1 M borate, pH 9.0, and 2% ethanol. The number of stained cells/well was counted with an inverted microscope, or the dye was eluted with 10% acetic acid and its absorbance determined at 600 nm. Nonspecific or background migration was evaluated on BSA-coated membranes and subtracted from all data points. Each determination represents the average of three individual wells, and error bars represent the S.D. of the mean. FG cells were grown to 70-80% confluency in T75 flasks (10-15 × 106 cells/flask) with RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI for 20-24 h before stimulation with 5 ng/ml PMA or 100 ng/ml TGF-α for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 24 h. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA) on ice for 30 min, and isolated with a rubber policeman. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the amount of total protein was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Volumes corresponding to 50 μg of protein from total cell lysates were mixed with equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min under nonreducing conditions, electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were subsequently blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The filter strips were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with 2 μg/ml of either a polyclonal rabbit anti-uPAR (399R) or a mouse anti-uPA mAb (394). After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies (at a 1:3000 dilution) conjugated with peroxidase (Bio-Rad), washed several times in TBS-T, and analyzed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). Serum-starved FG cells were harvested as for the migration assay and were stimulated with 5 ng/ml PMA in FBM-BSA for 6 h in the presence or absence of mouse anti-uPAR mAb 3936 (50 μg/ml). Cells were then rinsed twice in ice-cold FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4), and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-uPAR (399R) or rabbit anti-uPA (389) at 10 μg/ml for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed three times with excess FACS buffer and then incubated with secondary antibody (FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG; Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) diluted 1:100 for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed and analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Cell analysis was gated on forward and size scatter intensities, and the results are presented as histograms. FG cells were serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation with 5 ng/ml PMA for 1, 4, 8, or 24 h. At each time point, spent culture medium and cell surface acid eluates were collected as described previously (27Stoppelli M.P. Tacchetti C. Cubellis M.V. Corti A. Hearing V.J. Cassani G. Appella E. Blasi F. Cell. 1986; 45: 675-684Google Scholar) and analyzed for the amount of secreted and surface-bound uPA antigen by an anti-uPA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). Cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI for 20-24 h before stimulation with 10 ng/ml PMA or 100 ng/ml TGF-α for 1, 4, 8, or 24 h. Total cellular RNA (10 μg) isolated from these cells was subjected to denaturing electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.45Google Scholar) and transferred to a GeneScreen membrane (DuPont NEN). Membranes were hybridized with either a uPA or a uPAR cDNA fragment labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (>3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) as described (29Virca G.D. Northemann W. Shiels B.R. Widera G. Broome S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 370-371Google Scholar). To control for variations in RNA loadings, membranes were rehybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA fragment from the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Membranes were exposed to Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80°C. The intensity of hybridization signals was determined directly using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Exposure of cells to growth factors or phorbol esters is known to promote their migration on extracellular matrix proteins (12Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Google Scholar, 30Matthay M.A. Thiery J.P. Lafont F. Stampfer M.F. Boyer B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 869-878Google Scholar). We recently showed that induction of αvβ5-dependent FG pancreatic carcinoma cell migration on vitronectin but not adhesion on this substrate requires activation of protein kinase C with either PMA or growth factors (12Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Google Scholar) and that this event requires gene transcription and protein synthesis (14Yebra M. Filardo E.J. Bayna E.M. Kawahara E. Becker J.C. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 841-850Google Scholar). However, FG cell motility on collagen was constitutive and mediated by integrin α2β1, suggesting the induction of αvβ5-directed cell motility was specific (12Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Google Scholar). Induction of cell invasive behavior has been linked to expression of uPA·uPAR on the cell surface (9Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2437-2445Google Scholar, 10Crowley C.W. Cohen R.L. Lucas B.K. Liu G. Shuman M.A. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5021-5025Google Scholar, 11Stahl A. Mueller B.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3066-3071Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether activation of FG cell migration on vitronectin was associated with the expression of uPA and uPAR on these cells. As shown in Fig. 1, stimulation of serum-starved FG cells with either PMA or TGF-α promoted cell motility toward vitronectin within 4-6 h and induced a similar time-dependent increase in uPA mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). PMA treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in the steady-state levels of uPA mRNA. Maximal levels of uPA mRNA were observed at 4 h, and levels remained elevated at 24 h. Following TGF-α treatment, the steady-state levels of uPA mRNA increased after 1 h and remained elevated between 1 and 24 h. Both PMA and TGF-α increased the steady-state levels of uPAR mRNA (Fig. 2B) with kinetics similar to those observed for uPA mRNA. Maximal levels of uPAR mRNA were observed 4 h after PMA treatment and remained elevated at 24 h. In TGF-α-treated cells, maximal levels of uPAR mRNA were observed at 1 h and remained elevated through 24 h.Fig. 2Kinetics of uPA and uPAR induction in FG cells. Cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 24 h prior to stimulation with either 10 ng/ml PMA or 100 ng/ml TGF-α for the indicated times. Total RNA was isolated, and uPA (A) or uPAR (B) mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. mRNA loadings were normalized by reprobing each Northern blot with a cDNA probe for the “housekeeping” gene, G3PDH. Hybridization signals were directly quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The relative levels of uPA and uPAR mRNA (in arbitrary units), corrected for differences in loading, are indicated under each lane. C, for Western blot analysis, total cell lysates (50 μg/lane) of cells with no addition or treated with 5 ng/ml PMA or 100 ng/ml TGF-α for the indicated times were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were visualized by ECL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) No cell-associated uPA or uPAR protein was detected by Western blotting in unstimulated cells or cells stimulated for 1 h with PMA. However, a high level of surface-bound uPA and uPAR protein was first detected at 4 h post-PMA stimulation (Fig. 2C) and remained elevated at 24 h. The kinetics of induction of uPA and uPAR proteins were similar to those observed for the induction of FG cell migration on vitronectin (Fig. 1). TGF-α stimulation of FG cells resulted in a similar but smaller increase in cell-bound uPA and uPAR protein levels that was first detected after 2 h and remained elevated at 24 h (Fig. 2C). In addition, activation of protein kinase C induced a time-dependent increase in both cell surface-associated uPA and uPA secreted into the cell-conditioned medium as measured by uPA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Secreted uPA steadily increased between 4 and 24 h post-PMA stimulation, whereas surface-bound uPA greatly increased between 4 and 8 h, reached a peak at 8 h, and remained elevated 24 h post-PMA stimulation (Fig. 3), in accordance with the time course of induction of uPAR protein observed above (Fig. 2C) and the motility of FG cells on vitronectin (Fig. 1). The observation that exposure of FG cells to PMA or TGF-α promoted uPA and uPAR expression and induced αvβ5-directed cell migration prompted us to examine whether these events were functionally related. Thus, we evaluated whether the binding of uPA to its receptor might contribute to the αvβ5-dependent FG cell motility on vitronectin. As shown in Fig. 4, inhibition of uPA binding to its receptor with a function-blocking monoclonal antibody to uPAR (mAb 3936) or by the addition of excess soluble uPAR results in a >50% inhibition of FG cell motility on vitronectin, a level of inhibition comparable with that obtained with the anti-αvβ5 mAb P1F6. In contrast, these reagents had no effect on FG cell motility on collagen, suggesting that α2β1-dependent migration of FG cells is not influenced by uPA or uPAR. Furthermore, when either anti-uPAR or soluble uPAR was used together with anti-αvβ5, the level of inhibition of migration was the same as that seen when either antagonist was used alone, suggesting a functional cooperation between αvβ5 and uPA·uPAR. In addition, we demonstrated by FACS analysis (Fig. 5) that when FG cells were stimulated with PMA in the presence of a function-blocking antibody to uPAR (mAb 3936, panel C), the levels of receptor-bound uPA, detected using a polyclonal anti-uPA antibody (389), were similar to the background levels observed in the unstimulated cells (panel A). These findings confirm that mAb 3936 strictly interferes with the binding of uPA to its receptor and suggest that both uPA and uPAR contribute to this αvβ5-mediated migration event.Fig. 5Anti-uPAR mAb 3936 interferes with uPA binding to PMA-stimulated FG cells. Cells were incubated for 6 h in medium alone (A), medium containing 5 ng/ml PMA (B), or medium containing both 5 ng/ml PMA and 50 μg/ml mAb 3936 (C). Cells were rinsed twice in FACS buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) and stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against either uPA (389, - - -) or uPAR (399R, −−). The cells were then rinsed and treated with an anti-rabbit IgG FITC-conjugated antibody and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer. Background fluorescence (····) represents cells treated with secondary antibody alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether uPA enzymatic activity was involved in FG cell migration, we examined the effects of the specific uPA inhibitors, PAI-1 and PAI-2, and an antibody that blocks uPA enzymatic activity (mAb 394) on this event. As shown in Fig. 6, both PMA- and TGF-α-induced migration to vitronectin are inhibited by PAI-1, PAI-2, and mAb 394, while in contrast, adhesion to vitronectin is only inhibited by PAI-1. In view of the findings by Wei et al. (31Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar) that uPA·uPAR can function as a vitronectin receptor, this is an important observation, since it clearly indicates that the induction of migration that follows the expression of uPA·uPAR is not just dependent upon the ability of uPA·uPAR to promote adhesion to vitronectin. The ability of PAI-1, but neither PAI-2 nor mAb 394, to inhibit adhesion likely reflects the fact that only PAI-1 can bind directly to vitronectin (32Kost C. Stüber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Google Scholar, 33Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar, 34Padmanabhan J. Sane D.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 829-834Google Scholar). Thus, PAI-1 bound to vitronectin may interfere with integrin ligation and/or uPA·uPAR binding. PAI-2 and the function-blocking anti-uPA mAb do not interfere with adhesion but probably abrogate migration via the inhibition of uPA·uPAR function. To examine whether the requirement for uPA enzymatic activity in cell migration to vitronectin is dependent on the generation of plasmin, we tested the plasmin-specific inhibitor, aprotinin, and the lysine analogue tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid has been shown to interfere with the binding of plasminogen to the cell surface and, therefore, prevent the generation of plasmin. Neither of these inhibitors had any effect on migration (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that internalization of active uPA is important to the migratory process, we incubated FG cells with recombinant receptor-associated protein, which inhibits uPA·uPAR·PAI interaction with LDL receptor-related protein, and observed that it had no effect on cell migration to vitronectin, although it was present during the entire duration of the migration assay. 2M. Yebra, G. C. N. Parry, S. Strömblad, N. Mackman, S. Rosenberg, B. M. Mueller, and D. A. Cheresh, unpublished observations. These results indicate that both uPA binding to its receptor and uPA activity, independently of plasmin generation, are required for αvβ5-directed FG cell migration on vitronectin but not FG cell migration on collagen (Fig. 6), an event mediated by integrin α2β1 on these cells (12Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Google Scholar, 19Leavesley D.I. Ferguson G.D. Wayner E.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1101-1107Google Scholar). As we have shown above, the surface expression and interaction of uPA with its receptor play a major role in the protein kinase C-inducible αvβ5-dependent cell motility on vitronectin. Therefore, we investigated whether migration mediated through another vitronectin receptor, αvβ3, also required uPA·uPAR interaction. For this purpose, we examined FG-B cell motility on vitronectin. FG-B cells are FG cells that have been transfected with the β3 integrin subunit and thereby express αvβ3, which facilitates constitutive migration on vitronectin (19Leavesley D.I. Ferguson G.D. Wayner E.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1101-1107Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, FG cells utilize uPA·uPAR, while FG-B cells migrate on vitronectin independently of uPA·uPAR expression. Specifically, anti-uPAR, or a 17-mer peptide (clone 20) that blocks uPA binding to uPAR (25Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7129-7133Google Scholar) blocked FG cell migration but did not significantly affect FG-B migration, while an antibody directed against αvβ3 (mAb LM609) effectively inhibits FG-B migration. Furthermore, we examined migration to vitronectin of two human melanoma cell lines, M21 and WM35, both of which constitutively express αvβ3 as their major vitronectin receptor. As shown in Fig. 7, C and D, both M21 and WM35 cells migrate to vitronectin in an αvβ3-dependent manner, since LM609 (anti-αvβ3) almost completely abrogated this event. In contrast, although both cell lines also express αvβ5 and uPAR, function-blocking antibodies to αvβ5 (P1F6) or to uPAR (3936) did not inhibit cell migration. Thus, uPA·uPAR selectively affects αvβ5-directed FG cell migration on vitronectin. Growth factors or chemokines influence cell migration, which contributes to wound healing, development, and tumor cell invasion. To this end, we previously demonstrated that αvβ5-mediated motility but not adhesion of carcinoma cells depends on prior exposure of cells to growth factors or phorbol esters (12Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127:"

https://openalex.org/W1993179214,"The small GTPase Rab2 is a resident of pre-Golgi intermediates and required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex (Tisdale, E. J., Bourne, J. R., Khosravi-Far, R., Der, C. J., and Balch, W. E. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 119, 749-761). The Rab2 protein, like all small GTPases, contains conserved GTP-binding domains as well as hypervariable carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal domains. While the role of the carboxyl terminus in specific membrane localization is well recognized, the potential role of the variable NH2 terminus remains to be clarified. To determine whether the NH2 terminus of Rab2 was required for its activity in vivo, a trans dominant mutant of Rab2 that inhibits ER to Golgi transport was progressively truncated and analyzed for its effect on vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein transport in a vaccinia-based transient expression system. Deletion of the first 14 amino-terminal residues resulted in the loss of the inhibitory properties of the mutant without affecting its post-translational processing or membrane association. To assess the potential role of the NH2 terminus in Rab2 function, a peptide corresponding to the first 13 amino acids following the initiator methionine was introduced into an in vitro assay that efficiently reconstitutes transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein from the ER to the Golgi stack. This peptide was a potent inhibitor of transport. Biochemical and morphological studies revealed that the peptide strongly interfered with assembly of pre-Golgi intermediates which mediate segregation of anterograde and retrograde transported proteins en route to the Golgi.

The combined results suggest that the NH2 terminus of Rab2 is required for its function and for direct interaction with components of the transport machinery involved in the maturation of pre-Golgi intermediates. The Rab family of small GTPases includes more than 30 members that regulate vesicular traffic between specific compartments of the endocytic and exocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells (1Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Google Scholar, 2Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 5: 613-620Google Scholar). Rab proteins, like other members of the Ras superfamily, contain four highly conserved sequence motifs required for guanine nucleotide binding (3Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Google Scholar). In order for Rab proteins to regulate distinct transport events, non-conserved regions must confer unique function. The most divergent regions of Rab proteins are located at their amino and carboxyl termini. The function of the carboxyl terminus has been extensively characterized. Cysteine residues found at the COOH terminus of all Rab proteins are post-translationally processed by the addition of geranylgeranyl lipids, a modification essential for membrane association and function (4Casey P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1-23Google Scholar). Moreover, the hypervariable region composed of the terminal ∼30 amino acids dictates localization of Rab proteins to specific endocytic and exocytic compartments (5Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. Steizer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Google Scholar, 6Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Google Scholar). In contrast to the well characterized role of the carboxyl terminus in small GTPase function, few studies have focused on the potential role(s) of the hypervariable amino termini found in different Rab proteins. Sequence alignments of Rab family members show that the NH2 termini are variable in length. This has led to the suggestion that these extensions, at least in some cases, participate in specific protein interactions. In support of this idea, truncation of the NH2-terminal domain of Rab5 prevents early endosome fusion (7Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, peptide mimetics to this region also block the fusion of endosomes in an in vitro assay that reconstitutes this event (7Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Google Scholar). A conserved lysine found in the amino terminus of most Rab proteins has also been reported to be essential for prenylation of Rab5 by Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II (8Sanford J.C. Pan Y. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 71-85Google Scholar). Although these two studies ascribe two distinct roles for the NH2 terminus, both implicate a functional requirement for the NH2 terminus in Rab activity. The Rab2 protein is a resident of pre-Golgi intermediates (9Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Google Scholar), which consist of clusters of small vesicles and tubules (termed vesicular-tubular clusters or VTCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VTCvesicular tubular clusterVSV-Gvesicular stomatitis virusendo Hendoglycosidase Hendo Dendoglycosidase DERendoplasmic reticulumNRKnormal rat kidneyCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).

Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Google Scholar), and participate in the segregation of anterograde and retrograde transported protein following export from the ER (11Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Google Scholar). Although the function of Rab2 is unknown, we have previously demonstrated that it is required for protein traffic between the ER and the Golgi complex (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar). A mutation in the nucleotide binding domain that restricts Rab2 to the GTP-bound form (Rab2(Q65L)) or a mutation that causes a high exchange rate (Rab2(N119I)) resulted in proteins that were potent inhibitors of ER to Golgi transport when transiently expressed in vivo. vesicular tubular cluster vesicular stomatitis virus endoglycosidase H endoglycosidase D endoplasmic reticulum normal rat kidney Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). To investigate the biochemical requirement for Rab2 in protein transport through the early secretory pathway, we have now focused on a region of the amino terminus (amino acids 1-14) to assess its potential role in Rab2 function. In vivo, we find that the amino terminus is critical to sustain the inhibitory phenotype of the Rab2(N119I) mutant. Moreover, a peptide synthesized to the first 13 amino acids of Rab2 following the initiating methionine was found to be a potent and specific inhibitor of protein transport using an assay that reconstitutes ER to Golgi traffic in vitro. Combined biochemical and morphological studies used to map the site of peptide inhibition revealed that the Rab2 peptide specifically arrests transport at an early stage of the secretory pathway, preventing the normal flow of cargo through VTCs. These results demonstrate that the NH2 terminus of Rab2 is required for its activity and for interaction with as yet unidentified components which function in the assembly and maturation of VTCs. A monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxyl terminus of VSV-G (P5D4) was generously provided by T. Kreis (13Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Google Scholar). Antiserum to p58 was a gift of J. Saraste (14Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2021-2029Google Scholar). The polyclonal serum to α-1,2-mannosidase II was kindly provided by M. Farquhar (University of California, San Diego, CA). Endoglycosidase H (endo H) was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody specific for Rab2 (1C5B) was prepared from a hybridoma cell line generated against recombinant Rab2 protein. Endoglycosidase D was prepared from the culture supernatant of Diplococcus pneumoniae (15Glasgow L.R. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8615-8623Google Scholar). Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was acquired from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Peptides were synthesized at The Scripps Research Institute Protein/DNA Core Facility. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and normal rat kidney (NRK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 15B cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Rab2 expression constructs were generated from human Rab2 cDNA sequences (16Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12394-12401Google Scholar) provided by M. Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). All Rab sequences were introduced into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET3a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression from the T7 promoter (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). NH2-terminal deletions of Rab2 and Rab2(N119I) were generated by PCR using 5′ oligonucleotide primers, which included an NdeI site and sequence complementary to Rab2 that introduced a start codon at the respective deletion site: Δ11, primer 5′-GCAAACATATGGGCGACACAGGTG-3′; Δ14, primer 5′-GCAAACATATGGGTGTTGGTAAATCATGC-3′ in tandem with a 3′ antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to wild type Rab2, 5′-CCGCGGATCCTCAACAGCAGCCGCCCC-3′. The ΔCC mutant was generated by PCR using 5′ sense wild type oligonucleotide and the 3′ primer 5′-CCGCGGATCCCTGCCGCCCCCAGCCTGCTG-3′. All mutated Rab sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The transient expression of the Rab2 mutant proteins was as described previously (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (5 × 105/35-mm dish) were infected with a vaccinia T7 RNA polymerase recombinant virus (vTF7-3) (18Fuerst T.T. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Google Scholar) for 30 min and then cotransfected with 5 μg of plasmid encoding for VSV-G protein (pAR-G) and 5 μg of pET-Rab plasmid DNA encoding for a mutated Rab protein as described above, which had been premixed in TransfectACE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 6 h post-transfection, the medium was removed and the cells incubated for 15 min in methionine-free minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), biosynthetically labeled for 10 min with 20 μCi of Tran35S-label (specific activity 1192 Ci/mmol) (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA), then chased for 1 h in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. The chase was terminated by the addition of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (Sigma) and the lysate precleared for 30 min with 50 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem Corp.). The soluble fraction was incubated overnight at 4°C with a monoclonal antibody to VSV-G (clone 8G5) and Pansorbin. Immune precipitates were washed three times with 10 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, boiled, then centrifuged. To the supernatant was added 30 μl of 0.2 M citrate (pH 5.5) and 5 μl of endo H (1 unit/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) and the samples digested overnight at 37°C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6.75% gels according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The gel was dried, and quantitation of the various oligosaccharide processing intermediates of VSV-G protein was accomplished using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). NRK or CHO clone 15B cells were infected for 4 h with the temperature-sensitive VSV strain ts045, then biosynthetically labeled with 100 μCi of Tran35S-label for 10 min at the restrictive temperature (39.5°C) to accumulate VSV-G mutant in the ER. The cells were then perforated by swelling and scraping and employed in the ER to cis/medial Golgi transport assay as described (20Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Google Scholar, 21Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Google Scholar). Briefly, transport reactions were performed in a final volume of 40 μl in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2) 75 mM KOAc, 2.5 mM MgOAc, 5 mM EGTA, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (100 μM UDP-galactose and 100 μM CMP-sialic acid were added where indicated under “Results”), an ATP-regenerating system (1 mM ATP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, and 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase), 5 μl of rat liver cytosol (25-30 μg/ml protein in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 125 mM KOAc), and 5 μl of semi-intact cells (∼5 × 107 cells/ml) in 50 mM Hepes-KOH, 90 mM KOAc (pH 7.2). To the assay was added the respective peptide as described under “Results.” The reactions were preincubated on ice for 30 min, and subsequently incubated for 90 min at 32°C and transferred to ice to terminate transport; the membranes were then pelleted, solubilized in buffer, and digested with endo H or endoglycosidase D (endo D). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the fraction of VSV-G protein processed to the endo H-resistant or endo D-sensitive forms quantitated by the PhosphorImager. NRK cells plated on coverslips were infected with ts045 at 39.5°C for 2-3 h, then shifted to ice and permeabilized with digitonin (20 μg/ml) as outlined previously (22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Google Scholar). Coverslips containing the permeabilized cells were inverted and placed in tissue culture wells containing the transport mixture described above, preincubated on ice for 15 min with or without peptide, and then incubated for 80 min at 15°C or 20 min at 32°C. To terminate transport, the cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde, PBS for 10 min on ice. Fixation was quenched with 10 mM ammonium chloride in PBS for 10 min, and the cells were then blocked in PBS with 5% normal goat serum for 10 min at room temperature. To detect intracellular VSV-G, cells were re-permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS/normal goat serum for 10 min, washed with PBS, then incubated for 30 min with a monoclonal antibody specific for the VSV-G protein cytoplasmic tail (P5D4) (13Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were co-stained with antibody to α-1,2-mannosidase ll, a marker for the cis/medial Golgi compartments (23Velasco A. Henricks L. Moreman K.W. Tulsiani D.R.P. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Google Scholar) or to p58, a marker for pre-Golgi intermediates (14Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2021-2029Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with PBS, costained for 30 min with Texas Red goat anti-mouse and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit antibody, mounted, and viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert Fluorescence microscope. HeLa cells were vaccinia infected/transfected with the Rab mutants as described above, then lysed and subjected to partitioning with pre-cycled Triton X-114 (Sigma) as described (24Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar). The aqueous and detergent-rich phases were precipitated with seven volumes of acetone for 1 h at −20°C. After centrifugation, the resulting pellets were resuspended in sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) in 25 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with a monoclonal antibody to Rab2 (1C5B) washed, further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Pierce), and then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham). Quantitation of Rab2 protein was performed by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To study the effects of mutant forms of Rab2 on vesicular traffic in vivo, we employed a transient expression system (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar, 18Fuerst T.T. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Google Scholar) in which cells were co-transfected with plasmids that encode wild-type or mutant Rab, and a plasmid that encodes the cargo molecule VSV-G (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar). ER to Golgi transport is measured by following the processing of VSV-G to endo H-resistant forms during transport through compartments of the Golgi stack (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar, 21Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Google Scholar, 22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that a mutation in the GTP-binding domain of Rab2 (Rab2(N119I)) resulted in a protein that potently inhibited transport of VSV-G between the ER and the Golgi complex (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar). If the NH2 terminus contains critical residues for Rab2 function, deletion of these residues would eliminate the dominant inhibitory phenotype of the mutant. Overexpression of wild-type Rab2 caused a moderate decrease (25%) in the processing of VSV-G to endo H-resistant forms (Fig. 1A, lane b). A similar partial decrease in protein transport through late Golgi compartments has been observed in cells that overexpress wild-type Rab6 (25Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Google Scholar). In contrast, cells that express amino-terminal truncated wild-type Rab2 proteins missing 11 (Fig. 1A, lane c) and 14 (Fig. 1A, lane d) residues transported VSV-G to the same extent as that observed in the control (Fig. 1A, lane a). Analogous NH2-terminal deletions of the Rab2(N119I) mutant, which inhibits ER to Golgi transport (Fig. 1B) (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar), led to a progressive loss in the ability of this mutant to arrest vesicular traffic (Fig. 1B, lanes c and d). These results suggest that the deleted amino acids are necessary for both wild-type Rab2 and Rab2(N119I) function. A critical lysine residue found in the NH2 terminus of Rab5 and other Rab proteins (see Table II) has been reported to be essential for prenylation (8Sanford J.C. Pan Y. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 71-85Google Scholar). We were concerned with the trivial possibility that NH2-terminal truncated forms of Rab2 which lack this motif could not be modified at their COOH-terminal cysteine residues by Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II during transient expression in vivo and were therefore inactive. For example, overexpression of wild-type Rab2(ΔCC) (Fig. 1A, lane e) or Rab2(N119I-ΔCC) (Fig. 1B, lane e) had no effect on transport of VSV-G. When we examined the effect of removal of the terminal CC residues from Rab2(Δ14) (Fig. 1A, lane f) or the partial inhibitor Rab2(N119I-Δ14) (Fig. 1B, lane f), both completely lost their inhibitory activity. These results suggest that NH2-terminal truncated forms of Rab2 are normally prenylated. To establish this point, HeLa cells that overexpress wild-type or mutant Rab2 protein were partitioned with Triton X-114, and the distribution of Rab2 in the two phases analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The endogenous pool of Rab2 is predominantly membrane-associated (78%) and found in the detergent-rich phase (Table I). The phase separation of transiently expressed wild-type Rab2 showed that the protein distributes with 53% in the detergent phase (membrane-associated) and 47% in the aqueous phase (cytosolic) (Table I). The increase in the distribution of Rab2 to the cytosolic pool was presumably due to incomplete prenylation of Rab2 generated under conditions of overexpression. Rab2 wild-type mutants that lacked either 11 or 14 amino-terminal residues partitioned between the phases in a manner comparable with that of the overexpressed wild-type protein (Table I). In contrast, the Rab2(ΔCC) protein was recovered predominantly (>95%) with the aqueous phase (Table I), which demonstrates that prenylation of Rab2 is essential for it to partition to the detergent phase. Similar experiments were performed with the Rab2(N119I) proteins. Both the Rab2(N119I) and its NH2-terminal truncated mutants distributed between the two phases in a manner comparable with that of the overexpressed wild-type protein, whereas >95% of Rab2(N119I-ΔCC) was found in the aqueous phase (Table I). These in vivo data provide evidence that the reduced inhibitory activity of the amino-terminal deletion mutants is not a result of a prenylation defect.Table II.Peptides synthesized for in vitro assayRab proteinN-terminal alignmentaThe N-terminal regions of Rab proteins are aligned as described (9).PeptideRab1B————–MNPEYDYLFKLLLIGD—NPEYDYLFKLLLIGDRab27-mer—————-MAYAYLFKYIIIGD—AYAYLFK13-merAYAYLFKYIIIGDRandomAYKAGYIDLYIFIRab3AbUnderline indicates peptide used in present studies.MASATDSRYGQKESSDQNFDYMFKILIIGN—ASATDSRYGQKRab5bUnderline indicates peptide used in present studies.—MANRGATRPNGPNTGNKICQFKLVLLGEcThe lysine residue critical for prenylation of Rab5 is shown in bold.—ANRGATRPNGPNTGNKdThe N-terminal peptide inhibits endosome fusion (7).a The N-terminal regions of Rab proteins are aligned as described (9Chavrier P.

This assay utilizes tsO45 VSV-G, a protein that has a thermoreversible defect in export from the ER. Cells were infected for 4 h at the restrictive temperature (39.5°C) to retain VSV-G exclusively in the ER (22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Google Scholar), then rapidly transferred to ice and perforated to generate semi-intact cells. Export of VSV-G from the ER was initiated by incubation of perforated cells at the permissive temperature (32°C) in the presence of cytosol and ATP (21Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Google Scholar, 22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Google Scholar). To facilitate purification of recombinant Rab2 for use in vitro, wild-type and mutant forms were epitope-tagged at their NH2 termini. Surprisingly, and in contrast to epitope-tagged Rab1 proteins, which can be modified with His6, Myc, or hemagglutinin tags at their NH2 terminus and retain full activity (26Pind S. Nuoffer C. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Farquhar M.G. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 239-252Google Scholar, 27Nuoffer C.N. Davidson H.W. Matteson J. Meinkoth J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Google Scholar), the inhibitory activity of Rab2 mutants was completely lost when either His6- or hemagglutinin-tagged proteins were transiently expressed in vivo (data not shown). While these results support our observation that the NH2-terminal domain of Rab2 is required for function, the inability to epitope-tag active forms of Rab2 made it difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of wild-type or mutant proteins from recombinant sources to study function in vitro. We therefore examined whether peptidomimetics to the NH2 terminus of Rab2 or other Rab proteins would interfere with the transport of VSV-G between the ER and the Golgi stack in vitro. The peptides generated are summarized in Table II. As shown in Fig. 2 (open triangles), incubation of semi-intact cells with the peptide that corresponds to the amino-terminal 13 amino acids of Rab2 following the initiating methionine strongly inhibited the processing of VSV-G to endo H-resistant forms in a dose-dependent manner. Transport was reduced by 50% at a peptide concentration of 25 μM (Fig. 2). This concentration is ∼5-fold lower than that reported to be required for the equivalent Rab5 NH2-terminal peptide to inhibit endosome fusion by ∼50% (7Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Google Scholar). A scrambled peptide (Table II) was generated to address the possibility that inhibition by the Rab2 (13-mer) peptide was nonspecific. In this case, we observed only weak inhibition at 100 μM (Fig. 2, open squares). Likewise, a shorter peptide to the Rab2 NH2 terminus (7-mer) (Table II) failed to inhibit transport even at 100 μM (Fig. 2, closed triangles). Transport of VSV-G to the Golgi stack was not affected by 100 μM amounts of the corresponding Rab3A peptide or the Rab5 peptide, which inhibits endosome fusion in vitro (7Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We also noted that a peptide to the amino terminus of Rab1B, a protein essential for ER to Golgi transport (12Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar, 26Pind S. Nuoffer C. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Farquhar M.G. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 239-252Google Scholar) failed to inhibit protein traffic (Fig. 2, closed circles). These results demonstrate the arrest in ER to Golgi transport was specific to the Rab2 (13-mer) peptide and suggests that the peptide specifically interferes with Rab2, but not Rab1 function. Previous in vitro studies have shown that complete transport of VSV-G from the ER to endo H-resistant forms in the Golgi compartment requires a 15-20-min lag period (21Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Google Scholar). During this time, VSV-G is exported from the ER to pre-Golgi intermediates composed of clusters of ER-derived carrier vesicles and short tubular elements (referred to as VTCs) (10Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Google Scholar, 11Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Google Scholar, 21Davidson H.W. Balch W.E.

Subsequent transport of VSV-G from VTCs to the cis/medial Golgi compartments results in its processing to the first endo H-resistant R1 oligosaccharide form, which terminates in GlcNAc residues. Transport through sequential Golgi compartments to the trans Golgi network results in processing to the endo H-resistant RT form, which contains galactose and sialic acid (21Davidson H.W. Balch W.E.

Characterization of the mechanism of signaling utilized by GH indicated that tyrosine residues in GH receptor are not necessary for tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-2; however, the regions of GH receptor necessary for IRS-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation are the same as those required for JAK2 association and tyrosyl phosphorylation. The role of IRS-2 as a signaling molecule for GH is further demonstrated by the finding that GH stimulates association of IRS-2 with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. These results are consistent with the possibility that IRS-2 is a downstream signaling partner of multiple members of the cytokine family of receptors that activate JAK kinases.

It is a known substrate for protein kinases including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, src protein-tyrosine kinase, and protein kinase C. In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of annexin II in insulin signal transduction. Phosphorylation of annexin II in response to insulin treatment of intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-T cells was detected by 5 min and reached maximal levels after a 2-3-h incubation with the hormone. However, unlike other receptor substrates, annexin II failed to undergo insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation under conditions where receptor internalization was inhibited. This was evident in CHO cells, overexpressing the insulin receptor, in which internalization was inhibited either by tyrosine kinase inhibitors or by lowering the temperature to 4°C, and in CHO cells overexpressing various insulin receptor mutants in which normal internalization was impaired. Hence, Tyr phosphorylation of annexin II could be part of the internalization and sorting mechanism of the insulin receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1972484052,"The 3' ends of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs are generated by endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation. In mammals, the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) plays a central role in both steps of the processing reaction. Here, the cloning of the 73-kilodalton subunit of CPSF is reported. Sequence analyses revealed that a yeast protein (Ysh1) was highly similar to the 73-kD polypeptide. Ysh1 constitutes a new subunit of polyadenylation factor I (PFI), which has a role in yeast pre-mRNA 3'-end formation. This finding was unexpected because in contrast to CPSF, PFI is only required for the polyadenylation reaction. These results contribute to the understanding of how 3'-end processing factors may have evolved."

Transient transfection assays were carried out to investigate the effects of different intracellular targeting of calreticulin on transactivation mediated by glucocorticoid receptor. BSC40 cells were transfected with either calreticulin expression vector (ER form of calreticulin) or calreticulin expression vector encoding calreticulin minus leader peptide, resulting in cytoplasmic localization of the recombinant protein. Transfection of BSC40 cells with calreticulin expression vector encoding the ER form of the protein led to 40-50% inhibition of the dexamethasone-sensitive stimulation of luciferase expression. However, in a similar experiment, but using the calreticulin expression vector encoding cytoplasmic calreticulin, dexamethasone-stimulated activation of the luciferase reporter gene was inhibited by only 10%. We conclude that the ER, but not cytosolic, form of calreticulin is responsible for inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene expression. These effects are specific to calreticulin, since overexpression of the ER lumenal proteins (BiP, ERp72, or calsequestrin) has no effect on glucocorticoid-sensitive gene expression. The N domain of calreticulin binds to the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor in vitro; however, we show that the N+P domain of calreticulin, when synthesized without the ER signal sequence, does not inhibit glucocorticoid receptor function in vivo. Furthermore, expression of the N domain of calreticulin and the DNA binding domain of glucocorticoid receptor as fusion proteins with GAL4 in the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that calreticulin does not interact with glucocorticoid receptor under these conditions. We conclude that calreticulin and glucocorticoid receptor may not interact in vivo and that the calreticulin-dependent modulation of the glucocorticoid receptor function may therefore be due to a calreticulin-dependent signaling from the ER.

Mutations of murine p53 serine residues individually to either alanine or glutamic acid at positions 7, 9, 12, 18, 37, 312, and 389 resulted in equivalent levels of transcriptional activation in standard transient transfection experiments. However, when p53 transcriptional activity was measured in cells that attain G1 arrest upon contact inhibition, wild-type p53 was inactive, and only alteration at serine 389 to glutamic acid resulted in a functional p53 protein. This Ser → Glu mutant also has an increased ability to bind DNA. Elimination of the phosphorylation site by substitution of an alanine amino acid resulted in loss of transcriptional activity. We also demonstrated that specific phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 is induced by cyclin E overexpression in high-density cells.

A cluster of phosphoserines has been identified in vivo in the transactivation domain of murine p53 at amino acids 7, 9, 18, and 37 (14Wang Y. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4231-4235Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that purified casein kinase I can phosphorylate serines 7, 9, and 12 (15Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1361-1369Google Scholar). Purified DNA-activated protein kinase has also been shown to phosphorylate serines 7 and 18 in murine p53 and serines 15 and 37 in human p53 (16Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Google Scholar). Experiments examining the role of p53 phosphorylated amino-terminal amino acids in transcriptional activation indicated that mutations of these serines did not alter p53 function (17Fuchs B.

Two phosphoserines in the C-terminal domain, serines 312 and 389 in murine p53, have been identified both in vivo and in vitro (21Bischoff J.R. Friedman P.N. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Beach D. Proc.

Lu X. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 789-793Google Scholar), nor did a similar mutation in human p53 affect transactivation function (30Marston N.J. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2707-2716Google Scholar) or suppression of focus formation (31Slingerland J.M. Jenkins J.R. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1029-1037Google Scholar). Serine 389 in murine p53 has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by purified casein kinase II (23Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Google Scholar). Hupp et al. (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar) reported evidence that phosphorylation of this site in vitro promotes the specific DNA binding activity of p53. In vivo studies have failed, however, to show a clear role for the functional importance of phosphorylation at serine 389. A p53 protein with a mutation of serine 389 to alanine or aspartic acid bound DNA as well as the wild-type p53 protein and had no effect on transcriptional activity (17Fuchs B. O'Connor D. Fallis L. Scheidtmann K.H. Lu X. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 789-793Google Scholar, 30Marston N.J. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2707-2716Google Scholar, 33Fiscella M. Zambrano N. Ullrich S.J. Unger T.

These mutants have also been shown to suppress focus formation as well as wild-type p53 (33Fiscella M. Zambrano N. Ullrich S.J. Unger T. Lin D. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3249-3257Google Scholar). Thus far, the most persuasive data indicating that phosphorylation of p53 is important for its function have come from in vitro experiments. In previous studies, we showed that the DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation functions of p53 are lacking in cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by contact inhibition. Overexpression of cyclin E in these cells promoted cell cycle progression and recovery of both DNA binding and transactivation functions of p53 (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to analyze the role of phosphorylation in regulating p53 activity. Accordingly, we generated a series of mutations in murine p53 at the phosphorylated serine amino acids. We altered these serine residues either to alanine (to mimic an unphosphorylated state) or to glutamic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) and tested their effects on DNA binding and transactivation. In cycling cells, no significant difference was seen for either the wild-type p53 protein or any of the phosphorylation mutants. However, in G1-arrested cells, when wild-type p53 is not functional, only the p53 mutant with a Ser389→ Glu substitution retained both DNA binding and transactivation functions. Overexpression of cyclin E in this system allowed wild-type p53 to function, had no effect on the p53 Ser389→ Glu mutant, and only partially rescued the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the p53 mutant with a Ser389→ Ala substitution. Expression of cyclin E in contact-inhibited cells promoted phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 and activation of DNA binding and transcriptional activity of p53 in vivo. Thus, by synchronizing cells in G1 via contact inhibition, we demonstrated the importance of phosphorylation for p53 function. p53SA7, p53SA12, p53SA18, and p53SA37 encode murine p53 with Ser → Ala mutations at amino acids 7, 12, 18, and 37, respectively. They were generated by established procedures (36Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers synthesized direct the changes of codon 7 from TCA to GCA, codon 12 from AGC to GCC, codon 18 from AGC to GCC, and codon 37 from TCA to GCA, respectively. p53SA9 encodes a Ser → Ala substitution at amino acid 9. p53SE7, p53SE9, p53SE12, p53SE18, and p53SE37 encode murine p53 with Ser → Glu mutations at amino acid 7, 9, 12, 18, and 37, respectively. These were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (37Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sainsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides synthesized directed the changes of codon 9 from TCG to GCG, codon 7 from TCA to GAA, codon 9 from TCG to GAG, codon 12 from AGC to GAA, codon 18 from AGC to GAA, and codon 37 from TCA to GAA. The PCR products were subcloned into the wild-type p53 expression plasmid LTRXA, which contains the Harvey murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (38Hinds P. Finlay C. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 739-746Google Scholar). p53SA312 and p53SA389 encode murine p53 with mutations from Ser → Ala at amino acids 312 and 389, respectively. p53SE312 and p53SE389, which encode murine p53 with Ser → Glu mutations at amino acids 312 and 389, respectively, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. Oligonucleotides were synthesized that directed the changes of codon 312 from TCT to GCT or GAA for p53SA312 or p53SE312 and codon 389 from TCA to GCA or GAA for p53SA389 or p53SE389, respectively. The appropriate fragments containing the mutations were subcloned into LTRXA. Sequence analyses confirmed the mutations and ensured that no other changes were introduced by the PCR amplification procedures. These plasmids were used to generate p53SA312/389 or p53SE312/389, which encode p53 with an alanine or glutamic acid substitution, respectively, at both serines 312 and 389. SV40SA389 and SV40SE389 were generated by subcloning the mutations from p53SA389 and p53SE389, respectively, into SV40XA (39Hao M. Finlay C.A. Lozano G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 299-306Google Scholar). Cells were plated at the appropriate cell densities in 10-cm plates and grown for ∼24 h before transfection. Two micrograms of the pSV2-β-gal plasmid was cotransfected with 5 μg of the reporter and 2-10 μg of the effector plasmids using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (40Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase and luciferase assays were performed as described (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. For protein immunoprecipitation assays, cells were labeled for 2-3 h in methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). For protein phosphorylation assays, cells were metabolically labeled in phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN). Cells were then harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the extracts were prepared by sonication and removal of the cell pellets. Cell lysates with equivalent β-galactosidase units were used for immunoprecipitation as described (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar). The p53 antibodies were obtained from supernatants of hybridomas grown in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum to a density of 106 cells/ml, while the cyclin E antibody was commercially available (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Mini-nuclear extracts were prepared from one set of transiently transfected cells as described (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). One of each duplicate plate transfected at the same time with the same DNA was harvested and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. For preparing nuclear extracts, the amount of buffer C added was calculated according to the transfection efficiency determined by the β-galactosidase activity of the duplicate plate. This assay was carried out as described (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar, 42Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing the p53 binding element, 5′-GATCCCCTGCCTGGACTTGCCTGGA-3′, and its complement were synthesized for these experiments. Several lines of evidence prompted us to examine whether phosphorylation of p53 is important for its function. First, p53 is a transcriptional activator that is phosphorylated on numerous serine amino acids. Many transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation (43Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Google Scholar). In addition, cyclin E overexpression in cells arrested in G1 was found to activate p53 function (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that cyclin E, when complexed with Cdk2, may phosphorylate and activate p53. We began this study by creating a series of murine p53 mutants with alterations of the known phosphorylated serine residues at amino acids 7, 9, 12, 18, 37, 312, and 389. These serines were altered singly to alanine to mimic an unphosphorylated state or to glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation (Table I). In addition, serines at positions 312 and 389 were both altered in the same construct to either alanines or glutamic acids. These plasmids were transfected into NIH3T3 cells with either one of two p53 reporter plasmids, the p53 promoter or mdm2 promoter attached to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase genes, respectively (3Barak Y.

Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar, 44Deffie A. Wu H. Reinke V. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3415-3423Google Scholar). The results indicated that all serine mutant plasmids were able to activate the mdm2-luciferase reporter to the same extent (Figs. 1A and 2A). Use of the p53 promoter also resulted in activation of all serine mutants to the same extent (data not shown). Thus, experiments with two different p53-responsive promoters showed no differential expression of these p53 serine mutants. A known p53 mutant (LTRKH) that cannot activate transcription did not do so in our assay (45Raycroft L. Schmidt J.R. Yoas K. Hao M. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6067-6074Google Scholar). Thus, all data indicated that alteration of the phosphorylated serine amino acids had no effect on p53 transcriptional activation. Next we considered the possibility that phosphorylation was only one mechanism by which p53 became transcriptionally functional. We therefore assayed the function of the serine mutants in NIH3T3 cells arrested in G1 by contact inhibition. In this system, we have already shown that wild-type p53 was not functional even though the protein was present at high levels (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar). Transfection of the phosphorylation mutants in this system revealed that only p53 mutants containing glutamic acid at position 389 were transcriptionally active (Fig. 2B). Wild-type p53 and all other serine mutants, including the p53 Ser389→ Ala mutant, were not functional (Figs. 1B and 2B). Since we have shown previously that cyclin E activated p53 in cells arrested in G1 by contact inhibition (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar), we assayed these mutants at high cell density in the presence or absence of cyclin E. Transient transfections were performed in NIH3T3 cells with the p53 serine mutant expression plasmids and the mdm2-luciferase reporter with or without the cyclin E expression plasmid. A vector with the cyclin E gene deleted was used as a control. In the absence of cyclin E, only p53SE389 and p53SE312/389 were transcriptionally active (Fig. 3A). The addition of the cyclin E expression plasmid activated wild-type p53 and all the phosphorylation mutants, but to different extents (Fig. 3B). The p53 serine mutants containing alanine at position 389 were consistently activated to a lesser degree in the presence of cyclin E. To determine whether p53 protein levels were affected in these experiments, we performed a series of duplicate transfections in which one plate was subjected to a transactivation assay while the other was used to measure protein levels. In these experiments, we used SV40 promoter-p53 constructs because they express p53 at higher levels and allow detection of p53 by immunoprecipitation. In addition, the transient transfections were performed in SaOs-2 cells since they lack endogenous p53 (46Masuda H. Miller C. Koeffler H.P. Battifora H. Cline M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7716-7719Google Scholar). The trend was identical; at low cell density, all p53 phosphorylation mutants activated the mdm2-luciferase target (Fig. 4A). However, at high cell density, only p53SE389 was active. Again, p53SA389 only partially recovered its ability to transcriptionally activate a p53 target in cells overexpressing cyclin E. The duplicate transfections were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys and immunoprecipitated with p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421. The levels of p53 expressed in these cells were comparable in all experiments (Fig. 4B). Since p53 protein levels were not altered at high cell density, yet p53SE389 was the only transcriptionally active p53, we monitored changes in DNA binding affinity. Protein extracts of cells transfected with p53 mutants were immunoprecipitated using the p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421, which binds p53 adjacent to phosphorylated serine 389. Using this antibody, we could detect no difference in DNA binding among the mutants (Fig. 5A). This antibody has been shown to activate p53 for DNA binding and thus serves as a good control for protein levels (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar). However, when we used p53 monoclonal antibody PAb242, which binds an epitope in the amino terminus, we saw a specific DNA binding capacity of p53SE389. Wild-type p53 at low cell density was able to bind DNA (Fig. 5B, lane 2), but it could not do so at high cell density (lane 3). DNA binding was recovered in the presence of cyclin E (Fig. 5B, lane 4). The p53SA389 mutant exhibited the same DNA binding profile as wild-type p53 (Fig. 5B, lanes 5-7). However, p53SE389 bound DNA as well as wild-type p53 at low cell density and even better at high cell density in the absence or presence of cyclin E (Fig. 5B, lanes 8-10). As controls for the DNA binding reaction, we used a p53 mutant with an Arg248→ Trp substitution or with a mutated p53-binding oligonucleotide and saw no binding (data not shown). Our data thus far indicated phosphorylation of p53 at amino acid 389 to be important for function, and the presence of cyclin E in this system activated p53 for DNA binding and transactivation via this amino acid. An additional question we needed to ask was whether the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex phosphorylated p53 at amino acid 389. SaOs-2 cells were again transfected with wild-type p53 with or without cyclin E or with p53 phosphorylation mutant p53SA389 with or without cyclin E (Fig. 6). Plates transfected with p53 expression plasmids at high cell density were immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody PAb421 after labeling with [35S]Met/Cys to measure total p53 protein (Fig. 6A) or after labeling with 32P to measure incorporation of phosphate (Fig. 6C). In addition, the levels of cyclin E expression were measured (Fig. 6B). Wild-type p53 incorporated phosphate in the presence of cyclin E in duplicate experiments (Fig. 6C); p53SA389 did not, even though the same amount of p53 protein was present (Fig. 6A). The levels of cyclin E expressed were also similar in the cyclin E-transfected lanes (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 5). Endogenous cyclin E migrated at ∼55 kDa, while exogenous cyclin E did so at ∼50 kDa as described previously (47Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Google Scholar). The lower molecular mass bands detected using cyclin E antibodies have been observed by others and may represent degradation products of cyclin E (47Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Google Scholar). We repeated these experiments with the inclusion of other mutants (Fig. 7). p53 mutants were individually transiently transfected into density-arrested SaOs-2 cells with the cyclin E expression plasmid, labeled with 32P, and immunoprecipitated with p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421. Again, the p53SA389 mutant did not incorporate phosphate (Fig. 7, lane 2) when compared with wild-type p53 (lane 1). However, the p53SE389 mutant, in which the glutamic acid substitution is expected to mimic phosphorylation, did incorporate phosphate. These data indicate that serines other than serine 389 incorporate phosphate and suggest that p53SE389 mimics, to some extent, wild-type p53. Two additional mutants incorporated in the assay were the 312 mutants. Both p53SA312 and p53SE312 incorporated phosphate (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5) slightly better than wild-type p53. Functional regulation by phosphorylation has been well documented for many transcription factors (reviewed by Hunter and Karin (43Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Google Scholar)) as well as for the tumor suppressor Rb gene product (48Ludlow J.W. DeCaprio J.A. Huang C. Lee W. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1989; 56: 57-65Google Scholar, 49Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Google Scholar). To examine the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of p53 function, we generated a series of point mutations at each of the previously identified phosphorylation sites in a murine p53 construct and measured their effect on p53 transactivation function in cells cultured under different conditions. No significant difference was found when any of these mutants were tested in low-density cycling cells. However, when their transcriptional activities were measured in high-density cells that attain G1 arrest upon contact inhibition, only mutation of p53 at serine 389 to glutamic acid resulted in a functional p53 protein. Alteration of p53 at serine 389 to glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation maintains p53 transcriptional and DNA binding activities in contact-inhibited cells. We also demonstrated that phosphorylation of p53 is induced by cyclin E overexpression in contact-inhibited cells. Using the p53 mutant with a Ser389→ Ala substitution, we showed no phosphorylation in contact-inhibited cells in which cyclin E is overexpressed. These data suggest either that specific phosphorylation occurs at amino acid 389 or that general phosphorylation of p53 is affected by this mutation. The latter seems to be the case since the p53SE389 mutant could incorporate phosphate. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that serine 389 must be phosphorylated first. Elimination of the phosphorylation site by substitution of an alanine amino acid resulted in only partial recovery of transcriptional activity in cells induced into cell cycle progression by cyclin E overexpression, although DNA binding was as elevated as in wild-type p53 or the p53SE389 mutant. One possibility is that the p53SA389 mutant adopts a conformation needed for DNA binding, but the lack of the negative charge does not allow efficient interaction with the transcription machinery. Our data establish for the first time that phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 is important in regulating its transcription function in vivo. In support of our finding, a p53 Ser → Ala mutant partially lost its ability to suppress growth (50Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Meek D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5565-5570Google Scholar). Consistent with data from other groups (17Fuchs B. O'Connor D. Fallis L. Scheidtmann K.H. Lu X. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 789-793Google Scholar, 18Mayr G.A. Reed M. Wang P. Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2410-2417Google Scholar, 30Marston N.J. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2707-2716Google Scholar, 31Slingerland J.M. Jenkins J.R. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1029-1037Google Scholar), none of the other serine mutations had any effect on transcriptional activation. The ability of cyclin E expression to restore p53 transcriptional activation and DNA binding properties has been described (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar). Since cyclin E overexpression has also been shown to push cells into the cell cycle (35Deffie A. Hao M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Hulboy D. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3926-3933Google Scholar, 47Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Google Scholar), we believe that the overexpression of cyclin E pushes the cells into the G1/S window, where p53 functions as a checkpoint. In addition, since serine 389 is a substrate for casein kinase II in vitro and p53 is phosphorylated poorly by cyclin E-Cdk2 in vitro, the overexpression of cyclin E does not appear to directly activate p53 phosphorylation at serine 389. The possibility exists that the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex phosphorylates another substrate, e.g. casein kinase II, which then phosphorylates p53. Despite the significant functional difference between wild-type p53 and the p53 serine 389 mutants in contact-inhibited cells, these mutations did not affect p53 function in actively cycling cells. Specifically, the Ser389→ Glu mutation did not have an increased activity compared with that of the Ser389→ Ala mutation. These data are consistent with other published reports whose authors failed to detect any role of phosphorylation in p53 function (30Marston N.J. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2707-2716Google Scholar, 33Fiscella M. Zambrano N. Ullrich S.J. Unger T. Lin D. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3249-3257Google Scholar). We hypothesize that these cells have another mechanism for activating p53 function. When this other mechanism is in play, phosphorylation at serine 389 does not lead to a further increment of p53 transcriptional activity, perhaps because of limiting cofactors necessary for p53 transactivation. This alternate mechanism seems to be absent in cells arrested in G1 by contact inhibition since wild-type p53 was not functional, and phosphorylation of p53 at serine 389 yielded a significant increase in p53 activity. Our data therefore indicated that p53 can be activated by at least one other mechanism that masks the effect of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 in the context of actively cycling cells. Indeed, in vitro studies have suggested that multiple mechanisms exist to activate p53 DNA binding activity. These include glycosylation, phosphorylation of human p53 in vitro at serine 392 (homologous to serine 389 in murine p53), binding to p53 antibody PAb421, C-terminal deletion of p53, and binding to small peptides (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar, 51Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Google Scholar, 52Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930Google Scholar). In addition, while efficient p53-DNA binding can occur in the presence of antibody PAb421, the alternatively spliced p53 protein that has a different C terminus bound DNA efficiently in vitro without activation by PAb421 (53Wu Y. Liu Y. Lee L. Miner Z. Kulesz-Martin M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4823-4830Google Scholar). The masking of p53 phosphorylation at serine 389 proposed by our study explains the seemingly contrary results from other groups. In transactivation assays, alterations of human p53 serine 392 yielded no difference in function compared with that of wild-type p53. As Fiscella et al. (33Fiscella M. Zambrano N. Ullrich S.J. Unger T. Lin D. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3249-3257Google Scholar) showed in SaOs-2 cells, mutations at this serine to either alanine or aspartic acid did not affect p53 transactivation of the p21WAF1/cip1 promoter. Similarly, Marston et al. (30Marston N.J. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2707-2716Google Scholar) reported that a human p53 mutant with a Ser392→ Ala substitution activated the mdm2 promoter as well as wild-type p53 in NIH3T3 cells. These results indicate that p53 phosphorylation at this site is not required for p53 to function as a transcriptional activator. However, in both of these studies, cells were plated at a density of 3-5 × 105 cells/10-cm plate, which resembles our low-density cell culture conditions, in which we also saw no functional difference of mutations at serine 389. Since our data implied the existence of more than one mechanism for activating p53 function, we suspect that the experimental conditions used in these studies favored other mechanism(s) of p53 activation. Activation of p53 by phosphorylation may be camouflaged in these cases. Since functional p53 is a potent growth suppressor, the evolution of more than one mechanism to regulate p53 function seems very likely. We are examining whether phosphorylation of serine 389 is the mechanism of activating p53 upon DNA damage by ultraviolet light or γ-irradiation."

Interaction between coexpressed Kv1.1 (α) and Kvβ1.1 (β) subunits confers rapid inactivation on the delayed rectifier-type current that is observed when α subunits are expressed alone. Integrating electrophysiological and biochemical analyses, we show that the inactivation of the αβ current is not complete even when α is saturated with β, and the αβ current has an inherent sustained component, indistinguishable from a pure α current. We further show that basal and protein kinase A-induced phosphorylations at Ser-446 of the α protein increase the extent, but not the rate, of inactivation of the αβ channel, without affecting the association between α and β. In addition, the extent of inactivation is increased by agents that lead to microfilament depolymerization. The effects of phosphorylation and of microfilament depolymerization are not additive. Taken together, we suggest that phosphorylation, via a mechanism that involves the interaction of the αβ channel with microfilaments, enhances the extent of inactivation of the channel. Furthermore, phosphorylation at Ser-446 also increases current amplitudes of the αβ channel as was shown before for the α channel. Thus, phosphorylation enhances in concert inactivation and current amplitudes, thereby leading to a substantial increase in A-type activity.

Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) currents show enormous diversity, but nevertheless can be classified functionally into two major classes: the delayed rectifier type, which are very slowly inactivating, and the A type, which are rapidly inactivating (1Rudy B.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol.

Lotan I FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). mRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. Kvβ1.1 was in a pAKSZ vector, and its mRNA was transcribed in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase after linearization with EcoRI. Frogs (Xenopus laevis) were maintained and dissected, and their oocytes were prepared as described (22Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 13. The Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2-5 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 200-500 ng/μl Kvβ 1.1 mRNA for two-electrode voltage clamp studies, and 100-200 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 3-7 μg/μl Kvβ 1.1 mRNAs for macropatch and biochemical studies. The concentrations of the injected mutant Kv1.1 mRNAs deviated slightly from the above concentrations, as they were adjusted to give similar current amplitudes with Kvβ 1.1. Injected oocytes were incubated at 22°C for 1-3 days in ND96 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1.0 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (NDE solution; Ref. 22Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 13. The Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar), and then assayed either electrophysiologically or biochemically. (Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS was added to the NDE solution during incubation, starting several hours after the RNA injection. Cytochalasins were added 4-12 h before the electrophysiological assay. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (20Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To avoid possible errors introduced by series resistance, only current amplitudes up to 4 μA were recorded, and in a given experiment the amplitudes of WT and mutant currents were similar. Oocytes were placed in a 1-ml bath continuously perfused with ND96 solution supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2. Currents were elicited by stepping the membrane potential from a holding potential of −80 mV to +50 mV for 200 ms. Current-voltage relationships were obtained by 200-ms depolarizing steps from −90 mV (80-ms prepulse). Net current was estimated by subtraction of the scaled leak current elicited by a voltage step to −90 mV. Intervals of 20 s between each trace allowed for recovery from inactivation. The time course of the decay phase of the current was fitted with a sum of two exponential components. The slow component had a time constant of several tens of milliseconds, thus representing inactivation distinct from the fast inactivation of the fast component. The time constant of the fast component (τinact) is referred to in the text. Cell-attached macropatch recordings were done with Axopatch 200 (Axon Instruments). The vitelline membrane was removed as described (22Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 13. The Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Oocytes were placed in a depolarizing bath solution containing 150 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 6 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 8, so that the oocyte membrane would rest at ∼ 0 mV. Borosilicate glass Dagan LE16 (Dagan Corp.) patch pipettes were filled with 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz (−4 dB) and sampled at 4 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were done with pCLAMP software. Partial analog capacity compensation was achieved with the circuicity of Axopatch, and leak and the remaining capacitative currents were subtracted by using the P/4 method (24Bezanilla F. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Macropatch currents were determined by the same protocols as whole cell currents, only that the depolarizing steps lasted 70 ms. The time course of the decay phase of the current was fitted with a single exponential function. This was done essentially as described (19Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following injection, six to eight oocytes were incubated at 22°C for 4 h in NDE solution, then for 3 days in NDE containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys, and then homogenized in 150-300 μl of medium consisting of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 1 μM pepstatin, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline supplemented with protein phosphatase inhibitors: okadaic acid (50 nM), vanadate (0.5 mM), and KF (50 mM). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. After addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 4%, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4°C, antiserum was added to the supernatant for 16 h at 4°C. The antibody-antigen complex was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose and then pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 8000 × g. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with immunowash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100); the final wash contained no Triton. Plasma membranes were separated mechanically, as described (19Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were placed for 10 min in ice-cold hypotonic solution (5 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM pepstatin, and 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors, as specified above. Plasma membranes together with the vitelline membranes (extracellular collagen-like matrix), were removed manually with watchmaker's forceps. Ten internal fractions or 20-30 plasma membranes were processed as described for whole oocytes. Gels were dried and placed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) cassette for about 1 day (for whole oocytes or internal fractions) or 2-4 days (for the plasma membranes). Using the software ImageQuant, a digitized scan was derived and relative intensities of protein bands were estimated quantitatively as described (20Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.E.; N denotes number of frogs assayed, and n denotes the number of oocytes assayed. Student's t test was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences between two populations, unless otherwise stated. In agreement with Rettig et al. (14Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), coexpression of Kvβ1.1 (β) subunit with Kv1.1 (α) subunit in Xenopus oocytes conferred inactivation on the voltage-dependent, delayed rectifier-type K+ current expressed from α subunit alone (Ref. 13Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar; Fig. 1, A and B). Inactivation became pronounced at voltages more positive than −10 mV but was not complete even at +50 mV, as the current had a substantial sustained component remaining at the end of the 200-ms depolarization. The time course of the decay phase of the current (τinact; see “Experimental Procedures”) varied only slightly with voltage and reached an average of 7.7 ± 0.3 ms at +50 mV (N = 2, n = 6; Fig. 1B, inset). To confirm that the kinetics of these currents were adequately resolved by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, we also analyzed these currents using macropatch recording technique that allows for better time resolution (Fig. 1C). The τinact values of the macropatch currents were 7.4 ± 0.7 ms at +50 mV (N = 2, n = 4), very similar to those of the whole cell currents, The time course of recovery from inactivation, assessed using standard two-pulse protocol, was best fitted with an exponential function with a time constant of 4.3 s (Fig. 1D). Using concomitant biochemical analysis by SDS-PAGE, we could monitor the expression of the two protein subunits. The expression of the α subunit in oocytes injected with Kv1.1 mRNA (α mRNA) and its immunopurification by a specific antibody from both the internal fraction (containing the cytoplasm and internal membranes; Fig. 1E, lane 7) and the plasma membranes (manually separated, as described under “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 1E, lane 11) have been described previously (19Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The α protein appeared mainly in the form of two glycosylated polypeptides migrating as ∼54 and ∼57 kDa (the 57-kDa band represents the phosphorylated form of the protein) and a diffuse band migrating as ∼ 80 kDa and representing highly glycosylated forms. The latter band was usually apparent in plasma membrane fractions after more than 2 days of expression (see Fig. 2C). The β subunit was immunopurified from oocytes injected with Kvβ1 mRNA (β mRNA) by an antibody generated against its C terminus. It migrated as a polypeptide of 45 kDa (e.g. Fig. 1E, lane 9; the predicted molecular mass of the core polypeptide deduced from the cDNA sequence is 44.7 kDa; Ref. 14Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Physical association between the two subunits was demonstrated in oocytes injected with β and α mRNAs, as the α and β polypeptides could be reciprocally coimmunopurified with either the β or α antibodies, respectively, after solubilization in 4% Triton X-100 (but not in 1% SDS; Fig. 1E). The association was apparent both in the internal fraction and in plasma membranes of oocytes. One observation we made was that the α antibody could precipitate some of the β polypeptides in oocytes injected with only β mRNA (Fig. 1E, lanes 3 and 6). Since precipitation of β occurred only upon solubilization of the oocytes in 4% Triton X-100 and not in 4% SDS, it probably was not due to cross-reactivity of the α antibody with the β polypeptide, but rather caused by coprecipitation with an endogenous α polypeptide (shown to be present in small amounts in oocytes; Ref. 19Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An additional observation, made in oocytes of most frogs that were injected with β mRNA, was the presence of a minor band that migrated as a 33-kDa polypeptide (see Fig. 1E). Its nature is at present unknown. To study functional channels that are αβ complexes, we attempted to reach conditions under which all α subunits in the plasma membrane were associated with β. Increasing the β-to-α mRNA ratio resulted in increasing amounts of β associated with α (as judged by the increasing amounts of β polypeptides that were coprecipitated with a given amount of α); saturation occurred at an mRNA ratio of 40 (Fig. 2, A and B). The substantial excess of β mRNA over α may be needed because the α mRNA was derived from a construct that confers high level of protein expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under the saturation conditions, the β polypeptides were in excess over α in the plasma membrane fraction (as judged by the larger amount of β polypeptides precipitated by the β antibody than that coprecipitated by the α antibody; Fig. 2C), and most of the α in the plasma membrane was associated with β. Thus, the bound α (coprecipitated by the β antibody) was 100% and 87% of the total α (precipitated by the α antibody) in oocytes of two frogs (see Fig. 2C; all molecular forms of α were taken into account). Concomitantly, we performed electrophysiological analysis of the functional consequences of increasing the β-to-α mRNA ratio. For practical purposes we presented the total current (Ip, peak) as consisting of two apparent components: an inactivating component (Ii) and a noninactivating sustained component remaining at the end of the 200-ms depolarizing pulse (Is); the apparent extent of inactivation (inactivating fraction) was defined as Ii/Ip (Fig. 2E). Increasing the β-to-α mRNA ratio resulted in increased extent of inactivation of the currents (Fig. 2D) up to saturation of about 60% extent of inactivation. Notably, saturation occurred at β-to-α mRNA ratio of about 50, which coincided with saturation in the β-binding capacity of the α polypeptides (Fig. 2, compare D with B). The time constant of inactivation (τinact) was independent of the mRNA ratio (see Fig. 2D, inset). At this point it could be concluded that, under conditions where most of α was associated with β in the plasma membrane, the current still had a substantial sustained component (the Is fraction (Is/Ip) was about 40%), implying that the latter is an inherent feature of the current flowing through channels formed by αβ complexes rather than by α alone (not associated with β). This conclusion was further substantiated upon examination of an α mutant (αS446A) that bound β to the same extent as did wild type (αWT), and yet had an Is fraction that could be larger than 90% in oocytes of some frogs (see below). The β-to-α mRNA ratio was kept at 100 in all the following electrophysiological experiments to ensure saturation with β. Biophysical analysis of Is under these saturating conditions showed that it behaved identically to currents elicited by free α (Iα, current elicited in oocytes injected with α mRNA only), according to the following three criteria. First, analysis of the time course of the decay of tail currents showed that the time course of deactivation of Is was identical to that of Iα, whereas deactivation of Ip was faster (Fig. 3, A and B). Second, the voltage dependence of steady-state activation derived from tail currents and from currents elicited at the different potentials (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively) showed that the activation curve of Is coincided with that of Iα, whereas the activation curve of Ip was shifted to more depolarized potentials and its slope was changed (see legend to Fig. 3, C and D, for details on parameters). Third, Is and Iα displayed inward rectification at potentials more positive than +20 mV, whereas Ip did not (Fig. 3D). Rectification of Kv1.1 has not been described before, and its underlying mechanism remains to be determined. Inward rectification has, however, been described for three other delayed rectifier K+ channels: DRK1 (25Lopatin A.N. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and RAW (26Rettig J. Wunder F Stocker M. Lichtinghagen R. Mastiaux F. Beckh S. Kues W. Pedrazani P. Schroter K.H. Ruppersberg J.P. Veh R. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2473-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), where rectification results from voltage-dependent blocking by internal cations, and HERG (27Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), where rectification results from voltage-dependent C-type inactivation that occurs much faster than activation. Having characterized the αβ channel, we could study the modulation of the αβ current by phosphorylation. Previously we have shown that the α protein (Kv1.1) is partially phosphorylated in its basal state in the oocytes (19Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Using the mutants S446A and R442C/S446A, we further showed that Ser-446 in the C terminus is the target of this phosphorylation (e.g. comparison of lanes 7 and 3 in Fig. 4C shows that only the wild type (WT), and not the S446A, is expressed in the form of the 57-kDa polypeptide that represents the phosphorylated form of α). To determine the role of the basal phosphorylation in the β-induced inactivation, we compared currents of αβ channels in which the α subunit was either WT (αWTβ) or one of the phosphorylation-deficient mutants (αmutβ). As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), the extent of inactivation (Ii/Ip) of each of the αmutβ channels was significantly smaller than that of the αWTβ. This was not the case when the α mutants unrelated to phosphorylation, S489I (also at the C terminus), S322C, or K320Q/R324M (at the S4-S5 loop), were coexpressed with β (Fig. 4B). τinact of αS446Aβ did not vary significantly from that of αWTβ and was 8.1 ± 0.57 ms (N = 2, n = 5; determined from macropatch currents). Also, there was no change in the voltage dependence of steady-state activation of αS446Aβ (not shown). One possibility to account for the difference in the extent of inactivation between the αWTβ and the αS446Aβ currents could be that it was due to different β-binding capacities of the two α polypeptides. This possibility was excluded in the concomitant biochemical analyses. Whenever oocytes of one frog were compared, the β-to-α polypeptides ratio precipitated by the α antibody was similar for αWTβ and αS446Aβ channels, both in whole oocytes and in plasma membranes. Such comparisons done in oocytes of several frogs showed that the β-to-α ratio for αS446Aβ was 1.2 ± 0.1-fold (N = 4) of that for αWTβ in whole oocytes and 0.97 ± 0.13-fold in plasma membranes (N = 3). (A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4C. Note that the experiment was done under saturating conditions where β was expressed in excess.) Next we addressed the effect of PKA-induced phosphorylation on the extent of inactivation. Previously we showed that incubation of oocytes for several hours to several days with 0.5 mM (Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS (a membrane-permeant activator of PKA) causes phosphorylation of the α polypeptide at Ser 446 and thus increases the relative intensity of the 57-kDa over the 54-kDa band (Ref. 20Levin G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). In this study we showed that α associated with β was also phosphorylated following this treatment (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Concomitant electrophysiological experiments showed that treatment with (Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS caused an increase of about 40% in the extent of inactivation of the αWTβ but not of the αS446Aβ currents (Fig. 5B; n = 5); τinact was not affected (data not shown). However, in oocytes of two additional frogs, (Sp)-8-Br-cAMPS treatment did not affect the extent of inactivation of the αWTβ current. Examination of the α polypeptide immunopurified from those oocytes revealed that in both frogs it was highly phosphorylated in its basal state (more than 75% phosphorylation as compared to the usual ∼50% phosphorylation; Ref. 20Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B."
https://openalex.org/W2119479764,"We have shown that ethanol inhibits uptake of adenosine by a specific nucleoside transporter in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells and that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity is required for this inhibition. After chronic exposure to ethanol, adenosine uptake is no longer inhibited on rechallenge with ethanol, i.e. transport has become tolerant to ethanol. Here we show that protein kinase C (PKC) contributes to ethanol-induced tolerance of adenosine transport. Activation of PKC by phorbol esters in control cells results in an ethanol-tolerant phenotype, similar to that produced by chronic ethanol exposure. In addition, chronic exposure to ethanol increases the amounts of α, δ, and ϵ PKC. However, reducing PKC activity by inhibition with chelerythrine during chronic exposure to ethanol or down-regulation by phorbol esters prevents the development of ethanol-induced tolerance of adenosine transport. By contrast, the inhibition of PKA activity produces tolerance to ethanol inhibition of adenosine uptake. When protein phosphatase inhibitors are present, inhibiting PKA activity has no effect on ethanol sensitivity of adenosine uptake, suggesting a role for protein phosphatases in the regulation of ethanol sensitivity of uptake. Taken together, our results suggest that PKA and PKC have opposing effects on the ethanol sensitivity of adenosine transport; PKA activity is required for ethanol sensitivity, and PKC activation produces tolerance. Based on these data, we propose that chronic ethanol exposure increases PKC activity, leading to the activation of a protein phosphatase (1 or 2A). This phosphatase then dephosphorylates a PKA-phosphorylated site, which is required for ethanol to inhibit adenosine uptake. Therefore, the sensitivity of adenosine transport to ethanol appears to be maintained by a balance of PKA and protein phosphatase activities, and PKC may regulate phosphatase activity.

INTRODUCTIONWe have presented evidence that the cAMP signaling system is important for regulating the response to ethanol in a cell culture model of tolerance. We found that ethanol acts on a specific nucleoside transporter in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells (1Krauss S.W. Ghirnikar R.B. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1021-1026Google Scholar), inhibiting adenosine uptake (2Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Casso D.J. Franklin C. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1946-1951Google Scholar). In cells treated chronically with ethanol, however, adenosine uptake becomes insensitive when rechallenged with acute ethanol, and adenosine uptake is no longer inhibited by ethanol (2Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Casso D.J. Franklin C. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1946-1951Google Scholar). The loss of ethanol sensitivity is an example of ethanol tolerance at a cellular level. Using this model system, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate tolerance to ethanol.We have shown that ethanol inhibition of adenosine uptake requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateANOVAanalysis of variance. activity; ethanol does not inhibit adenosine uptake in mutant cells lacking PKA activity (3Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 812-817Google Scholar). We also found that the ethanol sensitivity of transport in cells chronically exposed to ethanol can be restored by activating PKA (4Coe I.R. Dohrman D.P. Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 365-369Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibition of PKA in naive cells reproduces the ethanol-tolerant phenotype. This latter effect can be prevented by inhibiting protein phosphatase activity with okadaic acid (4Coe I.R. Dohrman D.P. Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 365-369Google Scholar), suggesting that protein phosphatase (1 or 2A) is also involved in regulating the ethanol sensitivity of adenosine uptake. Based on this earlier work, we concluded that ethanol sensitivity of adenosine uptake appears to be due to a balance of PKA and phosphatase activities.Recent evidence also implicates protein kinase C (PKC) in cellular responses to ethanol. On acute exposure to ethanol, PKC activity increases in human lymphocytes (5DePetrillo P.B. Liou C.S. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 351-354Google Scholar) and epidermal keratinocytes (6Kharbanda S. Nakamura T. Kufe D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 675-681Google Scholar). Moreover, chronic exposure to ethanol causes increased PKC activity in NG108-15 and PC12 cells (7Messing R.O. Petersen P.J. Henrich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23428-23432Google Scholar). PKC also regulates the ethanol sensitivity of GABAA receptors (8Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 113-117Google Scholar, 9Weiner J.L. Zhang L. Carlen P.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

A. 1995; 92: 3658-3662Google Scholar), NMDA receptors (11Snell L.D. Iorio K.R. Tabakoff B. Hoffman P.L. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1783-1789Google Scholar), AMPA/kainate receptors (12Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Harris R.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3162-3171Google Scholar), and 5HT1c and M1 muscarinic receptors (13Sanna E. Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1004-1012Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of PKC in the regulation of ethanol sensitivity of adenosine transport. We found that activation of PKC produces the tolerant phenotype in naive cells and that inhibition or down-regulation of PKC during chronic exposure to ethanol prevents the development of tolerance. Our results suggest that PKC activity is required for the development of tolerance of adenosine transport after chronic exposure to ethanol.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that a specific facilitative nucleoside transporter is a primary target for ethanol in NG108-15 cells (1Krauss S.W. Ghirnikar R.B. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1021-1026Google Scholar). Acute ethanol inhibition of adenosine uptake via this transporter leads to activation of adenosine A2 receptors and a cascade of intracellular signaling events leading to tolerance of adenosine transport on rechallenge with ethanol (2Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Casso D.J. Franklin C. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1946-1951Google Scholar). We found that adenosine uptake is not inhibited by ethanol in mutant cells lacking PKA activity (3Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 812-817Google Scholar) and that the tolerance of adenosine transport induced by chronic ethanol exposure could be reversed by activating PKA (4Coe I.R. Dohrman D.P. Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 365-369Google Scholar). These results suggest that PKA activity is required for ethanol to inhibit adenosine uptake. Treatment with phorbol esters (Fig. 1), which activate PKC, or activation of bradykinin receptors (Fig. 2), which also leads to activation of PKC (21Tippmer S. Quitterer U. Kolm V. Faussner A. Roscher A. Mosthaf L. Müller-Esterl W. Häring H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 297-304Google Scholar, 22Gerwins P. Fredholm B.B. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 186-193Google Scholar), produces a tolerant phenotype similar to that produced by chronic exposure to ethanol. Conversely, ethanol tolerance is prevented in chronically exposed cells when PKC activity is inhibited (Fig. 4) or reduced by down-regulation (Fig. 5).These data suggest that the ethanol sensitivity of adenosine transport is regulated by both PKA and PKC. PKA maintains the ethanol-sensitive phenotype; PKC activity is required for chronic ethanol-induced tolerance of adenosine transport. There is evidence in other systems that a balance of PKA and PKC activities regulates cellular functions. PKA can overcome PKC-dependent desensitization of the G-protein-activated K+ channel (23Chen Y. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7839-7842Google Scholar), and opposing effects of PKA and PKC on the glycine receptor have also been reported (24Vaello M.-L. Ruiz-Gomez A. Lerma J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2002-2008Google Scholar). Hoek and co-workers (25Hoek J.B. Nomura T. Higashi K. Alling C. Diamond I. Leslie S.W. Sun G.Y. Wood W.G. Alcohol, Cell Membranes, and Signal Transduction in Brain. Plenum Press, New York1993: 219-234Google Scholar) have also shown that PKA and PKC have opposite effects on the regulation of basal and receptor-stimulated phospholipase C activity by ethanol in liver.In naive NG108-15 cells, activation of PKC produces the tolerant phenotype of adenosine transport (Fig. 1), but ethanol-induced tolerance can be reversed by activating PKA. These observations are best explained by an indirect mechanism of action for PKC with protein phosphatase(s) 1 and/or 2A as intermediates (Fig. 6). We propose that PKC activates a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the PKA-phosphorylated site on the transporter or an associated regulatory protein producing the ethanol-insensitive phenotype. In support of this model, we found that inhibition of PKA activity produces an ethanol-tolerant phenotype only if protein phosphatase(s) 1 and/or 2A are active (4Coe I.R. Dohrman D.P. Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 365-369Google Scholar); in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, inhibiting PKA activity had no effect on ethanol sensitivity of transport. Therefore, ethanol sensitivity of transport appears to be due to a balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. In naive cells, phosphorylation predominates. Phosphatase activity predominates after inhibition of PKA activity or after chronic ethanol exposure. Phosphatase activity could be stimulated directly by PKC as described for the receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase RPTPα (26Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Google Scholar) or indirectly by phosphorylation and inactivation of a phosphatase inhibitor protein as described for β-PMA activation of protein phosphatase 1 in L6 cells (27Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16662-16667Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKC by chelerythrine or down-regulation of PKC by PMA in cells exposed chronically to ethanol would be expected to prevent activation of the phosphatase by PKC, leaving the PKA-phosphorylated site intact and resulting in an ethanol-sensitive phenotype.PKC is a family of isozymes of which at least five are expressed in NG108-15 cells (Fig. 3A). Beckmann et al. (28Beckmann R. Lindschau C. Haller H. Hucho F. Buchner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 335-343Google Scholar) did not detect β1 in NG108-15 cells. This may reflect the difference in culture medium in which the cells are grown. We found that the amounts of α, δ, and ϵ were increased after chronic exposure to ethanol (Fig. 3B). Although we have not measured PKC activity directly, an increase in PKC activity correlated with increased amounts of α, δ, and ϵ PKC after chronic exposure of PC12 cells to ethanol (7Messing R.O. Petersen P.J. Henrich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23428-23432Google Scholar). Since chelerythrine inhibited both PKC activity and the ethanol-induced increase in amounts of δ and ϵ PKC, it remains to be determined whether increases in PKC amount or PKC activity, per se, are required for the development of tolerance of adenosine transport.In addition to changes in the amount or activity of PKA, PKC, or possibly protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, ethanol might alter the intracellular localization of these enzymes, thus altering their function. Recent evidence suggests that the localization of intracellular signaling enzymes determines their specificity of action (29Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Google Scholar, 30Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Google Scholar, 31Inagaki N. Ito M. Nakano T. Inagaki M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 448-452Google Scholar). PKA (32Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Google Scholar), protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (30Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Google Scholar), and specific isozymes of PKC (33Disatnik M.-H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Google Scholar) have unique locations within a number of cell lines including NG108-15 cells (28Beckmann R. Lindschau C. Haller H. Hucho F. Buchner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 335-343Google Scholar). Ethanol has been shown to cause translocation of PKC activity from cytosolic to membrane fractions in astroglial cells (34Skwish S. Shain W. Life Sci. 1990; 47: 1037-1042Google Scholar), human lymphocytes (5DePetrillo P.B. Liou C.S. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 351-354Google Scholar), and epidermal keratinocytes (6Kharbanda S. Nakamura T. Kufe D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 675-681Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ethanol may modulate the balance of PKA, PKC, and protein phosphatase activities by altering their localization in NG108-15 cells. Such changes may contribute to the development of ethanol tolerance. INTRODUCTIONWe have presented evidence that the cAMP signaling system is important for regulating the response to ethanol in a cell culture model of tolerance. We found that ethanol acts on a specific nucleoside transporter in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells (1Krauss S.W. Ghirnikar R.B. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1021-1026Google Scholar), inhibiting adenosine uptake (2Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Casso D.J. Franklin C. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1946-1951Google Scholar). In cells treated chronically with ethanol, however, adenosine uptake becomes insensitive when rechallenged with acute ethanol, and adenosine uptake is no longer inhibited by ethanol (2Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Casso D.J. Franklin C. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1946-1951Google Scholar). The loss of ethanol sensitivity is an example of ethanol tolerance at a cellular level. Using this model system, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate tolerance to ethanol.We have shown that ethanol inhibition of adenosine uptake requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateANOVAanalysis of variance. activity; ethanol does not inhibit adenosine uptake in mutant cells lacking PKA activity (3Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 812-817Google Scholar). We also found that the ethanol sensitivity of transport in cells chronically exposed to ethanol can be restored by activating PKA (4Coe I.R. Dohrman D.P. Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 365-369Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibition of PKA in naive cells reproduces the ethanol-tolerant phenotype. This latter effect can be prevented by inhibiting protein phosphatase activity with okadaic acid (4Coe I.R. Dohrman D.P. Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 365-369Google Scholar), suggesting that protein phosphatase (1 or 2A) is also involved in regulating the ethanol sensitivity of adenosine uptake. Based on this earlier work, we concluded that ethanol sensitivity of adenosine uptake appears to be due to a balance of PKA and phosphatase activities.Recent evidence also implicates protein kinase C (PKC) in cellular responses to ethanol. On acute exposure to ethanol, PKC activity increases in human lymphocytes (5DePetrillo P.B. Liou C.S. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 351-354Google Scholar) and epidermal keratinocytes (6Kharbanda S. Nakamura T. Kufe D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 675-681Google Scholar). Moreover, chronic exposure to ethanol causes increased PKC activity in NG108-15 and PC12 cells (7Messing R.O. Petersen P.J. Henrich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23428-23432Google Scholar). PKC also regulates the ethanol sensitivity of GABAA receptors (8Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 113-117Google Scholar, 9Weiner J.L. Zhang L. Carlen P.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

We therefore investigated the role of PKC in the regulation of ethanol sensitivity of adenosine transport. We found that activation of PKC produces the tolerant phenotype in naive cells and that inhibition or down-regulation of PKC during chronic exposure to ethanol prevents the development of tolerance. Our results suggest that PKC activity is required for the development of tolerance of adenosine transport after chronic exposure to ethanol.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1021-1026Google Scholar). Acute ethanol inhibition of adenosine uptake via this transporter leads to activation of adenosine A2 receptors and a cascade of intracellular signaling events leading to tolerance of adenosine transport on rechallenge with ethanol (2Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Casso D.J. Franklin C. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1946-1951Google Scholar). We found that adenosine uptake is not inhibited by ethanol in mutant cells lacking PKA activity (3Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Mol.

Inhibition of PKC by chelerythrine or down-regulation of PKC by PMA in cells exposed chronically to ethanol would be expected to prevent activation of the phosphatase by PKC, leaving the PKA-phosphorylated site intact and resulting in an ethanol-sensitive phenotype. PKC is a family of isozymes of which at least five are expressed in NG108-15 cells (Fig. 3A). Beckmann et al. (28Beckmann R. Lindschau C. Haller H. Hucho F. Buchner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 335-343Google Scholar) did not detect β1 in NG108-15 cells. This may reflect the difference in culture medium in which the cells are grown. We found that the amounts of α, δ, and ϵ were increased after chronic exposure to ethanol (Fig. 3B). Although we have not measured PKC activity directly, an increase in PKC activity correlated with increased amounts of α, δ, and ϵ PKC after chronic exposure of PC12 cells to ethanol (7Messing R.O. Petersen P.J. Henrich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23428-23432Google Scholar). Since chelerythrine inhibited both PKC activity and the ethanol-induced increase in amounts of δ and ϵ PKC, it remains to be determined whether increases in PKC amount or PKC activity, per se, are required for the development of tolerance of adenosine transport. In addition to changes in the amount or activity of PKA, PKC, or possibly protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, ethanol might alter the intracellular localization of these enzymes, thus altering their function. Recent evidence suggests that the localization of intracellular signaling enzymes determines their specificity of action (29Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Google Scholar, 30Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Google Scholar, 31Inagaki N. Ito M. Nakano T. Inagaki M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 448-452Google Scholar). PKA (32Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol.

Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Google Scholar) have unique locations within a number of cell lines including NG108-15 cells (28Beckmann R. Lindschau C. Haller H. Hucho F. Buchner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 335-343Google Scholar). Ethanol has been shown to cause translocation of PKC activity from cytosolic to membrane fractions in astroglial cells (34Skwish S. Shain W. Life Sci. 1990; 47: 1037-1042Google Scholar), human lymphocytes (5DePetrillo P.B. Liou C.S. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 351-354Google Scholar), and epidermal keratinocytes (6Kharbanda S. Nakamura T. Kufe D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 675-681Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ethanol may modulate the balance of PKA, PKC, and protein phosphatase activities by altering their localization in NG108-15 cells. Such changes may contribute to the development of ethanol tolerance. We thank Drs. Daria Mochly-Rosen and Robert Messing for many invaluable discussions and Drs. Ulrike Heberlein, Michael Miles, and Robert Messing, as well as members of the laboratory, for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2033269692,"The cDNAs encoding a new α2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia V) were cloned from a mouse brain cDNA library by means of a polymerase chain reaction-based method using the nucleotide sequence information on mouse ST8Sia I (GD3 synthase) and mouse ST8Sia III (Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcα2,8-sialyltransferase), both of which exhibit activity toward glycolipids. The predicted amino acid sequence of ST8Sia V shows 36.1% and 15.0% identity to those of mouse ST8Sia I and III, respectively. The recombinant protein A-fused ST8Sia V expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited an α2,8-sialyltransferase activity toward GM1b, GD1a, GT1b, and GD3, and synthesized GD1c, GT1a, GQ1b, and GT3, respectively. The apparent Km values for GM1b, GD1a, GT1b and GD3 were 1.1, 0.082, 0.070, and 0.28 mM, respectively. However, ST8Sia V did not exhibit activity toward GM3. Thus, the substrate specificity of ST8Sia V is different from those of ST8Sia I and III, both of which exhibit activity toward GM3. Transfection of the ST8Sia V gene into COS-7 cells, which express GD1a as a major glycolipid, led to the expression of determinants for monoclonal antibody 4F10, which recognizes GT1a and GQ1b, suggesting that ST8Sia V exhibits activity toward gangliosides GD1a and/or GT1b in vivo. The expression of the ST8Sia V gene was tissue- and developmental stage-specific, and was clearly different from those of other α2,8-sialyltransferase genes. The ST8Sia V gene was strongly expressed in the brain and weakly in other tissues such as the liver. In addition, its expression was greater in the adult than fetal brain. These results strongly indicate that ST8Sia V is a candidate for SAT-V, the α2,8-sialyltransferase involved in GD1c, GT1a, GQ1b, and GT3 synthesis.

Gangliosides comprise a structurally diverse subset of sialylated glycosphingolipids that are abundantly expressed in the brain (1Ando S. Neurochem. Int. 1983; 5: 507-537Google Scholar). The biological roles of gangliosides are becoming increasingly appreciated, particularly in regard to intercellular adhesion, immune modulation, growth control, and receptor function (2Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar). Ganglioside biosynthesis takes place in the Golgi apparatus where, starting with Glc-Cer, it progresses with the sequential addition of Gal, GalNAc, and Sia to the growing oligosaccharide chain. These reactions are catalyzed by specific glycosyltransferases. Many of these enzyme activities have been studied and partially characterized in rat liver Golgi membrane fractions. These studies suggested a scheme for ganglioside biosynthesis (Scheme 1, Table I) (3Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7044-7048Google Scholar, 4Iber H. Echten G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 115-120Google Scholar, 5Iber H. Zacharias C. Sandhoff K.

The abbreviated nomenclature for cloned sialyltransferases follows the system of Tsuji et al. (27Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar).

GD3, and GT3 synthase activities (SAT-I, -II, and -III) can be discriminated on the basis of the enzymatic characteristics. However, a competition-based assay suggested that each of galactosyltransferase II (GalT-II), GalNAc transferase, SAT-IV and -V activity is due to a sole enzyme, respectively. In addition, SAT-V activity was reported to synthesize GT3 from GD3 (5Iber H. Zacharias C. Sandhoff K.

To clarify the biosynthesis of gangliosides, it is necessary to clone, express, and characterize the enzymes corresponding to the activities in the Golgi membrane fractions. In the case of GalNAc-T, the results for knockout mice as to GalNAc-T clearly suggested that GalNAc-T activity is due to a sole enzyme. 2K. Furukawa, personal communication. However, the situation in the case of α2,8-sialyltransferase groups is more complicated. In 1994, three groups including ours cloned GD3 synthase (ST8Sia I) by the expression cloning method (6Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsuji S. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15950-15956Google Scholar, 7Nara K. Watanabe Y. Maruyama K. Kasaharam K. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7952-7956Google Scholar, 8Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Loys K.O. Shuku H. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10455-10459Google Scholar). One group reported that GD3 synthase exhibits SAT-V activity (9Watanabe Y. Nara K. Yakahashi H. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 555Google Scholar). Recently, GT3 synthase was cloned by the expression cloning method and its nucleotide sequence was shown to be identical to that of GD3 synthase, indicating that GD3 and GT3 are synthesized by a single enzyme (10Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A. Sasaki K. Nishi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3684-3691Google Scholar). These observations may lead to the conclusion that only one α2,8-sialyltransferase, ST8Sia I, is responsible for the biosynthesis of all α2,8-sialic acid linkages in gangliosides. However, the following evidence suggests that plural α2,8-sialyltransferases are responsible for the activities of SAT-II, -III, and -V, respectively. (i) ST8Sia III also exhibits activity toward GM3 and GD3 in vitro (11Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar). (ii) In the rat liver Golgi membrane fractions, the activities of SAT-II and -V were clearly distinguished enzymatically (4Iber H. Echten G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 115-120Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown in this paper, the apparent Km values of mouse ST8Sia I for GD1a, GT1b, and GD3 are much higher than those observed for the Golgi membrane fractions. Thus, it is possible that there are other α2,8-sialyltransferases that synthesize GT3, GT1a and/or GQ1b more specifically, like the activity of SAT-V, even though GD3 synthase can transfer all α2,8-linked sialic acid residues in gangliosides. According to this consideration, we tried to clone new ganglioside-specific α2,8-sialyltransferases, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach and the sequence information on mouse ST8Sia I and ST8Sia III, both of which exhibit activity toward glycolipids. In this article, we will describe evidence for the occurrence of an α2,8-sialyltransferase similar to SAT-V/III. Some glycosphingolipis (lactosylceramide, GM3, GD3, GM1, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b, and asialo-GM1) and Triton-CF-54 were purchased from Sigma, CMP-[14C]NeuAc (11.8 GBq/mmol) was from Amersham Corp, IgG-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc., NANase II was from Glyko Inc. and sialidase from Vibrio cholerae was from Boehringer Mannheim. GM1b (Siaα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer) was synthesized from asialo-GM1 by the enzymatic reaction of recombinant mouse ST3Gal I, which exhibits activity toward Galβ1,3GalNAc sequences of glycoproteins and glycolipids (12Lee Y.-C. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Nakaoka T. Tsuji S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 377-385Google Scholar), followed by the purification on a Silica-Gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck). 2,3-Sialylparagloboside (2,3-SPG; Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer) was kindly provided by Dr. Iwamori (University of Tokyo). PCR was performed with degenerate primers (5′-primer P2O3-L, TGTGC(G/T)GTGGT(G/T)GGAAAC(A/G)GTGG(A/G)AT(C/T)(C/T)TG; 3′-primer, P2O3-S, GGCCAGAA(A/G)CC(A/G)TA(G/C)A(A/T)G(G/T)(A/G)(G/C)A(C/T)CTC(C/T)TC(A/G)CA) deduced from conserved regions in mouse ST8Sia I (GD3 synthase) and ST8Sia III (Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcα2,8-sialyltransferase) (Fig. 1). The cDNA synthesized from total RNA of 3-day-old mouse brains was used as a template for PCR. The cycling parameters for PCR were 94°C for 40 s, 37°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min for the first 5 cycles, and 94°C for 40 s, 55°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min for the following 30 cycles. The 0.5-kb PCR products were blunt-ended, kinated, and then subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC119. The subclones were characterized by sequencing. Approximately 106 plaques of an adult mouse brain cDNA library were screened with the 0.5-kb PCR fragments. Standard molecular cloning techniques described by Maniatis et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used. Truncated forms of ST8Sia V, lacking the first 35 amino acids of the open reading frame, were prepared by PCR amplification using three kinds of ST8Sia V derivatives, namely ST8Sia V-L, -M and -S, as template with 5′- and 3′-primers containing a XhoI site, i.e. 5′-primer P4-Sec (5′-GATCCTGTACAGCAAGAGCTACATCAAAA-3′) and 3′-primer P4-Tail (5′-CAGGAGTCGAGACACCCATGGCAGGCCTGGT-3′). The resulting amplified and digested 1171-, 1063-, and 970-bp XhoI fragments were inserted into the XhoI site of expression vector pcDSA (6Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsuji S. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15950-15956Google Scholar). The insert junctions were confirmed by restriction enzyme and DNA sequencing. These resulting plasmids consisted of the IgM signal peptide sequence, the protein A IgG binding domain, and the truncated forms of ST8Sia V-L, -M, and -S, respectively. Each expression plasmid (10 μg) was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells on a 100-mm plate by the DEAE-dextran method. After 48 h, the cell culture medium was collected and protein A-ST8Sia V expressed in medium was adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose gel (Pharmacia; 25 μl of resin/50 ml of culture medium) at 4°C for 16 h. The complex of IgG-Sepharose gel and the enzyme fused with protein A was used as the enzyme source. The reaction mixture comprised 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 M CMP-[14C]NeuAc (3.6 nCi), various amounts of glycolipids, 0.3% Triton CF-54, and 2 μl of enzyme preparation in a total volume of 10 μl. After incubation at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The enzyme reaction was performed within the time that the reaction proceeded linearly. Incubation times for ST8Sia I, III, and V were 15 min, 4 h, and 4 h, respectively. For the separation [14C]NeuAc conjugated glycolipids and CMP-[14C]NeuAc, the reaction mixtures were applied on C-18 columns (Sep-Pak Vac, 100 mg; Waters, Milford, MA), which had been washed with water and 0.1 M KCl. The C-18 columns were then washed again with water, and the glycolipids were eluted with methanol. The methanol solutions were dried up, and then the residues were subjected to HPTLC with solvent systems of chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10) and n-propanol/28% ammonia solution/water (75:5:25). The radioactive materials in the glycolipids were visualized with a BAS 2000 radioimage analyzer (Fuji Film). For linkage analysis of sialic acid, GT1b sialylated with ST8Sia V was purified by C-18 column chromatography and dried. The sialylated GT1b was dissolved in 0.1% Triton X-100 and then digested with linkage-specific sialidase, NANase II (specific for α2,3- and α2.6-linked sialic acids, 5 units/ml) or V. cholerae sialidase (specific for α2, 3-, α2.6-, and α2.8-linked sialic acids, 1 unit/ml). After digestion, desialylated glycolipid was purified by C-18 column chromatography, dried, and subjected to HPTLC with solvent systems of chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10). Total RNA (5 μg) was fractionated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%) and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran; Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was prehybridized in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5 × saline-sodium phosphate-EDTA solution, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium lauryl sarcosine, and 10 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 37°C for 2 h. Hybridization was performed overnight at 45°C with a 32P-labeled DNA probe made by the random priming method. The full-length ST8Sia V-M cDNA (1128 bp) was used as a probe. The membrane was washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C, in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C, and finally in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. RT-PCR was performed with cDNA synthesized from total RNA (5 μg), and 5′- and 3′-primers for ST8Sia V and G3PDH (ST8Sia V 5′-primer P4C1, 5′-GCGGGAAGGAGATCAACAGCGCT-3′, nucleotides 641-663; ST8Sia V 3′-primer, 5′-CAGGAGTCGAGACACCCATGGCAGGCCTGGT-3′, complementary to the ST8Sia V cording strand nucleotides 1243-1273; G3PDH 5′-primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, nucleotides 526-547; G3PDH 3′-primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′, complementary to the G3PDH cording strand nucleotides 958-977). The cycling parameters for PCR for ST8Sia V and G3PDH were 94°C for 40 s, 55°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles or 18 cycles, respectively. Recently, four types of α2,8-sialyltransferase genes were cloned (6Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsuji S. Nishi T. J. Biol.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 664-685Google Scholar, 16Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M. Beethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerady-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar), two of which, ST8Sia I (GD3 synthase) and ST8Sia III, exhibit activity toward α2,3-sialylated glycosphingolipids. To isolate the gene encoding a new α2,8-sialyltransferase involved in ganglioside biosynthesis, we conducted PCR cloning experiments with two degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on two highly conserved regions, sialyl motifs L and S, of mouse ST8Sia I and ST8Sia III (11Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar), and a mouse cDNA library. In order to exclude fragments of ST8Sia I and III, we digested the amplified fragment with BglII and HindIII, whose restriction sites are present in the amplified fragments (0.5 kb) of ST8Sia I and ST8Sia III, respectively, and then another PCR was performed using the same primers and the BglII/HindIII-resistant fragment as a template. The PCR product corresponding to a 0.5-kb fragment was subcloned and sequenced. Among several clones, one clone, pCRP4, encoded a peptide exhibiting 47.9% and 22.5% identity to mouse ST8Sia I and ST8Sia III, respectively. This fragment, pCRP4, was used as a probe to screen an adult mouse brain cDNA library. Several overlapping clones were obtained and sequenced (Fig. 1). cDNAs of three different lengths were cloned, named P4-L, P4-M and P4-S. Among nine clones, six clones were P4-M, two clones were P4-L, and only one clone was P4-S. P4-L, -M, and -S encode proteins of 412, 376, and 345 amino acids, respectively, each of which exhibits a type II transmembrane topology, consisting of a NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a proline-rich stem region, and a large COOH-terminal active domain, and contains two highly conserved regions, namely sialyl motifs L and S, like all so far cloned sialyltransferases (Fig. 1). The predicted amino acid sequence encoded by P4-M exhibits 36.1% and 15.1% identity to the mouse ST8Sia I and III genes, respectively. No similarity, except in sialyl motifs L and S, was observed as compared with other types of sialyltransferases. As described in the following sections, P4-L, -M, and -S encode the α2,8-sialyltransferases, which exhibit the same substrate specificities, and we designated them as ST8Sia V (-L, -M, and -S). The only difference between the three cDNAs was found in the putative stem region of the proteins (Fig. 1), deletions of 36 and 67 amino acids in the stem region of ST8Sia V-L (residues 44-79 and residues 44-110) being observed in ST8Sia-M and -S, respectively. The nucleotide sequences in other regions of the three cDNAs were completely the same (Fig. 1). In order to compare the quantity of gene expression among the three kinds of ST8Sia V in adult mouse brain, RT-PCR was performed using cDNA synthesized from adult brain total RNA, 5′-primer P4-Sec, of which sequence is upstream of a position occurred the deletion, and 3′-primer P4-Tail. The ST8Sia V-M gene was amplified most effectively, suggesting that ST8Sia V-M was considered to be abundantly expressed in adult mouse brain (data not shown). The expression of the ST8Sia V gene in several mouse tissues was analyzed by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. The probe and primers (5′-primer P4C1 and 3′-primer P4Tail) using these experiments can detect three kinds of transcript but not distinguish the difference among these length. In adult mouse tissues, a strong signal corresponding to 2.3 kb was observed in brain and a weak signal of the same size was observed in testis (Fig. 2A). These signals for the ST8Sia V gene were hardly detected in other tissues, including adult liver by Northern blot analysis. However, RT-PCR analysis indicated that transcripts were expressed in mouse liver, lung, placenta, and spleen, in addition to brain and testis (Fig. 2C). Expression of the gene was first observed in embryonic 14-day brain, and then increased up to postnatal 7-week brain (Fig. 2B). To facilitate determination of the enzymatic activity of the new sialyltransferase, we constructed an expression plasmid, pcDSA-ST8Sia V-M, which allows expression of the COOH-terminal portion of ST8Sia V-M as a secretable protein fused with the IgG-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (6Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsuji S. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15950-15956Google Scholar, 11Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar). The plasmid was then transfected into COS-7 cells, and the protein A-fused ST8Sia V-M expressed in the medium was adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose resin, which was used as the enzyme source. In view of the sequence similarity between sialyl motifs L and S of ST8Sia V and I, we examined the sialyltransferase activity toward several gangliosides. As shown in Fig. 3, 14C-sialic acids were incorporated into GD3, GD1a, and GT1b by ST8Sia V-M and their products comigrated with authentic GT3, GT1a, and GQ1b, respectively, on HPTLC with two different solvent systems (chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10) and n-propanol/28% ammonia solution/water (75:5:25)). ST8Sia V-M also exhibited activity toward GM1b (Siaα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer), 2,3-sialylparagloboside (2,3-SPG; Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer), and probably toward GQ1b, in addition to GD1a, GT1b, and GD3 (Fig. 3). However, it was surprising that ST8Sia V did not exhibit activity toward GM3 (Siaα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1Cer) (Fig. 3). Since ST8Sia I and III were shown to exhibit the activity toward GM3 as an acceptor together with other glycolipids including 2,3-SPG (9Watanabe Y. Nara K. Yakahashi H. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 555Google Scholar, 11Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar), ST8Sia V was enzymatically distinguishable from ST8Sia I and III. As shown in Fig. 4, the product co-migrated with authentic GQ1b was resistant to the treatment with α2,3- and α2,6-specific sialidase, but was completely digested by the treatment with V. cholerae sialidase, which cleaves all types of sialic acid linkages, suggesting that the incorporated sialic acids contained α2,8-linkages. The substrate specificities of the other forms (ST8Sia V-L and -S) were compared with that of ST8Sia V-M. Soluble recombinant ST8Sia V-L and -S also exhibited activity toward GD1a, GT1b, GM1b, and GD3. The apparent Km values for GT1b and GM1b of ST8Sia V-L and -S were almost the same as those of ST8Sia V-M (Table II). Therefore, the substrate specificity and preference of ST8Sia V were not affected by the length of the putative stem region. The results indicated that three forms of ST8Sia V showed similar activity to SAT-V, which has been shown to exhibit α2,8-sialyltransferase activity toward GD1a, GT1b, GM1b, and GD3 in the rat liver Golgi apparatus.Table IIApparent Km values for GM1b and GT1b of ST8Sia V-L, -M, and -SKm (mM)LMSmMGM1b1.01.11.0GT1b0.0680.0700.072 Open table in a new tab To examine the in vivo activity of ST8Sia V, the ST8Sia V gene was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, which express GD1a as a major ganglioside, and then cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody, 4F10, which equally recognizes GT1a and GQ1b (17Yamamoto H. Tsuji S. Nagai Y. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 513-517Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, some of the ST8Sia V gene-transfected cells were positively stained with 4F10, whereas the cells transfected with the same vector without an insert were not stained. It has been reported that GD3 synthase (ST8Sia I) cloned from human exhibited GT3 synthase activity in addition to GD3 synthase activity in vivo and in vitro (6Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N.

On the other hand, ST8Sia III can also produce GD3 and GT3 from GM3 and GD3, respectively, in vitro (11Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar). In view of the fact that ST8Sia V exhibits GT3 synthase (SAT-III) activity and SAT-V activity, similar to ST8Sia I or III, we compared the acceptor substrate specificity of the protein A-fused soluble ST8Sia V with those of the protein A-fused soluble ST8Sia I and III. As shown in Table III, the soluble ST8Sia I, III, and V showed broad activities toward most gangliosides tested. However, the Km value for each substrate was characteristic of each enzyme. In the case of ST8Sia V, the Km values for GD1a and GT1b were very low (70-80 μM), that for GD3 was medium (about 300 μM), and those for GM1b and 2,3-SPG were relatively high (over 1000 μM), indicating that ST8Sia V exhibits a substrate preference for GD1a and GT1b rather than GD3, 2,3-SPG, or GM1b. On the other hand, the Km values for GD1a, GT1b, GD3, and 2,3-SPG of ST8Sia I were very high (2-5 mM) compared to that for GM3 (30 μM). ST8Sia III exhibited only very low activity toward GD1a and GT1b, showing the lowest Km value toward 2,3-SPG. Thus, GM3 was a much more suitable acceptor for ST8Sia I than GD3, GD1a, or GT1b, and 2,3-SPG served as the best acceptor for ST8Sia III in vitro. The Vmax/Km values indicated that GT1b and GD1a served as much better acceptors for ST8Sia V than ST8Sia I or III. In addition, the apparent Km values of the three sialyltransferases for GD3 (280 μM for ST8Sia V, and 3-5 mM for ST8Sia I and III) indicated that ST8Sia V is a candidate for GT3 synthase.Table IIIApparent Km and relative Vmax valuesAcceptorKmVmaxVmax/KmmMST8Sia VGM3NDNDNDGD30.281657GM1b1.16761GD1a0.08260730GT1b0.0701001400SPG1.08080ST8SiaIGM30.0301003300GM1bNTNTNTGD35.05010GD1a5.07816GT1b2.07839SPG2.25224ST8Sia IIIGM30.594068GM1bNTNTNTGD33.36620GD1aNCNCNCGT1bNCNCNCSPG0.0821001200 Open table in a new tab We cloned three cDNAs encoding new α2,8-sialyltransferases (ST8Sia V-L, -M, and -S) from a mouse brain cDNA library by a PCR-based approach using the sequence information on the sialyl motifs of ST8Sia I and III, which exhibit activity toward gangliosides. The putative amino acid sequences revealed that the three types of ST8Sia V had putative stem regions of different length. The different lengths of the stem region may result of alternative splicing. Several genomic organization of sialyltransferase genes have been reported and some of them occur the splicing at stem region (ST6Gal I, ST6GalNAc II, ST3Gal I and IV, and ST8Sia III) (18Svensson E.C. Soreghan B. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20863-20868Google Scholar, 19Kurosawa N. Inoue M. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15109-15116Google Scholar, 20Chang M.-L. Eddy R.L.

Taguchi A. Arita N. Kojima N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The length of the stem region may affect the substrate specificity and/or preference, but, as far as seen in an in vitro assay, there are no differences in substrate specificity and/or preference within experimental error (Table II). Northern blot analysis indicated that expression of the ST8Sia V gene was completely different from that of the ST8Sia I and III genes. ST8Sia V was strongly expressed in brain with age, but low in other tissues, as shown in Fig. 2. Enzymatic analysis with the protein A-fused soluble ST8Sia V revealed that mouse ST8Sia V exhibited similar activity to SAT-V observed in the rat liver Golgi fractions, as follows. (i) ST8Sia V synthesizes GT1a, GQ1b, GD1c, and GT3 from GD1a, GT1b, GM1b, and GD3, respectively, but not GD3 from GM3, just like SAT-V (4Iber H. Echten G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 115-120Google Scholar, 5Iber H. Zacharias C. Sandhoff K. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 137-142Google Scholar). (ii) The apparent Km values of the recombinant soluble ST8Sia V for GD1a (82 μM), GT1b (70 μM), GM1b (1.1 mM), and GD3 (280 μM) were comparable with those observed in the rat liver Golgi fractions (10-30 μM for GD1a and GT1b, about 500 μM for GM1b, and 130 μM for GD3) (4Iber H. Echten G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 115-120Google Scholar, 5Iber H. Zacharias C. Sandhoff K. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 137-142Google Scholar). (iii) Transient transfection of the mouse ST8Sia V gene into COS-7 cells led to the expression of GT1a/GQ1b. Comparison of the substrate specificities of ST8Sia I, III, and V demonstrated that the in vitro specificities of these cloned α2,8-sialyltransferases for glycolipids were rather broader than those of other sialyltransferases so far cloned, and almost completely overlapped each other, most α2,3-sialylated glycolipids serving as in vitro acceptor substrates for the three enzymes. It has been demonstrated that human ST8Sia I (GD3 synthase) also exhibits SAT-V activity (9Watanabe Y. Nara K. Yakahashi H. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 555Google Scholar). Mouse ST8Sia I as well as mouse ST8Sia V actually synthesized GT1a and GQ1b from GD1a and GT1b, and mouse ST8Sia III exhibited weak activity toward GD1a and GT1b in vitro. However, the apparent Km values for GD1a and GT1b of mouse ST8Sia V are 100 times lower than those of mouse ST8Sia I. Therefore, mouse ST8Sia V is a much better candidate for GT1a/GQ1b synthase (SAT-V) than mouse ST8Sia I or III. Similarly, mouse ST8Sia V is a much better candidate for GT3 synthase among the three α2,8-sialyltransferases, based on the Km values for GD3 (280 μM for ST8Sia V, and 3-5 mM for ST8Sia I and III), although ST8Sia I, III, and V can produce GT3 from GD3 in vitro. However, the occurrence of a distinct enzyme (SAT-III), which is more specific for GD3, is possible. Recently, another possibility for GT3 synthesis was proposed. Nakayama et al. (10Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A. Sasaki K. Nishi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3684-3691Google Scholar) reported that GT3 was directly synthesized from GM3 by a single GD3/GT3 synthase, which is the same as human GD3 synthase (ST8Sia I), through the transfer of multiple α2,8-sialic acids, as judged from the results as to in vitro enzyme activity and the expression of GT3 through the transfection of the human GD3 synthase gene into several cells. This pathway may be possible, because another α2,8-sialyltransferase, ST8Sia II or IV, as a single enzyme has been shown to transfer multiple α2,8-sialic acid residues on α2,3-sialylated N-glycosylated glycoproteins, particularly on the neural cell adhesion molecule, yielding polysialic acid chains (15Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 664-685Google Scholar, 23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 119-122Google Scholar, 24Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Google Scholar). We examined the direct production of GT3 from GM3 in vitro by mouse ST8Sia I, but GT3 was hardly synthesized when GM3 was used as an acceptor substrate. 2M. Kono, N. Kojima, and S. Tsuji, unpublished observation. This inconsistency may be due to differences in the enzyme source and/or assay conditions. On the other hand, when the mouse ST8Sia I gene was transfected into mouse melanoma B16 cells, which express GM3 but not the ST8Sia III or V gene, with a strong virus promoter, GT3 as well as GD3 was expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, the mouse ST8Sia III gene transfection also led to the expression of GD3 and GT3 on the cell surface. Similarly, GT1a/GQ1b was expressed on the surface of COS-7 cells by the transfection of not only the mouse ST8Sia V gene but also the mouse ST8Sia I and III genes.3 Since the substrate specificities of the cloned α2,8-sialyltransferases are rather broad in vitro, it is possible that multiple enzymes co-function in a single step of the ganglioside pathway in the Golgi network. To confirm the in vivo specificity of cloned enzymes, especially sialyltransferases, it is important to determine the localization of the cloned enzymes in the Golgi network in addition to expression of specific carbohydrates through transfection of glycosyltransferase genes. We are very grateful to Dr. Hong Liu who carefully read and improved the language of the manuscript."

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), another member of the growth factor family operating via receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase, is shown in the present work to stimulate in vivo the phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Analysis of tryptic digests prepared from phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptors of IGF-1-treated, metabolically labeled smooth muscle cells was performed using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, two-dimensional peptide mapping, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results of these separate analyses reveal that IGF-1 stimulates phosphorylation predominantly on tyrosyl residues Y132/141 of the second intracellular loop of the β2-adrenergic receptor rather than the C-terminal region targeted by the activated insulin receptor (Y350/354, Y364), although both growth factors block β-adrenergic agonist action.

The tryptic eluate was then separated on a microbore HPLC (Applied Biosystems) using a 220-mm Aquapore OD-300 column and a gradient of acetonitrile (0-50% in 45 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and counted for Cerenkov radiation. Tryptic digests of β2-adrenergic receptor isolated from metabolically labeled cells (see above) and phosphorylated synthetic peptide markers (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P.

The peaks identified in the HPLC eluates of tryptic digests were subjected to two-dimensional peptide mapping on cellulose thin-layer plates (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P.

An aliquot (10 μl) of the tryptic eluate was spotted onto a TLC plate and subjected to high voltage (1000 V) electrophoresis for 60 min in a buffer composed of formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water (50:156:1794, pH 1.9). Following electrophoresis, the TLC plate was air-dried overnight and then subjected to chromatography (at a right angle to the direction of electrophoresis) in a phosphochromatography buffer composed of 1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (15:10:3:12). The plates were dried and the peptides identified by autoradiography (14Hadcock J.R. Ros M. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14784-14790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic digests of the β2-adrenergic receptor were prepared as described above. Phosphopeptides then were purified from the tryptic digest by ferric chelation chromatography (17Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tryptic eluates were dried and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 1 M NaCl, pH 5.5). The samples were loaded onto a column of IDA beads (Pierce) charged with ferric chloride. Following adsorption of the sample, the column was washed with buffer A and again with buffer B (50 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.0) and then washed with buffer C (500 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0) to release the phosphopeptides. The samples were dried, washed several times with water to rid them of salts, and then subjected to mass analysis using a Bruker Protein MALDI TOF mass spectrometer fitted with a UV nitrogen laser of 337 nM and a pulse length of 3 ns. The samples were mixed with the matrix sinapinic acid and 2-μl aliquots spotted for analysis. The molecular mass was determined for each peak of the MALDI TOF mass spectrum. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates 48 h before each experiment. On the day of the experiment, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was aspirated and the cells washed and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 10 μM Ro-201724 (cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor). Cells were challenged with isoproterenol (10 μM) in the absence and presence of IGF-1 (100 nM) or with IGF-1 alone for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of HCl (0.1 M final). Cyclic AMP accumulation was measured using a competition binding assay (18Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. Kerman K. Gitomer W. Pilch P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated the ability of activated purified IGF-1 receptor to catalyze phosphorylation of recombinant β2-adrenergic receptor in a reconstituted in vitro system (7Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we explored whether the β2-adrenergic receptor was indeed phosphorylated in DDT1MF-2 hamster vas deferens smooth muscle cells stimulated with IGF-1. First we investigated the effect of IGF-1 treatment on the ability of the β-catecholamine isoproterenol to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation in these cells. Isoproterenol (10 μM) stimulated a 6-fold increase in cyclic AMP accumulation (Table I). Although failing to alter cyclic AMP levels by itself, IGF-1 (100 nM) effectively abolished the rise in intracellular cyclic AMP stimulated by isoproterenol, demonstrating the cross-regulatory effects of this insulin-like growth factor on catecholamine action. For study of phosphorylation, cells first were labeled metabolically with [32P]Pi, washed, and then stimulated with IGF-1 (Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation of the β2-adrenergic receptor from metabolically labeled cells subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveal “basal” phosphorylation of β2-adrenergic receptor in the absence of IGF-1 or insulin as previously noted (3Port J.D.

IGF-1 stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor in these smooth muscle cells in culture. The phosphorylation of receptor peaked at 10 nM IGF-1, resulting in a doubling of the content of phosphate.Table IIGF-1 abolishes β2-adrenergic agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulationTreatmentCyclic AMP accumulationpmol/105 cellsNone0.3 ± 0.1Isoproterenol, 10 μM5.3 ± 1.0IGF-1, 100 nM0.4 ± 0.2Isoproterenol, 10 μM+ IGF-1, 100 nM1.3 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab The time course for IGF-1 stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation in DDT1MF-2 cells was explored. Phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor nearly doubles within 30 s of stimulation of the cells with 100 nM IGF-1 (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation reaches a peak value within 2 min and declines from 5 min thereafter. By 10 min, the phosphorylation declines to near base-line values, revealing the transient nature of the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation. The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation was determined. In units of mol Pi/mol β2-adrenergic receptor, basal unstimulated phosphorylation is 0.8 ± 0.2, whereas that stimulated by 10 nM IGF-1 is 1.6 ± 0.5 (n = 4, p ≤ 0.05 for the difference).

Metabolically labeled β2-adrenergic receptor from control and IGF-1-stimulated DDT1MF-2 cells were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, subjected to digestion with trypsin, and the tryptic digests resolved by reversed-phase HPLC as developed earlier (6Karoor V.

In the absence of IGF-1 stimulation, the HPLC profile displayed several peaks (Fig. 2A) previously shown to be composed largely of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K.

For tryptic digests of β2-adrenergic receptor isolated from metabolically labeled IGF-1-treated cells, the HPLC profile (Fig. 2B) was quite distinct from the basal state (Fig. 2A) and that observed for digests from insulin-treated cells (6Karoor V.

Based upon the previous elution profiles of tryptic phosphopeptides of β2-adrenergic receptor used as standards (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the prominent IGF-1-stimulated phosphopeptides were identified as those containing tyrosyl residues Y132 and Y141 (Fig. 2, C and D). Two-dimensional peptide mapping of the peaks resolved by HPLC was used to verify the nature of the labeled phosphopeptides. High-voltage electrophoresis followed by thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 2, E and F) confirmed the identity of the phosphopeptides derived from tryptic digests of β2-adrenergic receptor isolated from IGF-1-treated cells (Fig. 2F), i.e. phosphorylation predominantly of Y132/141 (Fig. 2E). An alternative strategy, i.e. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry was used to extend the analysis of phosphopeptides as a means to avoid the need to metabolically label cells with [32P]Pi. For this approach the phosphopeptides were isolated from the mixture of tryptic peptides by ferric chelation column chromatography (17Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The purification of phosphopeptides by ferric chelation simplifies the interpretation of the spectra (Table II and Fig. 3). The full topological analysis of the tryptic peptides derived from intracellular domains of the β2-adrenergic receptor is displayed elsewhere (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mass spectrometry data identified those peptides of the β2-adrenergic receptor that are phosphorylated in response to IGF-1 (Table III). Since the ionization potential of peptides in a mixture can be quite variable (19Yip T.T. Hutchens T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Liao P.C. Leykam J. Andrews P.C. Gage D.A. Allison J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the mass size rather than the apparent abundance is most informative. The Y141 tryptic phosphopeptide identified both by HPLC and by two-dimensional mapping of β2-adrenergic receptor peptides from IGF-1-treated metabolically labeled cells (Fig. 2) was observed at m/z 919.4 and (+2 Na+) 964, agreeing within 0.4% of the calculated mass (Fig. 3, a-c). Other phosphopeptides present correspond to phosphoserine-containing sequences, e.g. sequence 345-348 (SSSK) with m/z 472, sequence 254-259 (SGHLR) with m/z 696, and sequence 410-419 (NCSTNDSPL) corresponding to phosphoserine/threonine containing peptide with m/z 986.4 and (+1 Na+) 1008.2. The signature of the matrix itself, sinapinic acid, was prominent at m/z 205 and 225.Table II.Tryptic fragments of the intracellular domains of the β2-adrenergic receptor which harbor potential sites for phosphorylationResiduesSequenceaPhosphorylation sites in boldface.Mass261-263SSK302345-348SSSK389378-381ESER501254-259SGHLR607141-147YQSLLTK834410-419NCSTNDSPL914132-140YIAITSPFK1021349-361AYGNGYSSNSNGK1300240-253FHSPNLGQVEQDGR1565362-377TDYMGEASGCQLGQEK1698382-409LCEDPPGTESFVNCQGTVPSLSLDSQGR2975a Phosphorylation sites in boldface.

The differences in the spectra clearly demonstrate the unique features of the sites phosphorylated in response to IGF-1. Four peaks from the spectrum of receptor phosphopeptides of unstimulated control cells with signals at m/z 471, 515, 761, and 1046 (not shown) were often observed in the spectra from hormone-stimulated cells and were not investigated further. The analysis, confined to phosphotyrosyl-containing sequences (Table III), reveals signal at m/z 1700.6 corresponding to Y350/354 (peptide + coupled matrix + 1 Na+) and 2186 corresponding to Y364 (peptide + coupled matrix + 2 Na+). These data agree well with analysis of labeled tryptic peptides of β2-adrenergic receptor from metabolically labeled cells subjected to HPLC and two-dimensional peptide mapping (6Karoor V.

The current work illuminates a broadened understanding of G-protein-linked receptors as substrates for growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. At the outset, it seemed likely that IGF-1 and insulin might promote phosphorylation of a common site(s) of the β2-adrenergic receptor through which coupling to Gs might be counter-regulated. Although sharing many features in counter-regulation of catecholamine action, IGF-1 and insulin are shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of distinct regions in the β2-adrenergic receptor. Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues localized to the C-terminal tail of the receptor, predominantly Y350/354 and Y364. The sequence about Y364 has features of recognition domain for a growth factor tyrosine kinase (21Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 239-253Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Y350 creates a Src homology 2 domain (22Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Hser W.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar), which may interact with the adapter molecule GRB2. Stimulation by IGF-1, in contrast, leads to phosphorylation of a sequence embedded in the second intracellular loop of this GPLR (7Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), largely confined to Y141 and Y132. Phosphorylation of either Y132 (YXXI) or Y141 (YXXL) creates a recognition domain for binding of Shc, an element central to insulin signaling and for binding of members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (23Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Oliver P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated the ability of IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor to phosphorylate the recombinant β2-adrenergic receptor in vitro in a reconstituted system (7Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The data obtained in vivo agree well with the prior data obtained in vitro, creating the possibility for more detailed analysis of the interaction of tyrosine kinase receptors with GPLR substrates in the reconstituted system (7Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Most significant is the observation that IGF-1 and insulin counter-regulate signaling via β2-adrenergic receptors, although promoting phosphorylation at spatially distinct sites of the molecule. In addition, phosphorylation of either the C terminus (in response to insulin) or the second, intracellular loop (in response to IGF-1) of the β2-adrenergic receptor abolishes signaling to a common end point, the stimulatory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase Gs."
https://openalex.org/W2087642068,"The B form of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Lactococcus lactis (DHOdehase B) is encoded by the pyrDb gene. However, recent genetic evidence has revealed that a co-transcribed gene, pyrK, is needed to achieve the proper physiological function of the enzyme. We have purified DHOdehase B from two strains of Escherichia coli, which harbored either the pyrDb gene or both the pyrDb and the pyrK genes of L. lactis on multicopy plasmids. The enzyme encoded by pyrDb alone (herein called the δ-enzyme) was a bright yellow, dimeric protein that contained one molecule of tightly bound FMN per subunit. The δ-enzyme exhibited dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity with dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and molecular oxygen as electron acceptors but could not use NAD+. The DHOdehase B purified from the E. coli strain that carried both the pyrDb and pyrK genes on a multicopy plasmid (herein called the δκ-enzyme) was quite different, since it was formed as a complex of equal amounts of the two polypeptides, i.e. two PyrDB and two PyrK subunits. The δκ-enzyme was orange-brown and contained 2 mol of FAD, 2 mol of FMN, and 2 mol of [2Fe-2S] redox clusters per mol of native protein as tightly bound prosthetic groups. The δκ-enzyme was able to use NAD+ as well as dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and to some extent molecular oxygen as electron acceptors for the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, and it was a considerably more efficient catalyst than the purified δ-enzyme. Based on these results and on analysis of published sequences, we propose that the architecture of the δκ-enzyme is representative for the dihydroorotate dehydrogenases from Gram-positive bacteria.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyzes the fourth chemical reaction in the biosynthesis of UMP, which is oxidation of 5,6-dihydroorotate to orotate. Genes encoding this enzyme have been cloned and sequenced from a variety of organisms. The milk-fermenting bacterium Lactococcus lactis is the only organism so far known to contain two dihydroorotate dehydrogenases. They have been termed dihydroorotate dehydrogenase A (DHOdehase A) 1The abbreviations used are: DHOdehase A and DHOdehase Bthe A and B forms of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from L. lactisPyrDBpolypeptide chain encoded by pyrDbPyrKpolypeptide chain encoded by pyrKδ-enzymedimeric dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B containing only PyrDB subunitsδκ-enzymetetrameric dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B built of both PyrDB and PyrK subunitsDCIP2,6-dichloroindophenolPCRpolymerase chain reaction. and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B (DHOdehase B) and are encoded by the pyrDa and pyrDb genes, respectively (Andersen et al., 2Andersen P.S. Jansen P.J.G. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3975-3982Google Scholar). Both enzymes are able to function in pyrimidine biosynthesis, since both of the genes must be inactivated by mutation in order to impose a pyrimidine requirement on L. lactis and since either of the two genes is able to correct the pyrimidine requirement of a pyrD deletion strain of Escherichia coli (Andersen et al., 2Andersen P.S. Jansen P.J.G. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3975-3982Google Scholar). The polypeptides encoded by the pyrDa and pyrDb genes both consist of 311 amino acid residues, and the predicted amino acid sequences are 30% identical with each other. However, the sequence of DHOdehase A shows 71% amino acid identity with the sequence of the cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from bakers' yeast, while the sequence of DHOdehase B shows 60-70% amino acid identity with the deduced amino acid sequence of dihydroorotate dehydrogenases from B. subtilis and several other Gram-positive bacteria (Andersen et al., 2Andersen P.S.

We have initiated a study of these two dihydroorotate dehydrogenases from L. lactis, with the aim of comparing their functional and structural properties with the properties of the enzymes from E. coli (Larsen and Jensen, 16Larsen J.N. Jensen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 59-65Google Scholar) and other organisms. We began by purifying the two lactococcal enzymes from strains of E. coli that carried either pyrDa or pyrDb cloned on multicopy plasmids. DHOdehase A was a stable enzyme and proved to be a dimeric protein, containing one molecule of FMN per subunit. It was an efficient catalyst that could use dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), or, to a lower extent, molecular oxygen as an acceptor of the reducing equivalents from dihydroorotate (Nielsen et al., 25Nielsen F.S. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 857-861Google Scholar). However, the DHOdehase B encoded by the pyrDb gene turned out to be an unstable and inefficient enzyme, although it could be produced in substantial quantities in E. coli. We considered the possibility that this enzyme might require unusual electron acceptors or unusual incubation conditions for optimal function. While we were searching for such assay conditions, it appeared as a result of genetic studies that the activity of DHOdehase B in L. lactis was dependent on the integrity of a neighboring open reading frame, now termed pyrK, which is co-transcribed with pyrDb (Andersen et al., 3Andersen P.S. Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5005-5012Google Scholar). Therefore, we introduced the pyrK gene into our expression vector, which already carried pyrDb, and purified DHOdehase B from a strain of E. coli harboring this plasmid. The resulting enzyme was dramatically different from the enzyme encoded by the pyrDb gene alone, as it appeared to be a stable stoichiometric complex of PyrDB and PyrK polypeptides. Furthermore, the protein had acquired the ability to use NAD+ as a co-substrate for the oxidation of dihydroorotate. For the sake of simplicity we have named the native enzyme encoded only by the pyrDb gene the δ-enzyme, and the enzyme encoded by pyrDb and pyrK was called the δκ-enzyme. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and Deep Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase were bought from either New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim and used as recommended by the manufacturers. The Sequenase 2.0 kit was from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE52) was from Whatman BioSystems Ltd. (Maidstone, United Kingdom), hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel) was from Bio-Rad, the dye-liganded Matrex Red A was from Amicon, and the Superose 12 column was from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Blue dextran-Sepharose was prepared as described previously (Led et al., 17Led J.J. Switon W.K. Jensen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 469-479Google Scholar). Molecular weight marker proteins were bought from Bio-Rad or Pharmacia. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was from BDH (Poole, UK), and acrylamide solutions (Protogel™ and Sequagel™) were from National Diagnostics. Other fine chemicals were either from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma. Radionucleotides were purchased from DuPont NEN. The expression vectors, pFN2 and pFN4, were constructed by cloning PCR copies of the pyrDb and pyrK genes from L. lactis, present on plasmids pIP51 and pKP6, respectively (Andersen et al., 3Andersen P.S. Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5005-5012Google Scholar) into the multicopy plasmid pUHE23-2 (obtained from H. Bujard, Heidelberg). This plasmid carries the very strong LacI-repressible PA1/04/03 promoter to drive transcription of cloned genes (Deutschle et al., 5Deutschle U. Kammerer W. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2987-2994Google Scholar). For the pyrDb gene, the PCR reaction was directed by two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-CCGGAATTCAGGAGAGAAATAATGACTGAA and 5′-CGCGGATCCGAATTATTTTTTGCCTTCTTTTACT), which were designed to generate an EcoRI and a BamHI site at the start and the end of the resulting PCR fragment. For the pyrK gene, the PCR reaction was directed by two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-CGGGATCCCGTCCGTAAATAAAAGAATGGA and 5′-AACTGCAGAATTAGAATGAAAGCTGTTT), designed to generate a BamHI and a PstI site at the start and the ends of the DNA fragment. The resulting PCR fragments, as well as the vector pUHE23-2, were digested either with EcoRI and BamHI (for pyrDb) or BamHI and PstI (for pyrK), and after removal of the phosphates from the ends of the digested vector with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, the DNA fragments were ligated together by standard techniques. After transformation of the E. coli strain S∅6645 (araD139Δ(ara-leu)7679 galU galK Δ(lac)174 ΔpyrD(MluI-BssHII::Kmr)[F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15 Tn10]) with the ligation mixture, colonies that were resistant to ampicillin were selected on agar plates. Plasmids were isolated from several independent colonies and tested for the content of cloned PCR fragments, and the structures of the selected plasmids, pFN2 and pFN4, are shown in Fig. 1. The plasmid pFN3 was constructed by transferring the EcoRI-BamHI fragment carrying the pyrDb gene from plasmid pFN2 to pFN4, also cut with EcoRI and BamHI. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned PCR fragments were determined by the technique of Sanger et al. (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and the PCR primers combined with two universal sequence primers located on either side of the cloning region of pUHE23-2. The sequence of the pyrDb fragment was found to be identical to the published sequence of the pyrDb gene of L. lactis (Andersen et al., 2Andersen P.S. Jansen P.J.G. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3975-3982Google Scholar), but the sequence of codon number 201 in the pyrK gene of our PCR product (plasmids pFN3 and pFN4) was read as a GCC codon (encoding alanine) instead of the CGC codon (encoding arginine) in the published sequence (Andersen et al., 3Andersen P.S. Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5005-5012Google Scholar). However, sequencing of the template plasmid pKP6 and inspection of the original gels showed that this difference was due to an error in the published sequence, accession number X74207. In the standard assay for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity, the oxidation of dihydroorotate was coupled to the reduction of the synthetic quinone dichloroindophenol (DCIP). The reduction of 1 μmol of DCIP causes a decrease in the absorbance at 600 nm, ϵ = 20 × 103M−1 cm−1 (Karibian, 12Karibian D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 58-63Google Scholar). The spectra were recorded in a Zeiss Specord S10 diode-array photometer. The standard assay mixture contained 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM KCN, 1 mM dihydroorotate, and 50 μM DCIP. The assay temperature was 37°C. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of orotate/min under these conditions. In assays with different electron acceptors, we used the absorption at 295 nm to obtain a quantitative measure of the production of orotate (ϵ = 3.67 × 103M−1 cm−1). Two forms of DHOdehase B were purified from strain S∅6645, transformed either with the expression vector pFN2, which carried the pyrDb gene, or with plasmid pFN3, which carries both the pyrDb and pyrK genes of L. lactis. The cells were grown to stationary phase at 37°C with vigorous aeration in LB broth medium (Miller, 21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1 g/liter ampicillin. The synthesis of DHOdehase was induced by the addition of 0.75 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside when the optical density (A436) of the culture was 1.0. For plasmid pFN2, growth was continued for 24 h until the culture had been stationary for several hours, while the cultures containing pFN3 were harvested 3.5 h after induction because the PyrK polypeptide was slowly degraded upon prolonged incubation in the stationary phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 6000 rpm using a GS-3 rotor in a refrigerated Sorvall centrifuge, washed with 0.9% NaCl, and kept frozen at −20°C. The buffer used during all steps in the purification was 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol, termed Buffer A. Unless otherwise stated, all operations were carried out on a melting ice bath or in a refrigerated room at 4°C. All columns were run with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. To purify the δ-enzyme, frozen cell pellets from 2.5-liter stationary cultures of S∅6645/pFN2 were suspended in 75 ml of ice cold Buffer A and disrupted by ultrasonic treatment using a Branson sonifier for 15 × 0.5 min, interrupted by cooling in an ice bath for 1.5 min between cycles of sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12.000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. (null)/1;10 volume of a 10% solution of streptomycin sulfate was added to the supernatant. After stirring for 15 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation as described above. The supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against 2 liters of 5 mM sodium phosphate containing 10% glycerol (pH 6) and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied onto a 25-ml column of Matrex Red A (Amicon). After washing the column with 75 ml of Buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.80 M NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions with most DHOdehase activity were pooled and dialyzed for 3 h against 1 liter of 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6, containing 10% glycerol. The dialyzed sample was applied on a 25-ml column of DE52 (Whatman) equilibrated with Buffer A. After washing the column with 75 ml of Buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with Buffer A containing 0.2 M NaCl. Fractions with the most DHOdehase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of Buffer A overnight. Subsequently, the enzyme solution was loaded on a 25-ml column of blue dextran Sepharose. The column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer A and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions with most DHOdehase activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against Buffer A using a Micro Ultrafiltration system (Amicon). Glycerol was added to 50%, and the enzyme was stored at −20°C. The purification procedure is summarized in Table I, and an SDS-PAGE analysis of the enzyme product is shown in Fig. 2.Table IPurification of DHOdehase B (δ-enzyme) from SØ6645-pFN2 containing only the pyrDb genPurification stepVolumeTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationmlunitsmgunits/mg%-foldCrude extract50164521360.771001.0Streptomycin supernatant44145211261.3882.0Matrex Red A228251216.8508.8DE-5254621926.7378.7Blue Sepharose78312545.7197.4 Open table in a new tab In order to purify the δκ-enzyme, frozen cell pellet from a 10-liter culture of S∅6645/pFN3 was suspended in 75 ml of Buffer A and disrupted by sonication as described above. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. (null)/1;10 volume of a 10% solution of streptomycin sulfate was added to the supernatant. After stirring for 15 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation as described above. The supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against 2 liters of 5 mM sodium phosphate containing 10% glycerol (pH 6) and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a 100-ml column of DE52. After the loading was completed, the column was first washed with 400 ml of Buffer A and then eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml) from 0 to 0.20 M NaCl in Buffer A followed by a 100-ml linear gradient from 0.20 M NaCl to 1.0 M NaCl. The orange-brown δκ-enzyme appeared from the column with a peak at 0.22 M NaCl, while a surplus of the yellow-green δ-enzyme peaked at 0.15 M NaCl. Fractions containing the δκ-enzyme were pooled, dialyzed for 2 h against 2 liters of 5 mM sodium phosphate containing 10% glycerol (pH 6), and applied onto a 25-ml column of hydroxylapatite. This column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient over 200 ml from Buffer A to 500 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol. Fractions containing most dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity (peaking at 0.25 M sodium phosphate) were pooled, dialyzed for 2 h against 2 liters of 5 mM sodium phosphate containing 10% glycerol (pH 6), and loaded onto a 25-ml column of Matrex Red A. After washing the column with 50 ml of Buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with a 200-ml gradient from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl in Buffer A. The activity peaked at 0.15 M NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed as described above, and the chromatography on Matrex Red A was repeated. The active fractions were concentrated using a Micro Ultrafiltration system (Amicon), dialyzed exhaustively against 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 50% glycerol, and stored at −20°C. The flavin was released from aliquots of the enzymes by treating with 0.25 M formic acid and analyzed by chromatography on poly(ethyleneimine)-impregnated cellulose thin layer plates together with authentic FMN (RF = 0.35) and FAD (RF = 0.17) as described by Larsen and Jensen (16Larsen J.N. Jensen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 59-65Google Scholar). In addition, the flavin was extracted from the δκ-enzyme by treatment with 4% ammonium sulfate in 75% methanol as described by Aleman and Handler (1Aleman V. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4087-4096Google Scholar). After pelleting the protein part of the enzyme by centrifugation, the spectrum of the supernatant was recorded and compared with the spectra of authentic FMN, FAD, and mixtures of the two flavin compounds, dissolved in 4% ammonium sulfate, 75% methanol. Aliquots of the δκ-enzyme (800 μl containing 1-12 nmol of enzyme in 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6) were mixed with 100 μl of 8 M HCl and incubated for 10 min at 0°C. Protein was precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of 80% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and the solution was cleared by centrifugation. 200 μl of 75% ammonium acetate was added to 800 μl of the supernatant to adjust the pH to 4.5. Subsequently, 80 μl of 10% hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 80 μl of 4 mM tripyridyl-s-triazine were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min. The amount of iron was quantified by measuring the absorption at 593 nm as described by Fischer and Price (6Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clinical. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Google Scholar). One nmol of Fe gave an absorption A593 = 0.015. Aliquots of enzyme (320 μl) were treated with 2.6% Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.75% NaOH for 2 h; 100 μl of 0.1% N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, dissolved 5 M HCl, and 40 μl of 11.5 mM FeCl3 in 0.6 M HCl were then added, and the solution was mixed by shaking for 1 min. Finally, 320 μl of water was added, and the sample was cleared by centrifugation. The acid-labile sulfide was quantified by measuring A670 as described by King and Morris (13King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 10: 634-641Google Scholar). One nmol of S2− gave an absorption A670 = 0.032. Saturation curves from kinetic experiments were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the BIOSOFT program Ultrafit for the Macintosh. The expression vectors used for production of DHOdehase B in E. coli are described in Fig. 1. All three plasmids are derivatives of pUHE23-2 and contain the strong LacI-controlled PA1/04/03 promoter to drive transcription of the cloned genes. Plasmid pFN2 contains only the pyrDb gene, which we initially thought would contain all coding information for DHOdehase B of L. lactis (Andersen et al., 2Andersen P.S. Jansen P.J.G. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3975-3982Google Scholar). Plasmid pFN3 contains both pyrDb and pyrK, but the two genes are inserted in opposite order relative to the order by which they are transcribed from the chromosome of L. lactis. Plasmid pFN4 carries only the pyrK gene. The plasmids, pFN2 and pFN3, were able to complement the pyrimidine requirement of the E. coli strain S∅6645, which is deleted for the pyrD gene, but pFN4 was not. In order to use S∅6645, transformed with pFN2 or pFN3, for production of DHOdehase, it was important to grow the cultures to a considerable density while the strong PA1/04/03 promoter was kept repressed, since growth terminated approximately one generation after induction of promoter activity by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. The purification procedure for DHOdehase B encoded by pyrDb is described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Table I. The enzyme could be produced in substantial amounts in an electrophoretically homogeneous form (Fig. 2). However, the enzyme was unstable, and the specific activity decreased slightly in the last steps of purification (Table I). In earlier versions of the purification, the fall in specific activity during purification was even more dramatic. The half-life of the δ-enzyme was about 45 s under assay conditions at 37°C and was 4 min when the assays were performed at 25°C. If a solution of the δ-enzyme in the purification buffer was left at room temperature overnight, no dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity remained. The purification procedure for the δκ-enzyme is described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Table II. The resulting enzyme contained equal amounts of PyrDB and PyrK polypeptides (Fig. 2). These two polypeptides seemed to form a very stable complex with each other, since they have resisted separation over many steps of column chromatography and since they migrated as a single protein during electrophoresis in a nondenaturing agarose gel with mobility very different from the mobility of the δ-enzyme, which contained only the PyrDB subunits (Fig. 3). The complex δκ-enzyme was a very stable protein. The activity could be assayed without problems at 37°C, and approximately 75% of the activity remained when the protein was incubated in the purification buffer for 20 min at 55°C.Table II.Purification of DHOdehase B (δκ-enzyme) from SØ6645-pFN3 containing both pyrDb and pyrKPurification stepVolumeTotal activityTotal proteinaThe amount of protein in the samples were determined by the Lowry procedure (Lowry et al., 1951).

Open table in a new tab The two forms of DHOdehase B were subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) together with standard marker proteins. Fractions were collected and analyzed by measurements of enzyme activity and by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The δ-enzyme eluted from the column together with bovine serum albumin, molecular mass 64-66 kDa. This gel filtration behavior indicated that the protein is a homodimer consisting of two PyrDB subunits, since the molecular mass of the subunit is 33 kDa. On the other hand, the native δκ-enzyme eluted at a position corresponding to a protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa. This indicated that the δκ-enzyme is a tetramer composed of two PyrDb subunits (33 kDa) and two PyrK subunits (29 kDa). The purified δ-enzyme was bright yellow, with a trace of green, and it showed an absorption spectrum typical for an oxidized flavoprotein with absorption maxima at 450 and 375 nm (Fig. 4). The absorbance at 450 nm was 0.29 per mg of protein, determined by the Lowry procedure (Lowry et al., 20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). This value indicated that the δ-enzyme contains 0.9 mol of flavin/mol of subunit (Mr = 33,000), since flavoproteins usually have an absorption coefficient A450 of about 11 mM−1 cm−1 (Untuch-Grau et al., 29Untuch-Grau R. Blatterspiel R. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Saleh M. Schultz E. Schirmer R.H. Wittmann-Liebold B. Flavins and Flavoproteins: Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier North-Holland, New York1982: 38Google Scholar). The flavin was released from the protein by treatment with 0.33 M formic acid and found to co-migrate with authentic FMN by thin layer chromatography, while it migrated twice as fast as FAD. The complex δκ-enzyme was orange-brown instead of yellow, and the characteristic flavin peaks at 377 and 452 nm in the absorption spectrum (Fig. 4) were superimposed onto a broad range of absorption extending from 300 to beyond 600 nm. Upon treatment with formic acid, both FMN and FAD were released from the enzyme. The two flavin compounds were present in approximately equal amounts as judged from the intensities of the two yellow spots on the chromatogram inspected under UV light. The flavins were also extracted from the enzyme with 4% ammonium sulfate and 75% methanol, leaving a yellow supernatant and a brownish protein pellet after centrifugation. The absorbance of the supernatant at 448 nm indicated that one mol of native δκ-enzyme contains 4.1 ± 0.1 mol of flavin. The ratio between the absorption at 268 nm and the absorption at 448 nm was compared with the similar ratios of absorbances of mixtures of authentic FMN and FAD. This analysis revealed that the enzyme contains approximately 40% FMN and 60% FAD. Based on these results, we propose that the δκ-enzyme contains 2 mol of FAD and 2 mol of FMN per mol of native tetrameric enzyme. The absorption spectrum in Fig. 4, as well as the color of the protein, indicated that the enzyme contains iron as well as the flavins, and since it also developed a characteristic smell of sulfide when it was treated with sulfuric acid, we suspected that the protein contained iron-sulfur redox centers. The iron content was quantified by the method of Fischer and Price (6Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clinical. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Google Scholar) and a value of 3.6 ± 0.3 mol of Fe/mol of native δκ-enzyme was found. Furthermore, we found 3.2 ± 0.3 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of enzyme by using the method of King and Morris (13King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 10: 634-641Google Scholar). These iron and sulfur analyses were performed more than six times using two different preparations of the enzyme, and since the method of King and Morris (13King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 10: 634-641Google Scholar) usually underestimates the true content of sulfur, the data suggest strongly that one mol of native δκ-enzyme contains two mol of [2Fe-2S] redox centers. The iron-sulfur clusters are likely to be bound to the sulfhydryl-rich stretches of amino acid residues near the carboxyl termini of the PyrK subunits (Fig. 5). Both forms of DHOdehase B displayed optimal activity around pH 8 when assayed with DCIP as electron acceptor and dihydroorotate as substrate (Fig. 6). The specificity of the enzyme reactions at pH 8 is shown in Table III. It appears that both forms of DHOdehase B could use dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and to a lower extent also molecular oxygen as electron acceptors for the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, whereas only the δκ-enzyme was able to use NAD+. When assayed under standard conditions at pH 8, using 50 μM DCIP as an electron acceptor, the apparent Km for orotate was 28 ± 2 μM for the δκ-enzyme and 949 ± 48 μM for the δ-enzyme, while the apparent Vmax was 3-fold higher for the δκ-enzyme than for the δ-enzyme, indicating that the δκ-enzyme is a considerably more efficient catalyst than the δ-enzyme. The apparent Km of the δκ-enzyme for NAD+ was 111 ± 12 μM when assayed with 1 mM dihydroorotate as co-substrate. Neither of the enzymes was able to use dihydrouracil as a substrate with DCIP as electron acceptor.Table III.Specificity for electron acceptors by the two forms of DHOdehase BElectron acceptorActivityδκ-Enzymeδ-Enzymeμmol/min/mgDCIP (0.05 mM)486K3[Fe(CN)6] (0.45 mM)7618NAD+ (0.1 mM)250.8Fumarate (0.05 mM)30.8NADP+, Q10, Q6, or K230.8NoneaAll reactions contained molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure, i.e. about 230 μM.30.8a All reactions contained molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure, i.e. about 230 μM. Open table in a new tab The δκ-enzyme catalyzed efficient conversion of orotate to dihydroorotate at the expense of the reducing equivalents of [NADH + H+] at pH 6.5, but no formation of dihydroorotate could be detected at pH 8, probably because this high pH favors formation of [NADH + H+]. No conversion of uracil to dihydrouracil could be detected at pH 6.5 using [NADH + H+] as co-substrate, showing again that DHOdehase B of L. lactis does not belong to the class of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenases, which are able to reduce all natural pyrimidine bases. The results presented in this paper document unambiguously that the polypeptides encoded by the pyrDb and pyrK genes of L. lactis form a protein complex, herein termed the δκ-enzyme, since they resisted separation by chromatography on several types of columns and since they migrated as a single protein species during electrophoresis in a nondenaturing gel. The δκ-enzyme is able to use dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), NAD+, and, to some extent, molecular oxygen as acceptors of the reducing equivalents from dihydroorotate. We propose that the complex δκ-enzyme is the physiological form of DHOdehase B in L. lactis, since disruption of the pyrK gene in mutants lacking DHOdehase A (encoded by pyrDa) gave rise to a 4-fold lower growth rate in the absence of pyrimidines and made it impossible to assay DHOdehase B activity in extracts of L. lactis with the use of NAD+ as electron acceptor (Andersen et al., 3Andersen P.S. Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5005-5012Google Scholar). It seems likely that the architecture of the δκ-enzyme is the prototype of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenases from Gram-positive bacteria, since the PyrDB protein shows very high sequence similarity to all known PyrD proteins of Gram-positive bacteria (i.e. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus caldolyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis (Nielsen et al., 25Nielsen F.S. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 857-861Google Scholar)) and since an orf with very high similarity to pyrK is found immediately upstream of the pyrD gene in these bacteria (Andersen et al., 3Andersen P.S. Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5005-5012Google Scholar; Ghim et al., 8Ghim S.-Y. Nielsen P. Neuhard J. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 479-491Google Scholar; Li et al., 18Li X. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6866-6873Google Scholar; Quinn et al., 27Quinn C.L. Stephenson B.T. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9113-9127Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown in the case of B. subtilis that disruption of this orf, now termed pyrDII, imposes a partial pyrimidine requirement on the bacterium and strongly lowers the activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in cell-free extracts (Kahler and Switzer, 11Kahler A.E. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5013-5016Google Scholar). The behavior of the δκ-enzyme during SDS-gel electrophoresis and gel filtration indicated strongly that it consists of two PyrDB and two PyrK subunits. Spectrophotometric and chromatographic determinations showed that the native enzyme contains 2 mol of FAD and 2 mol of FMN. In addition, the iron and sulfide analyses indicated strongly that the tetrameric δκ-enzyme contains 2 mol of [2Fe-2S] redox centers. The ability to bind FMN must reside in the PyrDB subunit, while the ability to bind FAD and the [2Fe-2S] clusters as prosthetic groups seems to be linked to the PyrK subunit in the complex, since the protein encoded by the pyrDb gene alone, i.e. the δ-enzyme, is a functional dimeric dihydroorotate dehydrogenase that only contains FMN. Furthermore, the capability to use NAD+ as an electron acceptor is linked to the presence of the PyrK subunits in the complex, since the δ-enzyme is unable to function with NAD+ as a substrate. The δ-enzyme resembles several other dihydroorotate dehydrogenases, e.g. dihydroorotate dehydrogenase A from L. lactis (Nielsen et al., 25Nielsen F.S. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 857-861Google Scholar), and the enzymes from E. coli (Larsen and Jensen, 16Larsen J.N. Jensen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 59-65Google Scholar) and the two protozoans, Crithidia fasciculata and Trypanosoma bruceri (Pascal et al., 26Pascal R.A. Trang N.L. Cerami A. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 171-178Google Scholar). These enzymes are all dimeric dihydroorotate dehydrogenases with one FMN per subunit, and they are unable to use NAD+ as an electron acceptor. The dihydroorotate dehydrogenases purified from bovine liver mitochondria and the mitochondria of Neurospora crassa were also found to contain FMN (Hines and Johnson, 9Hines V. Johnson M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1222-1226Google Scholar; Hines et al., 10Hines V. Keys III, L.D. Johnston M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11386-11392Google Scholar; Miller, 22Miller R.W. Can. J.

Biophys. 1971; 146: 256-270Google Scholar), whereas flavin could not be detected in significant quantities in the enzymes purified from Plasmodium berghei (Krungkrai et al., 14Krungkrai J. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1934-1939Google Scholar) and rat liver (Forman and Kennedy, 7Forman H.J. Kennedy J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 23-31Google Scholar), and in a recombinant truncated version of the human enzyme (Copeland et al., 4Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Google Scholar). Hitherto, the ability to use NAD+ as electron acceptor seemed to be a unique property of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Zymobacterium oroticum, which was discovered by Lieberman and Kornberg (19Lieberman I. Kornberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 12: 223-234Google Scholar). Because this enzyme was made in large amounts when the bacterium was grown with orotate as the sole carbon source and because subsequently discovered dihydroorotate dehydrogenases were unable to use NAD+, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase of Z. oroticum was generally regarded as being an atypic, catabolic enzyme. To the best of our knowledge, however, it was never shown that this enzyme does not also participate in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. Z. oroticum is a Gram-positive bacterium (now called Clostridium oroticum), and it is likely that its dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is homologous to the dihydroorotate dehydrogenases of other Gram-positive bacteria (i.e. formed like the δκ-enzyme described herein). The reaction kinetics of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase of Z. oroticum were studied intensively 30 years ago, and the enzyme was shown to contain two FAD, two FMN, and 4 g-atoms of iron, bound in acid-labile iron-sulfur clusters, in each native enzyme molecule, Mr = 120,000 (Aleman and Handler, 1Aleman V. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4087-4096Google Scholar; Miller and Massey, 24Miller R.W. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1453-1465Google Scholar). However, no studies were made on the protein moiety of the enzyme, and the amino acid sequence is unknown. Currently, we are studying how the FMN redox centers on the PyrDB subunit of the δκ-enzyme of L. lactis interact with the FAD groups and iron-sulfur clusters on the PyrK subunits. The presence of the different types of redox centers on different subunits may facilitate these studies.

Adamo M. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 1-58Google Scholar, 2De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Google Scholar). Insulin receptors more weakly recognize IGF-I and IGF-II. Conversely, IGF-I receptors preferentially recognize IGF-I but also bind IGF-II and insulin with 10-fold and 100-1000-fold weaker affinity, respectively (1Werner H. Adamo M. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 1-58Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, transautophosphorylation reactions of the receptor β-subunit increase its tyrosine kinase activity toward endogenous substrates (3White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar). Activity of insulin and IGF-I receptors thus converges on the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 (3White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar, 4Myers M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Google Scholar) and IRS-2 (5Patti M.-E. Sun X.-J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Google Scholar)), which then act with the receptor itself as docking proteins for other substrates such as the 85-kDa adaptor subunit of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and Grb-2. Grb-2 in turn recruits the mSOS nucleotide exchange factor, which activates Ras and triggers a kinase cascade culminating in the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases (2De Meyts P. Wallach B.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 597-611Google Scholar).Despite the large similarity of insulin and IGF-I receptors and intracellular signaling pathways, the main physiological actions of insulin in vivo and in vitro involve glucose, protein, and lipid metabolisms, whereas IGF-I acts as a mitogenic hormone or cytokine. Subtle differences in the biochemistry of the two receptors have been proposed to explain the fundamental difference in the physiological roles of insulin and IGF-I (7LeRoith D. Sampson P.C. Roberts C.T. Horm. Res. 1994; 4: 74-79Google Scholar). They include some differences in the C-terminal regions of the insulin and IGF-I receptors (8Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Google Scholar, 9McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Levy J. Huecksteadt T. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8904-8911Google Scholar) (of the two tyrosine residues phosphorylated on activation of the insulin receptor, only one is present in the IGF-I receptor; the lacking residue could be important for metabolic signaling but not for mitogenicity (10Takata Y. Webster N.J.G. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9135-9139Google Scholar, 11Baron V. Gantier N. Kaliman P. Dolais-Kitabgi J. Van Obberghen E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9365-9370Google Scholar)), a higher dissociation rate of ligands from the insulin receptor compared with IGF-I receptor (2De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Google Scholar), or somewhat different substrate specificities of kinase catalytic domains (12Xu B. Bird V.G. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29825-29830Google Scholar). Nevertheless, insulin has been found to signal a mitogenic pathway through its own receptor rather than IGF-I receptors in transfected NIH 3T3 or Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress insulin receptors (8Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Google Scholar, 13Hofmann C. Goldfine I.D. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8606-8611Google Scholar, 14Randazzo P.A. Jarett L. Exp.

Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Saltiel A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 214-222Google Scholar) or in some cancer cell lines such as hepatoma cells (17Koontz J.W. Iwahashi M. Science. 1981; 211: 947-949Google Scholar), breast carcinoma cells (18Papa V. Reese C.C. Brunetti A. Vigneri R. Siiteri P.K. Goldfine I.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7858-7862Google Scholar), and T-cell lymphoma cells (19Ish-Shalom D. Tzivion G. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. De Meyts P. Naor D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 409-415Google Scholar).Whether insulin can signal mitogenesis through its own receptor in normal cells containing normal levels of insulin and IGF-I receptors is far less clear (20King G.L. Kahn C.R. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 130-140Google Scholar, 21Conover A. Hintz R.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1989; 21: 59-63Google Scholar). The dog thyroid primary culture system is a unique model to reassess the biological role of insulin and IGF ligand-receptor systems. DNA synthesis and proliferation of these cells can be separately triggered either by growth factors including EGF acting through tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways or by TSH acting through cAMP (22Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 323-329Google Scholar, 23Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Google Scholar). Among other major differences between the two mitogenic pathways (24Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Google Scholar, 25Roger P.P. Reuse S. Maenhaut C. Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 59-191Google Scholar), we previously noticed that the stimulation of DNA synthesis by EGF depended on high insulin concentrations that could interact with IGF-I receptors, whereas 100-1000-fold lower insulin concentrations were sufficient to support the TSH stimulation of DNA synthesis (23Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterize the insulin and IGF-I receptors of dog thyrocytes in culture, their expression, and their involvement in the comitogenic effects of insulin and IGFs. Unexpectedly, we found that TSH through cAMP induces the expression of insulin receptors but not of IGF-I receptors. This is associated with an enhanced responsiveness of the cells not only to insulin but also to IGFs and explains the comitogenic effect of low insulin concentrations in the presence of TSH.DISCUSSIONIn dog thyroid cell primary cultures (22Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 323-329Google Scholar, 23Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Google Scholar), as in other in vitro thyroid cell culture systems (42Smith P. Wynford-Thomas D. Stringer B.M.J. Williams E.D. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1439-1445Google Scholar, 43Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Veneziani B.M. Ingbar S.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 127-132Google Scholar, 44Roger P. Taton M. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 66: 1158-1165Google Scholar), the stimulation of cell proliferation by TSH or growth factors requires comitogenic factors. As illustrated here, the dependence on such permissive factors can be fulfilled by the administration of IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin. Even the weak variable stimulation of DNA synthesis by TSH in the absence of exogenous insulin or IGFs (23Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Google Scholar) was partly dependent on autocrine production of IGF-I or IGF-II, as demonstrated in this and other thyroid cell culture systems (45Maciel R.M.B. Moses A.C. Villone G. Tramontano D. Ingbar S.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1546-1553Google Scholar, 46Williams D.W. Williams E.D. Wynford-Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 61: 139-143Google Scholar). Again, as in other systems (1Werner H. Adamo M. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 1-58Google Scholar, 20King G.L. Kahn C.R. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 130-140Google Scholar, 43Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Veneziani B.M. Ingbar S.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 127-132Google Scholar) the comitogenic action of either low IGF-I concentrations or high supraphysiological concentrations of insulin was at least in part mediated by IGF-I receptors in dog thyrocytes. The originality of these cells is that, in the presence of TSH, but not in the presence of cAMP-independent mitogenic factors including EGF, HGF, and TPA, insulin receptors beside IGF-I receptors also can mediate the comitogenic signaling cascade. Indeed, in the presence of TSH, the permissive effect of insulin on DNA synthesis was exerted mainly at low physiological concentrations, depended on insulin receptors (since it was completely inhibited by the MA-10 blocking antibody), and was completely independent of IGF-I receptors (since it was not affected by the blockade of IGF-I receptors). Therefore, in TSH-treated dog thyroid cells, IGF-I receptors and insulin receptors are equivalent in their capacity to mediate a comitogenic pathway, which, however, can be elicited only by IGF-I receptors when the same cells are stimulated by cAMP-independent growth factors.We explain this apparent paradox by our present observation that TSH, through cAMP, induces the expression of insulin receptors but not of IGF-I receptors. In control unstimulated cells, insulin binding, insulin receptor protein (as assessed by Western blotting), and mRNA (as assessed by Northern blotting) were at the limit of detection, at variance with IGF-I receptors, which were present at the density of about 5 × 104 receptors/cell. Insulin receptor gene expression, insulin receptor content, and insulin responsiveness were gradually induced by TSH and forskolin, and after 2 days of treatment with TSH, densities of insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors were comparable.Insulin receptor gene expression has been studied in various systems, and its regulation has been found to be especially important for directing insulin to specific target tissues (47Desbuquois B. Tozzo E. Collinet M. Lopez S. Bortoli M. Amessou M. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1993; 54: 373-384Google Scholar, 48Mamula P.W. McDonald A.R. Brunetti A. Okabayashi Y. Wong K.Y. Maddux B.A. Logsdon C.

Insulin receptors are expressed ubiquitously, but the classic insulin target tissues contain higher levels of insulin receptor protein, leading to increased insulin sensitivity. Insulin receptors are induced in vitro and in vivo during muscular, pancreatic, and adipose differentiation (47Desbuquois B. Tozzo E. Collinet M. Lopez S. Bortoli M. Amessou M. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1993; 54: 373-384Google Scholar, 48Mamula P.W. McDonald A.R. Brunetti A. Okabayashi Y. Wong K.Y. Maddux B.A. Logsdon C. Goldfine I.D.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 625-634Google Scholar). In addition, in various tissues and cell types, insulin receptor expression is under positive regulation by glucocorticoid hormones and negative regulation by insulin (47Desbuquois B. Tozzo E. Collinet M. Lopez S. Bortoli M. Amessou M. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1993; 54: 373-384Google Scholar, 48Mamula P.W. McDonald A.R. Brunetti A. Okabayashi Y. Wong K.Y. Maddux B.A. Logsdon C.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 625-634Google Scholar). Until now, hormones acting through cAMP have never been found to stimulate insulin receptor expression or binding capacity (47Desbuquois B. Tozzo E. Collinet M. Lopez S. Bortoli M. Amessou M. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1993; 54: 373-384Google Scholar). On the contrary, forskolin was reported to inhibit insulin receptor mRNA accumulation from human IM 9 lymphocytes (53Briata P. Gherzi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1184-1190Google Scholar), and in various systems the phosphorylation of insulin receptors by cAMPdependent protein kinase decreases their tyrosine kinase activity (54Stadtmauer L. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3402-3407Google Scholar, 55Tanti J.F. Grémeaux T. Rochet N. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 19-26Google Scholar). On the other hand, IGF-I receptor expression and its stimulation by growth-promoting factors and hormones have been found to be essential for proliferation processes (56Baserga R. Sell C. Porcu P. Rubini M. Cell Prolif. 1994; 27: 63-71Google Scholar), including in the case of hormones acting through cAMP, such as follicle-stimulating hormone in granulosa cells (57Adashi E.Y. Resnick C.E. Svoboda M.E. Van Wyk J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3923-3926Google Scholar). The present demonstration of the induction by cAMP of the expression of insulin receptors instead of IGF-I receptors during a growth stimulation process was therefore totally unexpected.Our results suggest that insulin receptors, once expressed at a sufficient level, can signal a mitogenic cascade as efficiently as IGF-I receptors. Similar to our observations from a normal differentiated epithelial cell, progestins were found to increase the insulin receptor content and consequently insulin stimulation of growth in human breast carcinoma cells (18Papa V. Reese C.C. Brunetti A. Vigneri R. Siiteri P.K. Goldfine I.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7858-7862Google Scholar). Experiments from transfected NIH 3T3 or Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin or IGF-I receptors also suggest that the insulin receptor does not differ very much from IGF-I receptor in its capacity to signal a mitogenic response (8Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Google Scholar, 13Hofmann C. Goldfine I.D. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8606-8611Google Scholar, 14Randazzo P.A. Jarett L. Exp.

Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Saltiel A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 214-222Google Scholar). The relative levels of expression rather than intrinsic structural differences (8Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Google Scholar, 9McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Levy J. Huecksteadt T. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Van Obberghen E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9365-9370Google Scholar) might be a major factor determining the propensity of insulin or IGF-I receptors for signaling mitogenesis.As the likely consequence of increased insulin receptor expression, the pretreatment of dog thyrocytes by TSH or forskolin induced the insulin responsiveness of a signaling pathway that includes the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-like proteins, the phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAP kinases, their nuclear translocation, and the appearance of the c-Fos protein. Interestingly, the sensitivity of this pathway to IGF-I and IGF-II (and high supraphysiological insulin concentrations that also interact with IGF-I receptor) was also enhanced by TSH as well as the comitogenic sensitivity to IGF-I and IGF-II. Transfection of NIH 3T3 with insulin receptors also increases their responsiveness to IGF-I (13Hofmann C. Goldfine I.D. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8606-8611Google Scholar, 14Randazzo P.A. Jarett L. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 190: 31-39Google Scholar). In TSH-treated dog thyrocytes, our characterization of IGF-I and insulin receptors showed that IGF-II has only a little preference for IGF-I receptors. It might thus act on insulin receptors as well, which might explain why IGF-II, like insulin, was comitogenic at lower concentrations in the presence of TSH and was relatively insensitive to antibodies blocking IGF-I receptor. At high concentrations (>10−8M), IGF-I also significantly competed for insulin receptor binding. In the presence of TSH, it could thus act in part through insulin receptors, which would explain its partial resistance to IGF-I receptor blockade (not shown). Nevertheless, TSH also somewhat enhanced the sensitivity to lower IGF-I concentrations that did not significantly compete for insulin receptor binding. Conceivably, the induction of insulin receptor expression could also increase the presence of insulin/IGF-I receptor hybrids that preferentially bind IGF-I (58Siddle K. Soos M.A. Field C.E. Navé B.T. Horm. Res. 1994; 41: 56-65Google Scholar), but we failed to detect an increase of IGF-I binding capacity in response to TSH. Despite the good correlation of the kinetics of the stimulatory effects of TSH and forskolin on insulin and IGF responsiveness and on insulin receptor expression, additional mechanisms should be envisaged to explain the increased sensitivity to IGF-I. In FRTL5 rat thyroid cell line, prior TSH exposure also amplifies various responses to IGF-I (43Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Veneziani B.M. Ingbar S.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 127-132Google Scholar, 59Takada K. Amino N. Tada H. Miyai K. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1548-1555Google Scholar, 60Takahashi S.I. Conti M. Van Wyk J.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 736-745Google Scholar), including the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 175-kDa IRS-like protein (61Takahashi S.-I. Conti M. Prokop C. Van Wyk J.J. Earp III, H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7834-7841Google Scholar, 62Condorelli G. Formisano P. Miele C. Beguinot F. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1615-1625Google Scholar), without increasing IGF-I binding (63Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Ingbar S.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 133-136Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) are unclear and controversial (61Takahashi S.-I. Conti M. Prokop C. Van Wyk J.J. Earp III, H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7834-7841Google Scholar, 62Condorelli G. Formisano P. Miele C. Beguinot F. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1615-1625Google Scholar).cAMP as a second messenger for mitogenic hormones can positively control cell proliferation both by direct and indirect mechanisms (25Roger P.P. Reuse S. Maenhaut C. Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 59-191Google Scholar). This is especially well illustrated in the present study. TSH, through cAMP but independently of MAP kinases (28Lamy F. Wilkin F. Baptist M. Posada J. Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8398-8401Google Scholar), c-Jun (29Reuse S. Pirson I. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 210-215Google Scholar) and c-Fos (26Baptist M. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 160-171Google Scholar), directly controls dog thyroid cell cycle progression, including a late restriction point just before DNA synthesis initiation (39Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 282-292Google Scholar). In addition, as shown here, it indirectly stimulates the MAP kinase-dependent insulin/IGF-I comitogenic pathway, at least in part by inducing insulin receptors. It is noteworthy that this TSH effect on insulin receptors is delayed and relatively stable after removal of the cAMP stimulus. Therefore, it probably does not mediate the direct effect of cAMP on G0-S prereplicative phase progression, which continuously requires an especially labile cAMP-dependent intermediary (39Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 282-292Google Scholar). In Balb-c 3T3 fibroblasts, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates proliferation at least in part by inducing IGF-I receptors, thus increasing cell competence to progress into the cell cycle in response to IGF-I (56Baserga R. Sell C. Porcu P. Rubini M. Cell Prolif. 1994; 27: 63-71Google Scholar). In dog thyroid cells, cAMP thus acts both as a progression factor and as a competence factor increasing responsiveness to insulin and IGF-I, which then cooperate with cAMP as progression factors. By a distinct mechanism that does not involve a potentiation of MAP kinase activation, cAMP also increases the competence of dog thyroid cells to respond to EGF (26Baptist M. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 160-171Google Scholar). TSH and cAMP can thus very potently promote thyroid cell proliferation by separately stimulating multiple pathways that cooperate at various levels.In dog thyroid cells, insulin at low concentrations moderately stimulates the expression of some thyroid-differentiated functions, such as thyroglobulin mRNA accumulation (64Pohl V. Roger P.P. Christophe D. Pattyn G. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 663-672Google Scholar). The induction of insulin receptors by TSH and cAMP might thus be a factor in the delayed induction of thyroglobulin transcription by TSH. As observed in several tissues (47Desbuquois B. Tozzo E. Collinet M. Lopez S. Bortoli M. Amessou M. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1993; 54: 373-384Google Scholar, 48Mamula P.W. McDonald A.R. Brunetti A. Okabayashi Y. Wong K.Y. Maddux B.A. Logsdon C.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 625-634Google Scholar) insulin receptor expression might be associated with differentiation expression, which in thyroid is mainly supported by TSH (24Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Google Scholar). The present observations might be related to the impairment of thyroid growth and function in response to TSH in diabetic rats and mice, which is restored upon insulin administration (65Jolin T. Morreale de Escobar G. Escobar del Rey F. Endocrinology. 1970; 87: 99-110Google Scholar, 66Pericas I. Jolin T. Acta Endocrinol. 1977; 86: 128-139Google Scholar, 67Bagchi N. Brown T.R. Shivers B. Lucas S. Mack R.E. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 1428-1432Google Scholar). In thyroid gland in vivo, a direct synergy of TSH and circulating insulin, besides locally produced IGF-I (68Thomas G. Davies H.G. Williams E.D. J. Pathol. 1994; 173: 355-360Google Scholar), might be an interesting possibility that deserves further studies. INTRODUCTIONInsulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorMAPmitogen-activated proteinIRSinsulin receptor substrateGrb-2growth factor receptor bound 2TSHthyrotropinEGFepidermal growth factorBrdUrd8-bromodeoxyuridineHGFhepatocyte growth factorTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateIGFBPIGF-binding protein. are related hormones (50% sequence homology) and bind to highly similar receptors, which consist of two extracellular α subunits (∼130 kDa) and two membrane-spanning β-subunits (∼95 kDa) linked by disulfide bounds (1Werner H. Adamo M. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 1-58Google Scholar, 2De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Google Scholar). Insulin receptors more weakly recognize IGF-I and IGF-II. Conversely, IGF-I receptors preferentially recognize IGF-I but also bind IGF-II and insulin with 10-fold and 100-1000-fold weaker affinity, respectively (1Werner H. Adamo M. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 1-58Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, transautophosphorylation reactions of the receptor β-subunit increase its tyrosine kinase activity toward endogenous substrates (3White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar). Activity of insulin and IGF-I receptors thus converges on the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 (3White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar, 4Myers M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Google Scholar) and IRS-2 (5Patti M.-E. Sun X.-J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Google Scholar)), which then act with the receptor itself as docking proteins for other substrates such as the 85-kDa adaptor subunit of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and Grb-2. Grb-2 in turn recruits the mSOS nucleotide exchange factor, which activates Ras and triggers a kinase cascade culminating in the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases (2De Meyts P. Wallach B.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 597-611Google Scholar).Despite the large similarity of insulin and IGF-I receptors and intracellular signaling pathways, the main physiological actions of insulin in vivo and in vitro involve glucose, protein, and lipid metabolisms, whereas IGF-I acts as a mitogenic hormone or cytokine. Subtle differences in the biochemistry of the two receptors have been proposed to explain the fundamental difference in the physiological roles of insulin and IGF-I (7LeRoith D. Sampson P.C. Roberts C.T. Horm. Res. 1994; 4: 74-79Google Scholar). They include some differences in the C-terminal regions of the insulin and IGF-I receptors (8Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Google Scholar, 9McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Levy J. Huecksteadt T. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8904-8911Google Scholar) (of the two tyrosine residues phosphorylated on activation of the insulin receptor, only one is present in the IGF-I receptor; the lacking residue could be important for metabolic signaling but not for mitogenicity (10Takata Y. Webster N.J.G. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9135-9139Google Scholar, 11Baron V. Gantier N. Kaliman P. Dolais-Kitabgi J. Van Obberghen E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9365-9370Google Scholar)), a higher dissociation rate of ligands from the insulin receptor compared with IGF-I receptor (2De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Google Scholar), or somewhat different substrate specificities of kinase catalytic domains (12Xu B. Bird V.G. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29825-29830Google Scholar). Nevertheless, insulin has been found to signal a mitogenic pathway through its own receptor rather than IGF-I receptors in transfected NIH 3T3 or Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress insulin receptors (8Lammers R.

Sci. 1995; 766: 409-415Google Scholar).Whether insulin can signal mitogenesis through its own receptor in normal cells containing normal levels of insulin and IGF-I receptors is far less clear (20King G.L. Kahn C.R. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 130-140Google Scholar, 21Conover A. Hintz R.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1989; 21: 59-63Google Scholar). The dog thyroid primary culture system is a unique model to reassess the biological role of insulin and IGF ligand-receptor systems. DNA synthesis and proliferation of these cells can be separately triggered either by growth factors including EGF acting through tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways or by TSH acting through cAMP (22Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 323-329Google Scholar, 23Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Google Scholar). Among other major differences between the two mitogenic pathways (24Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Google Scholar, 25Roger P.P. Reuse S. Maenhaut C. Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 59-191Google Scholar), we previously noticed that the stimulation of DNA synthesis by EGF depended on high insulin concentrations that could interact with IGF-I receptors, whereas 100-1000-fold lower insulin concentrations were sufficient to support the TSH stimulation of DNA synthesis (23Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterize the insulin and IGF-I receptors of dog thyrocytes in culture, their expression, and their involvement in the comitogenic effects of insulin and IGFs. Unexpectedly, we found that TSH through cAMP induces the expression of insulin receptors but not of IGF-I receptors. This is associated with an enhanced responsiveness of the cells not only to insulin but also to IGFs and explains the comitogenic effect of low insulin concentrations in the presence of TSH."

We have now obtained genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that DnaK heat shock protein of <i>E. coli</i>, a prokaryotic homologue of hsp70, is involved in this re-supercoiling of DNA. As re-supercoiling of DNA did not occur in an <i>rpoH</i> amber mutant, it seems likely that heat shock proteins are required for this reaction. Plasmid DNA in a <i>dnaK</i> deletion mutant relaxed excessively after temperature shift-up, and the re-supercoiling of DNA was not observed. DNAs incubated with a crude cell extract prepared from the <i>dnaK</i> mutant were more relaxed than seen with the extract from its isogenic wild-type strain, and the addition of purified DnaK protein to the mutant extract led to an increase in the negative supercoiling of DNA. Moreover, reaction products of purified DNA gyrase more negatively supercoiled in the presence of DnaK protein. Based on these results, we propose that DnaK protein plays a role in maintaining the negative supercoiling of DNA against thermal stress."

Acceleration of the rate of inhibition of factor Xa involves a conformational change in antithrombin that is translated from the heparin binding site to the reactive center loop. A mechanism has been proposed for generation and propagation of the conformational change in which the binding of the negatively charged heparin reduces ionic repulsions between positively charged residues on and adjacent to the D-helix in the heparin binding site of antithrombin (van Boeckel, C. A. A., Grootenhuis, P. D. J., and Visser, A. (1994) Nature Struct. Biol. 1, 423-425). This charge neutralization is proposed to elongate the D-helix and initiate the conformational change which is then translated to the reactive center loop. Several basic residues, including arginine 132 and lysine 133, were predicted to be important both in heparin binding and in this mechanism of heparin activation. To test both the helix extension mechanism and the role of these two residues in heparin binding and factor Xa inhibition, we individually changed arginine 132 and lysine 133 to uncharged methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. The Kd values for binding of R132M and K133M variants to the high affinity pentasaccharide were weakened only 2.3- and 4.5-fold respectively, suggesting a location for R132 and K133 peripheral to the main pentasaccharide binding site. However, the Kd values for long chain high affinity heparin were weakened at least 17-fold for both R132M and K133M, indicating involvement of each residue in binding extended chain heparin species. These reductions in affinity were ionic strength-dependent. The rates of inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by each variant, however, were indistinguishable from those of control antithrombin, and the accelerations of the rate of inhibition produced by heparin were normal. We conclude that neither arginine 132 nor lysine 133 plays an important role in the binding of heparin pentasaccharide or in the mechanism of heparin activation, suggesting that D-helix extension through charge neutralization is not the mechanism for transmission of conformational change from the heparin binding site to the reactive center region.

The activity of the sequences flanking the first exon of the gene was investigated using a luciferase-based reporter assay in transiently transfected HepG2, COS1, BSC40, and HeLa cells. Deletion analysis allowed the mapping of two elements able to promote antithrombin gene transcription in HepG2 and COS1 cells. The first element is located upstream of the first exon (−150/+68 nucleotides). The second element is in the first intervening sequence (+300/+700 nucleotides) and functions in an orientation opposite to that of the first.

The mechanisms underlying AT gene expression are not well known. The AT gene is expressed primarily in the liver, with lower levels in the kidney and brain (2Sheffield W.P. Wu Y.I.

The orientations of the various constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis and/or DNA sequencing. Control luciferase reporter plasmids contained the SV40 early promoter-enhancer complex (pGL Prom-Enh, Promega) or the liver-specific proximal promoter from the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS) gene (pCPS-luc; Ref. 6Howell B.W. Lagace M. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2928-2933Google Scholar). A SV40 β-galactosidase-derived reporter plasmid (pSV-βGAL, Promega) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The parent luciferase plasmid pSVOA-LΔ5′ was included as a control for background luciferase expression. Promoter, enhancer, or repressor activity of AT sequences was tested in the following vectors: pGL (Promega), a SV40 derivative; and pCPS −67/+3 nt-luc and pTK −81/+52 nt-luc, containing the minimal promoters of the CPS and thymidine kinase genes, respectively. Single and multiple copies of elements A and B were inserted upstream of the minimal promoters of pCPS −67/+3 nt-luc and pTK −81/+52 nt-luc. Single copies cloned in pUC19 were digested with KpnI/SalI and inserted between the KpnI/XhoI sites of both reporter plasmids. Multiple copies of the elements obtained from self-ligation were subcloned into pBluescript (KS)+ (Stratagene), digested with KpnI/SacI or HindIII/SacI, and inserted into the KpnI/SacI sites of pCPS-luc or the HindIII/SacI sites of pTK-luc. Vectors for the in vitro and in vivo expression of various transcription factors have been described: human COUP-TF1 (7Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Google Scholar), a truncated version of human COUP-TF1 (t-COUP-TF1) lacking its first 51 amino acids (7Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Google Scholar), rat HNF4α (8Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Transcriptional Regulation of Liver-Specific Genes. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 1-32Google Scholar), rat PPARα (9Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vectors for the expression of mouse C/EBPα and rat HNF3α and β were a generous gift of Drs. P. Hoodless and J. Darnell, The Rockefeller University. Large scale plasmid preparations were made either by two rounds of centrifugation on CsCl or by anion exchange chromatography (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA).Fig. 2Deletional analysis of the −1100/+68 nt AT region.

Cells at 50-60% confluence were transfected with 25 μg of DNA (20 μg of plasmid plus 5 μg of carrier DNA) by calcium phosphate precipitation (10Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Google Scholar), followed by a 10% glycerol shock 16 h post-transfection (with the exception of COS1 cells). Lipofection transfections were performed as described (11Carlsson P. Bjursell G. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 113-121Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments, all cells were incubated for 24 h before and during transfection in medium without phenol red and containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (9Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5723-5727Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of the AT minimal promoter construct pAT−150/+68 nt-luc and 1-8 μg of the expression vectors for various transcription factors. The amount of plasmid transfected was normalized to 20 μg with the parental vectors pSG5 or pRC/CMV (2.5 μg each) and carrier DNA. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection and was normalized to the protein content of the lysates and to β-galactosidase activity. The −150/+68 nt DraI/EaeI fragment of the AT gene was made blunt and subcloned in both orientations into the plasmid pGEM-3Zf(+). The plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and the 3′-ends were labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. The plasmid was then digested with HindIII, and the probe was purified from agarose gel. DNase I cleavage and protection by total cellular extracts of HepG2, COS1, and HeLa cells were performed in the presence of bovine serum albumin, poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and carrier DNA, as described (12Graves B.J. Johnson F. McKnight R. Cell. 1986; 44: 565-576Google Scholar). The amounts of extract and DNase I used are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with nuclear extracts of HepG2, COS1, BSC40, and HeLa cells (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 5: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides tested (wild-type; mutant elements A, B, and C; and oligonucleotides for competition) are listed in Table I. Additional oligonucleotides for binding of CTF/NF1, NFκB, TFIID, SP1, AP1, AP2, and AP3 were obtained from Promega. Each oligonucleotide and its complementary strand (with added restriction sites) were annealed and subcloned into pUC18 (Stratagene). For element B, a −28/+47 nt NlaIV/BstXI fragment of the AT promoter subcloned into the plasmid pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega) was also tested. Restriction fragments of each element were labeled at their 3′-ends with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Extracts containing 10 μg of protein were incubated for 15 min with each probe (2.5 ng) at 25°C in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 μg of carrier DNA (unless otherwise indicated). Buffer conditions were as described (14Gillman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried at 4°C on prerun 4% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio) with 6.7 mM Tris, 6.7 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA as running buffer. In competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides were used at 100 molar excess of the test oligonucleotide (unless otherwise indicated). In supershift assays, 1 μl of antiserum or 0.5 μg of an IgG fraction was used. Antibodies were added immediately after addition of labeled probe, and the reaction was incubated for another 30 min unless otherwise indicated. In vitro transcription-translation assays were carried out with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-coupled system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Reactions were done concomitantly with and without L-[35S]methionine. The efficiency of the translation was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the labeled products. Unlabeled translation products were used for EMSA, and the total amount of lysate was maintained at 4 μl with unprogrammed lysate. The specificity of the shifts was confirmed by supershift analysis.Table IOligonucleotides used in the mobility shift assays (upper strands only)ConsensusOligonucleotideElement AWild typeGGTCATCAGCCTTTGACCTCAGTTCC5′ truncatedCATCAGCCTTTGACCTCAGTTCCMutant 1GGTCATCAGCCTTTGAggTCAGTTCCMutant 2GGTCATCAGggaaaGACCTCAGTTCCMutant 3GGTCATCAGCCTTTcAggTCAGTTCCMutant 4GGTCATCAGggaaaTGAggTCAGTTCCPYBPCTTTGACCTGElement BWild typeCCAGTTTTCAGGCGGATTGCCTCAGATCACACMutant 1CCAGggggCAGGCMutant 2GGcccccCTCAGATCMutant 3CCAGggggCAGGCGGccccCTCAGATCElement CWild typeCAACACTGGGCTCTACACTTTGCTTAACCCompetitionHNF4TCGAGGCAAGGTTCATATTTGTGTAGGCOUP-TF1TTTCTATGGTGTCAAAGGTCAAACTGHNF3CCTGATTCTGATTATTGACTTAGTCAACGC/EBPAGATTGCGCAATCTGHD-PPRETCTCCTTTGACCTATTGAACTATTACCTACATT Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the results of deletional analysis of cis-elements flanking exon 1 of the AT gene in the reporter plasmid pSVOA-LΔ5′. The data shown were generated following calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of HepG2 and COS1 cells. The largest construct assayed was a 6900-base pair HindIII fragment of the AT gene (Fig. 1A). This fragment was unable to promote luciferase activity. Removal of exon 1 and downstream sequences by cleavage with HindIII at −4800 nt and EaeI at +68 nt, 3 nt upstream of the translational start site of the AT mRNA, provided a construct with detectable luciferase activity (Fig. 1D). Further 5′ deletions to −2500 (Fig. 1E) or −1100 nt (Fig. 1F) did not noticeably change luciferase values. Because slightly lower luciferase expression was obtained for a −4800/+68 nt construct (Fig. 1D) than for a −2500/+68 nt construct (Fig. 1E), the effect of sequences between −4800 and −2500 nt was tested directly in the pGL plasmid system. A −4800/−2500 nt construct did not reduce luciferase activity driven by the SV40 minimal promoter, confirming the absence of a negative element in this region of the gene (data not shown). To facilitate further deletional analysis, the activities of all constructs were reported relative to the activity of the −1100/+68 construct, which was given an arbitrary luciferase value of 100% (Fig. 1F). 5′ deletions of the −1100/+68 construct up to −150 nt did not noticeably alter luciferase activity in either HepG2 or COS1 cells (Fig. 2). Further deletions of the −150/+68 nt element were selected to encompass the area protected in DNA footprints. Deletions to −101, −70, and −28 nt progressively abolished luciferase activity in HepG2 and COS1 cells. A −28/+68 nt construct was unable to promote transcription by itself (Fig. 2). Deletions from the 3′-end and upstream of +68 nt did not show markedly altered luciferase activity up to +11 nt. In contrast, decreased luciferase activity was seen at, and upstream of, −28 nt (Fig. 2). The three elements A, B, and C mapped in footprints were unable to promote luciferase expression when subcloned into pSVOA-LΔ5′ in their natural orientation relative to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3). In contrast, two tandemly repeated copies of element A or three tandemly repeated copies of element B enhanced luciferase expression driven by heterologous minimal promoters when inserted upstream of TK-luc or CPS-luc (Fig. 3). Data presented in Fig. 1 support the possibility of a second regulatory element within IVS1 of the AT gene. This element was identified following subcloning of the +300/+2100 nt region of IVS1 in an inverse orientation upstream of the luciferase gene (Fig. 1I). Effectively, insertion of this fragment led to an increase in luciferase activity in pSVOA-LΔ5′. The presence of this second regulatory element was confirmed by further deletional analysis, allowing the narrowing of the active sequences to +300/+700 nt (Fig. 1J). When the initial +300/+2100 nt construct, or its deletions, were inserted in their natural orientation relative to the luciferase gene, no increase in luciferase expression was observed (Fig. 1, H and K-M). The strength of the element in IVS1 to promote luciferase expression was about 50% and 25% relative to the level of expression of the 5′ upstream element in COS1 cells and HepG2 cells, respectively. The lower efficiency in HepG2 cells as compared to COS1 cells was seen with both the original IVS1 construct and with deletions derived from it. Fig. 4, Fig. 5 define the areas protected by nuclear extracts in the upper and lower strands of the −150/+68 nt probe from the 5′ upstream promoter. Three elements, designated A, B, and C (in decreasing order of protected strength) were identified. Element A was strongly protected in both DNA strands and gave a very similar pattern for the three sources of nuclear extracts (HepG2, COS1, and HeLa). Element A extended from −89 to −65 nt in the upper strand (Fig. 4) and from −92 to −68 nt in the lower strand (Fig. 5). Element B was protected by nuclear extracts prepared from the three cell lines, but stronger protection was observed with extracts from COS1 cells and HepG2 cells than from HeLa cells. This was particularly evident in the upper strand when increasing amounts of DNase I, or of nuclear extract, were added (Fig. 4). In the upper strand, differences in the boundaries of element B were also observed (Fig. 4, lanes 2 (top dashed line), 8 (top solid line), and 10 (top double line, top solid line)); nuclear extracts from HeLa, HepG2, and COS1 cells were protected from +3 nt, −10 nt (area −10/+3 nt slightly protected), and −14 nt to +37 nt, respectively. The protection of element B in the lower strand (Fig. 5, lanes 13-15) was similar (−8/+30 nt) for extracts from the three cell lines. Element C (−124/−101 nt) was seen clearly only in the lower DNA strand with extracts from all three cell lines (Fig. 5). Variations in the DNase I concentration, or in the amount of nuclear extract, did not give protection of the upper strand.Fig. 5Footprint analysis of the −150/+68 nt lower strand of AT.

Element A exhibited similar shifts with the three sources of extract (Fig. 6, A and B). Binding could be competed with an excess of unlabeled element A (Fig. 6A, lane 2) and with oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites of members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, such as COUP-TF1 and HNF4 (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Element A was also effectively competed with the peroxisome proliferator response element of the rat hydratase-dehydrogenase gene (HD-PPRE) (Fig. 6A, lane 6), which is very similar in sequence to element A. The HD-PPRE has been shown to interact with a number of nuclear hormone receptors, including COUP-TF1 and 2, HNF4, RXR, PPAR, TR, and LXR (9Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S.

Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). No competition for binding to element A was seen with oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites for elements B, C, and the general transcription factors listed in Table I (e.g. CTF/NF1; Fig. 6A, lane 7). Supershift analysis with anti-COUP-TF1 antibodies confirmed the interaction of COUP-TF1 with element A in all cell extracts (Fig. 6B). Antibodies against HNF4 showed a supershift with HepG2 extract, but not with HeLa or COS1 extracts (Fig. 6B). Antibodies against RXRα and PPARα also generated supershifts with extracts from HeLa and HepG2 cells (Fig. 6B). Similarly, antibody to TRα, another ubiquitous nuclear hormone receptor shown to bind the HD-PPRE (12Graves B.J. Johnson F. McKnight R. Cell. 1986; 44: 565-576Google Scholar, 15Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesomo K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.D. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar), reacted with element A and extract from HeLa cells (other sources of extracts not tested). Mobility shifts were generated with element B and nuclear extracts from the three cell lines. Binding could be competed with excess unlabeled element B, but not elements A or C. Data for HepG2 nuclear extracts are presented in Fig. 6C. Competition assays suggested interactions of element B with HNF3 (lane 1) and members of the CCAAT-binding proteins, such as C/EBPα and CTF/NF1 (lane 2 or 10 and lane 4, respectively). The Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen 1-nuclear factor 1 (EBNA1-NF1), another element known to bind members of this protein family, also competed strongly with element B for binding (Fig. 6C, lane 6). Antibodies to isoforms α, β, and γ of HNF3 did not generate supershifts with element B (Fig. 6D for HNF3α). In contrast, supershift analysis confirmed the interaction of C/EBPα with element B in HepG2 extracts after overnight incubation at 4°C of the antibody with the nuclear extract mixture before addition of the probe (Fig. 6D). Mutant B3 (+3/+27 nt; Fig. 6C, lane 12), or half-site mutant B1 (+3/+13 nt; Fig. 6C, lane 9) could not compete for binding to element B, while mutant B2 (+10/+27 nt; Fig. 6C, lane 11) competed only slightly. Mobility shifts were generated with element C and nuclear extracts from all three cell lines (Fig. 6E, data for HepG2 and HeLa nuclear extracts). Binding to element C could be competed with excess unlabeled element C and also partially with element A (Fig. 6E, lanes 3 and 1, respectively). Additional competition assays suggested interactions of element C with HNF4, HNF3, and C/EBPα (Fig. 6E, lanes 6-10). Supershift analysis confirmed a partial interaction of element C with HNF4 (Fig. 6F). Interaction of the AT 5′ upstream promoter was observed with two liver-enriched factors, HNF4 and C/EBPα. HNF4 bound to elements A and C (Fig. 7, A and D, respectively), whereas C/EBPα bound to element B (Fig. 7B). 5′ truncation of element A (removal of a nuclear hormone receptor consensus half-site at −92/−88 nt) did not suppress HNF4 binding (Fig. 7A). The additional element A mutations tested were targeted to the nuclear hormone receptor half-site TGACC at −75/−79 nt and to the 5 nt immediately upstream. None of the mutants tested could bind HNF4. Interactions between ubiquitous nuclear hormone receptors and element A were also detected by EMSA. Addition of both PPARα and RXRα with element A resulted in a shift, suggesting heterodimerization of these receptors (Fig. 7A). No binding was seen with either receptor alone. No mutant of element A bound the combination of both receptors. In contrast, binding of TRα was seen with the wild-type and all mutant A elements, although TRα binding to mutant A4 was greatly reduced (Fig. 7C). Fig. 7 also presents the binding profile of COUP-TF1 with the wild-type and mutant A elements. COUP-TF1 interacted strongly with element A, with additional species above the primary shifted species (Fig. 7A). COUP-TF1 dimerization on element A was assessed by incubation with full-length COUP-TF1 and with a truncated form of the same receptor (Tr-COUP). This truncated form has been shown previously to retain intact DNA binding properties (7Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Google Scholar). After EMSA, a new shifted species migrating between the COUP-TF1 and Tr-COUP species was seen, indicating dimerization of the COUP-TF1 receptor (Fig. 7C, arrow). 5′ truncation of element A (−87/−65 nt element) did not suppress COUP-TF1 binding (Fig. 7A). Mutant A1 (TGAgg at −76/−75 nt) and mutant A2 (ggaaTGACC at −83/−80 nt) retained the ability to bind COUP-TF1 (Fig. 7A). Mutant A3, which combines the mutations in mutants A1 and A2, and mutant A4 (TcAgg modification at −78/−76/−75 nt) abolished COUP-TF1 binding (Fig. 7A). These results suggest that the −79/−75 nt half-site is critical for COUP-TF1 binding and that the nucleotides immediately upstream of this motif also influence COUP-TF1 binding, although to a lesser degree. We attempted to detect receptor heterodimerization on element A. There was no evidence of COUP-TF1 heterodimerization with any receptor (Fig. 7C). Likewise, HNF4 did not heterodimerize with TRα or PPARα, although preliminary evidence from supershift analysis suggested a RXRα-HNF4 interaction. As seen in Fig. 8, addition of antibodies resulted in the disappearance of the shifted species formed with element A. Supershifted species were formed also with with anti-HNF4 antibodies (lanes 3, 10, and 13; single arrowhead) and with anti-RXRα antibodies (lanes 7 and 11; double arrowhead). Anti-PPARα antibodies did not form a readily discernible supershifted species; however, these antibodies did result in the disappearance in the shifted species formed with element A (Fig. 8, lane 8). Addition of antibodies against RXRα to a reaction containing element A and both HNF4 and RXRα formed a supershifted species (Fig. 8, lane 11). As RXRα alone was unable to bind element A, the results suggest that a complex of HNF4-RXRα can form on element A. Expression of HNF4 and C/EBPa in transient transfections of HepG2 and BSC40 cells activated transcription from the AT 5′-upstream promoter (Fig. 9). RXRα activated transcription in BSC40 cells, but almost not at all in HepG2 cells. COUP-TF1, TRα, HNF3, and, to a lesser extent PPARα, repressed transcription in both cell types. Activation by HNF4 was reduced by coexpression of COUP-TF1, TRα, and PPARα/RXRα. In HepG2 cells, activation by HNF4 was reduced by coexpression of PPARα or RXRa alone. In contrast in BSC40 cells, when HNF4 and RXRa were cotransfected, the increase in luciferase expression was up to 7-fold higher than the increase expected by the sum of activities of both factors, suggesting RXRα-HNF4 synergy. The addition of all the receptors tested resulted in a marked decrease of AT gene transcriptional efficienc"

https://openalex.org/W2052585651,"Various models of the transmembrane topology of the Na+,K+-ATPase predict either 8 or 10 membrane spans for the α-subunit and one to three membrane spans for the β-subunit. Structure/function analysis, however, requires precise knowledge about the folding of enzymes. Therefore, the intention of this work was to establish a transmembrane topology model for the subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase. The bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase was fused to the C termini of truncated α- and β-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase. Fusions were generated at Arg60 (LTTAR60), Glu116 (AATEE116), Ala247 (VEGTA247), Leu311 (YTWEL311), Ala444 (VAGDA444), Ala789 (IFIIA789), Met809 (LGTDM809), Asp884 (RVTWD884), Ile946 (MKNKI946), and Arg972 (GVALR972) of the sheep α1-subunit and at Pro236 (LGGYP236) of the dog β-subunit. The fusion constructs were expressed in yeast cells for studies on the localization of the fused reporter enzyme. Activity measurements of the reporter enzyme revealed that only intracellular fusion sites lead to active β-galactosidase. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with cells expressing α1/β-galactosidase and β/β-galactosidase hybrid proteins demonstrated that inactive β-galactosidase is associated with the yeast plasma membrane and can be detected from the extracellular side. The data obtained suggest that Pro236 of the β-subunit is located on the extracellular surface, corresponding to a model with one transmembrane segment, and that the α-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase consists of 10 membrane-associated spans. They also suggest that a stretch of the α1-subunit between membrane spans M7 and M8 might be hidden within the membrane, surrounded by the other hydrophobic spans, in analogy to the P-loop of Na+ or K+ channels and to the “hourglass” structure of water channels. Various models of the transmembrane topology of the Na+,K+-ATPase predict either 8 or 10 membrane spans for the α-subunit and one to three membrane spans for the β-subunit. Structure/function analysis, however, requires precise knowledge about the folding of enzymes. Therefore, the intention of this work was to establish a transmembrane topology model for the subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase. The bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase was fused to the C termini of truncated α- and β-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase. Fusions were generated at Arg60 (LTTAR60), Glu116 (AATEE116), Ala247 (VEGTA247), Leu311 (YTWEL311), Ala444 (VAGDA444), Ala789 (IFIIA789), Met809 (LGTDM809), Asp884 (RVTWD884), Ile946 (MKNKI946), and Arg972 (GVALR972) of the sheep α1-subunit and at Pro236 (LGGYP236) of the dog β-subunit. The fusion constructs were expressed in yeast cells for studies on the localization of the fused reporter enzyme. Activity measurements of the reporter enzyme revealed that only intracellular fusion sites lead to active β-galactosidase. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with cells expressing α1/β-galactosidase and β/β-galactosidase hybrid proteins demonstrated that inactive β-galactosidase is associated with the yeast plasma membrane and can be detected from the extracellular side. The data obtained suggest that Pro236 of the β-subunit is located on the extracellular surface, corresponding to a model with one transmembrane segment, and that the α-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase consists of 10 membrane-associated spans. They also suggest that a stretch of the α1-subunit between membrane spans M7 and M8 might be hidden within the membrane, surrounded by the other hydrophobic spans, in analogy to the P-loop of Na+ or K+ channels and to the “hourglass” structure of water channels. Na+,K+-ATPase (sodium pump; EC 3.6.1.37) is an enzyme embedded in plasma membranes of animal cells. The enzyme consists of two subunits, α and β. Various isoforms of both subunits have been described (1Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261Google Scholar, 2Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Google Scholar, 3Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Google Scholar, 4Lingrel J.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 263-270Google Scholar, 5McDonough A.A. Geering K. Farley R.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1598-1605Google Scholar). Both subunits are required for catalytic activity (6Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4189-4192Google Scholar, 7Scheiner-Bobis G. Farley F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 226-234Google Scholar), which consists of the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to the active transport of Na+ and K+ ions against their electrochemical gradients across plasma membranes. The structure/function relationships of the sodium pump have been investigated in great detail with biochemical methods and molecular biological techniques. Nevertheless, it is sometimes difficult to define whether the specific amino acids of interest reside within hydrophobic or hydrophilic areas of the protein. Since the exact number of hydrophobic spans of the α-subunit is still unknown, it is sometimes controversial whether modified amino acids from hydrophilic areas are localized on the extra- or intracellular sides. A precise investigation of structure/function relationships, however, can be carried out successfully only when the spatial organization of the protein is known. Analysis of the transmembrane topology of α- and β-subunits of the sodium pump by hydropathy plots (8Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) does not always produce clear results. While a single transmembrane span can be calculated for the β-subunit, the folding of the α-subunit in the membrane is difficult to predict. Based on current knowledge, the amino-terminal third of the α-subunit transverses the membrane four times (9Jorgensen P.L. Karlish S.J.D. Gitler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7435-7442Google Scholar). This is followed by a large hydrophilic third of the protein that has been identified as the ATP-binding domain of the sodium pump. For the last third of the α-subunit, which is localized between the ATP-binding site and the C terminus, hydropathy analysis has produced conflicting results. The number of the transmembrane spans for this part of the α-subunit varies from three to six in different models (10Antolovic R. Brüller H.J. Bunk S. Linder D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 195-202Google Scholar, 11Shull G.E. Schwarz A. Lingrel J.B. Nature. 1985; 316: 691-695Google Scholar, 12Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3471-3478Google Scholar, 13Ovchinnikov Y.A. Luneva N.M. Arystarkhova E.A. Gevondyan N.M. Arzamazova N.M. Kozhich A.T. Nesmeyanov V.A. Modyanov N.N.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 521-524Google Scholar). Since the C terminus was shown to be localized on the cytoplasmic side (10Antolovic R. Brüller H.J. Bunk S. Linder D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 195-202Google Scholar, 17Vladimirova N.M. Potapenko N.A. Sachs G. Modyanov N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 175-184Google Scholar), either four or six membrane spans are most likely to be formed by the carboxyl-terminal third of the α-subunit. The total number of the hydrophobic spans of the α-subunit should therefore be either 8 or 10. Other methods can help to either correct or supplement the data derived from hydropathy analysis. In several studies, the detection of single amino acids on either the extracellular or intracellular surface of the plasma membrane was used together with the hydropathy data as a basis for the analysis of the transmembrane topology. Asn831 is the amino-terminal amino acid of a 19-kDa hydrophobic fragment derived from the α-subunit that is involved in Rb+ occlusion (18Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Google Scholar, 19Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Stein W.D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 69-76Google Scholar). This fragment can be generated when Na+,K+-ATPase in inside-out vesicles is extensively digested by trypsin. Thus, it was concluded that under physiological conditions, this fragment resides on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. The detection of Asn831 on the intracellular side of the plasma membrane initiated far reaching conclusions about the folding of the α-subunit. As the final result of this investigation, a model with 10 transmembrane spans was preferred over one with 8, although the latter could not be excluded (12Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3471-3478Google Scholar, 18Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Google Scholar). The transmembrane topology of the α-subunit has also been analyzed by the use of antibodies directed against either naturally occurring or artificially inserted epitopes (13Ovchinnikov Y.A. Luneva N.M. Arystarkhova E.A. Gevondyan N.M. Arzamazova N.M. Kozhich A.T. Nesmeyanov V.A. Modyanov N.N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 230-234Google Scholar, 15Yoon K.L. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28249-28258Google Scholar, 20Mohraz M. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2929-2936Google Scholar, 21Arystarkhova E. Gasparian M. Modyanov N.N. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13694-13701Google Scholar). Although this approach is most promising for the analysis of transmembrane topology, the results obtained can be controversial. For example, the sequence 887WINDVEDSYGQQWTYEQR904 of the α-subunit from pig kidney was detected on either the extra- or intracellular side of the plasma membrane using the same IIC9 antibody in different investigations (13Ovchinnikov Y.A. Luneva N.M. Arystarkhova E.A. Gevondyan N.M. Arzamazova N.M. Kozhich A.T. Nesmeyanov V.A. Modyanov N.N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 230-234Google Scholar, 20Mohraz M. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2929-2936Google Scholar). In addition, the use of antibodies against artificial epitopes that were inserted by molecular biological methods is not always conclusive. In some cases, the epitopes could not be detected, possibly because they were hidden within the protein (15Yoon K.L. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28249-28258Google Scholar). As a result, transmembrane topology models with either 8 or 10 transmembrane spans were proposed. In the work presented here, a different approach was used to determine the correct number of transmembrane spans of the α- or β-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase. The entire lacZ gene of Escherichia coli that is missing the start codon ATG was fused 3′-terminally in selected restriction sites of either the α- or β-subunit cDNAs. The lacZ gene codes for β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) (β-gal), 1The abbreviations used are: β-galβ-galactosidaseX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranosideONPGo-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranosideC12FDG5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-β-galactopyranosideCPCQ2-(5′-chloro-2′-phosphoryloxyphenyl)-6-chloro-4-[3H]quinazolinoneN3ATPazidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. which can be transcribed correctly only when the fusion occurs in frame with the ATG codon of either the α- or β-subunit cDNA. The hybrid DNA molecules were expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells contain neither endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase nor β-gal, but they can express both proteins. In all hybrid proteins, β-gal is localized C-terminally. Depending upon the location of the fusion site, it was expected that β-gal would be expressed either on the cytosolic or on the extracellular side of the yeast cell membranes. A presupposition for this assumption is that the expressed hydrophobic parts of the α- or β-subunit are correctly inserted and that the hydrophilic β-gal moiety protrudes out of the plasma membrane. β-galactosidase 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-β-galactopyranoside 2-(5′-chloro-2′-phosphoryloxyphenyl)-6-chloro-4-[3H]quinazolinone azidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. The results presented here confirm this assumption. Based on the localization of the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase in expressed fusion proteins, the data help to derive a topological model for the transmembrane organization of the Na+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits. This model might affect our understanding of the functional mechanism of the sodium pump. Strains and vectors are listed in Table I. For subcloning steps with the plasmid pBluescript® II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the E. coli strain HB101 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. E. coli SURE® cells (Pharmacia, Uppsala) were used as a host strain for transformations with the vector pMC1871 (Pharmacia) that contains the complete β-galactosidase gene. Bacteria were grown in LB broth. Antibiotics were supplemented at final concentrations of 50-100 μg/ml for ampicillin and 10-20 μg/ml for tetracycline. Colonies expressing β-galactosidase and β-galactosidase fusion proteins were identified on LB agar plates supplemented with 20-40 μg/ml concentrations of the chromogenic indicator X-gal. S. cerevisiae strain 20B12 (22Chen C.Y. Oppermann H. Hitzeman R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8951-8970Google Scholar) was transformed by the method of Ito et al. (23Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar) with vectors based on pCGY1406αβ (6Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4189-4192Google Scholar) containing the fusion constructs described in the next paragraph. The vector pCGY1406αβ codes for the sheep α1-subunit and for the dog β-subunit (6Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol.

Yeast cells were grown in YNB, and fusion protein-expressing colonies were visualized on YNB agar plates supplemented with 40-60 μg/ml X-gal.Table IStrains and vectorsStrain or vectorGenotype or relevant propertiesSupplier or Ref.E. coliHB101F− D(macRo-mrr) leu supE44 ara14 galK2 lacY1 proA2 rspL20 (strr) xyl-5 mil-1 recA13Life Technologies, Inc.SUREe14 (mcrA) D(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)171 sbcC recB recI umuC::Tn5 (kanr) uvrC supE44 lac gyrA96 relA1 thi-1 endA1 F′ proAB lacIqZDM15 Tn10 (tetr)PharmaciaS. cerevisiae20B12trp1 pep4-322pCGY1406αβShuttle vector carrying sheep α1 and dog β CUP1 PGK (ampr, TRP1)6pBluescript II SK+Vector carrying lacZ′ lac(amp′)StratagenepMC1871lacZ fusion vector without promotor (tetr)PharmaciapCALLZ seriesα/lacZ fusions in pCGY1406αβThis studypCABL236LZβ/lacZ fusion in pCGY1406αβThis study Open table in a new tab Restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp., New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), Stratagene, and MBI (Vilnius, Lithuania). Oligonucleotides, if not otherwise specified, were obtained from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Cloning procedures were performed according to standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Vols. 1-3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase was fused in frame with the α1-gene by various cloning steps. The fusion expression plasmid pCAL60LZ was constructed by cloning the SalI cartridge of the plasmid pMC1871 (Pharmacia) containing the entire lacZ gene into the XhoI site of the shuttle vector pCGY1406αβ. Fusions AL444LZ and AL751LZ′ were prepared by the following subcloning procedure. The plasmid pBD was obtained by the insertion of a 10-mer linker containing a BglII site (Stratagene) into the EcoRV site of the plasmid pBluescript II SK+ and the subsequent deletion of the BamHI-BglII fragment. This step was required in order to abolish the BglII site and to maintain the reading frame for lacZ′ of pBluescript II SK+ coding for the α-polypeptide complementing M15 mutants of E. coli cells. The XhoI-ApaI fragment of pCGY1406αβ was ligated into the XhoI-ApaI site of plasmid pBD and was designated pBDA. The PstI lacZ cartridge of pMC1871 was ligated to NsiI-cut pBDA. The new XhoI-ApaI fragment was ligated back into pCGY1406αβ, resulting in pCAL444LZ. The fusion vector pCAL751LZ′ was constructed by cloning EcoRI cartridges containing the incomplete lacZ gene into the MunI site of pBDA and ligation into the original MunI site of the XhoI-ApaI fragment. This construct is missing the 3′-terminal part of the lacZ gene and codes for inactive β-galactosidase. It was used as an internal control. Fusion AL946LZ was obtained by ligating BglII-PstI adapters to a mobilized BamHI cartridge of the lacZ gene and to BglII-cut pBDA. Fusion AL972LZ was prepared similarly with the use of XhoI-Eco81I adapters and a lacZ SalI cartridge. Fusion AL247LZ was prepared as follows. A 13-mer linker containing an EcoNI site was inserted into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+, resulting in pBE. XhoI- and EcoNI-cut pBE was ligated to the corresponding α1-fragment, resulting in plasmid pBEA. After the insertion of an 8-mer linker containing a BglII site into the Eco72I site within the α1-portion of pBEA, the modified plasmid was digested with BglII and was ligated to the lacZ BamHI cartridge of pMC1871. Mutations were necessary to insert the lacZ gene into sites not accessible by restriction enzymes. The first step consisted of the construction of mutation plasmids (see Table I) containing subcloned portions of the α1-gene. The SacI-KpnI polylinker fragment of pBluescript II SK+ was replaced with a new polylinker containing sites for BglII, Eco72I, MunI, and XhoI. The new plasmid was designated pBP. XhoI-Eco72I and MunI-BglII fragments of the α1-cDNA were cloned into the new polylinker restriction sites. These new plasmids were designated pBPA1 and pBPA2, respectively. Mutagenesis was done by polymerase chain reaction (25Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Google Scholar) to create new BamHI sites using Tfl polymerase (Epicentre Technologies Corp., Madison, WI). In addition, pBEA was used to introduce a BglII site within the Eco72I-NsiI portion of the α1-cDNA. After insertion of the lacZ cartridge into the new restriction sites, the modified α1-genes were re-inserted into pCGY1406αβ by subcloning steps. The fusion plasmid pCDL236LZ was constructed by deleting the α1-cDNA in pCGY1406αβ with KpnI, inserting a 10-mer linker containing an XhoI site (Promega, Madison, WI) into the SmaI site of the reduced plasmid, and then ligating this to the SalI cartridge of the lacZ gene. The complete plasmid was recovered by cloning in the KpnI α1-fragment. All constructs were analyzed by restriction digests. Correct polymerase chain reaction amplification was controlled by DNA sequencing (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) with the Sequenase™ kit (U. S. Biomedical Corp.). Yeast cells were grown in YNB at 28°C to late log phase (A600 = 1.0-1.5). The culture was centrifuged at 1500 × g at 4°C and washed twice with ice-cold deionized water. At this point, pellets can be stored frozen at −80°C. All following steps were carried out at 0-4°C. Cells were suspended in freshly prepared breakage buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin) and were stirred with glass beads in a bead beater apparatus six times for 20 s with 1-min intervals on ice. Cell debris was pelleted by a 10-min centrifugation at 6000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The resulting membrane pellet was suspended in 1-2 ml of 25 mM imidazole and 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, and was stored at −20°C. Yeast membranes were suspended in sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and heated at 70°C for 7 min before loading onto SDS gels (4% stacking gel, 6% separating gel) according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). A total of 20 μg of protein (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) was loaded on each lane. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) at 100 mA for 1.5 h (29Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Google Scholar). Blots were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the β-galactosidase of the fusion proteins (1:2000 dilution; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). This primary antibody was then visualized by the ECL™ system (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). β-Galactosidase activity of yeast membranes was determined using the protocol of Rose and Botstein (30Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Google Scholar). A total of 100 μl of membrane suspension containing 10 mg of protein was diluted with 900 μl of Z-buffer (60 mM Na2PO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, and 0.27% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), and 60 μl of 0.1% SDS and 90 μl of chloroform were added. The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 20 s. After equilibration at room temperature for 5 min, ONPG was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mg/ml. The reaction was stopped at various times by adding 0.5 ml of 1 M Na2CO3. Specific activity was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm and comparing this with a standard curve established using β-galactosidase of known activity (Boehringer). Substrate fluorescence imaging for the detection of intracellularly localized β-galactosidase was performed by use of the fluorogenic β-galactosidase substrate C12FDG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described by Zhang et al. (31Zhang Y.Z. Naleway J.J. Larison K.D. Huang Z.J. Haugland R.P. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3108-3113Google Scholar). Yeast cells in late logarithmic phase growth were suspended in Z-buffer supplemented with 0.3 mM chloroquine (Sigma) to reduce background fluorescence (31Zhang Y.Z. Naleway J.J. Larison K.D. Huang Z.J. Haugland R.P. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3108-3113Google Scholar) and were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min, the cells were resuspended in Z-buffer containing 25 mM C12FDG. Fluorescence was observed after incubation for 1-2 h by using a Leitz fluorescence microscope with an excitation filter in the blue range of 350-450 nm and an emission filter open above 520 nm. Indirect immunofluorescence for the detection of extracellularly localized β-galactosidase was investigated by use of ELF™ (enzyme amplification fluorescence; Molecular Probes, Inc.). First, yeast cells were fixed by incubation for 1.5 h in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (with KOH), containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5; suspended in 1 M sorbitol and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; and treated with 50 units of glucuronidase (Sigma) and 10 units of Zymolyase®-20T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo) for 1 h at 30°C to prepare spheroplasts. Cells were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 3 min and were washed twice with 1 ml of 1 M sorbitol and 1 mM EDTA. Afterwards, cells were suspended in 100 μl of the same buffer, and 20 μl of the spheroplast suspension was transferred to poly-D-lysine (Sigma)-coated slides and fixed in methanol for 5 min and acetone for 30 s at −20°C (32Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min in blocking buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% bovine serum albumin), a polyclonal antibody (Sigma) against the β-galactosidase of the fusion proteins (1 μg/ml after dilution in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 50% (v/v) ethanol)) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 12 h. Thereafter, slides were washed three times in wash buffer, and a biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody (10 μg/ml after dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was applied for another 2 h. Fluorescence was achieved by adding streptavidin, biotinylated alkaline phosphatase, and the substrate CPCQ of ELF. Between additions, washing steps were included. The enzyme reaction was stopped by 25 mM EDTA, 1 mM levamisol, and 0.01% Triton® X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and slides were visualized by microscopy as described above. Ten α1/lacZ fusions and one β/lacZ fusion were generated by direct fusion of lacZ cartridges to the 3′-termini of the α1- and β-genes of the Na+,K+-ATPase. This cloning strategy included subcloning procedures like insertion of linkers and adapters and polymerase chain reaction mutation (Table I). All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing of the fusion sites. Fusion locations on the α1-subunit were chosen on the basis of the theoretical models of Shull et al. (11Shull G.E. Schwarz A. Lingrel J.B. Nature. 1985; 316: 691-695Google Scholar) and Karlish et al. (12Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3471-3478Google Scholar) predicting either 8 or 10 membrane spans, respectively (Fig. 1). When required, single restriction sites were introduced by mutations. Depending upon which of the two models is correct, fusion proteins of the carboxyl-terminal third that follows the ATP-binding domain should be expressed either extra- or intracellularly (Fig. 1, A and B). Additionally, fusion proteins on the amino-terminal end (XhoI site) and the ATP-binding domain (NsiI site) were formed as an internal control for intracellularly expressed β-galactosidase. Fusion proteins within the ouabain-binding site of the α1-subunit localized between membrane spans M1 and M2 (Fig. 1A) and fusion proteins with the β-subunit (Fig. 1C) were formed as a control for extracellular localization of fusion sites. Other fusion proteins within the amino-terminal third of the α1-subunit (Fig. 1A) were formed in order to verify whether the theoretical predictions of both models for four membrane spans between the N terminus and ATP-binding domain are indeed correct. The fusion constructs (Table II) were transformed into E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells. On X-gal-supplemented agar plates, all bacteria were blue in color except clones bearing pCGY1406αβ without any fusion proteins and pCAL751LZ′ lacking the EcoRI-3′-terminus fragment of the entire lacZ gene (Fig. 2A). These negative controls indicate that at least the lacZ portion of all constructed fusion genes is expressed in E. coli. It is unlikely, however, that correct insertion of αβ-complexes containing α1/β-gal and β/β-gal fusion proteins takes place within the bacterial plasma membrane since functional expression of sodium pumps in E. coli was never achieved.Table IISequence functions of constructed fusion vectors and β-gal activity of the fusion proteinsFusion vectorSequence junction (5′→ 3′)Fusion siteFusion proteinβ-gal activitymilliunits/mgpCAL60LZACT GCT CGA CGG ATC CGG GGA ATTArg60α60 / β-gal254 ± 17pCAL116LZACA GAA GAG GAT CCC GTC GTT TTAGlu116α116 /β-gal0pCAL247LZGGC ACT GCA CGA GAT CCC GTC GTTAla247α247 /β-gal60 ± 8pCAL311LZACC TGG TTA GAT CCC GTC GTT TTALeu311α311 /β-gal0pCAL444LZGGT GAT GCA GGT CGA CGG GGA ATTAla444α444 /β-gal7 ± 2pCAL751LZ′GCT TCA ATT CCC GGG GAT CCC GTCIle751α751 /β-gal0pCAL789LZATT ATT GCA AAG GAT CCC GTC GTTAla789α789 /β-gal38 ± 4pCAL809LZACA GAC ATG GAT CCC GTC GTT TTAMet809α809 /β-gal0pCAL884LZACC TGG GAT CCC GTC GTT TTA CAAAsp884α884 /β-gal30 ± 3pCAL946LZAAG AAC AAG ATC TCT GCA GGT CGAIle946α946 /β-gal15 ± 2pCAL972LZGTT GCC CTG AGG ACT CGA CGG ATCArg972α972 /β-gal0pCBL236LZGGC GGC TAC CCC CCT CGA CGG ATCPro236β236 /β-gal2 ± 1 Open table in a new tab In the case of yeast cells transformed by the constructed fusion vectors (Fig. 2B), only fusions at Arg60, Ala247, Ala789, Asp884, and Ile946 resulted in markedly blue clones. Yeast cells transformed with pCAL444LZ showed only a weak blue color that grew darker with time. Clones bearing fusion vectors pCAL116LZ, pCAL311LZ, pCAL809LZ, and pCAL972LZ remained white. Measurements of the β-gal activity within isolated yeast membranes (Table II) revealed the highest activity for the shortest fusion protein (α60/β-gal), although the observed enzymatic activity did not correlate with the length of the truncated α1-chain. Membranes isolated from yeast cells transformed with fusion vectors pCAL116LZ, pCAL311LZ, pCAL809LZ, and pCAL972LZ did not display any β-gal activity (Table II). The same applies for membranes isolated from cells transformed with pCAL751LZ′. This vector codes for the expression of an inactive β-gal with a truncated carboxyl terminus (Table II). To determine whether all fusion constructs are expressed in full length, immunoblotting was performed with preparations of crude yeast cell membranes. The stable expression of shuttle vector pCGY1406αβ in yeast cells was shown earlier (6Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol.

The existence of a second termination factor was suggested by the finding that transient exposure of purified elongation complexes to heparin rendered them refractory to VTF-induced termination. Loss of termination competence correlated with the removal of several polypeptide components of the elongation complex. We present the identification of factor X, an activity that restored VTF responsiveness to heparin-stripped ternary complexes.

Vaccinia virus RNA polymerase is a multisubunit enzyme devoted exclusively to the synthesis of mRNA. The RNA polymerase, its accessory transcription factors, and multiple RNA processing enzymes are packaged within the vaccinia virus particle, where they are poised to synthesize the early class of viral mRNAs. A remarkable property of the early transcription reaction is its absolute dependence on the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (1Kates J. Beeson J. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 50: 1-18Google Scholar, 2Gershowitz A.

The energy requirement can be recapitulated in vitro during transcription of linear DNA templates by RNA polymerase and accessory factors isolated from virus particles (4Golini F. Kates J.R. J.

ATP hydrolysis is essential during transcription initiation at an early promoter (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2982-2989Google Scholar, 8Li J. Broyles S.S. J. Biol.

The fact that transcription termination is coupled to initiation from an early viral promoter raises the question of whether ATP hydrolysis during initiation and termination is performed by the same component of the transcription apparatus. ATP hydrolysis during promoter-dependent initiation is catalyzed by ETF (early transcription factor), 1The abbreviations used are: ETFearly transcription factorVTFvaccinia termination factorNTPnucleoside triphosphateNTPasenucleoside triphosphataseDTTdithiothreitolAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. a heterodimer of 82- and 70-kDa subunits (10Broyles S.S.

ETF binds to the early promoter and recruits RNA polymerase to the template (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2982-2989Google Scholar, 10Broyles S.S. Yuen L. Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol.

An essential 94-kDa polypeptide subunit of the RNA polymerase (variously named RAP94, H4, or rpo94) is believed to act as a molecular bridge between the RNA polymerase and ETF bound at the promoter (15Ahn B. Gershon P.D. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7552-7557Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Google Scholar). Formation of a preinitiation complex is ATP-independent (14Baldick C.J. Cassetti M.C. Harris N. Moss B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6052-6056Google Scholar). The energy requirement comes into play during the transition from the metastable preinitiation complex to a stable ternary complex containing a short nascent transcript (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2982-2989Google Scholar). ETF remains associated with the template DNA after the elongating polymerase has cleared the promoter (12Hagler J. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10099-10103Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Transcription terminates at heterogeneous sites downstream of a simple termination signal TTTTTNT in the nontemplate DNA strand (17Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Google Scholar). The signal is appreciated at the RNA level as UUUUUNU (18Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6220-6225Google Scholar). A virus-encoded termination factor (VTF) is required to transduce the UUUUUNU signal to the elongating polymerase (6Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar). VTF is identical to the vaccinia capping enzyme, a heterodimer of 95- and 33-kDa subunits (6Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar, 19Luo Y. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13303-13310Google Scholar). The termination factor activity of this multifunctional protein is independent of its role in capping and methylating the 5′ end of the nascent RNA chain (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar, 20Luo Y. Mao X. Deng L. Cong P. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3852-3856Google Scholar). VTF-dependent termination is a dynamic, energy-requiring process. The termination event is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). The termination sites and the overall efficiency of termination are determined by a kinetic balance between the rate of signaling and the rate of polymerase movement. The signaling rate is dictated by the concentration of hydrolyzable ATP. For example, lowering the ATP concentration slows the rate of signaling and thereby shifts the distribution of termination sites further away from the termination signal (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). Factor-dependent release of the RNA chain from the template-engaged RNA polymerase occurs in the absence of ongoing elongation, provided that the polymerase has already traversed a distance of greater than 20 nucleotides past the termination signal (21Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). A critical issue at this point is the identity of the component responsible for ATP hydrolysis during factor-dependent termination. VTF is a candidate for this role, because it has an intrinsic NTPase activity (22Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11588-11598Google Scholar, 23Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11960-11966Google Scholar). However, the NTPase of VTF does not display the specificity for ATP or dATP that characterizes the energy requirement during termination (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). A compelling argument against VTF being the energy coupling factor is the finding that mutations of VTF that specifically inactivate its NTPase (24Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Google Scholar) do not affect its ability to promote termination by purified transcription elongation complexes. 2L. Deng and S. Shuman, unpublished observations. This suggests that a component of the elongation complex, either RNA polymerase itself or an associated factor, is responsible for hydrolyzing ATP. In this report, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel factor, distinct from polymerase and ETF, but part of the elongation complex, that is required for VTF-dependent termination in vitro. This protein, which we call factor X, is a DNA-dependent ATPase. The pBS-based G21(TER) plasmid contains a vaccinia early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette (Fig. 1). G21(TER) was linearized with Acc65-1, which cleaved the DNA template upstream of the vaccinia early promoter region. Biotinylated dAMP was incorporated at the 3′ ends using Klenow DNA polymerase. The biotinylated DNAs were then digested with PvuII, and the restriction fragment containing the transcription cassette was isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. Purified DNA fragments were attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads as described (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). Ternary transcription complexes were formed as described (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM UTP, 1 μM [α32P]CTP (1000 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mM 3′-O-methyl GTP, vaccinia RNA polymerase (heparin agarose fraction containing ETF), and 100 fmol of bead-linked G21(TER) DNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Heparin was added as specified in the figure legends, and the samples were incubated for 2 min at 30°C. The beads were concentrated by microcentrifugation for 15 s and then held in place with a magnet while the supernatant was removed and replaced with 0.1 ml of 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM DTT. The beads were resuspended and subjected to two further cycles of concentration and washing; after the third wash, the beads were resuspended in a small volume of the wash buffer, and aliquots were distributed into individual reaction tubes to achieve approximately the same concentration of template as that used in the pulse-labeling phase. Elongation reactions (chase phase) were performed in 20-μl mixtures containing 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and NTPs as specified. Where indicated, VTF (0.2 pmol of recombinant D1/D12 heterodimer, purified as described (20Luo Y. Mao X. Deng L. Cong P. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3852-3856Google Scholar)) was added to the chase reaction mixtures just prior to the NTPs. After incubation at 30°C, the elongation reactions were stopped by the addition of buffer containing SDS and urea (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2982-2989Google Scholar). The samples were extracted with phenol:chloroform, and labeled RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Transcription products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing TBE (90 mM Tris, 90 mM borate, 2.5 mM EDTA), and radiolabeled transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM UTP, 1 mM CTP, 0.1 mM 3′-O-methyl GTP, RNA polymerase, and 3′ [32P]dCMP-labeled G21(TER)A78 template (approximately 18 fmol of a gel-purified 111-base pair HindIII/XbaI restriction fragment that was end-labeled using Klenow DNA polymerase) (16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Google Scholar). Incubation was for 30 min at 30°C. Heparin was then added as specified in the figure legends, and the samples were incubated for 2 min at 30°C before being applied to a native polyacrylamide gel (4% acrylamide, 0.13% bisacrylamide; 0.4-mm thickness) containing 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mM Tris, 22.5 mM borate, 0.25 mM EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature at 15 mA. Radiolabeled DNA was visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel. The Ni-agarose fraction of recombinant ETF (His-D6/A8 heterodimer) was prepared from vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells as described (8Li J. Broyles S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20016-20021Google Scholar). An aliquot of this material (0.28 ml; 110 μg of protein) was applied to a 4.8-ml, 15-35% glycerol gradient containing 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The gradient was centrifuged at 4°C for 15 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50 rotor. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Marker proteins (catalase, bovine serum albumin, and cytochrome c) were centrifuged in a parallel gradient. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280) were purchased from Dynal. Heparin (from porcine intestine; Mr∼6000) was purchased from Sigma. Heparin was stored at 4°C as a 50-mg/ml solution in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and diluted in the same buffer immediately prior to each experiment. Affinity-purified anti-H4 and anti-D6 antibodies were prepared as described (16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Google Scholar). Calf thymus DNA and salmon sperm DNA were purchased from Sigma. VTF-dependent termination by vaccinia RNA polymerase was assayed during a single round of transcription on a bead-linked template containing an early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette (Fig. 1). Situated downstream of the G-less cassette was a transcription termination signal, TTTTTTTTT. The strategy for analysis of termination entailed the assembly and purification of transcription elongation complexes containing [32P]CMP-labeled 21-mer nascent RNA chains. Ternary complexes were arrested at template position G21 when 3′-O-methyl GTP was included in the pulse-labeling reaction mixtures (Fig. 2). The bead-bound complexes were recovered by centrifugation. Washing the beads with buffer lacking nucleotides and magnesium served to remove NTPs and unbound proteins. When provided with unlabeled NTPs and magnesium, the elongation complexes hydrolyzed the blocking 3′-O-methyl GMP moiety (25Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Google Scholar) and resumed elongation to the end of the linear template; this was evinced by the conversion of the labeled 21-mer RNA into a 195-nucleotide run-off transcript (Fig. 2). A minor cluster of transcripts 34-40 nucleotides long was also detected after the 10-min chase period (Fig. 2, denoted by P); these species were engaged within complexes that had paused at template positions within the termination signal (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). The addition of VTF/capping enzyme to the purified transcription complexes just prior to the start of the NTP chase resulted in the appearance of a heterogeneous array of transcripts terminated downstream of the termination signal (Fig. 2, denoted by T). Note that a fraction of the pulse-labeled 21-mer RNAs were not extended during the chase; some of these chains were released spontaneously from the transcription complexes (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). Released 21-mer RNAs were capped during the chase reactions containing VTF/capping enzyme to form a new labeled species that migrated just above the 21-mer. No such RNA was formed in the absence of added capping enzyme (Fig. 2). Arrested G21 elongation complexes were incubated for 2 min with various concentrations of heparin and then subjected to several cycles of bead purification and washing to remove the heparin. The purified complexes that had been exposed transiently to heparin were then chased by the addition of NTPs and magnesium. Treatment with 125 μg/ml of heparin abrogated the capacity of the elongation complexes to terminate in response to VTF/capping enzyme (Fig. 2). Partial loss of VTF responsiveness occurred after treatment with 2.5-25 μg/ml of heparin (Fig. 2 and other data not shown). Exposure to 0.25 μg/ml of heparin had no effect on termination (Fig. 2). Because the heparin had been removed prior to the addition of VTF, the loss of termination competence necessarily reflected a change in the transcription complex, not VTF. Although heparin exposure abolished termination competence, it clearly did not preclude elongation. The efficiency of read-through past the G21 arrest site by complexes treated with 125 μg/ml of heparin was the same as that of untreated control complexes, suggesting that heparin treatment did not affect the nascent RNA cleavage activity of the polymerase. The majority of the heparin-treated polymerases transcribed to the end of the template to produce run-off transcripts (Fig. 2). Treating the G21 ternary complexes with heparin appeared to increase the extent of polymerase pausing within the T-run (Fig. 2). This effect was heparin concentration-dependent (Fig. 2). The TTTTTTTTT element in the G21(TER) template acts as an intrinsic pause site for vaccinia RNA polymerase.2 We have observed that the duration of pausing at the T-run is dictated by the concentration of NTPs included during the chase. When all four NTPs are at 1 mM, as was the case in the experiment shown in Fig. 2, run-off transcripts were synthesized within 10 s (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar).2 However, when NTP concentrations were limiting (≤10 μM), polymerase elongation rate was slowed, and numerous pause sites became apparent.2 To assess whether transient heparin treatment affected the pausing properties of the vaccinia polymerase, we performed a kinetic analysis of elongation by untreated G21 complexes (Fig. 3, control) and G21 complexes that had been incubated for 2 min with heparin (Fig. 3, heparin-stripped). Elongation was assayed at 10 μM UTP. Under these conditions, the control polymerase did not synthesize run-off transcripts until 120 s, because elongation was retarded at template positions preceding the limiting nucleotide. For example, control polymerase was delayed at A25 (immediately 5′ of T26) and at G32 (just preceding the first T of the T-run) (Fig. 3). These and most of the other pause sites were traversed by 5 min (Fig. 3). Heparin-stripped complexes were clearly impaired with respect to their capacity to read through the most proximal pause sites. Pausing at A25 persisted for up to 1 h. Strong elongation blocks also occurred at template positions C31, G32, T33, and T34 (Fig. 3). The A25, C31, G32, T33, and T34 transcripts were not terminated, i.e. they remained template-engaged even after 30 min (Fig. 4). In contrast, about one-half of the population of run-off RNAs was released from the template (Fig. 4). Incomplete dissociation of the vaccinia ternary complex at the end of linear template had been noted previously (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). The amount of full-length RNA made by heparin-treated complexes increased steadily during the 1-h incubation because a small fraction of the polymerases were able to transverse the T-run. Heparin-stripped complexes appeared no more prone than control complexes to pause downstream of the T-run, insofar as run-off RNA was detected within 2 min, albeit at low levels (Fig. 3). Similar kinetic experiments were performed using another template, G21, that differed from G21(TER) only in that it lacked the T-run (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). We found that heparin stripping had no effect on pausing on this template.2 Thus, the effect of heparin on elongation was to exacerbate the intrinsic pausing caused by the T-rich termination signal. An attractive explanation for the loss of VTF responsiveness was that heparin treatment caused dissociation of a component of the transcription complex that was required for termination. We tested this idea by assembling G21 ternary complexes in solution on a 32P end-labeled template containing an early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette (16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Google Scholar). The complexes were incubated with various concentrations of heparin and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a native polyacrylamide gel. The rationale was that removal of one or more components of the elongation complexes might result in altered electrophoretic behavior. Control ternary complexes migrated as a doublet (Fig. 5). Heparin elicited a concentration-dependent shift in the mobility of the ternary complexes. Low concentrations of heparin (0.05-0.5 μg/ml) reduced the upper species of the doublet while increasing the amount of the lower band. Higher concentrations of heparin (2.5-50 μg/ml) converted the lower doublet band into a novel, more rapidly migrating species (Fig. 5). The complex of ETF bound at the early promoter was also disrupted by low concentrations of heparin (Fig. 5). Antibody supershift experiments were performed to evaluate which components of the transcription complex may have been removed by heparin treatment. Incubation of control G21 ternary complexes with polyclonal antibody to rpo94 (anti-H4) elicited a supershift of both species of the ternary complex doublet. The supershifted material was either retarded in the sample well or entered the gel and migrated more slowly that the ternary complexes (Fig. 6). Anti-H4 had no effect on the ETF·promoter complex. In contrast, antibody to the 70-kDa ETF subunit (anti-D6) supershifted only the upper species of the ternary complex doublet. No loss or alteration of the lower ternary complex was apparent (Fig. 6). Anti-D6 supershifted the ETF complex, as expected. The antibody reactivity of the heparin-treated ternary complexes shows that ETF and rpo94 were sequentially stripped from the ternary complexes by increasing concentrations of heparin. The novel species of ternary complex formed at 25 μg/ml of heparin contained no immunoreactive rpo94 or ETF (Fig. 6). In light of the above results, we were attracted to the idea that removal of ETF and/or rpo94 by heparin may have caused the loss of termination competence and the exacerbation of intrinsic pausing. Our attention focused first on ETF, which has an intrinsic ATPase, as a potential candidate for the role of energy coupling factor during termination. (Admittedly, we chose at this point to ignore the observation that ETF dissociation preceded loss of termination competence.) We attempted to restore VTF responsiveness to heparin-stripped complexes by adding back ETF. Recombinant His-tagged ETF was expressed in vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells and isolated by Ni-agarose chromatography (8Li J. Broyles S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20016-20021Google Scholar). We found that this fraction (a gift of Dr. Steven Broyles, Purdue University) did indeed complement the heparin-stripped G21 complexes for both termination and read-through of the T-run (data not shown). The protein preparation was then subjected to further purification by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 7). ETF activity sedimented as a discrete peak at fractions 13 and 14, as determined by assaying specific binding to promoter-containing DNA (data not shown) and DNA-dependent ATPase (Fig. 7A). Western blotting of gradient fractions with antiserum to individual ETF subunits confirmed that ETF peaked in fractions 13 and 14 (data not shown). ETF sedimented at 7.6 S relative to marker proteins catalase, bovine serum albumin, and cytochrome c that were centrifuged in a parallel gradient (Fig. 7A). We were unable to detect immunoreactive H4 protein (rpo94) in any of the gradient fractions (data not shown). The termination-complementing activity sedimented as a discrete peak at fractions 16-18 (sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S) and was clearly distinct from ETF (Fig. 7B). We named this novel activity factor X. An activity capable of stimulating the production of run-off transcripts by heparin-stripped elongation complexes cosedimented with factor X (Fig. 7B). These properties of factor X are illustrated in the experiment shown in Fig. 8. Here, heparin-stripped G21 complexes were supplemented with increasing amounts of factor X (glycerol gradient fraction 17) and then chased at 10 μM UTP. Omission of VTF from the chase allowed us to focus solely on elongation. We observed that the amount of run-off RNA made by the heparin-stripped complexes was proportional to the amount of factor X added (Fig. 8). Increased run-off synthesis correlated with a factor X-dependent decrease in the abundance of the A25-paused transcript (Fig. 8). Similarly, the amount of pausing within the T-run was reduced by the addition of factor X. Factor X fully restored the synthesis of terminated transcripts when VTF was included during the chase (Fig. 8). The size distribution of terminated RNAs made by heparin-stripped complexes reconstituted with 1 μl of factor X and 500 fmol of VTF was identical to that of control complexes that had not been treated with heparin (Fig. 8). Inclusion of higher amounts of factor X did not increase termination efficiency or alter the size distribution of the terminated RNAs (data not shown). Note that factor X by itself did not cause transcription termination (Fig. 8). Similar results vis à vis termination were obtained when the chase reactions were performed at 1 mM UTP, i.e. factor and VTF were both required to reconstitute termination by heparin-stripped ternary complexes (Fig. 7B and data not shown). The activity profile of factor X during glycerol gradient sedimentation coincided with a shoulder of ATPase activity on the “lighter” side of the ETF ATPase peak (Fig. 7A). We compared the nucleic acid cofactor requirements of the peak glycerol gradient fractions of ETF (fraction 13) and factor X (fraction 17). ATP hydrolysis by ETF was dependent on a DNA cofactor. ATPase in the presence of native salmon sperm DNA was 50% higher than that seen with heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (Fig. 9A). A nearly identical preference of ETF for native versus denatured calf thymus DNA was noted previously by Broyles and Moss (11Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10761-10765Google Scholar). In contrast, factor X displayed a marked preference for denatured DNA (Fig. 9B). Clearly, the ATPase activity associated with factor X was distinct from that of ETF. ATP hydrolysis by factor X was not activated by an RNA cofactor, poly(C) (data not shown). This is noteworthy because poly(C) is a potent activator of nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase II (26Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3281-3286Google Scholar), a vaccinia-encoded RNA helicase that is similar in size to factor X (27Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10935-10939Google Scholar). Our finding that purified baculovirus-recombinant nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase II (28Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2615-2619Google Scholar) was incapable of complementing the termination defect of heparin-stripped elongation complexes2 effectively excluded the possibility that nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase II was factor X. The principal findings of this study are: (i) transient exposure of ternary complexes to heparin renders vaccinia RNA polymerase unresponsive to VTF-mediated transcription termination; (ii) heparin treatment strips off components of the elongation complex, including ETF and rpo94; (iii) heparin-stripped complexes can be restored to VTF responsiveness by the addition of a complementing activity, factor X, which is distinct from ETF and rpo94; and (iv) factor X has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. From these results, the following conclusions and inferences are drawn. Prior work had established that three components are necessary to reconstitute early transcription initiation, elongation, and termination in vitro. These are ETF, RNA polymerase, and VTF/capping enzyme (6Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar, 10Broyles S.S. Yuen L. Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10754-10760Google Scholar). ETF and VTF are both heterodimeric proteins. The capacity to reconstitute fully active VTF by coexpressing the two subunits in bacteria proves that VTF function is intrinsic to the heterodimer (20Luo Y. Mao X. Deng L. Cong P. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3852-3856Google Scholar). Similar conclusions apply to purified recombinant ETF heterodimer (8Li J. Broyles S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20016-20021Google Scholar), with the caveat that the recombinant protein was produced in vaccinia-infected cells. The RNA polymerase consists of at least nine polypeptides, one of which, rpo94, is required specifically for transcription in vitro of the early class of viral genes (15Ahn B. Gershon P.D. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7552-7557Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Google Scholar). Because polymerase has not been reconstituted from individual polypeptides, it is impossible to assess whether the nine known subunits are sufficient for early transcription in conjunction with ETF and VTF. A number of other viral proteins, including ETF and VTF/capping enzyme, remain physically associated with the polymerase during purification and sedimentation (5Broyles S.S. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 7-14Google Scholar). Thus, the polymerase component of the transcription reaction may well contain additional transcription factors that have not been appreciated to date. The present study shows that this is true by identifying factor X as a novel termination factor. By starting with purified transcription elongation complexes, we eliminated from the system any proteins that were not stably engaged on the template. Proteins remaining after multiple rounds of bead purification were regarded operationally as components of the elongation complex. We had shown earlier that elongation by pre-assembled ternary complexes was resistant to the addition of heparin during the chase (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2982-2989Google Scholar). Now, we demonstrate that transient treatment with heparin strips off multiple components of the elongation complex, leaving behind ternary complexes that elongate but are no longer capable of terminating in response to VTF. Factor X was identified on the basis of its ability to complement the termination defect of the heparin-stripped complexes. Factor X was isolated from a crude preparation of recombinant ETF expressed in vaccinia-infected cells. We have also detected factor X activity in the preparation of RNA polymerase used in our in vitro transcription reactions.2 Therefore, factor X is a normal constituent of the virus core and remains associated (at least to some extent) with vaccinia RNA polymerase during its purification. Given the relatively high concentrations of heparin required to render the ternary complexes VTF-unresponsive, we surmise that factor X is associated tightly with the elongation complex. Although ETF remains bound to the template after polymerase has elongated (12Hagler J. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10099-10103Google Scholar), it is prone to dissociate spontaneously during extended incubation (16Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Google Scholar). We show here that ETF is stripped from the template by low concentrations of heparin, well below the levels required to abrogate termination. Purified ETF is incapable of complementing heparin-stripped ternary complexes. Therefore, we conclude that ETF is not required for VTF-dependent termination. The removal of rpo94 from the ternary complexes paralleled the loss of termination competence; however, we were unable to detect any free rpo94 in the partially purified factor X preparation that restored VTF responsiveness. On this basis, we suspect that rpo94 is also not essential for VTF-dependent termination. An evaluation of the effects of adding free rpo94 back to heparin-stripped complexes remains elusive; all efforts to express free rpo94 as a recombinant protein in bacterial, baculovirus, and vaccinia virus-based expression systems have been unsuccessful. Our results impact strongly on the fascinating question of why VTF-dependent termination at UUUUUNU signals is restricted to early genes. UUUUUNU sequences are dispersed throughout intermediate and late mRNAs but are not recognized as termination signals by the RNA polymerase (29Vos J.C. Sasker M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2553-2558Google Scholar, 30Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Google Scholar). VTF/capping enzyme is present and functional at intermediate and late times during infection, as evinced by the fact that intermediate and late mRNAs are capped. It has been thought that coupling of VTF-dependent termination to initiation at an early promoter might involve specific contacts between VTF and a component of the transcription apparatus that is unique to early genes, i.e. ETF or rpo94. Our findings that ETF and rpo94 are not essential for termination in vitro by purified ternary complexes vitiates this simple view. We suggest that factor X may be the component responsible for early gene specificity of termination, e.g. if factor X associates uniquely with the early transcription apparatus. The finding that factor X has an associated DNA-dependent ATPase activity suggests strongly that factor X catalyzes the energy-dependent step in VTF-dependent termination. ATP hydrolysis by isolated factor X is stimulated preferentially by denatured DNA. If the same holds true of factor X as a component of the elongation complex, then its ATPase might be stimulated by the DNA single strands in the vaccinia transcription bubble (12Hagler J. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10099-10103Google Scholar). An outstanding issue is how the energy-dependent step of termination is coupled to the recognition of the UUUUUNU sequence in the nascent RNA. We propose a model in which the RNA signal recognition step is accomplished by VTF, which then conveys the signal information to factor X, activating its ATPase and eliciting release of the nascent RNA. According to this view, factor X would be the immediate target of RNA signaling by VTF, and the energy of ATP hydrolysis would be used either to disrupt contacts between the nascent RNA and the polymerase or between nascent RNA and the template DNA strand. As noted previously (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar), there are numerous mechanistic similarities between VTF-dependent termination by vaccinia RNA polymerase and rho-dependent termination by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, e.g. both reactions entail transduction of RNA signals to the elongating polymerase in an NTP hydrolysis-dependent, kinetically coupled reaction (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar, 31Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 127-138Google Scholar, 32Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Google Scholar). Rho NTPase activity is essential for its termination function. Identification of factor X as the relevant ATPase in the vaccinia system consolidates the notion that RNA-based termination mechanisms are fundamentally conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes. Heparin-stripped ternary complexes are more susceptible than untreated complexes to intrinsic pausing caused by the T-run in the G21(TER) template. The enhancement of pausing correlated with the loss of termination competence. However, the enhanced pausing did not cause the termination defect, insofar as the majority of heparin-stripped termination complexes were perfectly capable of elongating to the end of the template when chase reactions were performed at saturating NTP concentrations. Both effects of heparin stripping were complemented by the addition of factor X. Hence, we surmise that enhanced intrinsic pausing was caused by the depletion of factor X from the elongation complex. Whether the ATPase activity of factor X is required to stimulate read-through of the T-run is unclear. However, such a requirement would explain the earlier finding that pausing within the T-run on the G21(TER) template during a chase at 1 mM NTP was enhanced when AMP-PNP was substituted for ATP (9Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have described the initial discovery of factor X, a dissociable component of the elongation complex that is required for VTF-dependent transcription termination. Efforts to identify the viral gene encoding factor X are under way."
