https://openalex.org/W2127067932,"Clostridium difficile infection is the leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhoea in Europe and North America. During infection, C. difficile produces two key virulence determinants, toxin A and toxin B. Experiments with purified toxins have indicated that toxin A alone is able to evoke the symptoms of C. difficile infection, but toxin B is unable to do so unless it is mixed with toxin A or there is prior damage to the gut mucosa. However, a recent study indicated that toxin B is essential for C. difficile virulence and that a strain producing toxin A alone was avirulent. This creates a paradox over the individual importance of toxin A and toxin B. Here we show that isogenic mutants of C. difficile producing either toxin A or toxin B alone can cause fulminant disease in the hamster model of infection. By using a gene knockout system to inactivate the toxin genes permanently, we found that C. difficile producing either one or both toxins showed cytotoxic activity in vitro that translated directly into virulence in vivo. Furthermore, by constructing the first ever double-mutant strain of C. difficile, in which both toxin genes were inactivated, we were able to completely attenuate virulence. Our findings re-establish the importance of both toxin A and toxin B and highlight the need to continue to consider both toxins in the development of diagnostic tests and effective countermeasures against C. difficile."

https://openalex.org/W2014490965,"Specialized cellular microenvironments, or 'niches', modulate stem cell properties, including cell number, self-renewal and fate decisions. In the adult brain, niches that maintain a source of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The size of the NSC population of the SVZ at any time is the result of several ongoing processes, including self-renewal, cell differentiation, and cell death. Maintaining the balance between NSCs and NPCs in the SVZ niche is critical to supply the brain with specific neural populations, both under normal conditions or after injury. A fundamental question relevant to both normal development and to cell-based repair strategies in the central nervous system is how the balance of different NSC and NPC populations is maintained in the niche. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and Notch signalling pathways have fundamental roles during development of multicellular organisms. In Drosophila and in Caenorhabditis elegans these pathways may have either cooperative or antagonistic functions. In the SVZ, Notch regulates NSC identity and self-renewal, whereas EGFR specifically affects NPC proliferation and migration. This suggests that interplay of these two pathways may maintain the balance between NSC and NPC numbers. Here we show that functional cell-cell interaction between NPCs and NSCs through EGFR and Notch signalling has a crucial role in maintaining the balance between these cell populations in the SVZ. Enhanced EGFR signalling in vivo results in the expansion of the NPC pool, and reduces NSC number and self-renewal. This occurs through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism involving EGFR-mediated regulation of Notch signalling. Our findings define a novel interaction between EGFR and Notch pathways in the adult SVZ, and thus provide a mechanism for NSC and NPC pool maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W1972804526,"The ability to produce vigorous immune responses that spare self tissues and organs depends on the elimination of autoreactive T and B cells. However, purging of immature and mature self-reactive T and B cells is incomplete and may also require the involvement of cells programmed to suppress immune responses. Regulatory T cells (T(reg)) belonging to the CD4(+) T-cell subset may have a role in preventing untoward inflammatory responses, but T-cell subsets programmed to inhibit the development of autoantibody formation and systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like disease have not yet been defined. Here we delineate a CD8(+) regulatory T-cell lineage that is essential for the maintenance of self tolerance and prevention of murine autoimmune disease. Genetic disruption of the inhibitory interaction between these CD8(+) T cells and their target Qa-1(+) follicular T-helper cells results in the development of a lethal systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like autoimmune disease. These findings define a sublineage of CD8 T cells programmed to suppress rather than activate immunity that represents an essential regulatory element of the immune response and a guarantor of self tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2059195287,"“Super-blooms” of cyanobacteria that produce potent and environmentally persistent biotoxins (microcystins) are an emerging global health issue in freshwater habitats. Monitoring of the marine environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine “harmful algal bloom” in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface."
https://openalex.org/W1975680667,"Nuclear pore complexes selectively transport cargoes across the nuclear envelope. Now, two studies published in this issue follow the movement of single cargo proteins (Lowe et al.) and mRNA transcripts (David Grünwald and Robert Singer) as they translocate across the nuclear envelope, with nanometre precision and high temporal resolution. They discover previously unidentified transport sub-steps and provide fundamental insight into the mechanism of selective transport through the nuclear pore complexes. Newly synthesized messenger RNA is exported from the nucleus through nuclear pores. Here, a new imaging and tracking method has been developed to study the kinetics of mRNA export, with 20-ms time-precision and 26-nm spatial precision. A three-step model for export is presented, comprising docking, transport and release. Notably, mRNAs can move bi-directionally through the pore complex. Export of messenger RNA occurs via nuclear pores, which are large nanomachines with diameters of roughly 120 nm that are the only link between the nucleus and cytoplasm1. Hence, mRNA export occurs over distances smaller than the optical resolution of conventional light microscopes. There is extensive knowledge on the physical structure and composition of the nuclear pore complex2,3,4,5,6,7, but transport selectivity and the dynamics of mRNA export at nuclear pores remain unknown8. Here we developed a super-registration approach using fluorescence microscopy that can overcome the current limitations of co-localization by means of measuring intermolecular distances of chromatically different fluorescent molecules with nanometre precision. With this method we achieve 20-ms time-precision and at least 26-nm spatial precision, enabling the capture of highly transient interactions in living cells. Using this approach we were able to spatially resolve the kinetics of mRNA transport in mammalian cells and present a three-step model consisting of docking (80 ms), transport (5–20 ms) and release (80 ms), totalling 180 ± 10 ms. Notably, the translocation through the channel was not the rate-limiting step, mRNAs can move bi-directionally in the pore complex and not all pores are equally active."

https://openalex.org/W2153634567,"With the availability of high density whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism chips, genomic selection has become a promising method to estimate genetic merit with potentially high accuracy for animal, plant and aquaculture species of economic importance. With markers covering the entire genome, genetic merit of genotyped individuals can be predicted directly within the framework of mixed model equations, by using a matrix of relationships among individuals that is derived from the markers. Here we extend that approach by deriving a marker-based relationship matrix specifically for the trait of interest.In the framework of mixed model equations, a new best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method including a trait-specific relationship matrix (TA) was presented and termed TABLUP. The TA matrix was constructed on the basis of marker genotypes and their weights in relation to the trait of interest. A simulation study with 1,000 individuals as the training population and five successive generations as candidate population was carried out to validate the proposed method. The proposed TABLUP method outperformed the ridge regression BLUP (RRBLUP) and BLUP with realized relationship matrix (GBLUP). It performed slightly worse than BayesB with an accuracy of 0.79 in the standard scenario.The proposed TABLUP method is an improvement of the RRBLUP and GBLUP method. It might be equivalent to the BayesB method but it has additional benefits like the calculation of accuracies for individual breeding values. The results also showed that the TA-matrix performs better in predicting ability than the classical numerator relationship matrix and the realized relationship matrix which are derived solely from pedigree or markers without regard to the trait. This is because the TA-matrix not only accounts for the Mendelian sampling term, but also puts the greater emphasis on those markers that explain more of the genetic variance in the trait."
https://openalex.org/W1964082391,"Trans-differentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (Q-HSCs), which exhibit epithelial and adipocytic features, into myofibroblastic-HSC (MF-HSCs) is a key event in liver fibrosis. Culture models demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation is required for transition of epithelioid/adipocytic Q-HSCs into MF-HSCs. Hh signaling inhibits adiposity and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs). Leptin (anti-adipogenic, pro-EMT factor) promotes HSC trans-differentiation and liver fibrosis, suggesting that the pathways may interact to modulate cell fate. This study aimed to determine whether leptin activates Hh signaling and whether this is required for the fibrogenic effects of leptin. Cultures of primary HSCs from lean and fa/fa rats with an inherited ObRb defect were examined. Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and Hh signaling were used to delineate how ObRb activation influenced Hh signaling and HSC trans-differentiation. Fibrogenesis was compared in wild type and db/db mice (impaired ObRb function) to assess the profibrotic role of leptin. The results demonstrate that leptin-ObR interactions activate Hh signaling with the latter necessary to promote trans-differentiation. Leptin-related increases in Hh signaling required ObR induction of PI3K/Akt, which was sufficient for leptin to repress the epithelioid/adipocytic program. Leptin-mediated induction of JAK/STAT was required for mesenchymal gene expression. Leptin-ObRb interactions were not necessary for HSC trans-differentiation to occur in vitro or in vivo but are important because liver fibrogenesis was attenuated in db/db mice. These findings reveal that leptin activates Hh signaling to alter gene expression programs that control cell fate and have important implications for liver fibrosis and other leptin-regulated processes involving EMTs, including development, obesity, and cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2058413014,"Apoptosis and the subsequent clearance of dying cells occurs throughout development and adult life in many tissues. Failure to promptly clear apoptotic cells has been linked to many diseases. ELMO1 is an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic engulfment protein that functions downstream of the phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1, and, along with DOCK1 and the GTPase RAC1, promotes internalization of the dying cells. Here we report the generation of ELMO1-deficient mice, which we found to be unexpectedly viable and grossly normal. However, they had a striking testicular pathology, with disrupted seminiferous epithelium, multinucleated giant cells, uncleared apoptotic germ cells and decreased sperm output. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a crucial role for ELMO1 in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells lining the seminiferous epithelium. The engulfment receptor BAI1 and RAC1 (upstream and downstream of ELMO1, respectively) were also important for Sertoli-cell-mediated engulfment. Collectively, these findings uncover a selective requirement for ELMO1 in Sertoli-cell-mediated removal of apoptotic germ cells and make a compelling case for a relationship between engulfment and tissue homeostasis in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2060712419,"Multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis have emerged as grave threats to public health worldwide. Very few active drugs are available or likely to become available soon. To address these problems we revisited a classical observation, the applicability of phenothiazines as antimicrobial drugs. Within this pharmacological class we selected thioridazine, which is most efficacious and least toxic, when used as an antipsychotic drug. We tested thioridazine monotherapy in the Balb/c mouse model for its activity to treat both susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by a two months daily oral administration of 32 and 70 mg/kg. In addition, we tested its additive value when combined with a standard first-line regimen for susceptible tuberculosis. Thioridazine treatment resulted in a significant reduction of colony-forming-units of the susceptible (-4.4 log CFU, p<0.05) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis bacilli (-2.4 log CFU, p<0.009) in the lung both at one and two months after infection, compared to controls. Moreover, when thioridazine was added to a regimen containing rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide for susceptible tuberculosis, a significant synergistic effect was achieved (-6.2 vs -5.9 log CFU, p<0.01). Thioridazine may represent an effective compound for treatment of susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The phenothiazines and their targets represent interesting novel opportunities in the search for antituberculosis drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2022207080,"Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease displaying complex genomic alterations, and consequently, it has been difficult to determine the most relevant copy number alterations with the scale of studies to date. We obtained genome-wide copy number alteration (CNA) data from four different SNP array platforms, with a final data set of 398 ovarian tumours, mostly of the serous histological subtype. Frequent CNA aberrations targeted many thousands of genes. However, high-level amplicons and homozygous deletions enabled filtering of this list to the most relevant. The large data set enabled refinement of minimal regions and identification of rare amplicons such as at 1p34 and 20q11. We performed a novel co-occurrence analysis to assess cooperation and exclusivity of CNAs and analysed their relationship to patient outcome. Positive associations were identified between gains on 19 and 20q, gain of 20q and loss of X, and between several regions of loss, particularly 17q. We found weak correlations of CNA at genomic loci such as 19q12 with clinical outcome. We also assessed genomic instability measures and found a correlation of the number of higher amplitude gains with poorer overall survival. By assembling the largest collection of ovarian copy number data to date, we have been able to identify the most frequent aberrations and their interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1970302919,"Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in young children globally and improved diagnostics are needed to better identify cases and reduce case fatality. Metabolomics, a rapidly evolving field aimed at characterizing metabolites in biofluids, has the potential to improve diagnostics in a range of diseases. The objective of this pilot study is to apply metabolomic analysis to childhood pneumonia to explore its potential to improve pneumonia diagnosis in a high-burden setting.Eleven children with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined severe pneumonia of non-homogeneous aetiology were selected in The Gambia, West Africa, along with community controls. Metabolomic analysis of matched plasma and urine samples was undertaken using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS). Biomarker extraction was done using SIMCA-P+ and Random Forests (RF). 'Unsupervised' (blinded) data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), while 'supervised' (unblinded) analysis was by Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures (OPLS). Potential markers were extracted from S-plots constructed following analysis with OPLS, and markers were chosen based on their contribution to the variation and correlation within the data set. The dataset was additionally analyzed with the machine-learning algorithm RF in order to address issues of model overfitting and markers were selected based on their variable importance ranking. Unsupervised PCA analysis revealed good separation of pneumonia and control groups, with even clearer separation of the groups with PLS-DA and OPLS analysis. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between groups were seen with the following metabolites: uric acid, hypoxanthine and glutamic acid were higher in plasma from cases, while L-tryptophan and adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) were lower; uric acid and L-histidine were lower in urine from cases. The key limitation of this study is its small size.Metabolomic analysis clearly distinguished severe pneumonia patients from community controls. The metabolites identified are important for the host response to infection through antioxidant, inflammatory and antimicrobial pathways, and energy metabolism. Larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings are pneumonia-specific and to distinguish organism-specific responses. Metabolomics has considerable potential to improve diagnostics for childhood pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2061974718,"IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1), also known as MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5), is one of a family of intracellular proteins known to recognise viral RNA and mediate the innate immune response. IFIH1 is causal in type 1 diabetes based on the protective associations of four rare variants, where the derived alleles are predicted to reduce gene expression or function. Originally, however, T1D protection was mapped to the common IFIH1 nsSNP, rs1990760 or Thr946Ala. This common amino acid substitution does not cause a loss of function and evidence suggests the protective allele, Ala(946), may mark a haplotype with reduced expression of IFIH1 in line with the protection conferred by the four rare loss of function alleles. We have performed allele specific expression analysis that supports this hypothesis: the T1D protective haplotype correlates with reduced IFIH1 transcription in interferon-β stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (overall p = 0.012). In addition, we have used multiflow cytometry analysis and quantitative PCR assays to prove reduced expression of IFIH1 in individuals heterozygous for three of the T1D-associated rare alleles: a premature stop codon, rs35744605 (Glu627X) and predicted splice variants, rs35337543 (IVS8+1) and rs35732034 (IVS14+1). We also show that the nsSNP, Ile923V, does not alter pre-mRNA levels of IFIH1. These results confirm and extend the new autoimmune disease pathway of reduced IFIH1 expression and protein function protecting from T1D."
https://openalex.org/W1986553067,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a phylogenetically conserved protein; in humans, it is present in the plasma and at sites of inflammation. At physiological pH, native pentameric CRP exhibits calcium-dependent binding specificity for phosphocholine. In this study, we determined the binding specificities of CRP at acidic pH, a characteristic of inflammatory sites. We investigated the binding of fluid-phase CRP to six immobilized proteins: complement factor H, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, complement C3b, IgG, amyloid β, and BSA immobilized on microtiter plates. At pH 7.0, CRP did not bind to any of these proteins, but, at pH ranging from 5.2 to 4.6, CRP bound to all six proteins. Acidic pH did not monomerize CRP but modified the pentameric structure, as determined by gel filtration, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid-binding fluorescence, and phosphocholine-binding assays. Some modifications in CRP were reversible at pH 7.0, for example, the phosphocholine-binding activity of CRP, which was reduced at acidic pH, was restored after pH neutralization. For efficient binding of acidic pH-treated CRP to immobilized proteins, it was necessary that the immobilized proteins, except factor H, were also exposed to acidic pH. Because immobilization of proteins on microtiter plates and exposure of immobilized proteins to acidic pH alter the conformation of immobilized proteins, our findings suggest that conformationally altered proteins form a CRP-ligand in acidic environment, regardless of the identity of the protein. This ligand binding specificity of CRP in its acidic pH-induced pentameric state has implications for toxic conditions involving protein misfolding in acidic environments and favors the conservation of CRP throughout evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1988547464,"Background Seroadaptation strategies such as serosorting and seropositioning originated within communities of men who have sex with men (MSM), but there are limited data about their effectiveness in preventing HIV transmission when utilized by HIV-negative men. Methodology/Principal Findings Data from the EXPLORE cohort of HIV-negative MSM who reported both seroconcordant and serodiscordant partners were used to evaluate serosorting and seropositioning. The association of serosorting and seropositioning with HIV seroconversion was evaluated in this cohort of high risk MSM from six U.S. cities. Serosorting was independently associated with a small decrease in risk of HIV seroconversion (OR = 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81–0.95), even among participants reporting ≥10 partners. Those who more consistently practiced serosorting were more likely to be white (p = 0.01), have completed college (p = <0.0002) and to have had 10 or more partners in the six months before the baseline visit (p = 0.01) but did not differ in age, reporting HIV-infected partners, or drug use. There was no evidence of a seroconversion effect with seropositioning (OR 1.02, 95%CI, 0.92–1.14). Significance In high risk HIV uninfected MSM who report unprotected anal intercourse with both seroconcordant and serodiscordant partners, serosorting was associated with a modest decreased risk of HIV infection. To maximize any potential benefit, it will be important to increase accurate knowledge of HIV status, through increased testing frequency, improved test technology, and continued development of strategies to increase disclosure."
https://openalex.org/W2088112676,"The gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) can induce acute pancreatitis in rodents through its action on acinar cells. Treatment with CCK, in combination with other agents, represents the most commonly used model to induce experimental chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are responsible for pancreatic fibrosis and therefore play a predominant role in the genesis of chronic pancreatitis. However, it is not known whether PSC express CCK receptors. Using real time PCR techniques, we demonstrate that CCK1 and CCK2 receptors are expressed on rat PSC. Interestingly both CCK and gastrin significantly induced type I collagen synthesis. Moreover, both inhibit proliferation. These effects are comparable with TGF-β-stimulated PSC. Furthermore, the natural agonists CCK and gastrin induce activation of pro-fibrogenic pathways Akt, ERK, and Src. Using specific CCK1 and CCK2 receptor (CCK2R) inhibitors, we found that Akt activation is mainly mediated by CCK2R. Akt activation by CCK and gastrin could be inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Activation of ERK and the downstream target Elk-1 could be inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126. These data suggest that CCK and gastrin have direct activating effects on PSC, are able to induce collagen synthesis in these cells, and therefore appear to be important regulators of pancreatic fibrogenesis. Furthermore, similar to TGF-β, both CCK and gastrin inhibit proliferation in PSC."
https://openalex.org/W2158645640,"Background Isometric muscle contraction, where force is generated without muscle shortening, is a molecular traffic jam in which the number of actin-attached motors is maximized and all states of motor action are trapped with consequently high heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is a major limitation to deciphering myosin conformational changes in situ. Methodology We used multivariate data analysis to group repeat segments in electron tomograms of isometrically contracting insect flight muscle, mechanically monitored, rapidly frozen, freeze substituted, and thin sectioned. Improved resolution reveals the helical arrangement of F-actin subunits in the thin filament enabling an atomic model to be built into the thin filament density independent of the myosin. Actin-myosin attachments can now be assigned as weak or strong by their motor domain orientation relative to actin. Myosin attachments were quantified everywhere along the thin filament including troponin. Strong binding myosin attachments are found on only four F-actin subunits, the “target zone”, situated exactly midway between successive troponin complexes. They show an axial lever arm range of 77°/12.9 nm. The lever arm azimuthal range of strong binding attachments has a highly skewed, 127° range compared with X-ray crystallographic structures. Two types of weak actin attachments are described. One type, found exclusively in the target zone, appears to represent pre-working-stroke intermediates. The other, which contacts tropomyosin rather than actin, is positioned M-ward of the target zone, i.e. the position toward which thin filaments slide during shortening. Conclusion We present a model for the weak to strong transition in the myosin ATPase cycle that incorporates azimuthal movements of the motor domain on actin. Stress/strain in the S2 domain may explain azimuthal lever arm changes in the strong binding attachments. The results support previous conclusions that the weak attachments preceding force generation are very different from strong binding attachments."
https://openalex.org/W2045117050,"Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1) encoded by CLEC2D gene is a C-type lectin-like molecule interacting with human CD161 (NKR-P1A) receptor expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. Using RT-PCR and sequencing, we identified several CLEC2D alternatively spliced transcript variants generated by exon skipping. In addition to the reported transcript variants 1 (LLT1) and 2, we identified a novel splice variant 4 and transcripts coding for putative soluble proteins. CLEC2D transcripts were detected primarily in hematopoietic cell lines and were found to be co-induced by the same activation signals. Although very low amounts of putative soluble CLEC2D protein isoforms could be produced by transfectants, CLEC2D isoforms 2 and 4 were efficiently expressed. By contrast to LLT1, which was detected on the cell surface, isoform 2 and 4 remained in the endoplasmic reticulum where they formed homodimers or heterodimers with LLT1. They failed to interact with CD161, leaving LLT1 as the sole ligand for this receptor. CLEC2D therefore uses gene splicing to generate protein isoforms that are structurally distinct and that have different biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2028038980,"Background The use of insecticidal bed nets is found to be an effective public health tool for control of malaria, especially for under-five children and pregnant women. BRAC, an indigenous Bangladeshi non-governmental development organization, started working in the East African state of Uganda in June 2006. As part of its efforts to improve the health and well-being of its participants, BRAC Uganda has been distributing long lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLIN) at a subsidized price through health volunteers since February 2008. This study was conducted in March-April 2009 to examine how equitable the programme had been in consistence with BRAC Uganda's pro-poor policy. Methodology/Principal Findings Information on possession of LLINs and relevant knowledge on its proper use and maintenance was collected from households either with an under-five child and/or a pregnant woman. The sample included three villages from each of the 10 branch offices where BRAC Uganda's community-based health programme was operating. Data were collected by trained enumerators through face-to-face interviews using a hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA). Findings reveal that the study population had superficial knowledge on malaria and its transmission, including the use and maintenance of LLINs. The households' rate of possession of bed nets (41–59%), and the proportion of under-five children (17–19%) and pregnant women (25–27%) who reported sleeping under an LLIN were not encouraging. Inequity was observed in the number of LLINs possessed by the households, in the knowledge on its use and maintenance, and between the two programme areas. Conclusions/Significance The BRAC Uganda's LLINs distribution at a subsidized price appeared to be inadequate and inequitable, and BRAC's knowledge dissemination is insufficient for initiating preventive actions such as proper use of LLINs to interrupt malaria transmission. Findings contribute to the on-going debate on LLINs distribution in Africa and make a strong case for its free distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2003670951,"Both CD28 and NKG2D can function as co-stimulatory receptors in human CD8+ T cells. However, their independent functional contributions in distinct CD8+ T cell subsets are not well understood. In this study, CD8+ T cells in human peripheral blood- and lung-derived lymphocytes were analyzed for CD28 and NKG2D expression and function. We found a higher level of CD28 expression in PBMC-derived naïve (CD45RA+CD27+) and memory (CD45RA−CD27+) CD8+ T cells (CD28Hi), while its expression was significantly lower in effector (CD45RA+CD27−) CD8+ T cells (CD28Lo). Irrespective of the differences in the CD28 levels, NKG2D expression was comparable in all three CD8+ T cell subsets. CD28 and NKG2D expressions followed similar patterns in human lung-resident GILGFVFTL/HLA-A2-pentamer positive CD8+ T cells. Co-stimulation of CD28Lo effector T cells via NKG2D significantly increased IFN-γ and TNF-α levels. On the contrary, irrespective of its comparable levels, NKG2D-mediated co-stimulation failed to augment IFN-γ and TNF-α production in CD28Hi naïve/memory T cells. Additionally, CD28-mediated co-stimulation was obligatory for IL-2 generation and thereby its production was limited only to the CD28Hi naïve/memory subsets. MICA, a ligand for NKG2D was abundantly expressed in the tracheal epithelial cells, validating the use of NKG2D as the major co-stimulatory receptor by tissue-resident CD8+ effector T cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that NKG2D may provide an expanded level of co-stimulation to tissue-residing effector CD8+ T cells. Thus, incorporation of co-stimulation via NKG2D in addition to CD28 is essential to activate tumor or tissue-infiltrating effector CD8+ T cells. However, boosting a recall immune response via memory CD8+ T cells or vaccination to stimulate naïve CD8+ T cells would require CD28-mediated co-stimulation."

We investigated early changes in serum levels of several candidate biomarkers involved in cartilage and bone metabolism following the initiation of adalimumab as a prototypic active treatment in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) compared to placebo. Materials and Methods Twenty-four PsA patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 40 mg s.c. every other week or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by an open label extension phase. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment and analyzed for levels of CPII and PINP (synthesis of type II and type I procollagen), melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) (chondrocyte anabolism), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, C2C and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (type II collagen degradation), osteocalcin (OC) (bone formation), NTX-I and ICTP (both type I collagen degradation). Results After 4 weeks, there was a significant decrease in serum MMP-3 levels in adalimumab-treated patients (P<0.005), while no change was observed in the placebo group. A significant increase in serum MIA was noted after adalimumab therapy (P<0.005) but not after placebo treatment. After 12 weeks, there was a marked reduction in serum MMP-3 in both groups (P<0.005), whereas other markers did not show significant changes compared to baseline. Conclusion MMP-3 and MIA could serve as soluble biomarkers associated with inflammation as well as joint remodelling and destruction and may, together with clinical evaluation and in combination with other biomarkers, assist in distinguishing between effective and ineffective therapy in small, proof-of-principle studies of short duration in PsA.

Retinoid signaling was previously found to be nearly absent in UGP, but to be much stronger in LGP coincident with hypertrophy, extracellular matrix turnover and endochondral bone formation. To determine whether such distinct signaling levels and phenotypic events reflect different endogenous retinoid levels, the upper two-thirds and lower one-third of rabbit rib growth plates were microsurgically isolated and processed for ultrasensitive retinoid LC-tandem MS quantification. Indeed, the UGP samples contained only about a 0.6 nm concentration of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) that is the most active natural retinoid in tissues, whereas LGP samples contained nearly 3-fold higher atRA levels (about 1.8 nm). Perichondrium was quite rich in atRA (about 4.9 nm). Interestingly, the levels of retinol, the major but inactive atRA precursor, were similar in all tissues (1.1–1.6 μm), suggesting that the distinct atRA levels in UGP and LGP reflect different retinoid anabolic capacity. Indeed, RALDH2 and CRABP1 transcript levels were much higher in LGP than UGP samples. To determine the minimum effective atRA concentration, chondrogenic cells transfected with a retinoic acid response element (RARE)-luc reporter plasmid were treated with different concentrations of exogenous atRA (0–100 nm). About 3 nm atRA was needed to elicit appreciable RARE-luc reporter activity and to decrease proteoglycan synthesis and activity of an aggrecan enhancer reporter plasmid. In sum, the data indicate that (i) the endogenous levels of atRA are significantly higher in hypertrophic than upper zones of growth plate; (ii) such difference likely reflects distinct retinoid anabolic capacity; and (iii) importantly, atRA levels in hypertrophic portion are within effective ranges to elicit retinoid signaling and action, but those in upper zones are not.

https://openalex.org/W1967936683,"Nedd4-2 is an archetypal HECT ubiquitin E3 ligase that disposes target proteins for degradation. Because of the proven roles of Nedd4-2 in degradation of membrane proteins, such as epithelial Na+ channel, we examined the effect of Nedd4-2 on the apical Ca2+ channel TRPV6, which is involved in transcellular Ca2+ transport in the intestine using the Xenopus laevis oocyte system. We demonstrated that a significant amount of Nedd4-2 protein was distributed to the absorptive epithelial cells in ileum, cecum, and colon along with TRPV6. When co-expressed in oocytes, Nedd4-2 and, to a lesser extent, Nedd4 down-regulated the protein abundance and Ca2+ influx of TRPV6 and TRPV5, respectively. TRPV6 ubiquitination was increased, and its stability was decreased by Nedd4-2. The Nedd4-2 inhibitory effects on TRPV6 were partially blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not by the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine. The rate of TRPV6 internalization was not significantly altered by Nedd4-2. The HECT domain was essential to the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on TRPV6 and to their association. The WW1 and WW2 domains interacted with TRPV6 terminal regions, and a disruption of the interactions by D204H and D376H mutations in the WW1 and WW2 domains increased TRPV6 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, WW1 and WW2 may serve as a molecular switch to limit the ubiquitination of TRPV6 by the HECT domain. In conclusion, Nedd4-2 may regulate TRPV6 protein abundance in intestinal epithelia by controlling TRPV6 ubiquitination.

https://openalex.org/W1996786568,"Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is the commonest cause of primary antibody failure in adults and children, and characterized clinically by recurrent bacterial infections and autoimmune manifestations. Several innate immune defects have been described in CVID, but no study has yet investigated the frequency, phenotype or function of the key regulatory cell population, natural killer T (NKT) cells. We measured the frequencies and subsets of NKT cells in patients with CVID and compared these to healthy controls. Our results show a skewing of NKT cell subsets, with CD4+ NKT cells at higher frequencies, and CD8+ NKT cells at lower frequencies. However, these cells were highly activated and expression CD161. The NKT cells had a higher expression of CCR5 and concomitantly expression of CCR5+CD69+CXCR6 suggesting a compensation of the remaining population of NKT cells for rapid effector action."
https://openalex.org/W2169017387,"Membrane and actin cytoskeleton dynamics during phagocytosis can be triggered and amplified by the signal transduction of receptor tyrosine kinases. The epidermal keratinocytes appear to use the phagocytic mechanism of uptake to ingest melano-somes released by the melanocytes and play a pivotal role in the transfer process. We have previously demonstrated that the keratinocyte growth factor KGF/ FGF7 promotes the melanosome uptake through activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2b/KGFR. The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of KGFR expression, activation, and signaling in regulating the phagocytic process and the melanosome transfer. Phagocytosis was analyzed in vitro using fluorescent latex beads on human keratin-ocytes induced to differentiate. Melanosome transfer was investigated in keratinocyte-melanocyte cocul-tures. KGFR depletion by small interfering RNA microinjection and overexpression by transfection of wild type or defective mutant KGFR were performed to demonstrate the direct effect of the receptor on phagocytosis and melanosome transfer. Colocalization of the phagocytosed beads with the internalized receptors in phagolysosomes was analyzed by optical sectioning and 3-dimensional reconstruction. KGFR ligands triggered phagocytosis and melanosome transfer in differentiated keratinocytes, and receptor kinase activity and signaling were required for these effects, suggesting that FGFR2b/KGFR expression/activity and PLCγ signaling pathway play crucial roles in phagocytosis.—Belleudi, F., Purpura, V., Scrofani, C., Persechino, F., Leone, L., and Torrisi, M.

https://openalex.org/W2028783024,"Background A link between early mismatched nutritional environment and development of components of the metabolic syndrome later in life has been shown in epidemiological and animal data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an early mismatched nutrition produced by catch-up growth after fetal protein restriction could induce the appearance of hypertension and/or atherosclerosis in adult male mice. Methodology/Principal Findings Wild-type C57BL6/J or LDLr−/− dams were fed a low protein (LP) or a control (C) diet during gestation. Catch-up growth was induced in LP offspring by feeding dams with a control diet and by culling the litter to 4 pups against 8 in controls. At weaning, male mice were fed either standard chow or an obesogenic diet (OB), leading to 4 experimental groups. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed in conscious unrestrained wild-type mice by telemetry. Atherosclerosis plaque area was measured in aortic root sections of LDLr−/− mice. We found that: (1) postnatal OB diet increased significantly BP (P<0.0001) and HR (P<0.008) in 3-month old OB-C and OB-LP offspring, respectively; (2) that maternal LP diet induced a significant higher BP (P<0.009) and HR (P<0.004) and (3) an altered circadian rhythm in addition to higher plasma corticosterone concentration in 9 months-old LP offspring; (4) that, although LP offspring showed higher plasma total cholesterol than control offspring, atherosclerosis assessed in aortic roots of 6-mo old mice featured increased plaque area due to OB feeding but not due to early mismatched nutrition. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate a long-term effect of early mismatched nutrition on the appearance of hypertension independently of obesity, while no effect on atherosclerosis was noticed at this age."
https://openalex.org/W2045431172,"NG2 cells, a fourth type of glial cell in the mammalian CNS, undergo reactive changes in response to a wide variety of brain insults. Recent studies have demonstrated that neuronally expressed acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are implicated in various neurological disorders including brain ischemia and seizures. Acidosis is a common feature of acute neurological conditions. It is postulated that a drop in pH may be the link between the pathological process and activation of NG2 cells. Such postulate immediately prompts the following questions: Do NG2 cells express ASICs? If so, what are their functional properties and subunit composition? Here, using a combination of electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging and immunocytochemistry, we present evidence to demonstrate that NG2 cells of the rat hippocampus express high density of Ca2+-permeable ASIC1a channels compared with several types of hippocampal neurons. First, nucleated patch recordings from NG2 cells revealed high density of proton-activated currents. The magnitude of proton-activated current was pH dependent, with a pH for half-maximal activation of 6.3. Second, the current-voltage relationship showed a reversal close to the equilibrium potential for Na+. Third, psalmotoxin 1, a blocker specific for the ASIC1a channel, largely inhibited proton-activated currents. Fourth, Ca2+ imaging showed that activation of proton-activated channels led to an increase of [Ca2+]i. Finally, immunocytochemistry showed co-localization of ASIC1a and NG2 proteins in the hippocampus. Thus the acid chemosensor, the ASIC1a channel, may serve for inducing membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx, thereby playing a crucial role in the NG2 cell response to injury following ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2094716192,"Several protozoan parasites have been shown to undergo a form of programmed cell death that exhibits morphological features associated with metazoan apoptosis. These include the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei. Malaria zygotes develop in the mosquito midgut lumen, forming motile ookinetes. Up to 50% of these exhibit phenotypic markers of apoptosis; as do those grown in culture. We hypothesised that naturally occurring signals induce many ookinetes to undergo apoptosis before midgut traversal. To determine whether nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species act as such triggers, ookinetes were cultured with donors of these molecules. Exposure to the nitric oxide donor SNP induced a significant increase in ookinetes with condensed nuclear chromatin, activated caspase-like molecules and translocation of phosphatidylserine that was dose and time related. Results from an assay that detects the potential-dependent accumulation of aggregates of JC-1 in mitochondria suggested that nitric oxide does not operate via loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. L-DOPA (reactive oxygen species donor) also caused apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner. Removal of white blood cells significantly decreased ookinetes exhibiting a marker of apoptosis in vitro. Inhibition of the activity of nitric oxide synthase in the mosquito midgut epithelium using L-NAME significantly decreased the proportion of apoptotic ookinetes and increased the number of oocysts that developed. Introduction of a nitric oxide donor into the blood meal had no effect on mosquito longevity but did reduce prevalence and intensity of infection. Thus, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species are triggers of apoptosis in Plasmodium ookinetes. They occur naturally in the mosquito midgut lumen, sourced from infected blood and mosquito tissue. Up regulation of mosquito nitric oxide synthase activity has potential as a transmission blocking strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2056254683,"The innate immune system employs Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for the detection of invading microorganisms based on distinct molecular patterns. For example, TLR9 is activated by microbial DNA and also by short therapeutic CpG-containing oligonucleotides (CpG-ODN). TLR9 activation leads to the production of interferons and the priming of humoral adaptive immune responses. Unfortunately, the principles of ligand recognition by TLR9 are poorly understood, and genetic variants of TLR9, which may affect its function, have not been characterized systematically on the molecular level. We therefore sought to functionally characterize reported single nucleotide polymorphisms of TLR9 in the HEK293 model system. We discovered that two variants, P99L and M400I, are associated with altered receptor function regarding NF-κB activation and cytokine induction. Our investigations show that for the most functionally impaired variant, P99L, the ability to respond to physiological and therapeutic TLR9 ligands is severely compromised. However, CpG-ODN binding is normal. CpG-ODN recognition by TLR9 thus appears to involve two separate events, CpG-ODN binding and sensing. Our studies highlight Pro-99 as a residue important for the latter process. In genotyping studies, we confirmed that both M400I (rs41308230) and P99L (rs5743844) are relatively rare variants of TLR9. Our data add rs41308230 and rs5743844 to the list of functionally important TLR variants and warrant further research into their relevance for infectious disease susceptibility or responsiveness to CpG-ODN-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2051570680,"Background The tumor suppressor KLF6 and its oncogenic cytoplasmic splice variant KLF6-SV1 represent a paradigm in cancer biology in that their antagonistic cancer functions are encoded within the same gene. As a consequence of splicing, KLF6-SV1 loses both the C-terminus C2H2 three zinc finger (ZF) domain, which characterizes all KLF proteins, as well as the adjacent 5′ basic region (5BR), a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS). It has been hypothesized that this NLS is a functional domain critical to direct the distinct subcellular localization of the tumor suppressor and its splice variant. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate using EGFP fusion constructs that KLF6/KLF6-SV1 nucleo-cytoplasmic transport is not regulated by the 5′ basic region but activated by a novel NLS encoded within the ZF domain, and a nuclear export signal (NES) located in the first 16 amino acids of the shared N-terminus sequence. We demonstrate KLF6 nuclear export to be Crm1-dependent. The dysregulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport when disrupting the KLF6 NLS using site-directed mutagenesis showed that its integrity is necessary for appropriate protein stability. Moreover, these mutations impaired transcriptional induction of two KLF6 well-characterized target genes, E-cadherin and p21, as shown by RT-PCR and luciferase promoter assays. The addition of the ZF domain to KLF6-SV1 results in its nuclear localization and a markedly decreased half-life similar to wild type KLF6. Conclusions/Significance We describe the domains that control KLF6 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and how these domains play a role in KLF6 protein half-life and tumor suppressor function. The results begin to mechanistically explain, at least in part, the opposing functions of KLF6 and KLF6-SV1 in cancer."

To predict functional peptide regions important for substrate binding and activity of human β4GalT7, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the β1,4-galactosyltransferase family and generated a molecular model using the x-ray structure of Drosophila β4GalT7-UDP as template. Two evolutionary conserved motifs, 163DVD165 and 221FWGWGREDDE230, are central in the organization of the enzyme active site. This model was challenged by systematic engineering of point mutations, combined with in vitro and ex vivo functional assays. Investigation of the kinetic properties of purified recombinant wild-type β4GalT7 and selected mutants identified Trp224 as a key residue governing both donor and acceptor substrate binding. Our results also suggested the involvement of the canonical carboxylate residue Asp228 acting as general base in the reaction catalyzed by human β4GalT7. Importantly, ex vivo functional tests demonstrated that regulation of GAG synthesis is highly responsive to modification of these key active site amino acids. Interestingly, engineering mutants at position 224 allowed us to modify the affinity and to modulate the specificity of human β4GalT7 toward UDP-sugars and xyloside acceptors. Furthermore, the W224H mutant was able to sustain decorin GAG chain substitution but not GAG synthesis from exogenously added xyloside. Altogether, this study provides novel insight into human β4GalT7 active site functional domains, allowing manipulation of this enzyme critical for the regulation of GAG synthesis.

GAGs are implicated as regulators in many biological events related to intracellular signaling, cell-cell interactions, and tissue morphogenesis. Thus, the pathophysiological roles of GAGs are highly diversified, ranging from mechanical support to intricate effects on various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, and motility (1Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). These vital functions depend on the interactions of the GAG chains with a variety of molecules, including growth factors, cytokines, and their receptors, enzymes, including matrix proteases and coagulation factors as well as extracellular matrix proteins (2Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). glycosaminoglycan β1,4-galactosyltransferase 7 7-methoxy-2-naphthyl-β-d-xylopyranoside 7-methoxy-2-naphthyl-β-d-xylopyranoside-2-phosphate 4-methylumbelliferone-β-d-xylopyranoside 4-nitrophenol-β-d-xylopyranoside 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol Protein Data Bank. The biosynthesis of GAG chains, which governs the expression of these functions, involves the ordered stepwise addition of a series of monosaccharides derived from UDP-sugars onto the polypeptide backbone of a proteoglycan through the action of specific glycosyltransferases (3Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This multistep process starts by the addition of Xyl to a serine residue of the core protein followed by the addition of two Gal and one GlcUA to form the tetrasaccharide linkage region (GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1, 3Galβ1,4Xylβ1) common to most GAGs. This tetrasaccharide structure serves as a primer for the formation of heparin/heparan sulfate and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains, which is initiated by the attachment of GlcNAc or GalNAc, respectively. The glucosaminoglycan (heparin/heparan sulfate) and the galactosaminoglycan (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) chains then assemble by the alternating addition of GlcUA and GlcNAc or GlcUA and GalNAc, respectively. GAG chains are further modified by the cooperative action of epimerases and sulfotransferases that add considerable complexity and functionality to the polysaccharide backbone (4Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Bui C. Ouzzine M. Talhaoui I. Sharp S. Prydz K. Coughtrie M.W. Fournel-Gigleux S.

Τhe enzyme β4GalT7 (xylosylprotein β1,4-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.133) catalyzes the transfer of a Gal residue provided by UDP-α-d-Gal (UDP-Gal) onto Xyl, a key step in the synthesis of the linkage region of GAG chains (6Almeida R.

Accordingly, we found that phosphorylation of Xyl, preventing β4GalT7 activity, may act as a key regulatory event in the initiation of GAG synthesis (7Gulberti S. Lattard V. Fondeur M. Jacquinet J.C.

Furthermore, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, defects in this enzyme, which disrupt GAG synthesis, result in severe biological consequences. In humans, point mutations in the B4GALT7 gene are associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, characterized by aged appearance, developmental delay, dwarfism, and several connective tissue disorders (8Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the invertebrate Drosophila melanogaster, a reverse genetic approach proved β4GalT7 to be essential for viability (9Nakamura Y. Haines N. Chen J. Okajima T. Furukawa K. Urano T. Stanley P.

The structure of the fly protein has recently been solved by x-ray crystallography (10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Biol.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, defective β4GalT7 provokes serious morphological abnormalities during embryonic development (11Okajima T. Yoshida K. Kondo T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22915-22918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the requirement for a Xyl polypeptide as a starting block to build a GAG chain can be bypassed in vitro and in vivo by xyloside derivatives consisting of Xyl linked to a hydrophobic aglycone (12Lugemwa F.N. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19159-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These xylosides serve as substrates for β4GalT7, thus promoting initiation and polymerization of GAG chains. Such GAG precursors hold promise as anti-thrombotic drugs (13Martin N.B. Masson P. Sepulchre C. Theveniaux J. Millet J. Bellamy F. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1996; 22: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and anti-amyloid agents (14Kisilevsky R. Szarek W.A. Ancsin J.

On the other hand, inhibitors of GAG synthesis have been proposed as chemotherapeutic agents (15Mani K. Havsmark B. Persson S. Kaneda Y. Yamamoto H. Sakurai K. Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Suzuki S.

Thus, an understanding of the structure and function of β4GalT7, a pivotal enzyme in GAG biosynthesis, would represent a major step toward the development of GAG-based therapeutics. The β4GalT7 enzyme belongs to the human β1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) family, containing seven members that are involved in the formation of Galβ1,4GlcNAc or Galβ1,4Glc linkages in different glycoconjugates and free saccharides (18Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Analysis of their substrate specificity revealed major physiological functions and substantial impact in the pathogenesis of diseases. β4GalT1 (lactose synthase), one of the first glycosyltransferases to be cloned and characterized, acts on a nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residue as acceptor substrate, whereas in the presence of α-lactalbumin, the enzyme prefers Glc to GlcNAc (19Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 292-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). β4GalT2 and β4GalT3 catalyze the formation of Galβ1,4GlcNAc bonds in several glycoproteins and specific glycolipids. β4GalT5 and β4GalT6 are involved in the synthesis of lactosylceramide, which plays a major role in the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Recently, the importance of β4GalT4 in the construction of keratan sulfate chains, essential in the maintenance of corneal matrix structure, has been discovered (20Kitayama K. Hayashida Y. Nishida K. Akama T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30085-30096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the β4GalT genes show sequence homology with those coding for β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (β1,4GalNAcTs), among them several enzymes are involved in chondroitin sulfate GAG chains synthesis. Several short conserved peptide motifs, possibly involved in the donor- and acceptor-binding sites, have been identified in the human enzymes and among β4GalT orthologs in various animal species (21Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these motifs are also conserved between members of the β1,4-glycosyltransferase family, including seven β1,4-galactosyltransferases (β1,4GalTs), two β1,4GalNAcTs, and four chondroitin synthases (19Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 292-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Human β4GalT7 presents 73% protein sequence similarity with its Drosophila ortholog (10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15619-15626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the seven human β4GalT proteins exhibit 25–55% sequence homology (19Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 292-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The β4GalT7 is the most distant of the seven members of the β4GalT family (22Hennet T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Unlike β4GalT1, which has been subjected to extensive investigation for more than 20 years, our understanding of the mechanism of action of human β4GalT7 is limited. To gain further insight into the structure and function of this enzyme, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of β1,4GalTs, which identified 48 related sequences containing 8 highly conserved peptide motifs. Using the structural coordinates of Drosophila β4GalT7, we modeled the human β4GalT7 structure, predicting that the peptide motifs 163DVD165 and 221FWGWRGEDDE230 are likely to be important for the organization of the active site. Finally, using site-directed mutagenesis and a combination of in vitro and ex vivo activity assays, we analyzed the functional implications of these β4GalT hallmarks. Our results suggest the involvement of a carboxylate residue in the reaction catalyzed by human β4GalT7 and highlight the central function of Trp224 in donor and acceptor substrate binding. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (4-MUX), 4-nitrophenol-β-d-xylopyranoside (4-NP-Xyl), UDP-Gal, UDP-α-d-glucose (UDP-Glc), UDP-α-d-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-α-d-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), UDP-α-d-xylose (UDP-Xyl), and anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase antibodies were provided from Sigma. UDP[14C]Gal, UDP[14C]GlcUA, UDP[14C]Xyl, UDP[14C]GalNAc, UDP[14C]GlcNAc, and Na2[S35]SO4 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and UDP[14C]Glc was from Amersham Biosciences. 7-Methoxy-2-naphthyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (MN-Xyl) and 7-methoxy-2-naphthyl-β-d-xylopyranoside-2-phosphate (MN-Xyl-2P) were synthesized as described previously (7Gulberti S. Lattard V. Fondeur M. Jacquinet J.C. Mulliert G. Netter P. Magdalou J. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc antibodies were from Invitrogen. Cell culture media were provided by Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. The eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) and competent One Shot® Top10 Escherichia coli cells were from Invitrogen. The bacterial expression vector pET-41a(+) and E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were from Novagen-EMD4Biosciences, and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. Only eukaryote sequences were considered in this study. Twenty nine β4GalT7 homologous sequences from different animal species were retrieved from the NCBI Data Bank by PSI-BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) with default parameters using B4GT7_HUMAN as seeding sequence (25Harduin-Lepers A. Mollicone R. Delannoy P. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Other β4GalT7 homologous sequences were searched (26Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) through exploration of all genomic and expression sequence tags available and sequences from general (NCBI, DDBJ, and ENSEMBL) or specialized databases like the Joint Genome Institute (Department of Energy) for Branchiostoma floridae, using BLASTN and TBLASTN with default parameters (e-value cut off at 0.01). Within each animal species, the expression sequence tag contigs for each new β4GalT7-like sequence were compiled with CAP3 (23Huang X. Madan A. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (4113) Google Scholar). Splice site prediction analysis was achieved at the Berkeley Drosophila genome project. The structure of each gene, in terms of exon/intron boundaries, was deduced from several nonexclusive strategies as follows: (i) comparison of the boundaries proposed by Genscan (MIT Server), (ii) comparison of EST sequences to genomic assemblages (scaffolds or contigs), and (iii) comparison of predicted boundaries to those present in known genes. All nucleotide sequences allowing generation of a complete protein were considered, and the assignation of the new sequences to the β4GalT7 family was defined by the presence of the eight peptide motifs (Fig. 1). The 19 new sequences of β4GalT7 reconstructed by these approaches were submitted to EMBL with the following accession numbers: AM231255 Ciona savigny; AM231256 Drosophila ananassae; AM231257 Drosophila erecta; AM231258 Drosophila mojavensis; AM231259 Drosophila sechellia; AM231260 Drosophila simulans; AM231261 Drosophila yakuba; AM231262 Gallus gallus; AM231263 Oryzias latipes; AM231264 Pan troglodytes; AM231265 Schistosoma mansoni; AM231266 Tetraodon nigroviridis; AM231267 Takifugu rubripes; FN568101 Bos taurus; FN568102 Glossina morsitans; FN568103 Ovis aries; FN568104 Rana catesbeiana; FN568105 Sus scrofa; and FN568106 Squalus acanthias. Multiple alignments were performed using ClustalW (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and saved in Pir format. The Pir alignments were used for the selection of informative positions by G-Blocks (28Castresana J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (7502) Google Scholar). By this computerized method, 220 informative amino acid positions in eight G-blocks were selected for the phylogeny analyses. Phylogeny was carried out with Phylowin® software (29Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar) using pairwise gap removal, BIONJ, Poisson correction, and 500 bootstrap replicates. A molecular model of the catalytic domain of human β4GalT7 was initially built based on the structure of monomer A of bovine β4GalT1 complexed with UDP-Gal (PDB code entry 1O0R) (31Ramakrishnan B. Balaji P.V. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using Modeler version 8v2 (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The resulting model was then minimized using Amber simulation program version 8 (32Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E.

AMBER 8. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar) with 500 iterations of steepest descent and 150 of conjugate gradient. Docking of UDP-Gal-Mn2+ molecules in the human β4GalT7 structure was performed manually based on the position of the donor substrate in the structure of bovine β4GalT1. Charges of the atoms of UDP-Gal were calculated using the GAUSSIAN94 package (33Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery J.A.

Gaussian 98. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh1998Google Scholar) and the HF/6–31 G* basis set. Atom-centered charges were fitted with the antechamber of Amber 8 software package (32Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Merz K.M. Wang B. Pearlman D.A. Crowley M. Brozell S. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Mongan J. Hornak V. Cui G. Beroza P. Schafmeister C. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. P.A. K. AMBER 8. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). Mn2+ parameters available from the Amber website were used to build the model of β4GalT7-UDP-Gal-Mn2+ complex by energy minimization (500 iterations of steepest descent and 1500 of conjugate gradient). This model structure was next solvated using an octahedron box. The energy of the water molecules was minimized keeping those of the protein, UDP-Gal and Mn2+, fixed, with 1000 iterations of steepest descent and 1500 of conjugate gradients. Subsequently, the whole system was submitted to molecular dynamics, by the mean of an equilibration phase of 20 ps allowing the temperature rising from 0 to 300 K followed by a production phase of 600 ps at 300 K. A molecular model of the catalytic domain of human β4GalT7 was also generated based on the structure of Drosophila β4GalT7 linked to an N-terminal peptide of bovine β4GalT1 (PDB code entry 3LW6) using Modeler version 8v2 (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The resulting model was then minimized using Amber simulation program version 11 (34Case D.A. Darden T.A.

University of California, San Francisco2010Google Scholar), as described above. Protein sequence alignments used to generate the models are provided as supplemental material F1. The human β4GalT7 sequence (GenBank® nucleotide sequence accession number NM_007255) was cloned by PCR amplification from a placenta cDNA library (Clontech), as described previously (7Gulberti S. Lattard V. Fondeur M. Jacquinet J.C. Mulliert G. Netter P. Magdalou J. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For the heterologous expression of the human β4GalT7 in mammalian cell lines, the full-length cDNA sequence was modified by PCR to include a KpnI site and a Kozak consensus sequence at the 5′ end (5′-CGGTACCACCATGTTCCCCTCGCGGAGGAAAGCGGGCGC-3′), and a sequence encoding a Myc tag (EQKLIEEDL) and an XbaI site at the 3′ end (5′-GTCTAGATCACAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCGCTGAATGTGCACCAGGGTTGGC-3′). The modified cDNA sequence was then subcloned into the KpnI-XbaI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) to produce pcDNA-β4GalT7. For bacterial expression, a truncated form of β4GalT7 was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The sequence lacking the codons of the first 60 N-terminal amino acids was amplified from the full-length cDNA using the oligonucleotide sense (5′-CCATGGTCAGGGGACAAGGGCAG-3′) and antisense primers (5′-GCGGCCGCTCACCTGAATGTGCACCA-3′), including NcoI and NotI sites, respectively, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pET-41a(+) to produce the plasmid pET-β4GalT7. Final vector constructs were sequenced to verify that no errors had been introduced. Mutations were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, employing pcDNA-β4GalT7 or pET-β4GalT7 as template, and sense and antisense primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. Mutants were systematically checked by sequencing. The human decorin cDNA sequence (GenBank® accession number NM_001920.3) was cloned by PCR amplification from a placenta cDNA library (Clontech) using sense (5′-ATGAAGGCCACTATCATCCTCCTTCTG-3′) and antisense primers (5′-CTACTTATAGTTTCCGAGTTGAATGGC-3′). For the heterologous expression of the recombinant decorin in eukaryotic cells, the full-length cDNA sequence was modified by PCR to include an AflII site, a Kozak consensus sequence at the 5′ end, a sequence encoding a His5 tag, and an XhoI site at the 3′ end. This sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) to produce pcDNA-decorinHis. HeLa cells and CHO pgsB-618 cells purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and F-12/DMEM (1:1), respectively, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 1 mm glutamine. Wild-type and mutant pcDNA-β4GalT7 plasmids were individually transfected into HeLa or CHO pgsB-618 cells grown to 80% confluency, using ExGen 500 reagent (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 48 h after transfection and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and sonicated for 5 s. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) prior to SDS-PAGE or activity analyses. Alternatively, transfected cells were transferred to labeling medium prior to GAG extraction, as described below. CHO pgsB-618 cells were transfected with human pcDNA-decorinHis using geneticin G-418 (Sigma) for selection of stable transfectants, as described previously (36Fournel-Gigleux S. Jackson M.R. Wooster R. Burchell B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and then used for transient transfection with wild-type and mutant pcDNA-β4GalT7 plasmids. To express wild-type and mutant GST-β4GalT7, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET-β4GalT7 plasmids and selected by kanamycin resistance. Recombinants were inoculated in fresh Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and incubated at 37 °C on an orbital shaker (160 rpm) overnight. Each sample was then inoculated into 200 ml of fresh medium at a ratio of 1:100 and incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 °C until an absorbance (A) at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8 was reached. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were further cultured at 20 °C for 16 h. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g to eliminate cell debris, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged 15 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant and pellet from this centrifugation were then subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The supernatant from the last centrifugation containing soluble proteins was used for affinity chromatography purification of GST-β4GalT7 using glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B packed columns (GE Healthcare), following recommendations of the manufacturer, and the amount of purified protein was quantified using Quant-iTTM assay kit and QubitTM spectrofluorimeter. Protein samples from HeLa or CHO pgsB-618 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant pcDNA-β4GalT7 plasmids were separated on SDS-10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P® polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blot was developed using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibodies, as described previously (37Fondeur-Gelinotte M. Lattard V. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Jacquinet J.C. Mulliert G. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1667-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amount of recombinant wild-type and mutant protein expressed in cells was evaluated from immunoblot analysis using a calibration curve established with 15–50 ng of recombinant GST-Myc protein (Pierce) run on the same gel, as described previously (7Gulberti S. Lattard V. Fondeur M. Jacquinet J.C. Mulliert G. Netter P. Magdalou J. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol.

The in vitro assay of β4GalT7 activity was performed as described previously (7Gulberti S. Lattard V. Fondeur M. Jacquinet J.C. Mulliert G. Netter P. Magdalou J. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. J."
https://openalex.org/W2055631639,"Na(+)-coupled ascorbic acid transporter-2 (SVCT2) activity is impaired at acid pH, but little is known about the molecular determinants that define the transporter pH sensitivity. SVCT2 contains six histidine residues in its primary sequence, three of which are exofacial in the transporter secondary structure model. We used site-directed mutagenesis and treatment with diethylpyrocarbonate to identify histidine residues responsible for SVCT2 pH sensitivity. We conclude that five histidine residues, His(109), His(203), His(206), His(269), and His(413), are central regulators of SVCT2 function, participating to different degrees in modulating pH sensitivity, transporter kinetics, Na(+) cooperativity, conformational stability, and subcellular localization. Our results are compatible with a model in which (i) a single exofacial histidine residue, His(413), localized in the exofacial loop IV that connects transmembrane helices VII-VIII defines the pH sensitivity of SVCT2 through a mechanism involving a marked attenuation of the activation by Na(+) and loss of Na(+) cooperativity, which leads to a decreased V(max) without altering the transport K(m); (ii) exofacial histidine residues His(203), His(206), and His(413) may be involved in maintaining a functional interaction between exofacial loops II and IV and influence the general folding of the transporter; (iii) histidines 203, 206, 269, and 413 affect the transporter kinetics by modulating the apparent transport K(m); and (iv) histidine 109, localized at the center of transmembrane helix I, might be fundamental for the interaction of SVCT2 with the transported substrate ascorbic acid. Thus, histidine residues are central regulators of SVCT2 function."

A class of mutations, the mitochondrial genome integrity (mgi) mutations, has been shown to uncouple this process in the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase. Four mutant forms of the yeast F1 ATPase with mgi mutations were crystallized; the structures were solved and analyzed. The analysis identifies two mechanisms of structural uncoupling: one in which the empty catalytic site is altered and in doing so, apparently disrupts substrate (phosphate) binding, and a second where the steric hindrance predicted between γLeu83 and βDP residues, Leu-391 and Glu-395, located in Catch 2 region, is reduced allowing rotation of the γ-subunit with less impedance.

Overall, the structures provide key insights into the critical interactions in the yeast ATP synthase involved in the coupling process. IntroductionThe mitochondrial ATP synthase is a molecular motor that couples the transport of protons down a potential gradient with the phosphorylation of ADP. This process can be reversed and the hydrolysis of ATP results in the pumping of protons out of the mitochondrial matrix into the cytoplasm generating a proton gradient. In the synthesis mode, the protomotive force is established by oxidation of NADH or succinate by the electron transport chain. Whereas much is known on the structure/function of the ATP synthase and the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis, less is known on the molecular details on the coupling of proton transport and ATP synthesis. The structure/function relationship of the ATP synthase is key to understanding the coupling mechanism; that is, identification of which intra- and intermolecular interactions within the ATP synthase critical for coupling.The ATP synthase is composed of two distinct components, the F1 and the Fo portion and as such is referred to as the F1Fo ATP synthase. The F1 portion contains the catalytic sites and is composed of α3β3γδϵ with an overall molecular mass of about 350 kDa (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The active site is composed of the αβ pair, and thus there are three catalytic sites per complex. The γδϵ-subunits comprise the central stalk with the γ-subunit situated in the middle of the α3β3 subcomplex. The central stalk acts as a rotor and drives conformational changes in the active sites in a sequential manner, thereby effecting ATP synthesis. The δ- and ϵ-subunits are critical for coupling (2Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.F. Velours J. di Rago J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but their roles are unclear, they may participate directly in the coupling process or needed merely for structural purposes.The Fo portion of the ATP synthase acts as a proton turbine whose rotation is physically coupled to the central stalk and drives its rotation. Fo is minimally composed of subunits abc10 with the c10 arranged as a cylinder within the membrane (4Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Subunit a is thought to directly participate in the proton flow while subunit b is minimally involved in the structure of the peripheral stalk. The peripheral stalk is composed of subunits b, d, h, and subunit 5 (5Carbajo R.J. Silvester J.A. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Dickson V.K. Silvester J.A. Fearnley I.M. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E.

Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21597-21601Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and acts as a stator connecting F1 with Fo thereby preventing futile rotation of F1 without ATP synthesis. Thus, simply based on the structure of the ATP synthase, these subunits are essential for either the structure, the catalytic mechanism or for the coupling mechanism. It is not certain which subunits participate directly in transforming the energy of rotation of the central stalk to the phosphorylation of ADP.There are three regions in the F1 ATPase that are highly pertinent to the coupling of the ATP synthase: the collar, Catch 1 and Catch 2 (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The collar is formed by residues in the α- and β-subunits and encircles the γ-subunit presumably to fix the axis of rotation. Catch 1 and Catch 2 are in the β-subunits and residues within form contacts with the γ-subunit, which in part, define the structure of the active site.A number of mutations have been isolated in yeast Kluyveromyces lactis that allow the cells to lose their mitochondrial DNA and as such, were named mitochondrial genome integrity (mgi) 2The abbreviations used are: mgimitochondrial genome integrityAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateTF1Thermophile F1. mutations (9Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 517-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Chen X.J.

Genet. 1998; 259: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mgi mutations were mapped to the α-, β-, or γ-subunits of the ATP synthase. Similar, if not identical, mutations were identified using a similar selection scheme in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae (13Weber E.R. Rooks R.S. Shafer K.S. Chase J.W. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 1995; 140: 435-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in a related approach using the blood form of Trypanosoma brucei (14Schnaufer A. Clark-Walker G.D. Steinberg A.G. Stuart K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). While the relationship between the effect of the mutations and the resulting phenotypes is still unclear, there is good biochemical and genetic evidence that when the corresponding mutations are present in the yeast ATP synthase, the enzyme is uncoupled (15Wang Y.

The distinction should be made that these mutations do not simply inhibit the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, but the mutations reduce the efficiency of ATP synthesis by allowing proton flow without ATP synthesis, i.e. the mutations uncouple this process.The high-resolution crystal structure of the bovine ATPase has been determined for a number of different states (1Abrahams J.P.

The mutant enzymes crystallized under similar conditions as the wild type enzyme, and as such, there are three enzyme complexes in the asymmetric unit, which represent two different states of the enzyme and thus 8 unique F1 structures. These structures represent the first crystallographic study on mutant forms of the F1 ATPase and provide the first structural insights into how mutations uncouple the ATP synthase. These studies identify critical regions within the ATP synthase that are involved in the coupling process.RESULTSThe high resolution structure of the bovine enzyme (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) established the naming convention of the three active sites in F1: DP, TP, and E, where DP refers to the ADP-bound site, TP refers to the ATP (or AMP-PNP)-bound site, and E refers to the catalytic site that has no nucleotide bound. Regardless of the occupancy of the catalytic site in the current or prior models, the naming convention is continued as the active site is distinguished by a number of other features, most principally, the relative position of the γ-subunit. The β-subunits that form the active sites are referred to as βDP, βTP, and βE with analogous convention for naming the α-subunit that pairs with the β-subunit to form the active site, αDP, αTP, and αE. The interacting α/β pair that forms the DP, TP, or E sites will be referred to as the DP, TP, or E pair.The yeast enzyme crystallized with three F1 complexes in the asymmetric unit, heretofore referred to as yF1I, yF1II, and yF1III. yF1I and yF1II are thought to represent two different catalytic states of F1 (16Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). While both yF1I and yF1II contain AMP-PNP in the DP and TP sites, yF1II has phosphate bound to the E site, which is associated with differences in the twisting of the γ-subunit. The structure of yF1II identified the residues involved in binding phosphate (16Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). yF1II likely represents the structure of the yF1 with one of the substrates for ATP synthesis, phosphate, bound to the active site.The α- and β-subunits share structural homology. Up to the first 96 residues of the α- and 80 residues of the β-subunit, comprise a β-barrel structure. The structure of the β-barrel domain does not change significantly between the different catalytic forms and thus serves as a good reference point for structural alignment. The middle core region comprises the nucleotide binding sites, noncatalytic for the α-subunit and catalytic for the β-subunit. The conformations of DP and TP catalytic sites are nearly identical, while that of the E site differs considerably. The lower third of each subunit is composed of an α-helix bundle. Many of the helices in these regions are in different positions depending on the catalytic cycle, but also tend to be most variable between various structures of the bovine and yeast F1 ATPase.Fig. 1 (and supplemental Movie S1) shows the position of the residues (αAsn67, αAla295, αPhe405, βVal279, βArg408, γThr264, and γIle270), in the structure of the wild-type F1 that were identified in the mgi selection. The relative positions of these residues and bound phosphate are shown. For reference, the collar regions are α287–299 and β272–284, Catch 1 is β309–320, and Catch 2 is β386–400.Fig. 1A, shows residue αAsn67 is in the β-barrel region of the α-subunit, which lies above the collar region. In the E and DP pairs, αAsn67 forms two H-bonds with αArg289, which is in the collar region. Fig. 1B and supplemental Movie S1, show that residues αAla295, βVal279, γIle270, and γThr264 face the E pair and not the DP or TP pairs. Residues αAla295 and γIle270 form interacting pairs, as do βVal279 and γThr264. Residues αAla295 and βVal279 are in the collar region of the F1, which is just above the Catch 1 region of the β-subunit. In the TP pair, αAla295 is adjacent to γThr264. Finally, residues αPhe405 and βArg408 (Fig. 1C) were both identified in the mgi screen and are located at the interface of the α- and β-subunits in the α-helix bundle domains. In the DP pair of yF1II, but not yF1I, the side chains of αPhe405 and βArg408 interact with each other through cation/π interaction.Four mutant forms of the yeast F1 ATPase with corresponding mgi mutations were crystallized and the structures were determined: αAsn67Ile, αPhe405Ser, βVal279Phe, and γIle270Thr. These mutations reduce, but do not eliminate, the coupling of the ATP synthase (15Wang Y. Singh U. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8228-8236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. S1 shows composite omit density map in the area surrounding each mutated residue, which supports the contention that these are indeed the mutant forms of the enzyme.The crystallographic data are presented in supplemental Table S1. The resolution of the structures varied from 2.7 Å (for αPhe405Ser) to 3.2 Å (for αAsn67Ile and γIle270Thr). Like the wild-type enzyme, the mutant forms of the enzymes crystallized in p21 space group with three F1 complexes in the asymmetric unit. As with the wild-type structure, the electron density of yF1I is better on an average than that of yF1II, and much better than that of yF1III. The structure of yF1III is similar to that of yF1I and thus, will not be discussed.Structure of Wild Type yF1I versus yF1IIIn the wild-type enzyme, the structures of yF1I and II differed in three principle ways (Summarized in supplemental Fig. S2). First, the γ-subunit is twisted by about 17° in the direction of ATP hydrolysis (based on residues 18–25 in the γ-subunit, counterclockwise as viewed from the foot of the stalk) in yF1I relative to that of yF1II. Secondly, in yF1II, phosphate is bound to βE in a site that is consistent with being the substrate binding site, and thus the structure represents a catalytic intermediate. Presumably, this structure represents the catalytic intermediate where substrate, phosphate but not ADP, is bound to the active site. It is not clear if phosphate binding induces the twisting of the γ-subunit or if the twisting of the γ-subunit promotes the binding of phosphate.A third difference between yF1I and yF1II with the wild-type enzyme is that in yF1I, the interface between the α- and β-subunits in the DP pair is more open in yF1I as compared with that of yF1II. This effect is most pronounced in the C-terminal helical domain, which contains the Catch II region. The significance of this difference is discussed later in the context of the results from this study.Structure of Mutant Forms of yF1I versus yF1IIThe structural differences between yF1I and yF1II in the structures of the wild type enzyme were not consistently observed with each of the structures of the mutant forms (Summarized in supplemental Table S2). One surprising difference is that for the mutant form of αAsn67Ile, the structures of yF1I and yF1II are similar showing little differences in the twisting in the γ-subunit and phosphate was not bound to E site of yF1II (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2). Minimally, this suggests that the crystal contacts in yF1II do not cause the differential twisting of the γ-subunit and suggests that the binding of phosphate is required for the twisting of the γ-subunit.In the structures of yF1II for both αPhe405Ser and βVal279Phe, the γ-subunit is twisted in the same manner as the wild-type γ-subunit, but phosphate is not bound to the phosphate-binding site in the E site. (There is electron density adjacent to the P-loop in yF1I and yF1II of αPhe405Ser, which could be phosphate or sulfate (supplemental Fig. S3). However, this is not in the normal phosphate binding site (16Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and its nature is unclear.) Further, the twisting of the γ-subunit in γIle270Thr of yF1II is very similar to that of yF1II of the wild-type enzyme and in this case, phosphate is bound to the E site. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphate-binding neither dictates, nor is determined by, the twisting of the γ-subunit. However, these results are all in the context of mutations that alter the coupling of the ATP synthase and the mgi mutations may have differentially affected the relationship between phosphate binding and the twisting of the γ-subunit. If correct, then this may in part, explain the uncoupling effect of some of the mgi mutations.As stated earlier, the interface between the α- and β-subunits in the DP pair in the wild-type structure is more open in yF1I as compared with that of yF1II. For comparison, the distances were measured between the Cα carbons of αPhe405 and βArg408. These residues are at the exterior and within the C-terminal helical domains and both have been identified as residues that are mutated in the mgi class of mutations (9Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 517-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. Mol. Gen Genet. 1999; 262: 898-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For the wild type enzyme, the distance in yF1I was 15.6 Å, while that in yF1II was reduced to 10.9 Å. Thus, the DP pair is more closed in yF1II as compared with yF1I, in the wild-type enzyme. The DP pairs in yF1II were also more closed for the structures of the mutant forms of βVal279Phe and γIle270Thr, but not in the structures of the mutant forms of αPhe405Ser and αAsn67Ile where the DP pairs in yF1II were more open, comparable to the DP pair in yF1I. The more open DP pair in yF1II of αPhe405Ser is not surprising, because αPhe405 interacts with βArg408 in the DP pair of yF1II and is partly responsible for the stabilization of the closed form of the DP pair in yF1II (Fig. 1C). The more open structure is also expected for the structure of the mutant form of αAsn67Ile as in this structure, yF1II is nearly identical to that of yF1I, with little difference in the twisting of the γ-subunit. Lastly, the result is consistent with the structure of the mutant form of γIle270Thr, whereas in this structure, the E site of yF1II has bound phosphate and the γ-subunit is twisted in yF1II as in the wild-type structure, i.e. the structure is largely unchanged from the wild-type structure.The DP/TP/E active sites in yF1I and the TP active sites of yF1II of the mutant structures are not altered as compared with the corresponding active sites in the wild type enzyme. Also, despite the change in the α/β interface of the DP pair in two of the mutant forms in yF1II, the DP active sites were not largely changed in comparison to those of the wild type yF1II. (There were some minor changes as discussed below.) In contrast, the structure of the E active site of yF1II shows changes in two of the structures, suggesting a role of the E site in the coupling mechanism.αAsn67Ile Alters the Phosphate Binding E Catalytic SiteαAsn67 is located at the top of F1 in the β-barrel domain and is about 7.4 Å from αLeu287 (Cα carbon to Cα carbon) located at the beginning of the collar region (Fig. 2). Residue, αAsn67 is linked to the collar by two H-bonds with αArg289, which is located at the top of the collar region of the α-subunit just after Helix D. These hydrogen bonds are present in the E and DP pairs, but not in the TP pair, and as such, the conformation of the TP pair did not change in the mutant structure of αAsn67Ile in either yF1I or yF1II. There were some structural changes in both the E and DP catalytic sites, for yF1I or yF1II, but the changes were more profound for the E site than those in the DP site. For the E catalytic site, the conformational differences were larger in yF1II than those in yF1I. Fig. 2A shows an overlap of the α- and β-subunits from yF1II from the wild-type enzyme and that of αAsn67Ile using the β-barrel domains as the reference point. While the structures of the β-subunits nearly perfectly superimposed, the α-carbons of the corresponding α-subunits were displaced. The hydrogen bonds between αAsn67/αArg289 were broken in the mutant structure, which resulted in a displacement of the α-helices in the nucleotide binding domain and the α-helical bundle (Fig. 2, B and C). The movements in the helices of the nucleotide binding domain are considered more significant than those in the α-helical bundle because these aid in forming the catalytic site at the interface of the α- and β-subunits. In the nucleotide binding domain of the α-subunit, there were shifts of 1.5 Å in Helix E immediately following the collar region and 2.0 Å in the loop that is the structural analog of Catch 1 of the β-subunit. In the E catalytic site, largely formed by the β-subunit, the shifts in the α-subunit disrupted the phosphate-binding site such that the side chain of αArg375 and βLys163 (P-loop) are disordered and the guanidinium group of βArg190 is displaced by 1.7Å (Fig. 2D). The remaining residues that contribute to phosphate-binding, βAsp256 and βArg260, are well ordered and in the same position relative to the wild-type structure. Movements in the catalytic site residues that bind phosphate may explain the absence of phosphate in the E site of yF1II.FIGURE 2Structural changes observed in the F1 structure with mgi mutation, αAsn67Ile. A shows an overlap of the E site α- and β-subunits form the wild type (gray) and αAsn67Ile structure. The α- and β-subunits of the mutant structure are shown in salmon and blue, respectively. B is a closer view showing the shifts in the position of the helix following the collar region and the region in the α-subunit that is the structural analog to the Catch 1 region of the β-subunit. The wild-type γ-subunit is colored gray, and the mutant structure is colored green. C shows the disruption of the H-bond between αAsn67 and αArg289 with the αAsn67Ile mutation. The residues are shown in stick representation with the wild type colored as defined by the atom. D shows a view of the phosphate binding site and the relative changes in the atom positions with phosphate shown in yellow. The atoms of the wild-type structure are colored as defined by the atom. The residues indicated by the arrows correspond to: αArg375, βArg190, βArg260, βAsp256, and βLys163 (P-loop) starting at the bottom and proceeding in a clockwise direction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)βVal279Phe Alters Catch 1 Interactions and the Phosphate Binding SiteResidue βVal279 is located in a loop (residues 272–284), which together with a loop in the α-subunit (residues 287–299), form a collar, which encircles the γ-subunit (supplemental Fig. S4). The collar is formed by six loops: three from the α-subunit and three from the β-subunit. The C terminus of the γ-subunit forms an α-helix, which is curved and encircled by the collar. The apexes of the six loops that form the collar are not in the same plane, but rather step into different planes as the γ-subunit rotates. The stepping movement of the loops is necessary to keep the rotation of the γ-subunit along a fixed axis since the γ-subunit is curved. The collar is a rather rigid structure as seen by the phi-psi angles, and the presence of proline residues, which suggests that the collar limits wobble during rotation of the γ-subunit.In βE of yF1II, βEVal279 forms three hydrophobic or van der Waals contacts with γIle263 and is within 3.8 Å of γGln260) (Fig. 3A). There is also a contact between the amide nitrogen of βEVal279 and the side-chain hydroxyl of γThr264 (3.1 Å), though the geometry is not ideal for a strong H-bond. These interactions likely aid in defining the structure of this region, but also define the steric limits of βEVal279 with the γ-subunit. Importantly, γThr264Ala has been identified as an mgi mutation.FIGURE 3Structural changes observed in the F1 structure with mgi mutation, βVal279Phe. A and B show the structure of the β- and γ-subunits of wild-type F1 from yF1II. A shows a position of βVal279 and the interacting residues on the γ-subunit. B shows the interactions in the Catch 2 region between the residues of the β- and γ-subunits. The atoms colored in red correspond to αArg375. C and D show an overlap of the wild type (gray) and mutant structures (green and blue) and the relative shifts in positions. The atoms colored in dark salmon correspond to αArg375. The shift in the residues eliminates the H-bonds in the Catch 1 region in the mutant structure, and phosphate is not bound in the mutant structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to the collar region, there are two regions in the β-subunit that make close contacts with the γ-subunit and these are referred to as Catch 1 and Catch 2 (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Catch 1 is located in the loop that extends from βEAla309 to βEPro320 and follows β-sheet 13 where residues in βE form H-bonds with residues in the γ-subunit: βEAsp316, βEThr318, βEAsp319 and γArg259 and γAsn256 (Fig. 3B). Also located in the loop is βETyr311, which apparently forms π-π interactions with βEPhe259. Residue, βEPhe259, is immediately adjacent to βEArg260, which forms part of the phosphate-binding site in βE (Fig. 3B) (17Kabaleeswaran V. Shen H. Symersky J. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10546-10551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a possible conformational relay in βE from the collar region to the phosphate-binding site via Catch 1.The side chain of βEVal279, is located about 3.6 Å from the side chain of βEPro320 located at the beginning the loop that contains Catch I and is adjacent to γIle263 (Fig. 3, A and B). A principal effect of the βVal279Phe mutation on the structure of the F1 ATPase is that the larger phenylalanine side chain causes a movement in the position of the γ-subunit such that the axis of the γ-subunit is translated away from the βE-subunit (Fig. 3, C and D) and in doing so, disrupts the H-bonding network between residues in Catch 1: βEAsp316 and γAsn256, βEAsp316, and γArg259, βAsp319, and γArg259, βEThr318 and γGln260 and αTPAsp355 and γArg257 (supplemental Table S3 and Movie S2). All of the H-bonds are either weakened or destroyed, as is the case for βEAsp319 and γArg259, which is moved by more than 2 Å to a distance of 5.1 Å. The H-bonding network in Catch 1 is more extensive in yF1II as compared with yF1I, but in both cases, the mutation βVal279Phe weakens or eliminates the H-bonds. The loss of the H-bonds in the Catch 1 region has an effect on the phosphate-binding site where there are movements in critical side chains involved in phosphate-binding including βEArg260 and βEAsp256. Like the αAsn67Ile mutation, the E site does not have phosphate bound, likely due to the shifts in the critical side chains involved in phosphate-binding.γIle270Thr Alters Hydrophobic Interactions at the E Pair InterfaceResidue, γIle270, is nearly at the end of the γ-subunit and lies just 2 α-helical turns from the C terminus (Figs. 1, A and B and supplemental S5). Consistent with the interactions observed with βEVal279 and the γ-subunit, γIle270 interacts with residues in the E pair, but here with αE, which is adjacent to βE. Residue, αEAla295 interacts with γIle270, which is located in the γ-subunit on the same face of the α-helix as γLeu267. The face of the α-helix in this region of the γ-subunit is hydrophobic and h"

Antisense morpholino knockdown of either gphna or gphnb alone did not disturb synaptic clusters of GlyRs in the spinal cord and did not affect touch-evoked escape behaviors. However, on knockdown of both gphna and gphnb, embryos showed impairments in GlyR clustering in the spinal cord and, as a consequence, demonstrated touch-evoked startle response behavior by contracting antagonistic muscles simultaneously, instead of displaying early coiling and late swimming behaviors, which are executed by side-to-side muscle contractions.

In addition to binding sites for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of fibronectin (Fn), a number of streptococcal FnBPs also contain an upstream region (UR) that is closely associated with an NTD-binding region; UR binds to the adjacent gelatin-binding domain (GBD) of Fn. Previously, UR was shown to be required for efficient streptococcal invasion of epithelial cells. Here we show, using a Streptococcus zooepidemicus FnBP, that the UR-binding site in GBD resides largely in the 8F19F1 module pair. We also show that UR inhibits binding of a peptide from the α1 chain of type I collagen to 8F19F1 and that UR binding to 8F1 is likely to occur through anti-parallel β-zipper formation. Thus, we propose that streptococcal proteins that contain adjacent NTD- and GBD-binding sites form a highly unusual extended tandem β-zipper that spans the two domains and mediates high affinity binding to Fn through a large intermolecular interface.

Fn is a large glycoprotein of ∼230 kDa (monomer molecular mass) which is present in human plasma in a soluble, dimeric form and in the extracellular matrix in an insoluble form. Fn has a modular structure, composed of type 1, type 2, and type 3 (F1, F2, and F3) modules that combine to form functional domains (10Hynes R. Fibronectins.

The N-terminal domain (NTD) is composed of five F1 modules (1–5F1), and the adjacent gelatin-binding domain (GBD) contains 6F11F22F27-8-9F1 (Fig. 1A). FnBPs from S. pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Borrelia burgdorferi bind to the NTD through a tandem β-zipper (12Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S.

In other words, within these FnBPs, intrinsically disordered NTD-binding bacterial repeats (FnBRs) contain short motifs that form an anti-parallel β-strand along the triple-stranded β-sheet of consecutive F1 modules in the NTD. Structural evidence for this unusual mechanism of protein-protein recognition has been provided by both NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography for all five F1 modules of the NTD and for several bacterial peptides (12Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R.

Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), BBK32 from B. burgdorferi appears to contain only one (15Raibaud S. Schwarz-Linek U. Kim J.H. Jenkins H.T. Baines E.R.

Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10546-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for a β-zipper interaction between an F1 module of the GBD and a synthetic peptide from the α1 chain of type I collagen was obtained using both NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. A crystal structure of a GBD module pair, 8F19F1, with peptide bound (17Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) revealed that the collagen peptide forms an anti-parallel β-strand along the C-terminal (E) strand of triple-stranded β-sheet of 8F1. The GBD of Fn has also been shown to be important for binding of pathogenic bacteria to Fn. Talay et al. (18Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that SfbI from S. pyogenes binds to both NTD and GBD. Binding to GBD is mediated through a spacer domain (also known as an upstream region (UR)) on SfbI adjacent to and upstream of the FnBR region. Cell invasion assays demonstrated that the SfbI UR and FnBR regions are both required for efficient invasion of streptococci into the eukaryotic cell (18Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).It is likely that bacterial peptides, in binding Fn, harness (and probably modify) its normal physiological activity. Thus, understanding the mechanism of interaction of FnBPs with Fn will lead to a better understanding not only of the role of FnBPs in infection but also of the activities of Fn itself and how they might be controlled. For example, an S. pyogenes UR-containing peptide has been shown to reduce Fn matrix polymerization (19Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23430-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and to increase turnover of Fn (20Sottile J. Chandler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and collagen I (21Shi F. Harman J. Fujiwara K. Sottile J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C1265-C1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting possible applications in reducing pathological matrix remodeling (22Chiang H.Y. Korshunov V.A. Serour A.

Vet. Res. 2004; 35: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). An FnBP from S. zooepidemicus, FnZ (Fig. 1B), has a sequence organization similar to SfbI from S. pyogenes (2Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the UR-like sequence lies between the first and second of five putative FnBRs (2Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The SfbI UR motif LAGESGET is conserved in the FnZ UR (Fig. 1C) (24Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because a similar motif is also present in the α1(I) collagen peptide (Fig. 1C), we hypothesized that bacterial peptides might bind to the GBD via the same mechanism as collagen and compete with collagen for Fn binding.The aim of this work is to determine the mechanism of binding of streptococcal FnBPs to the GBD. First, we show that a S. zooepidemicus FnZ peptide binds both 8F19F1 and GBD. Second, data are presented that support an anti-parallel β-zipper mode of binding for FnZ to 8F19F1. Last, we show that the S. zooepidemicus FnZ peptide inhibits binding of the collagen peptide to 8F19F1, presumably due to overlap of the binding sites on 8F19F1. The role of conserved residues in 8F1-binding motifs and the consequences of the proximity of the NTD- and GBD-binding sites in the streptococcal proteins for the structure of Fn are also discussed.DISCUSSIONUR sequences are found in FnBPs from pathogenic streptococci (2Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and in BBK32, an FnBP from B. burgdorferi (2Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Probert W.S. Kim J.H. Höök M. Johnson B.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The UR binding site in SfbI from S. pyogenes had been located to the GBD (18Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we localized the FnZ UR binding site within GBD by showing that it binds primarily to the 8F19F1 module pair.We were unable to determine the structure of the 8F19F1-FnZ peptide complex using either NMR spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography. However, by close comparison of the UR and collagen peptide sequences with previously identified F1-binding motifs from S. aureus and S. pyogenes FnBRs and the available F1 module-peptide structures (Fig. 5), it is possible to understand the role of conserved residues in the 8F1-binding motif of UR. For example, the glycine residue in the GET (UR) or GER (collagen peptide) appears to be conserved to avoid a steric clash with Trp553 in the E-strand of 8F1 (Fig. 5A). This is similar to the role of a conserved glycine residue in S. aureus FnBR 3F1-binding motifs (Fig. 5A) (14Bingham R.J. Rudiño-Piñera E. Meenan N.A. Schwarz-Linek U. Turkenburg J.P. Höök M. Garman E.F. Potts J.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12254-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) because the E-strand of 3F1 contains a tryptophan side chain in a similar orientation to the 8F1 E-strand tryptophan (Fig. 5). This E-strand tryptophan residue is not conserved in 2F1, so here the equivalent peptide residue in the FnBR is the glutamate of the EDT motif (Fig. 5B), which forms a salt bridge with an arginine residue in the C-strand of the F1 module (Fig. 5A). In the collagen peptide-8F19F1 structure, due to the requirement for the glycine, this interaction is shifted two residues along the peptide and is formed by the glutamine in GQR (Fig. 5A) and thus in UR by the glutamate in GES. In 3F1-binding motifs, there is no equivalent negatively charged or polar residue to interact with the C-strand arginine, and in isolation, this motif binds 3F1 only very weakly (13Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In 2F1 binding, the aspartate of the EDT makes polar contacts with an arginine in the loop between the D and E strands. The sequence of this loop is very similar in 8F1, and the glutamate in the collagen peptide GER makes a similar interaction (Fig. 5A) as, we suggest, does the glutamate in the GET in UR. The 3F1-binding motif lacks the negatively charged residue that could interact with the lysine residue in the D-E loop of 3F1. We predict that the threonine in the GET UR motif interacts with backbone atoms in the B-strand and D-E loop of the F1 module (as observed for homologous hydroxyl-containing residues in 2F1- and 4F1-binding motifs from S. aureus FnBPA (14Bingham R.J. Rudiño-Piñera E. Meenan N.A. Schwarz-Linek U. Turkenburg J.P. Höök M. Garman E.F. Potts J.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12254-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)). The leucine in the LAG (UR) sequence is likely to be involved in hydrophobic contacts similar to those previously observed for the leucine in the LPG sequence in the collagen peptide (17Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The role of the glycine in these motifs is less clear and will require further investigation.FIGURE 5Comparison of F1-binding motifs and the role of conserved residues.

Fig. 6 shows a model of the 70-kDa region of Fn that contains both the NTD and GBD and the sequence of UR FnZ-2 (Fig. 1C). The binding sites for F1 modules in the FnZ sequence are indicated, based on our previous work studying homologous proteins from S. pyogenes (12Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R.

What is immediately striking is that there are only four residues between the most N-terminal 5F1-binding residue and the most C-terminal 8F1-binding residue based on crystal structures of S. aureus FnBPA-1 and FnBPA-5 peptides in complex with 4F15F1 (14Bingham R.J. Rudiño-Piñera E. Meenan N.A. Schwarz-Linek U. Turkenburg J.P. Höök M. Garman E.F. Potts J.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.

Vakonakis I. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, as suggested previously by the hairpin arrangement of modules in the solution structure of 6F11F22F2 (32Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the GBD modules appear to have a non-linear arrangement in the complex. In fact, the FnZ sequence suggests that the 70-kDa (NTD + GBD) fragment of Fn presents a surface that is largely composed of F1 modules from both the NTD and GBD and that streptococcal FnBPs bind across this surface through a highly extended tandem β-zipper, forming a large protein-protein interface.FIGURE 6Model of the 70-kDa (NTD + GBD) domain of Fn in complex with FnZ(370–428) highlighting the unusual extended tandem β-zipper proposed to form across NTD and GBD. The locations of F1-binding motifs in FnZ based on previous data from SfbI-Fn and FnBPA-Fn interactions and from data in the current work are indicated. The question marks indicate that the location of the binding site on 9F1 is uncertain, as is the conformation of the four residues (purple) between the 5F1 and 8F1-binding motifs.

The precise molecular mechanism of this effect is unknown. We and others (15Raibaud S. Schwarz-Linek U. Kim J.H. Jenkins H.T. Baines E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Potts J.R. J. Biol.

The NTD has been implicated in such intramolecular interactions and was shown recently to interact with F3 modules (26Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Ellis I.R. Sarkies P. Flanagan A. Schor A.M. Schor S.L.

It is less clear whether the GBD modules are involved in intramolecular interactions outside the GBD, but the high affinity and large intermolecular interface formed by FnBPs that bind both the NTD and GBD might be particularly efficient in disrupting intramolecular Fn-Fn interactions. In addition, the suggestion that IGD sequences within the GBD of Fn might bind to the αvβ3 integrin (34Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) means that UR binding to the GBD could have a more direct effect on the cell binding activity of Fn.We showed (Fig. 4) that the FnZ peptide inhibited binding of a peptide from the α1 chain of type I collagen to 8F19F1. Further work would be required to determine if FnBPs can inhibit intact collagen-Fn interactions. Recently, it was shown that collagen I matrix turnover is regulated by Fn (21Shi F. Harman J. Fujiwara K. Sottile J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C1265-C1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction between polymerized Fn and collagen stabilizes collagen within the extracellular matrix and reduces endocytosis and degradation of collagen. pUR4, a GBD/NTD-binding region from SfbI with homology to FnZ (Fig. 1C), inhibits Fn polymerization and enhances collagen endocytosis and degradation (21Shi F. Harman J. Fujiwara K. Sottile J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C1265-C1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The identification of the UR binding site within GBD and of the role of conserved residues will aid further studies of the function of the GBD in both physiological and pathological processes involving Fn and how bacterial FnBPs might modify or exploit these functions during infection.

Fn has a modular structure, composed of type 1, type 2, and type 3 (F1, F2, and F3) modules that combine to form functional domains (10Hynes R. Fibronectins.

The N-terminal domain (NTD) is composed of five F1 modules (1–5F1), and the adjacent gelatin-binding domain (GBD) contains 6F11F22F27-8-9F1 (Fig. 1A). FnBPs from S. pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Borrelia burgdorferi bind to the NTD through a tandem β-zipper (12Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S.

In other words, within these FnBPs, intrinsically disordered NTD-binding bacterial repeats (FnBRs) contain short motifs that form an anti-parallel β-strand along the triple-stranded β-sheet of consecutive F1 modules in the NTD. Structural evidence for this unusual mechanism of protein-protein recognition has been provided by both NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography for all five F1 modules of the NTD and for several bacterial peptides (12Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R.

Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), BBK32 from B. burgdorferi appears to contain only one (15Raibaud S. Schwarz-Linek U. Kim J.H. Jenkins H.T. Baines E.R.

Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10546-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for a β-zipper interaction between an F1 module of the GBD and a synthetic peptide from the α1 chain of type I collagen was obtained using both NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. A crystal structure of a GBD module pair, 8F19F1, with peptide bound (17Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) revealed that the collagen peptide forms an anti-parallel β-strand along the C-terminal (E) strand of triple-stranded β-sheet of 8F1. The GBD of Fn has also been shown to be important for binding of pathogenic bacteria to Fn. Talay et al. (18Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that SfbI from S. pyogenes binds to both NTD and GBD. Binding to GBD is mediated through a spacer domain (also known as an upstream region (UR)) on SfbI adjacent to and upstream of the FnBR region. Cell invasion assays demonstrated that the SfbI UR and FnBR regions are both required for efficient invasion of streptococci into the eukaryotic cell (18Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).It is likely that bacterial peptides, in binding Fn, harness (and probably modify) its normal physiological activity. Thus, understanding the mechanism of interaction of FnBPs with Fn will lead to a better understanding not only of the role of FnBPs in infection but also of the activities of Fn itself and how they might be controlled. For example, an S. pyogenes UR-containing peptide has been shown to reduce Fn matrix polymerization (19Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Vet. Res. 2004; 35: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). An FnBP from S. zooepidemicus, FnZ (Fig. 1B), has a sequence organization similar to SfbI from S. pyogenes (2Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the UR-like sequence lies between the first and second of five putative FnBRs (2Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The SfbI UR motif LAGESGET is conserved in the FnZ UR (Fig. 1C) (24Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because a similar motif is also present in the α1(I) collagen peptide (Fig. 1C), we hypothesized that bacterial peptides might bind to the GBD via the same mechanism as collagen and compete with collagen for Fn binding.The aim of this work is to determine the mechanism of binding of streptococcal FnBPs to the GBD. First, we show that a S. zooepidemicus FnZ peptide binds both 8F19F1 and GBD. Second, data are presented that support an anti-parallel β-zipper mode of binding for FnZ to 8F19F1. Last, we show that the S. zooepidemicus FnZ peptide inhibits binding of the collagen peptide to 8F19F1, presumably due to overlap of the binding sites on 8F19F1. The role of conserved residues in 8F1-binding motifs and the consequences of the proximity of the NTD- and GBD-binding sites in the streptococcal proteins for the structure of Fn are also discussed."

Non-surgical methods for cataract prevention are still elusive. We have genetically tested whether enhanced lens gap junction communication, provided by increased α3 connexin (Cx46) proteins expressed from α8(Kiα3) knock-in alleles in Gja8tm1(Gja3)Tww mice, could prevent nuclear cataracts caused by the γB-crystallin S11R mutation in CrygbS11R/S11R mice. Remarkably, homozygous knock-in α8(Kiα3/Kiα3) mice fully prevented nuclear cataracts, while single knock-in α8(Kiα3/−) allele mice showed variable suppression of nuclear opacities in CrygbS11R/S11R mutant mice. Cataract prevention was correlated with the suppression of many pathological processes, including crystallin degradation and fiber cell degeneration, as well as preservation of normal calcium levels and stable actin filaments in the lens. This work demonstrates that enhanced intercellular gap junction communication can effectively prevent or delay nuclear cataract formation and suggests that small metabolites transported through gap junction channels protect the stability of crystallin proteins and the cytoskeletal structures in the lens core. Thus, the use of an array of small molecules to promote lens homeostasis may become a feasible non-surgical approach for nuclear cataract prevention in the future."

Because gain-of-function mutations of BRAF can transform fibroblasts, we examined BRAF in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. The strong gain-of-function mutation, V600R, of BRAF found in melanomas and other cancers was identified in first passage synovial fibroblasts from two of nine rheumatoid arthritis patients and confirmed by restriction site mapping. BRAF-specific siRNA inhibited proliferation of synovial fibroblasts with V600R mutations. A BRAF aberrant splice variant with an intact kinase domain and partial loss of the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain was identified in fibroblasts from an additional patient, and fibroblast proliferation was inhibited by BRAF-specific siRNA. Our finding is the first to establish mechanisms for fibroblast transformation responsible for destruction of articular cartilage and bone in rheumatoid arthritis and establishes a new target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2119219792,"Background Model-based analyses, conducted within a decision analytic framework, provide a systematic way to combine information about the natural history of disease and effectiveness of clinical management strategies with demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the population. Among the challenges with disease-specific modeling include the need to identify influential assumptions and to assess the face validity and internal consistency of the model. Methods and Findings We describe a series of exercises involved in adapting a computer-based simulation model of HIV disease to the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort and assess model performance as we re-parameterized the model to address policy questions in the U.S. relevant to HIV-infected women using data from the WIHS. Empiric calibration targets included 24-month survival curves stratified by treatment status and CD4 cell count. The most influential assumptions in untreated women included chronic HIV-associated mortality following an opportunistic infection, and in treated women, the ‘clinical effectiveness’ of HAART and the ability of HAART to prevent HIV complications independent of virologic suppression. Good-fitting parameter sets required reductions in the clinical effectiveness of 1st and 2nd line HAART and improvements in 3rd and 4th line regimens. Projected rates of treatment regimen switching using the calibrated cohort-specific model closely approximated independent analyses published using data from the WIHS. Conclusions The model demonstrated good internal consistency and face validity, and supported cohort heterogeneities that have been reported in the literature. Iterative assessment of model performance can provide information about the relative influence of uncertain assumptions and provide insight into heterogeneities within and between cohorts. Description of calibration exercises can enhance the transparency of disease-specific models."
https://openalex.org/W2062067141,"Background In June of 2009, the World Health Organization declared the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, and by July, New York City's New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) experienced a heavy burden of cases, attributable to a novel strain of the virus (H1N1pdm). Methods and Results We present the signs in the NYPH electronic health records (EHR) that distinguished the 2009 pandemic from previous seasonal influenza outbreaks via various statistical analyses. These signs include (1) an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with influenza, (2) a preponderance of influenza diagnoses outside of the normal flu season, and (3) marked vaccine failure. The NYPH EHR also reveals distinct age distributions of patients affected by seasonal influenza and the pandemic strain, and via available longitudinal data, suggests that the two may be associated with distinct sets of comorbid conditions as well. In particular, we find significantly more pandemic flu patients with diagnoses associated with asthma and underlying lung disease. We further observe that the NYPH EHR is capable of tracking diseases at a resolution as high as particular zip codes in New York City. Conclusion The NYPH EHR permits early detection of pandemic influenza and hypothesis generation via identification of those significantly associated illnesses. As data standards develop and databases expand, EHRs will contribute more and more to disease detection and the discovery of novel disease associations."
https://openalex.org/W2070872421,"Several clinical studies have shown that, relative to disease progression, HIV-1 isolates that are less fit are also less pathogenic. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between viral fitness and control of viral load (VL) in acute and early HIV-1 infection. Samples were obtained from subjects participating in two clinical studies. In the PULSE study, antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated before, or no later than six months following seroconversion. Subjects then underwent multiple structured treatment interruptions (STIs). The PHAEDRA study enrolled and monitored a cohort of individuals with documented evidence of primary infection. The subset chosen were individuals identified no later than 12 months following seroconversion to HIV-1, who were not receiving ART. The relative fitness of primary isolates obtained from study participants was investigated ex vivo. Viral DNA production was quantified using a novel real time PCR assay. Following intermittent ART, the fitness of isolates obtained from 5 of 6 PULSE subjects decreased over time. In contrast, in the absence of ART the fitness of paired isolates obtained from 7 of 9 PHAEDRA subjects increased over time. However, viral fitness did not correlate with plasma VL. Most unexpected was the high relative fitness of isolates obtained at Baseline from PULSE subjects, before initiating ART. It is widely thought that the fitness of strains present during the acute phase is low relative to strains present during chronic HIV-1 infection, due to the bottleneck imposed upon transmission. The results of this study provide evidence that the relative fitness of strains present during acute HIV-1 infection may be higher than previously thought. Furthermore, that viral fitness may represent an important clinical parameter to be considered when deciding whether to initiate ART during early HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2063417360,"CPD1 (also known as ANP32-E) belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved acidic proteins with leucine rich repeats implicated in a variety of cellular processes regulating gene expression, vesicular trafficking, intracellular signaling and apoptosis. Because of its spatiotemporal expression pattern, CPD1 has been proposed to play an important role in brain morphogenesis and synaptic development.We have generated CPD1 knock-out mice that we have subsequently characterized. These mice are viable and fertile. However, they display a subtle neurological clasping phenotype and mild motor deficits.CPD1 is not essential for normal development; however, it appears to play a role in the regulation of fine motor functions. The minimal phenotype suggests compensatory biological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2167413952,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that couple ATP binding/hydrolysis with the transport of hydrophilic substrates across lipid barriers. Deletion of Phe-670 in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the yeast ABC transporter, Yor1p, perturbs interdomain associations, reduces functionality, and hinders proper transport to the plasma membrane. Functionality of Yor1p-ΔF was restored upon co-expression of a peptide containing wild-type NBD1. To gain insight into the biogenesis of this important class of proteins, we defined the requirements for this rescue. We show that a misfolding lesion in NBD1 of the full-length protein is a prerequisite for functional rescue by exogenous NBD1, which is mediated by physical replacement of the dysfunctional domain by the soluble NBD1. This association does not restore trafficking of Yor1p-ΔF but instead confers catalytic activity to the small population of Yor1p-ΔF that escapes to the plasma membrane. An important coupling between the exogenous NBD1 and ICL4 within full-length aberrant Yor1p-ΔF is required for functional rescue but not for the physical interaction between the two polypeptides. Together, our genetic and biochemical data reveal that it is possible to modulate activity of ABC transporters by physically replacing dysfunctional domains."
