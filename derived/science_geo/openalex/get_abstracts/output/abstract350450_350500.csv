However, the precise signaling mechanisms of ATP-induced apoptosis remain to be elucidated. Here we showed that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a critical role in ATP-induced apoptosis. p38 activation and apoptosis in macrophages were induced by ATP. ATP-induced apoptosis was mediated in part by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from NOX2/gp91phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex expressed in macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, ATP-induced ROS generation, p38 activation, and apoptosis were almost completely inhibited by selective P2X7 receptor antagonists. We also found that ATP-induced apoptosis were diminished in ASK1-deficient macrophages accompanied by the lack of p38 activation. These results demonstrate that ROS-mediated activation of the ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway downstream of P2X7 receptor is required for ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages.

To date, the ability of extracellular ATP at high concentrations (millimolar range) to kill cells is well established, especially toward cells of hematopoietic lineage such as macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes (1Hogquist K.A.

Immunol. 1990; 145: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP mainly activates two cell surface receptors, P2Y and P2X purinoceptors. Whereas P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled heptahelical receptors, P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels (3North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin.

P2X family members possess two cytoplasmic domains at the N and C termini and one extracellular ligand binding region in between two putative transmembrane domains and form functional homo/hetero-oligomeric channel complexes. P2X7 receptor, one of the P2X family members, is activated by higher concentrations of ATP than other members, and functions not only as a nonselective cation channel but also as a nonselective pore permeable to small molecules up to 900 Da (4Di Virgilio F.

Although several studies have previously shown that P2X7 receptor is involved in ATP-induced apoptosis, the precise mechanisms by which ATP-activated P2X7 receptor induces apoptosis has remained elusive.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). Each member of NOX family proteins shows a distinct cellular and tissue distribution pattern and is thought to play specific roles through ROS production, although they share structural similarities with six transmembrane domains and NADPH- and FAD-binding domains in their cytoplasmic region (14Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar). For instance, NOX2 is highly expressed in phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages and plays pivotal roles for bacterial infection (15Bokoch G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Activated NOX2 generates ROS such as superoxide (O2·¯) and H2O2 in the phagosome including invasive microorganisms, which induce ROS-dependent killing of them. On the other hand, NOX-dependent ROS production sometimes kills cells themselves because ROS serve as a proapoptotic trigger. Indeed, a large number of reports have demonstrated cell death including apoptosis in response to NOX activation (14Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar). However, the precise signaling pathway by which NOX activation induces apoptosis is poorly understood.

Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). ASK1 is a member of the MAP3K family that activates both the MKK4/MKK7-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 pathways (17Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K.

Toxicol. 2008; 48: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was shown that apoptosis induced by various types of stress, such as ROS and endoplasmic reticulum stress, is mediated in part by the activation of the ASK1-JNK/p38 pathway (19Saitoh M.

However, the individual roles of JNK and p38 remain to be clarified in different cell types and conditions. In the present study, we found that activation of ASK1 by ROS constitutes a major signaling pathway for ATP-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, p38 but not JNK activity was required for ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Our data indicate that ROS-mediated activation of ASK1-p38 pathway downstream of P2X7 receptor is required for ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Mice—The generation of ASK1-deficient (Map3k5-/-) mice has been described (20Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility and were used for experiments at 8–12 weeks of age. Age-matched mice were used for all of the experiments. Map3k5-/- mice were back-crossed onto the C57BL/6J strain for 20 generations. All of the experiments were in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan). Reagents—ATP, UTP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP), Brilliant Blue G (BBG), and rotenone were purchased from Sigma. Apocynin, KN62, KN93, SB202190, and SB202474 were purchased from Calbiochem. z-VAD-fmk, H2O2, SB203580 and SP600125 were purchased from Peptide Institute Inc., Wako, Promega, and Biomol International, respectively. Cell Culture—Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells and HEK293A cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (HEPES modification) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Spleen-derived macrophages (SDMs) were generated in vitro from mouse spleen as described previously (23Naito A. Azuma S. Tanaka S. Miyazaki T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, the splenocytes were flushed from either ASK1+/+ or ASK1-/- mice spleen. The cells were plated and cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 10 ng/ml of macrophage colony stimulating factor (Peprotech). Medium was changed after 3 and 5 days of culture, and the cells were subjected to experiments after 6 days of culture. DNA Fragmentation Assay—RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 15 min and incubated with ATP or H2O2 for 6 h at 37 °C. Stimulated cells (both floating and adherent) were collected and suspended with 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing DNA cleavage products were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 42 °C. DNA fragments were purified with phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and separated on an ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml)-containing 2% agarose gel. Immunoblot Analysis—The cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150 units/ml of aprotinin. After centrifugation, the cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (21Noguchi T. Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Saegusa K. Nakano H. Gohda J. Inoue J. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37033-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with antibodies to phospho-ASK1 (24Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology), P2X7 (Y-14), p38 (C-20), NOX2 (C-15) (Santa Cruz), β-actin, and FLAG (M2) (Sigma). The blots were developed with ECL (GE Healthcare). FACS Analysis—For measurement of ROS generation, RAW264.7 cells were incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) (Wako) for 30 min and then treated with ATP. The cells were scraped from the culture dishes and dispersed by pipetting as mild as possible to avoid mechanical damages to the cells. Fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry with the excitation wavelength at 488 nm and the emission wavelength at 580. For annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, RAW264.7 cells were treated with ATP and then labeled with annexin V-FITC and PI for 15 min. Fluorescent cells were detected by FACScalibur (BD Biosciences), and apoptotic cells were analyzed by using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Bioimaging of ROS—RAW264.7 cells were seeded onto a glass-bottomed dish (MATSUNAMI). For the detection of ROS, the cells were pretreated with 20 μm hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF) (25Setsukinai K. Urano Y. Kakinuma K. Majima H.J. Nagano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3170-3175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) (Daiichi Pure Chemicals) for 20 min and then treated with ATP. The fluorescence images were acquired with an LSM510 confocal laser scanning unit coupled to an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope with a Plan-Apochromat lens with a 63× and 1.4 objective (Carl Zeiss). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the emission was filtered with a 505–530-nm barrier filter. RNA Interference—Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) for mouse P2X7 receptor and NOX2 were purchased from Qiagen (HP GenomeWide siRNA, s100197330) and Invitrogen (Stealth Select RNAi, MSS203387 (NOX2 #1) and MSS203388 (NOX2 #2)), respectively. Stealth RNAi Negative CTL (Invitrogen) was used as a control. RAW264.7 cells that were seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with 100 pmol/well of siRNA using 4 μl/well of LipofectamineRNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were retransfected with the same procedure as the first transfection. After 48 h, the cells were treated with or without 0.5 or 1 mm ATP and were subjected to immunoblot or FACS analysis. Constructions—Full-length mouse P2X7 was cloned by a PCR. cDNA prepared from total RNA of RAW264.7 cells was used as a template. FLAG-P2X7 and FLAG-P2X7ΔC (which was truncated to 418 amino acids) were generated by PCR using mouse full-length P2X7 cDNA as a template and inserted into pcDNA3. All of the PCRs were carried out using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Immunostaining—HEK293A cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with TBS-T solution (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 137 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-FLAG antibody (M2: Sigma) was used as a primary antibody and visualized with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes). Hoechst 33258 was used for nuclear staining. The images were acquired by confocal microscopy (LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss). Caspase-3 Activity—SDMs were stimulated with ATP or H2O2 for 6 h at 37 °C, and the activities of caspase-3 were measured using CPP32/Caspase-3 fluorometric protease assay kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measurement of Apoptosis—SDMs were stimulated with ATP or H2O2 for 6 h at 37 °C, and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments were determined quantitatively using Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ATP and H2O2 Induce Apoptosis in Murine Macrophage Cells—To explore the roles of extracellular ATP, we first examined whether ATP induces apoptosis in macrophages. Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells treated with ATP showed DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1A, lane 1). ATP-induced apoptosis has been reported to be mediated by the activation of caspase-3 or caspase-8 (26Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We confirmed that pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk suppressed ATP-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1A, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3) and that caspase-3 activity was increased in RAW264.7 cells treated with ATP (Fig. 1B). We also found that H2O2 induced DNA fragmentation in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 4). H2O2 also induced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1B), and H2O2- and ATP-induced DNA fragmentation was similarly inhibited by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1A, lane 4 versus lanes 5 and 6). These results suggested that ATP and H2O2 induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in macrophages. ATP and H2O2 Induce Apoptosis via p38 but Not JNK Pathway—Because JNK plays critical roles in stress-induced apoptosis, we examined whether JNK is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. H2O2-induced DNA fragmentation was not suppressed by a JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 1C, lane 6 versus lane 10), whereas it was strongly reduced by two different p38 inhibitors, SB202190 and SB203580 (Fig. 1C, lane 6 versus lanes 7 and 8). SB202474, an inactive analog of SB202190 and SB203580, did not suppress DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1C, lane 9). These results suggested that the p38 pathway was required for H2O2-induced apoptosis in macrophages. In addition, we found that apoptosis induced by ATP was also inhibited by the inhibitors of p38 but not of JNK (Fig. 1C, lane 1 versus lanes 2–5). This p38 inhibitor-specific inhibition of ATP-induced apoptosis was further supported by quantitative analysis using FACS after staining with annexin V-FITC and PI (Fig. 1D). Upon ATP treatment, main population of cells shifted from the annexin (-)/PI (-) fraction (lower left panel) to the annexin (+)/PI (-) fraction (lower right panel) that represented the early apoptotic phase, which was reduced by the inhibitor of p38 but not of JNK. In this experiment, however, we could not completely avoid mechanically caused death of certain population of cells (the annexin (+)/PI (+) fraction; upper right panel) during the preparation of dispersed cells samples appropriate for FACS analysis because RAW264.7 cells tightly adhere to each other and to culture dishes. Microscopic examination of the annexin/PI-stained cells also indicated that ATP induced p38-dependent apoptosis but not necrosis, which could be readily induced by nigericin, an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (Fig. 1E). These results excluded the possibility that the annexin/PI double positive cells seen in untreated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1D) already existed prior to the treatment with ATP. Moreover, p38 activation in RAW264.7 cells treated with ATP and H2O2 was similar in the intensities and kinetics (Fig. 1F), suggesting that both ATP and H2O2 induced apoptosis through a similar signaling pathway. ROS Mediates ATP-induced Apoptosis—Because it has recently been reported that ATP activates ROS-dependent oxidative stress response (27Pfeiffer Z.A. Guerra A.N. Hill L.M. Gavala M.L. Prabhu U. Aga M. Hall D.J. Bertics P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Cruz C.M. Rinna A. Forman H.J. Ventura A.L. Persechini P.M. Ojcius D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2871-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), we investigated whether ROS generation was required for ATP-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with antioxidant propyl gallate blocked DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2, and it also reduced ATP-induced DNA fragmentation, although the inhibitory effect of propyl gallate on DNA fragmentation induced by ATP was weaker than on that induced by H2O2 (Fig. 2A). In addition, pretreatment with another antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) partially but substantially inhibited ATP-induced apoptosis as measured by annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ATP-induced apoptosis depended at least in part on ROS. We also found that ATP-induced p38 activation was strongly inhibited by pretreatment with NAC (Fig. 2C). Intriguingly, inhibitory effects of NAC appeared to be stronger on p38 activation than on apoptosis induced by ATP, suggesting that ATP-induced p38 activation was highly dependent on ROS. To assess a direct interaction between ATP and ROS, we examined whether ATP causes ROS generation. By using ROS selective fluorescence probe HPF, we detected ROS production in RAW264.7 cells treated with ATP (Fig. 2D). ATP-induced ROS production was also detected by using another ROS probe DCHF-DA as measured by FACS (Fig. 2E). These data indicated that ROS production was involved in ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages. ATP-mediated ROS Generation Depends on NADPH Oxidase—To identify where ATP-induced ROS was generated, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors of two representative ROS generators, NADPH oxidase and the mitochondria (14Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar, 29Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Apocynin has been shown to interfere with the function of NADPH oxidase, which generates ROS at the plasma membrane and serves as a major source of ROS toward extracellular environment (14Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar, 29Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol.

Dijkman J.H. Verhoeven A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ROS are generated during the transition of electrons from the NADPH-CoQ reductase (complex I) to the cytochrome c reductase (complex III) (31Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2005; 70: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Rotenone, a competitive inhibitor of complex I, effectively blocks ROS generation in the mitochondria. When we pretreated cells with apocynin, we found that ATP-induced ROS generation and p38 activation were reduced (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, we could not detect any inhibitory effect of rotenone on ATP-induced ROS production (data not shown). Furthermore, rotenone failed to inhibit ATP-induced p38 activation. The basal activity of p38 was even increased in the presence of rotenone by an unknown cause (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that NADPH oxidase was required for ATP-mediated ROS generation, although the potential involvement of mitochondrial ROS could not be completely eliminated. NOX2 Is Required for ATP-induced ROS Generation and Apoptosis—NOX family members are transmembrane enzymes that transport electrons across biological membranes to reduce oxygen to superoxide. NOX2 is known as a phagocyte NADPH oxidase highly expressed in phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages. We therefore examined whether NOX2 is responsible for ATP-induced ROS production in macrophages. When RAW264.7 cells were transfected with either two independent siRNAs for NOX2 gene (NOX2 #1 and NOX2 #2), we found that NOX2 expression was strongly impaired (Fig. 3D). In these NOX2 knockdown cells, ATP-induced p38 activation was found to be reduced. Importantly, knockdown of NOX2 reduced ATP-induced ROS production (Fig. 3E), suggesting that NOX2 was one of the major NADPH oxidases that contributed to ATP-mediated ROS production in RAW264.7 cells. Consistent with these findings, ATP-induced apoptosis was also reduced in NOX2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3F). These results suggested that NOX2 was required for ATP-induced ROS production and apoptosis. ATP-induced Apoptosis and p38 Activation Are Mediated by P2X7 Receptor—Extracellular ATP activates cell surface P2 purinoceptors, which trigger intracellular signal transduction (5North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that P2X7 receptor mainly mediates ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages (10Coutinho-Silva R.

ATP-induced DNA fragmentation was abrogated by pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with KN62 and BBG, which are antagonists against P2X7 receptors (Fig. 4A, lane 1 versus lanes 2–5) (34Hibell A.D. Thompson K.M. Xing M. Humphrey P.P. Michel A.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 947-957PubMed Google Scholar). FACS analysis after staining with annexin V-FITC and PI shown in Fig. 4B also revealed that ATP-dependent apoptosis was suppressed by pretreatment with KN62 or BBG. Although KN62 also works as a selective Ca2+/calmodurin-dependent kinase II inhibitor, another Ca2+/calmodurin-dependent kinase II inhibitor KN93 did not attenuate ATP-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Therefore, KN62 appeared to block ATP-induced apoptosis by mainly antagonizing P2X7 receptor. These results suggested that P2X7 receptor was required for ATP-induced apoptosis. To more directly assess the requirement of P2X7 receptor for ATP-induced apoptosis, we performed knockdown analysis of P2X7 receptor in RAW264.7 cells (the efficiency of knockdown was evaluated by immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 4F). We found that ATP-induced apoptosis was reduced in P2X7 knockdown cells (Fig. 4C), demonstrating again the requirement of P2X7 receptor for ATP-induced apoptosis. Next we investigated whether P2X7 receptor mediates p38 activation. BzATP is a more potent agonist for P2X7 receptor than ATP (9Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar), whereas UTP serves as an agonist for several P2Y receptors such as P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 (3North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). 300 μm BzATP and 3 mm ATP, but not 3 mm UTP, strongly activated p38 to a similar extent in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4D). In addition, ATP-induced p38 activation was abrogated in the cells pretreated with KN62 or BBG (Fig. 4E) and transfected with siRNA for P2X7 receptor (Fig. 4F). These results indicated that P2X7 receptor was required for ATP-induced p38 activation and apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, ATP-induced ROS production was inhibited by the treatment of cells with KN62 (Fig. 4G). Taken together, P2X7 receptor appeared to serve as a critical regulator of ROS production and p38, both of which were required for ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages. The C-terminal Cytoplasmic Region of P2X7 Receptor Is Required for ATP-induced p38 Activation—P2X7 receptor possesses a longer intracellular domain on its C-terminal compared with other P2X receptor family members. The C-terminal of P2X7 receptor is known to regulate the unique ability to form a large pore and to induce apoptosis (9Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 35Cheewatrakoolpong B. Gilchrest H. Anthes J.C. Greenfeder S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because the activation of p38 was important for apoptosis as shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), we examined whether the C-terminal region of P2X7 receptor is required to induce p38 activation. We then used HEK293A cells that were transiently transfected with FLAG-P2X7 or its C-terminal deletion mutant FLAG-P2X7ΔCto assess the requirement of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. In the FLAG-P2X7-transfected cells, ATP strongly induced p38 activation compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4H). On the other hand, p38 was not activated by ATP in FLAG-P2X7ΔC-transfected cells, although this mutant form of P2X7 was expressed on cell surface like FLAG-P2X7 as determined by immunostaining (Fig. 4I). These results suggested that the C-terminal region of P2X7 receptor was required for ATP-induced p38 activation. ASK1 Is Required for ATP-induced Apoptosis in Macrophages—We revealed that p38 activation mediated by ROS was required for ATP-induced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. However, the upstream signaling pathway of p38 remains to be elucidated. To date, we have shown that ASK1, a stress-responsive MAP3K, plays pivotal roles in ROS-induced JNK and p38 activations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and neuronal cells (16Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To examine whether ASK1 serves as an upstream kinase of p38 in an ATP-induced apoptosis signaling pathway in macrophages, we investigated ASK1 and p38 activations in ASK1+/+ and ASK1-/- mouse SDMs. Treatment with ATP or H2O2 clearly induced ASK1 activation in SDMs derived from ASK1+/+ but not ASK1-/- mice (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, p38 activation induced by ATP as well as H2O2 was strongly reduced in ASK1-/- SDMs as compared with ASK1+/+ cells (Fig. 5B). Finally, we examined whether ASK1 is required for ATP- and H2O2-induced apoptosis in SDMs by using several apoptotic indexes. Caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5C) and histone-associated DNA fragment quantity (Fig. 5D) were significantly higher in SDMs derived from ASK1+/+ than ASK1-/- mice, suggesting that ATP- and H2O2-induced apoptosis were ASK1-dependent. Because the expression level of P2X7 receptor (Fig. 5E) and the ROS production (Fig. 5F) in ASK1+/+ and ASK1-/- were indistinguishable, suppression of ATP-induced apoptosis in ASK1-/- SDMs was most likely due to the attenuation of ASK1-p38 signaling. These results demonstrate that the ASK1-p38 pathway is required at least in part for ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Although it has been shown that ATP induces apoptosis by activating caspases in macrophages (26Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), little is known about the relationship between ATP-induced apoptosis and the MAPKs. In the present study, we found that p38 activation via P2X7 receptor was required for ATP-induced apoptosis (Figs. 1 and 4). Several groups have shown that p38 was activated by stimulation of P2X7 receptor (7Suzuki T. Hide I. Ido K. Kohsaka S. Inoue K. Nakata Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 36Donnelly-Roberts D.L. Namovic M.T. Faltynek C.R. Jarvis M.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report that ATP-induced p38 activation leads to apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that ATP triggers ROS production and that ROS was required for ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Considering that ATP-induced apoptosis was not completely inhibited by antioxidants such as propyl gallate and NAC (Fig. 2, A and B), however, the ROS-independent signaling pathway(s) may also operate in ATP-induced apoptosis. Elucidation of such ROS-independent pathway(s) would be informative for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of ATP-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, it was intriguing that ATP-induced p38 activation was almost completely inhibited by pretreatment with NAC (Fig. 2C), suggesting that ROS is critically involved in the ATP-induced p38 activation. We also demonstrated that NOX2 is one of the major NADPH oxidases that contribute to ATP-mediated ROS production (Fig. 3E). Because pretreatment of cells with P2X7 receptor antagonists diminished ROS generation, NOX2-dependent ROS production appeared to be a downstream event of P2X7 receptor (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, we demonstrated that NOX2 and the C-terminal region of P2X7 receptor are required for ATP-induced p38 activation (Figs. 3D and 4H). These results suggested that C-terminal of P2X7 receptor regulates NOX2 activation. Interestingly, a similar mechanism has recently been reported for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling (38Kim Y.S. Morgan M.J. Choksi S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). NOX1, another member of NADPH oxidase family proteins, is activated by TNF through the formation of a complex with TNF signaling components such as TRADD and RIP1 on the cytoplasmic region of TNF receptor, which mediates sustained activation of JNK and necrosis. These findings may imply that NOX family proteins function as common signal transducers that convert extracellular signals to intracellular ROS and then provoke ROS-dependent cellular responses including cell death. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which P2X7 receptor activates NOX2. Furthermore, we found that p38 activation by ATP and H2O2 was mediated by ASK1 (Fig. 5B), leading to caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5, C and D). Because the expression level of P2X7 receptor (Fig. 5E) and the ATP-induced intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 5F) were similar in ASK1+/+ and ASK1-/- SDMs, ROS production through P2X7 receptor appeared to occur upstream of the ASK1-p38 axis. Our results provide one of the mechanisms by which ATP induces apoptosis in macrophages. Extracellular ATP activates P2X7 receptor and induces NOX2-dependent ROS generation probably via the C-terminal region of the receptor. This ROS production activates caspase-3 through the ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway and eventually leads to apoptosis (Fig. 6). The precise mechanisms by which p38 activates caspase-3 remained to be uncovered. Many groups report the important roles of JNK in caspase-3 activation, but the roles of p38 have been elusive. Our findings clearly demonstrated that p38 but not JNK was strongly activated in SDMs treated with ATP and H2O2 (Fig. 4B and data not shown) and may thus provide a useful model system to understand the p38-dependent signaling pathway leading to apoptosis. Physiological roles of ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages have not been established. Because a high concentration of ATP (millimolar range) is needed to induce apoptosis, apoptosis of macrophages may function as responses against acute ATP leakage from infected and/or damaged cells. It is reported that macrophages undergo apoptosis following infection with certain pathogens that are otherwise capable of surviving within the host cells (39Lammas D.A. Stober C. Harvey C.J. Kendrick N. Panchalingam S. Kumararatne D.S. Immunity. 1997; 7: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 40Kornfeld H. Mancino G. Colizzi V.

Therefore, ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway might play a critical role in macrophages to kill bacteria. In summary, our present study demonstrates that activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway by NOX2-derived ROS is required for ATP-induced apoptosis. A number of P2X7 polymorphisms have been reported; and in some cases, impaired killing of pathogens through ATP-induced macrophage apoptosis were reported (42Saunders B.M. Fernando S.L. Sluyter R. Britton W.J. Wiley J.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5442-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Fernando S.L. Saunders B.M. Sluyter R. Skarratt K.K. Wiley J.S. Britton W.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This may suggest the importance of P2X7 receptor and the subsequent activation of ASK1 and p38 in immune responses. Although further studies are required for the elucidation of physiological functions of the P2X7 receptor-ASK1-p38 pathway, these molecules may be potential therapeutic targets for antibacterial agents.

However, the detailed mechanisms of Ox-LDL-induced PPARα and PPARγ activation are not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Ox-LDL on PPARα and PPARγ activation in macrophages. Ox-LDL, but not LDL, induced PPARα and PPARγ activation in a dose-dependent manner. Ox-LDL transiently induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein expression, and COX-2 specific inhibition by NS-398 or meloxicam or small interference RNA of COX-2 suppressed Ox-LDL-induced PPARα and PPARγ activation. Ox-LDL induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2 specific inhibition abrogated Ox-LDL-induced COX-2 expression and PPARα and PPARγ activation, whereas p38 MAPK-specific inhibition had no effect. Ox-LDL decreased the amounts of intracellular long chain fatty acids, such as arachidonic, linoleic, oleic, and docosahexaenoic acids. On the other hand, Ox-LDL increased intracellular 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) level through ERK1/2-dependent overexpression of COX-2. Moreover, 15d-PGJ2 induced both PPARα and PPARγ activation. Furthermore, COX-2 and 15d-PGJ2 expression and PPAR activity were increased in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE-deficient mice. Finally, we investigated the involvement of PPARα and PPARγ on Ox-LDL-induced mRNA expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.

In conclusion, Ox-LDL-induced increase in 15d-PGJ2 level through ERK1/2-dependent COX-2 expression is one of the mechanisms of PPARα and PPARγ activation in macrophages.

PPARs are characterized by distinct tissue distribution patterns and metabolic functions. PPARα is highly expressed in tissues that demonstrate high catabolic rates for fatty acids, such as liver, heart, kidney, and muscle, whereas PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue where it plays a major regulatory role in adipocyte differentiation, and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (4Kliewer S.A.

Recently, we have reported that 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) induced activation of PPARα and PPARγ in macrophages (11Yano M. Matsumura T. Senokuchi T. Ishii N.

Moreover, we revealed that statin-induced activation of PPARα and PPARγ were mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent increase in intracellular 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) production (11Yano M.

However, the detailed mechanism involved in Ox-LDL-induced activation of PPARs and the role of PPARs in Ox-LDL-mediated acceleration of atherogenesis are not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism of Ox-LDL-induced activation of PPARs in macrophages. We demonstrated that Ox-LDL activated both PPARα and PPARγ through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent COX-2 expression in macrophages. In addition, Ox-LDL-induced activation of PPARs mediated the induction of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mRNA expression, as well as the suppression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression.

For immunohistochemistry, 3-μm-thick serial paraffin sections were used. First antibodies used were biotinylated FOH1a/DLH3 (16Itabe H. Takeshima E. Iwasaki H. Kimura J. Yoshida Y. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15274-15279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for Ox-LDL and goat polyclonal anti-integrin αM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for CD11b. As the second step reaction, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) for Ox-LDL and Hitofine Simple Stain Mouse MAX-PO (Goat, Nichirei) for CD11b were used. After visualization of peroxidase activity using 3,3-diaminobenzidine as a substrate, the sections were stained with hematoxylin for nuclear staining. As negative controls, the same procedures were performed, but the primary antibodies were omitted. Cell Cultures—Peritoneal macrophages were collected from anesthetized male C3H/He mice (25–30 g body weight) by peritoneal lavage with 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, resuspended in medium A (RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin), and incubated in appropriate tissue culture plates for 90 min (17Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More than 98% of the adherent cells were considered to be macrophages, based on four criteria, as described previously (18Chodakewitz J.A. Kupper T.S. Coleman D.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 832-836PubMed Google Scholar, 19Munker R. Gasson J. Ogawa M. Koeffler H.P. Nature. 1986; 323: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in medium A in appropriate tissue culture plates as previously described (20Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuda K. Furukawa N. Kaneko K. Shichiri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37665-37672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and used from passage numbers four to eight. THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, were cultured in medium A in 35-mm dishes and treated with 200 nm phorbol myristate acetate to induce their differentiation into macrophages. After 8 h of incubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in medium A until the initiation of experiments (11Yano M. Matsumura T. Senokuchi T. Ishii N. Murata Y. Taketa T. Motoshima H. Taguchi T. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Takuwa Y. Kawada T. Brownlee M. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1442-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein Preparation and Modification of Native LDL—Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation from the plasma of consenting normolipidemic subjects, obtained after overnight fasting (21Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 1860-1865Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LDL was dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Ox-LDL or mildly oxidized LDL (m-Ox-LDL) was prepared by incubation of LDL with 5 μm CuSO4 for 20 or for 5 h, respectively, at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 1 mm EDTA, and cooling (22Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Sakamoto Y. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The endotoxin level of Ox-LDL was <1 pg/μg of protein measured by Toxicolor system (Seikagaku, Japan). Macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL was performed by using Lindstedt's methods (23Lindstedt K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7741-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μm LDL and 100 nm CuSO4 were incubated at 37 °C with medium A in the absence (c-LDL)) or presence (Mm-Ox-LDL) of mouse peritoneal macrophages (1 × 106). After 20-h incubation, the supernatant was removed, and the extent of lipid peroxidation of LDL in the supernatant was determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARSs) as described below. Analysis of Oxidation, Electrophoretic Mobility, and Degradation of apoB in LDL Modified with CuSO4—Following oxidative modification of LDL with CuSO4 or macrophages, lipid peroxidation was assessed by the following procedures. The peroxides were quantified in terms of TBARS according to the method of Nagano et al. (24Nagano Y. Arai H. Kita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6457-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins (20 μg of protein) were suspended in 0.2 ml of 150 mm NaCl. The suspension was mixed with 0.5 ml of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.5 ml of the reagent (335 mg of 2-thiobarbituric acid in 100 ml of 50% (v/v) acetic acid). The mixture was boiled at 95 °C for 60 min. After being cooled, 2.0 ml of 1-butanol was added, shaken vigorously, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. The fluorescence of supernatant was measured with excitation at 515 nm and emission at 550 nm. Tetramethoxypropane was used as a standard. The electrophoretic mobility of native or oxidized LDL was measured in barbital/sodium barbital, pH 8.0, on 1% agarose gel SPE (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) (25Noble R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 693-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipoprotein pattern was visualized by staining the film with a lipid-specific stain. Relative electrophoretic mobility was defined as ratio of the distances migrated from the origin by modified LDL versus native LDL. For analysis of the degradation of apoB, lipoproteins were delipidated with ethyl acetate: ethanol (1:1), solubilized with 10% SDS, and separated on 4% to 20% SDS gels (Invitrogen Japan K.K. Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.) at 30 mA for 1 h. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by using semidry blotting, and the membranes were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibody to apoB at a dilution of 1:1000 for 2 h. After washing, the membranes were stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antigen detection was performed with an ECL plus kit (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by using National Institutes of Health Image analysis software (26Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Yano M. Taguchi T. Matsuo T. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Imoto K.

Full-length PPARs System—The reporter plasmid (AOX)3-luc, containing tree copies of an upstream activating sequence for the PPAR response element of acyl-CoA oxidase and a thymidine kinase gene promoter (tk-promoter) in front of a luciferase cDNA, and PPARγ2 expression plasmid (pCMX-PPARγ2), containing the mouse PPARγ2 gene driven by the CMV promoter, were kindly gifted from Dr. Michael Brownlee (Dept. of Medicine, Diabetes Research Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Human PPARα expression plasmid (pCMV-hPPARα) containing the human PPARα gene driven by the CMV promoter was a kind gift from Dr. Takahide Miyamoto and Dr. Tomoko Kakizawa (Dept. of Aging Medicine and Geriatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Japan) (27Miyamoto T. Kaneko A. Kakizawa T. Yajima H. Kamijo K. Sekine R. Hiramatsu K. Nishii Y. Hashimoto T. Hashizume K. J. Biol.

To measure the PPARα or PPARγ activity, RAW264.7 cells (2 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with (AOX)3-luc, and pCMV-hPPARα or pCMX-PPARγ2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were also co-transfected with a Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-SV40, Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal control. Luciferase assay was performed as described below. GAL4 Chimera System—The fusion protein expression vectors pM-PPARα and pM-PPARγ, containing residues 1–147 of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and 167–467 of the human PPARα ligand-binding domain or 204–505 of the human PPARγ ligand-binding domain, driven by the SV40 promoter were described previously (28Takahashi N.

The reporter plasmid p4xUASg-tk-luc, containing four copies of a 17-mer upstream activating sequence for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and a thymidine kinase gene promoter (tk-promoter) in front of a luciferase cDNA, was also described previously (28Takahashi N.

To measure the PPARα or PPARγ ligand binding activity, RAW264.7 cells (2 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with p4xUASg-tk-luc and pM-PPARα or pM-PPARγ, and subjected to luciferase assays as described below. Luciferase Assays—The NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-Luc) used for measuring NF-κB activity was purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. (Shiga, Japan). Luciferase reporter plasmids were transfected into RAW264.7cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages, or THP-1 macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were also co-transfected with a Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-SV40, Promega) as an internal control. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 5 h, and compounds were added to the medium at appropriate concentrations. After an additional 24 h of incubation, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assays using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions (29Matsuo T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Senokuchi T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Pestell R.G. Brownlee M. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transcription Activity of PPARs—Transcription activity of PPARα and PPARγ was assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based PPARα, -δ, and -γ Complete Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical). Sample proteins were extracted from aortas of apoE-/- or WT mice according to the manufacturer's instructions and were added to a 96-well plate that had been immobilized by an oligonucleotide containing PPAR response element. After 1 h, the wells were incubated with diluted primary PPARα or PPARγ antibody to recognize the accessible epitope on PPARα or PPARγ protein upon DNA binding. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and incubation was conducted for 1 h. At the end, the reaction was stopped, and absorbance was read at 450 nm on a spectrophotometer. This assay is specific for PPARα or PPARγ activation, and there is no cross-reaction with other PPAR isoforms. Transfection of siRNA—The siRNA against COX-2, PPARα, PPARγ, and an irrelevant 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex as a control were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RAW264.7 cells (2 × 106 cells/well) or mouse peritoneal macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with the siRNA of COX-2, PPARα, PPARγ, or control, in the absence or presence of appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 4-h incubation, the medium was changed to medium A, and luciferase assay or real-time RT-PCR was performed. In comparison to the control siRNA, the siRNA of COX-2, PPARα, or PPARγ suppressed the expression of these proteins by 86, 72, or 77%, respectively, according to Western blot analysis (11Yano M.

Western Blot Analysis—Cells (2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate, Nunc) or aortic sinus tissues were lysed by the lysis buffer, and centrifuged (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min). Supernatants were used as sample proteins. Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were applied to 10% SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by using semi-dry blotting.

The present paper is a progress report of this work; no claim is made for completeness, but sufficient new data are available to make publication at this time worth while, especially since some of the numerical results given in the earlier report require revision. The x-ray beam, produced by the impact of 335 Mev electrons on a 20 mil thick platinum target, has a width at half maximum of 0.0135 radian (about 1 inch at 6 feet from the target). In all but the earliest experiments the beam was further defined by a 1 inch hole in a lead block, then passed through a piece of carbon which served as the meson source. The x-ray intensity at one meter from the target was about 3500 r per hour (measured behind 1/8 inch of lead) under the best running conditions; the average was about half this. The actual exposures at the carbon meson source (6 feet from the target) ranged from 500 to 2000 r in the later runs.more » Mesons were recorded on Ilford nuclear plates; the highest density of meson endings observed was about 100 per square centimeter in a 100 micron emulsion.

https://openalex.org/W1967032407,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is an important mediator of the behavioral effects of ethanol in the central nervous system. Previous studies have demonstrated sites in the third and fourth membrane-associated (M) domains of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2A subunit that influence alcohol sensitivity and ion channel gating. We investigated whether two of these sites, Phe-637 in M3 and Met-823 in M4, interactively regulate the ethanol sensitivity of the receptor by testing dual substitution mutants at these positions. A majority of the mutations decreased steady-state glutamate EC(50) values and maximal steady-state to peak current ratios (I(ss)/I(p)), whereas only two mutations altered peak glutamate EC(50) values. Steady-state glutamate EC(50) values were correlated with maximal glutamate I(ss)/I(p) values, suggesting that changes in glutamate potency were attributable to changes in desensitization. In addition, there was a significant interaction between the substituents at positions 637 and 823 with respect to glutamate potency and desensitization. IC(50) values for ethanol among the mutants varied over the approximate range 100-325 mm. The sites in M3 and M4 significantly interacted in regulating ethanol sensitivity, although this was apparently dependent upon the presence of methionine in position 823. Molecular dynamics simulations of the NR2A subunit revealed possible binding sites for ethanol near both positions in the M domains. Consistent with this finding, the sum of the molecular volumes of the substituents at the two positions was not correlated with ethanol IC(50) values. Thus, there is a functional interaction between Phe-637 and Met-823 with respect to glutamate potency, desensitization, and ethanol sensitivity, but the two positions do not appear to form a unitary site of alcohol action."

https://openalex.org/W2023652437,"Spliceosome assembly is a dynamic process involving the sequential recruitment and rearrangement of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) on a pre-mRNA substrate. Here we identify several spliceosome protein interactions with different domains of human splicing factor SPF30 that have the potential to mediate the addition of the tri-snRNP to the prespliceosome. In particular, we show that the C-terminal tails of SmD1, SmD3, and the protein Lsm4 interact with the central Tudor domain of SPF30. We identify a novel interaction between the N-terminal domain of SPF30 and U2AF35, a prespliceosome protein that has a role in recognizing the 3′ splice site and recruiting U2 snRNP. We also show that the C terminus of SPF30 interacts with a middle domain of hPrp3, a component of U4/U6 di-snRNP and the tri-snRNP. Importantly, we show that the U2AF35 and hPrp3 interactions with SPF30 can occur simultaneously, thereby potentially linking 3′ splice site recognition with tri-snRNP addition. Finally, we note that SPF30 and its partner-interacting domains are not conserved in yeast, suggesting this interaction network may play an important role in the complex splicing observed in higher eukaryotes.

The spliceosome is the large and dynamic macromolecular complex responsible for removing intron sequences that interrupt many eukaryotic gene transcripts. Spliceosomes are composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), 2The abbreviations used are:snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinRG-richarginine- and glycine-richGSTglutathione S-transferaseY2Hyeast two-hybrid. known as U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and more than 100 additional proteins (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In vitro splicing studies show that snRNPs and additional protein factors come together with a pre-mRNA transcript in an ordered assembly via short-lived intermediate complexes to carry out the chemistry of splicing (2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Atkins J. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 333-360Google Scholar). Precisely how the assembly of these larger complexes is executed and controlled and which factors are responsible are poorly understood. small nuclear ribonucleoprotein arginine- and glycine-rich glutathione S-transferase yeast two-hybrid. Much of our knowledge about the identity and function of individual spliceosome proteins is the result of extensive genetic and biochemical analyses in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Brow D.A.

Although the yeast spliceosome is fundamentally similar to the mammalian spliceosome, the mammalian spliceosome must handle more complex splicing substrates and is subject to more complex regulation. Therefore, it is likely that some mammalian splicing factors have no functional correlate in yeast. Consistent with this idea, recent analyses of human spliceosomes by mass spectrometry identified a significant number of proteins not previously associated with splicing (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 5Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat.

Human SPF30 (also known as SMNrp) protein was first identified by mass spectrometry as a component of purified spliceosomes (5Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and initially characterized as a nuclear protein containing a Tudor domain, a motif found in RNA-binding proteins implicated in binding methylated arginines (11Talbot K. Miguel-Aliaga I. Mohaghegh P. Ponting C.P. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the sequence of SPF30 protein is generally conserved within higher eukaryotes, there is no S. cerevisiae homolog. SPF30 does share ∼51% sequence identity within the Tudor domain of SMN (survival of motor neuron), a protein important for snRNP biogenesis (40Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Mutations in SMN are believed to be responsible for its role in the autosomal recessive disease spinal muscular atrophy (12Campbell L. Potter A. Ignatius J. Dubowitz V. Davies K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 40-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The Tudor domain of SMN is sufficient for binding four of the Sm/Lsm proteins that make up a core heptamer of the U snRNPs (SmB, SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4). These four proteins contain arginine- and glycine-rich (RG-rich) motifs, and SMN protein has been shown to bind preferentially to dimethylarginine-modified residues within the RG-rich repeats of SmD1, SmD3 (13Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In addition, the Tudor domains of both SMN and SPF30 have been shown to preferentially bind a synthetic symmetrically dimethylated (RsDMAG)4 peptide identical to a sequence within the C terminus of the human SmD1 protein (14Cote J. Richard S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A critical role for SPF30 in splicing was demonstrated in a human in vitro system. Immunodepletion of the SPF30 protein from human nuclear cell extracts blocks spliceosome assembly on a minimal splicing substrate at the transition from prespliceosomes (A complex) to assembled spliceosomes (B complex) but does not appear to be necessary for tri-snRNP assembly (8Meister G.

Additionally, SPF30 was identified by mass spectrometry in purified human prespliceosomes and spliceosomes but was not detected in spliceosomes activated for catalysis in which the U4 and U1 snRNP association is destabilized (C complex) (6Behzadnia N.

Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The prespliceosome to spliceosome transition is characterized by the addition of the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP to a complex of U1 and U2 snRNPs bound, respectively, to the 5′ splice site and branch point region of a pre-mRNA transcript. SPF30 has been shown to associate with both the U2 17 S snRNP and the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP, suggesting that it may act as a bridge between the prespliceosome and tri-snRNP (8Meister G. Hannus S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31142-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A direct protein interaction between SPF30 and Prp3, a U4/U6 di-snRNP protein, was reported (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism, including its specific interaction partners and regulation, by which SPF30 serves as this potential bridge is unknown. Here we present data identifying SPF30-interacting partners and map those interactions to individual protein domains. Our results support a model in which specific domains of SPF30 interact with components in both the prespliceosome and the tri-snRNP, potentially joining them together within the spliceosome. Furthermore, we note that these interactions are not conserved in yeast, suggesting they may be important for the more complex splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs found in humans and other multicellular organisms. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Fulllength cDNA were cloned from HeLa cell total RNA (Ambion™). Recombinant GST-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli purified by glutathione affinity (GSTrap™; GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200™; GE Healthcare). GST-SPF30 Chromatography and Detection of snRNPs from HeLa Nuclear Extract—Approximately 1.0 mg of purified GST-SPF30 protein was coupled to Affi-Gel 10™ affinity matrix (Bio-Rad). HeLa nuclear extract (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) equilibrated in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was passed over the column. It has been observed that U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP complex can be disrupted upon repeated freeze-thawing (19Utans U. Behrens S.E. Luhrmann R. Kole R. Kramer A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), so we used freshly prepared nuclear extract to avoid disruption of spliceosome subcomplexes. After washing, snRNPs were eluted from the column using a gradient from 0.15 to 2 m KCl. RNA was purified from eluates using phenol/chloroform isolation and ethanol precipitation and separated by urea-PAGE electrophoresis. Standard Northern blot analysis was carried out using antisense U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNA probes (20Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—cDNAs were cloned from HeLa total RNA into the Yeast Matchmaker™ GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). AH109 and Y187 yeast strains were transformed with bait and prey vectors, respectively. Whole cell lysates from yeast strains expressing each bait and prey vector were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin antibodies, respectively, to ensure that each bait and prey protein was expressed and of the correct molecular weight. All of the possible combinations of bait and prey matings were tested, and diploid yeast strains were selected on Trp–Leu– plates. Diploids were then grown in Trp–Leu– liquid medium and plated onto either Trp–Leu– plates or onto Trp–Leu–His– plates to test for interaction between the bait and prey proteins. GST-SPF30 Pulldown of 35S-Labeled in Vitro Translated Proteins—In vitro translated proteins generated using T n T® quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). For GST pulldown assays 25 μl in vitro T n T® reactions were split in two and added to glutathione agarose resin (Sigma) bound to 50 μg of purified GST-SFP30 or GST alone. These mixtures were allowed to incubate with rotation for 2 h at 4°C, followed by three 10-min washes in buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The washed glutathione resin was resuspended in 25 μl of sample buffer and boiled, and the samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. U2AF Depletion from Nuclear Extract and Immunoblotting—U2AF depletions were carried out as previously described (21Lutzelberger M. Backstrom E. Akusjarvi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25478-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with 2 ml of oligo(dT) cellulose (NEB) for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The column was washed in the same buffer except with 2.5 m KCl followed by an elution containing 2 m guanidine HCl. Eluted fraction was dialyzed against 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, concentrated, and stored at –80 °C. The presence of U2AF35 in depleted extracts and eluate was assayed by immunoblotting against U2AF35 (Proteintech). Distinct Domains of SPF30 Interact with Specific snRNPs—SPF30 is a critical splicing factor in human extracts and interacts with multiple spliceosome snRNPs (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Rappsilber J. Ajuh P. Lamond A.I. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31142-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the role of SPF30 in splicing, we asked whether the snRNP interactions are distinct and mediated by different domains of SPF30. Using limited trypsin digests of purified SPF30 protein and in silico protein structure modeling, we predicted three distinct structural domains of SPF30 (data not shown). We expressed and purified GST-tagged versions of these predicted domains from bacteria (Fig. 1A) and obtained very pure soluble protein (Fig. 1B). We then tested the association of the SPF30 domains with snRNPs by an in vitro binding assay in which we passed HeLa nuclear extract over columns made from different SPF30 domains covalently linked to beads. After washing extensively, we eluted interacting species with a salt gradient and detected spliceosomal U snRNAs in elution fractions by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). We also show by Western analysis that the common snRNP protein SmB′/B″ is present in the pooled column eluate, supporting the hypothesis that snRNA detection is indicative of the corresponding snRNP (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2SPF30 interactions with spliceosome snRNPs.

Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Rappsilber J. Ajuh P. Lamond A.I. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31142-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Notably, no U1 association was detected. In contrast, we readily detect all five snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) in the pooled column eluate with fulllength SPF30 (1–238) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, full-length SPF30 differentially binds the snRNPs in a salt-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The most robust interaction is with U4 and U6 snRNPs, which both elute at ∼1.5 m KCl. It is likely that the coelution of U4 and U6 represents a U4/U6 di-snRNP. U5 snRNP elutes in a peak that coincides with the peak of U4 and U6, likely as a member of tri-snRNP. U1 and U2 snRNPs show a weaker interaction, with both peaking at ∼0.6 m KCl. As expected, with GST alone we detect neither SmB′/B″ nor snRNA association (Fig. 2, A, B, and H). We conclude that SPF30 interacts either directly or indirectly with all of the snRNPs, but with differential affinities. To dissect the SPF30 domains responsible for the snRNP interactions, we repeated this analysis with columns carrying fusions of GST to distinct structural domains of SPF30. An N-terminal region of SPF30 (amino acids 1–65) binds primarily U2 and U1 snRNPs (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, the central Tudor domain of SPF30 (amino acids 66–126) binds only U1 snRNP (Fig. 2E). Using a C-terminal domain (amino acids 127–238), mainly U4 and U6 snRNPs are bound, and, to a much lesser extent, U5 snRNP (Fig. 2F). SPF30 lacking the Tudor domain (Δ66–126) binds U2, U4, and U6 snRNPs and appears to have minimal interactions with U1 and U5 (Fig. 2G). These results clearly show that distinct domains of SPF30 are responsible for interacting with different snRNPs. The N-terminal domain binds specifically with both U2 and U1 or with a complex that contains both snRNPs. The C-terminal domain interacts with U4 and U6 snRNPs, likely as a di-snRNP. U1 and U5 associations cannot be assigned to SPF30 domains in a straightforward manner. U1 interacts strongly with the Tudor domain of SPF30 but also appears to interact with the N-terminal domain in some contexts, possibly indirectly through U2 snRNP. We see strong U5 association only with full-length SPF30, likely as a member of the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP. SPF30 Interacts with Proteins in the Prespliceosome and Tri-snRNP—To identify which snRNP-associated protein factors might interact directly with SPF30, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen with U1, U2, U4, and U6 snRNP-associated proteins. With this assay we identified several proteins that potentially interact with SPF30: SmD1, SmD3, the U6-specific protein Lsm4, hPrp3 (U4/U6 90-kDa protein), and, surprisingly, U2AF35, a key protein factor involved in 3′ splice site recognition and prespliceosome assembly (22Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Merendino L. Guth S. Bilbao D. Martinez C. Valcarcel J.

Blumenthal T. Nature. 1999; 402: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3A, 4A, and 5A, respectively). The interaction with hPrp3, which is a component of both the U4/U6 di-snRNP and tri-snRNP, was not unexpected given previous studies that showed in vitro binding of this protein with SPF30 (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the interactions with Sm, Lsm, and, in particular, U2AF35 are novel. To further confirm these interactions and map them to specific domains within the proteins, we applied both the Y2H system and in vitro pulldowns as described below.FIGURE 4The C terminus of SPF30 interacts with the middle domain of hPrp3.

Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of SmD1 and SmD3 contains the characteristic SmI and SmII β-strand motifs required for heptameric ring formation, whereas the C-terminal domain contains RG-rich repeats that can be dimethylated. As observed by Y2H, the central Tudor domain of SPF30 is sufficient to interact with SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4 (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). Interestingly, both the full length and the Tudor domain alone of SPF30 interact with the C-terminal domains of both SmD1 and SmD3. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal from either SmD1 or SmD3 provides no or very weak Y2H signal (Fig. 3, A and C). These results suggest that SPF30 interacts with a subset of the Sm/Lsm proteins. Given previous studies showing that the isolated Tudor domain of SPF30 can bind an RG-rich repeat containing peptides (14Cote J. Richard S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the Sm/Lsm protein interactions with SPF30 are mediated by its Tudor domain and the RG-rich C-terminal tails of SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4. Interestingly, of the 14 spliceosomal Sm/Lsm proteins, only SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4 contain extensive RG-rich C-terminal tails. To confirm the interaction between these proteins, we performed in vitro GST pulldown experiments using recombinant GST-tagged SPF30 and 35S-labeled in vitro translated SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4. With full-length GST-SPF30 we readily detect all three proteins in the pulldowns and observe little or no 35S-labeled protein in pulldowns with GST alone (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). These results further support a direct interaction of the SPF30 Tudor domain with the RG-rich repeat-containing Sm/Lsm proteins. Specific Domains of SPF30 Interact with the U4/U6 90-kDa Protein hPrp3 and the 17 S U2 snRNP Protein U2AF35—To further delineate the interaction of SPF30 with hPrp3, we tested several hPrp3 domains using domain boundaries for hPrp3 described previously in a study exploring protein interactions between hPrp3 and hPrp4 (27Gonzalez-Santos J.M. Wang A. Jones J. Ushida C. Liu J. Hu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23764-23772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We observe a positive Y2H signal when full-length hPrp3 is tested with either full-length SPF30 or SPF30Δ Tudor, but not with SPF30 Tudor domain alone (Fig. 4A). All of the hPrp3 domains containing amino acids 195–442 give a positive Y2H signal with both SPF30 and SPF30Δ Tudor, but not those lacking these central residues. These results suggest that it is the central region of hPrp3 that interacts with SPF30. To demonstrate a direct interaction, we performed pulldown experiments using recombinant GST-SPF30 and in vitro translated hPrp3. Using either the full length or the C-terminal domain (127–238) of GST-tagged SPF30, we readily detect in vitro translated hPrp3 in pulldowns (Fig. 4B). As observed in the yeast two-hybrid assays, hPrp3 proteins containing residues 195–442, but not those lacking these residues, are pulled down by SPF30. GST alone does not pull down any of the hPrp3 protein constructs. These results show that the C-terminal domain of SPF30 is sufficient to interact with the central domain of hPrp3. Of the 17 S U2 snRNP proteins we tested in the Y2H screen, only U2AF35 gives a positive signal. We used an approach similar to that described for hPrp3 above to map the regions of U2AF35 and SPF30 that interact with each other. Using the N-terminal (amino acids 1–146) and C-terminal domains (amino acids 147–240) of U2AF35 based on earlier structural studies of the protein (28Kielkopf C.L. Rodionova N.A. Green M.R. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we assayed for interactions with SPF30. Both SPF30 full-length and SPF30Δ Tudor show positive Y2H signal with full-length or the N-terminal domain of U2AF35 (Fig. 5A). This result suggests that the N-terminal domain of U2AF35 interacts with SPF30 residues outside of the Tudor domain. To confirm a direct interaction, we performed in vitro GST pulldown experiments using either GST-tagged full-length or N-terminal domain SPF30. We readily detect both in vitro translated U2AF35 full length (1–240) and truncated constructs containing the N-terminal domain residues 1–146 and residues 43–146, the latter of which lacks the zinc knuckle motif of U2AF35 (Fig. 5B). No U2AF35 pulldown is observed with GST alone. Because U2AF35 exists as a stable heterodimer with U2AF65, we also tested whether SPF30 interacts with U2AF35 in the presence of U2AF65 (Fig. 5C). We find that although SPF30 does not interact with U2AF65 alone by yeast two-hybrid or by in vitro binding (data not shown), it can pull down both U2AF35 and U2AF65 when present in an in vitro GST binding assay. Combined, these data show that the N-terminal domain of SPF30 is sufficient to interact with the N-terminal domain of U2AF35. U2AF35 Is Insufficient Alone to Mediate the SPF30 Interaction with U2 snRNP—In nuclear extracts SPF30 protein previously was shown by glycerol gradient centrifugation to associate with the 17 S U2 snRNP but not U4/U6 di-snRNP or U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to ask whether the SPF30 interaction with U2AF35, a 17 S U2 snRNP associated protein, is sufficient to mediate the SPF30 association with U2 snRNP. For these experiments, we depleted nuclear extracts of U2AF35 protein using oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (Fig. 6A) (22Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 29Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This technique efficiently depletes extracts of both U2AF65 and U2AF35 (U2AF) while allowing for the subsequent purification of the U2AF heterodimer. We incubated U2AF-depleted nuclear extracts with GST-SPF30 N-terminal domain bound to glutathione resin in the presence or absence of purified U2AF. Surprisingly, the N-terminal domain of SPF30 efficiently pulls down U1 and U2 snRNPs from extracts depleted of U2AF35 (Fig. 6B). Similarly, SPF30 association with 17 S U2 snRNP is not affected in U2AF-depleted extracts as observed by glycerol gradient centrifugation (data not shown). SPF30 association with U1 snRNP observed in these pulldown experiments remains to be further characterized. These results suggest that factor(s) additional to U2AF35 facilitate the SPF30 association with U2 snRNP. SPF30 Bridges an Indirect Interaction between U2AF35 and hPrp3—Previous studies suggested that SPF30 may serve as bridge between prespliceosomes and tri-snRNP, thereby allowing spliceosomes to assemble (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Rappsilber J. Ajuh P. Lamond A.I. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31142-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study we identified and characterized interactions via two distinct domains of SPF30 with both U2AF35 and Prp3, two proteins associated with prespliceosomes and tri-snRNP, respectively. Given these results, we tested whether SPF30 can associate with both U2AF35 and hPrp3 simultaneously. We bound recombinant GST-Prp3 (196–402) protein to glutathione resin and incubated with 35S-labeled U2AF35 (1–146) in the presence or absence of recombinant SPF30. GST alone either in the presence or absence of SPF30 did not precipitate U2AF35, whereas GST-Prp3 in the presence of SPF30 significantly enhanced the precipitation of U2AF35 (Fig. 7). These results suggest that SPF30 may promote an indirect interaction between hPrp3, a core tri-snRNP component, with U2AF35, an essential splicing factor present in prespliceosomes. Spliceosome assembly is a highly complex and dynamic process involving a myriad of proteins and RNAs. Although a number of specific interactions that mediate spliceosome assembly and function have been elucidated (primarily by genetic studies in S. cerevisiae), a large portion remains to be characterized. In particular, the interactions that govern tri-snRNP association with spliceosomes are not fully understood. Furthermore, there are likely many additional interactions required by the more complex splicing machinery in more complex eukaryotes. In this study, we focused on the human protein SPF30 and its interactions with spliceosome components. We find that full-length SPF30 interacts directly and/or indirectly with all five U snRNPs. Using truncated SPF30 proteins, we assigned specific snRNP interactions to distinct domains of SPF30. The N-terminal domain of SPF30 interacts predominantly with U2 and U1 snRNPs. The Tudor domain alone appears to interact exclusively with U1 snRNP, whereas the C-terminal domain interacts with the U4/U6 di-snRNP. Importantly, these observations correspond with the specific snRNP proteins that we subsequently found interact with SPF30 domains. The N-terminal domain of SPF30 binds U2AF35, a protein associated with the prespliceosome and 17 S U2 snRNP. We also showed that SPF30 interacts with U2AF35 in the presence of U2AF65, suggesting that SPF30 interacts with an intact U2AF heterodimer. However, this interaction alone is not sufficient to explain SPF30 association with U2 snRNP. Most studies on U2AF35 focus on its role in early spliceosome formation (22Ruskin B. Zamore P.D.

Blumenthal T. Nature. 1999; 402: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). U2AF35 interacts with its partner U2AF65 via residues 47–172 (N-terminal domain) (30Zhang M. Zamore P.D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A.I. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8769-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Together, the U2AF65/U2AF35 dimer recognizes the pre-mRNA polypyrimidine tract and 3′ splice site, respectively. U2AF65 has been shown to interact with SF3b155, a component of U2 snRNP, and this interaction may facilitate the recruitment and stable association of U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA (31Cass D.M. Berglund J.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10092-10101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Spadaccini R. Reidt U. Dybkov O. Will C. Frank R. Stier G. Corsini L. Wahl M.C. Luhrmann R. Sattler M. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 410-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, SPF30 interaction with U2AF35 may facilitate recruitment and stable association of tri-snRNP with the prespliceosome. U2AF35 is still present in fully assembled spliceosomes, although its role at this later stage of assembly is not understood (17Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Urlaub H. Gentzel M. Will C.L. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to speculate that U2AF may play a critical role in both prespliceosome formation and the transition to assembled spliceosomes. The C-terminal domain of SPF30 interacts with hPrp3. hPrp3 is a component of the U4/U6 di-snRNP and tri-snRNP, contacting hPrp4, hPrp6, and hSnu66 (33Liu S. Rauhut R. Vornlocher H.P. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It appears to join the spliceosome with tri-snRNP during the formation of B complex (17Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Urlaub H. Gentzel M. Will C.L. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is possible that tri-snRNP recruitment to the spliceosome is mediated in part by the interaction of the C-terminal domain of SPF30 and hPrp3. Thus, when SPF30 is depleted from extracts, spliceosomes arrest at prespliceosomes as observed previously (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Rappsilber J. Ajuh P. Lamond A.I. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31142-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Importantly, we show that the U2AF35 and hPrp3 interactions with SPF30 can take place simultaneously. Previously, both Meister et al. (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Rappsilber et al. (9Rappsilber J. Ajuh P. Lamond A.I. Mann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31142-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) hypothesized that SPF30 serves as a bridge between U2 snRNP and tri-snRNP at the transition to assembled spliceosomes. Our results support this model and provide a potential mechanism where SPF30 may function as a link between 3′ splice site recognition in the prespliceosome and recruitment of the tri-snRNP (Fig. 8), although more studies are needed to establish this function concretely. It is also plausible that U2AF35/SPF30 and SPF30/hPrp3 binding events are temporally ordered. Based on mass spectrometry analysis of purified splicing complexes, SPF30 appears to join the spliceosome at prespliceosome assembly and prior to tri-snRNP addition (6Behzadnia N. Golas M.M. Hartmuth K. Sander B. Kastner B. Deckert J. Dube P. Will C.L. Urlaub H. Stark H. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1737-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Hartmuth K. Urlaub H.

Interestingly, we only observe a strong U4/U6 di-snRNP association with recombinant SPF30 in pulldown experiments. In contrast, endogenous SPF30 in nuclear extracts appears exclusively associated with U2 17 S snRNP and not U4/U6 di-snRNP or tri-snRNP. These observations suggest that there may be a mode to regulate the association of SPF30 with hPrp3. Upon spliceosome activation, both U1 and U4 snRNP association with the spliceosome is destabilized as U6 exchanges base pairing with U4 for U2 snRNA and the 5′ splice site. At the same time, U2AF65/35, hPrp3, and SPF30 appear to leave the complex, because none of these proteins were identified in activated spliceosomes (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 34Boehringer D. Makarov E.M. Sander B. Makarova O.V. Kastner B. Luhrmann R. Stark H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Any potential role for SPF30 in the activation of the spliceosome remains to be explored. The Tudor domain of SPF30 interacts with the RG-rich C-terminal tails of core snRNP proteins SmD1 and SmD3. This interaction likely depends at least in part on methylation of RG-rich repeats in the Sm tails. Arginine methylation of an RG di-peptide was shown to enhance the interaction of the SMN and SPF30 Tudor domain with this motif, although it is not required (13Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 14Cote J. Richard S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Lsm4 also contains RG-rich repeats known to undergo arginine methylation modification similar to that of both SmD1 and SmD3 (35Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is likely the SPF30 Tudor interaction with Lsm4 takes place via the C-terminal domain of Lsm4; however, this detail remains to be explored. A role for SPF30 interaction with the Sm/Lsm proteins in spliceosome assembly is more difficult to specify because these proteins are core components of all the snRNPs. It is possible that the SPF30 Tudor domain-specific association with U1 snRNP we observe by in vitro pulldowns reflects an interaction important for SPF30 association with prespliceosomes. Furthermore, this interaction coupled with the U2AF35 interaction could serve as a signal for the recruitment of tri-snRNP to a bona fide splicing complex. On the other hand, the exclusive interaction observed between SPF30 Tudor domain and U1 snRNP may simply be due to the accessibility of the Sm heptamer of U1 snRNP, whereas the Sm/Lsm heptamer of U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs may be inaccessible in their assembled nuclear state. Alternatively, the ability of the SPF30 Tudor domain to preferentially bind SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4 may suggest an additional role in nuclear snRNP subcomplex assembly. The Tudor domain of SPF30 shares 51% identity to SMN protein, which plays an important role in snRNP biogenesis by assembling the Sm proteins into the nascent snRNPs (36Pellizzoni L. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2002; 298: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Like SPF30, SMN also binds directly to SmB/D1/D3 and Lsm4 via its Tudor domain (35Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SPF30 colocalizes with SMN protein at Cajal bodies (8Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a site of snRNP accumulation and putative subcomplex assembly (37Jady B.E. Darzacq X. Tucker K.E. Matera A.G. Bertrand E. Kiss T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1878-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 38Kiss T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5949-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 39Schaffert N. Hossbach M. Heintzmann R. Achsel T. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3000-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Finally, we note that the SPF30 and its interaction partner domains are not conserved in S. cerevisiae. As with SPF30, there is no yeast homolog of U2AF35. Yeast Prp3 does not have a similar central domain. Yeast Prp3 and human Prp3 primarily show conservation in the C-terminal domain. Moreover, the C-terminal tails of SmD1, SmD3, and Lsm4 are not present in yeast. The presence of these elements in humans, but not in S. cerevisiae may be reflective of the differences in splicing in these organisms. In general, S. cerevisiae pre-mRNAs have single, relatively short introns, whereas human pre-mRNAs feature multiple introns that can be megabases in length and are often alternatively spliced. The spliceosome assembly process in humans, therefore, likely requires additional protein machinery not found in yeast. It is intriguing to speculate that an assemblage of protein interactions, including SPF30, evolved in higher eukaryotes to coordinate the task of assembling spliceosomes on complex, multi-intron transcripts.

The presence of a series of glycosylases that focus on different lesion properties, all coexisting within the same cell, would provide a robust and partially redundant repair system necessary for the maintenance of the genome. The DNA of all living organisms is constantly damaged by multiple pathways, leading to a complex array of lesions. Most of these endogenous lesions are single-base damage products that are generally repaired by the base excision repair pathway. The base excision repair pathway is initiated by one of a series of damage-specific glycosylases (1Lindahl T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Krokan H.E.

DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 544-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) that find and remove the damaged base by cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond. The resulting abasic site is then processed and the damaged segment is resynthesized by a group of interacting nucleases, polymerases, and ligases in a repair sequence common to most types of single-base damage. Significant efforts are now underway in several laboratories to determine the mechanisms by which the lesions are initially located and distinguished from normal DNA bases. It is estimated that in the human genome, there are 104 to 105 lesions per cell per day from endogenous damage events (5Saul R.L. Ames B.N. Basic Life Sci. 1986; 38: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mullaart E. Lohman P.H. Berends F. Vijg J. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, these lesions are dispersed among 109 normal DNA bases, creating a substantial challenge for finding the damage. Furthermore, the fidelity of the glycosylase must exceed the fidelity of the DNA polymerases. If the glycosylase selectivity was 1/105, it would remove a normal DNA base each time it removed a damaged base, and if lower, could cause substantial collateral damage to the genome. Among the DNA repair glycosylases is the uracil glycosylase superfamily, members of which are found in all organisms including bacteria and primates as well as viruses (7Lindahl T. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Caradonna S.J. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol.

Common among these glycosylases is their capacity to recognize and remove uracil from DNA. Uracil residues may be found in DNA from the misincorporation of dUTP during DNA synthesis or the deamination of cytosine residues in DNA. The most active of these glycosylases is uracil DNA glycosylase, (UNG), 3The abbreviations used are: UNGuracil DNA glycosylaseMUGmispaired uracil DNA glycosylaseSMUGsingle stranded uracil DNA glycosylaseTmmelting temperatureUuracilAadenineTthymineFU5-fluorouracilClU5-chlorouracilHXhypoxanthinePupurine2AA2-aminoadenine2AP2-aminopurineσmHammett meta parameterΔGfree energyΔHenthalpyΔSentropykrelrelative rate constant, relative to the rate of U:G cleavage. which removes uracil when paired with either adenine or guanine, as well as uracil in single-stranded DNA. UNG does not cleave the normal DNA bases thymine or cytosine. Discrimination against thymine has been explained by the presence of a tyrosine residue (Tyr66 in Escherichia coli, Tyr147 in human) that creates a steric opposition with the thymine methyl group (11Saava R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Discrimination against cytosine results in part from the formation of specific hydrogen bonds with the N3 hydrogen and O4 carbonyl of uracil. In humans, the UNG gene is located on chromosome 12q and is spliced into two forms; UNG2 is targeted to the nucleus, whereas UNG1 is targeted to the mitochondria (12Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T.

On chromosome 12 in humans, two additional members of the uracil glycosylase family are found: the thymine DNA glycosylase that can remove thymine when mispaired with guanine (14Neddermann P.

MUG preferentially repairs uracil when mispaired with guanine, and has a very weak activity against mispaired thymine. The substrate preferences of MUG have been explained on the basis of DNA protein contacts observed in the crystal structure (24Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The preference of MUG for mispaired uracil has been ascribed to the formation of specific hydrogen bonds between amino acid residues of MUG and the “widowed guanine” remaining in the DNA helix following the extrusion of the target uracil residue. The strong selectivity for uracil over thymine by UNG has been attributed to a steric block created by an active site tyrosine residue (11Saava R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The strong selectivity of MUG for uracil over thymine similarly has been attributed to steric blocking of the thymine methyl group (24Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in the case of MUG, the corresponding residue is glycine, which would not be expected to have a substantial steric blocking effect. Previously, we investigated the substrate preferences of MUG using oligonucleotides containing a series of base analogs under steady-state enzyme reaction conditions (25Liu P. Burdzy A. Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon the basis of results obtained with a series of purine analogs paired with the target uracil residue, we proposed that the reduced thermal stability of a duplex containing uracil in a mispair, as opposed to the formation of specific hydrogen bonds, more likely explained the preference of MUG for mispaired uracil. In similar studies with 5-substituted pyrimidine analogs, we observed that MUG had substantial activity against 5-bromouracil and 5-iodouracil, leading us to propose that the electronic-inductive properties of the target base were more important than steric size in establishing the apparent selectivity of MUG for uracil over thymine. Subsequently, others investigating the kinetics of MUG activity established that MUG had a high affinity for the abasic site remaining in DNA following glycosylase removal of uracil (22O'Neill R.J. Vorob'eva O.V. Shahbakhti H. Zmuda E. Bhagwat A.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20526-20532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The high affinity for the abasic site would reduce the rate of MUG turnover, reducing the reliability of kinetic data obtained under steady-state conditions. In this article, we have reinvestigated the activity of MUG against a series of oligonucleotides containing purine and pyrimidine analogs. We have also obtained thermal melting and thermodynamic data on helix formation for a series of oligonucleotides containing this series of base analogs. We report here that the size and electronic-inductive properties of the pyrimidine 5-substituent, as well as helix stability can be used to reasonably explain the substrate preferences of MUG. Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Characterization—Oligonucleotides were prepared by solid phase synthesis methods as described previously (26Gait M.J. Oligonucleotide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY1983Google Scholar, 27Fujimoto J. Nuesca Z. Mazurek M. Sowers L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following synthesis and deprotection, oligonucleotides were purified with Poly-Pak II cartridges, and denaturing gel purified when necessary. The presence of modified bases was verified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry following acid hydrolysis and conversion to the trimethylsilyl ethers. Two sets of oligonucleotides were synthesized. A set of oligonucleotide 24-mers containing uracil with different 5-substituents (X) and purine analogs (P) was synthesized for the MUG activity assay (Fig. 1A). Another set of self-complementary 12-mers containing a uracil and a purine analog was synthesized for melting temperature (Tm) measurements in which the target uracil analog was placed within the same sequence context as in the 24-mer glycosylase assays (Fig. 1B). A 12-base sequence was selected for the thermodynamic studies because the predicted Tm would be within an appropriate range for UV melting studies. The self-complementary 12-mers were designed by keeping the two adjacent bases on each side of the uracil and purine analog base pair constant, and linking the two 5-base fragments in the 5′ → 3′ orientation. Proposed structures of the base pairs examined here are shown in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Proposed conformers of uracil base pairs with purine analogue base pairs in this study.

Labeled strands were annealed to a 2-fold excess of unlabeled complementary strands in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and allowed to cool to room temperature slowly for duplex formation. MUG was obtained from Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD. To compare MUG activity between different duplexes, we measured the cleavage rates under single turnover conditions as described by O'Neill et al. (22O'Neill R.J. Vorob'eva O.V. Shahbakhti H. Zmuda E. Bhagwat A.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20526-20532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 25 °C with 1.4 nm substrate and 0.56 μm MUG in the standard reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). At selected time points 10-μl samples were removed and quenched with 5 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. Abasic sites were then cleaved by heating the samples at 95 °C for 30 min after addition of an equal volume of the Maxam-Gilbert loading buffer (98% formamide, 0.01 m EDTA, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue). Cleaved DNA fragments were separated from intact DNA by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8 m urea), and subsequently quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software. The reaction rate constant, kobs, was determined by fitting time course data to a single exponential (y = a(1–e–bx)) using SigmaPlot 8.0, where a is the maximum level of product ratio and b is the kobs. A rapid quench-flow apparatus (RQF-3, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) was used for reactions requiring a short time course (53 ms to 200 s, U:G, U:HX, FU:G, and ClU:G). Reactions were performed in the standard conditions as described above except that the reaction volume was 35.5 μl, and 100 μl of 50 mm NaOH was used to quench reactions. The quenched reactions were heated at 95 °C for 20 min to cleave the abasic sites, and then dried under reduced pressure. DNA was redissolved in 14 μl of Maxam-Gilbert loading buffer and 1 μl of 10 pmol/μl of the uracil-containing oligonucleotide was added as a competitor. Samples were analyzed as described above. Determination of Helix Melting Behavior—Samples containing self-complementary 12-mer oligonucleotides were prepared in buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Concentration dependent Tm measurements were conducted with total strand concentration (CT) between 2 and 75 μm in cuvettes with path lengths between 1 and 10 mm. Molar extinction coefficients of oligonucleotides were calculated (28Richard, E. G. (1975) in CRC Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Nucleic Acid (Fasman, G.D., ed) 3rd Ed., Vol. 1, p. 589, Cleveland, OHGoogle Scholar) to determine single strand concentrations, and the molar extinction coefficients of 9.9, 12.5, 7.02, 1, and 7.7 × 103 m–1 cm–1, were used for U, HX, Pu, 2AP, and 2AA, respectively. Oligonucleotide melting temperatures (Tm) were determined using a Varian Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). Five temperature ramps were performed on each sample per run at 260 nm: 1) 15 °C to 90 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min, 2) 90 °C to 15 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min, 3) 15 °C to 90 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min, 4) 90 °C to 15 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min, and 5) 15 °C to 90 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. The sample was held for 3 min when the temperature reached 90 °C and 10 min when it reached 15 °C and started the next cycle. Data were collected at 0.5 °C intervals while monitoring the temperature with a probe inserted into a cuvette containing only buffer. The Tm of each duplex was determined using Cary WinUV Thermal software (Varian) with a total of 3 to 4 independent Tm measurements (Table 1).TABLE 1MUG reaction rate constants and physical properties of substratesBase pairRate constant (kobs)ΔGσmSizeΔHΔSTms-1kcal mol-1Åkcal mol-1cal mol-1 K-1°CU:G3.90 ± 0.17 × 10-2-10.8 ± 0.40.002.26-83.2 ± 5.0-237 ± 15.549.1 ± 0.1U:HX3.40 ± 0.24 × 10-2-10.4 ± 0.50.002.26-75.6 ± 8.1-213 ± 25.549.0 ± 0.7U:Pu3.90 ± 0.50 × 10-3-12.1 ± 0.30.002.26-90.8 ± 2.9-257 ± 9.252.4 ± 0.3U:A1.60 ± 0.01 × 10-3-15.9 ± 0.50.002.26-103.7 ± 3.7-286 ± 10.664.4 ± 0.5U:2AA7.00 ± 1.00 × 10-4-15.3 ± 0.90.002.26-92.9 ± 7.5-253 ± 21.966.3 ± 0.5U:2AP2.80 ± 0.30 × 10-3-14.7 ± 0.30.002.26-99.4 ± 3.2-276 ± 9.561.1 ± 0.1FU:G1.86 ± 0.08 × 10-1-10.9 ± 0.40.352.65-85.1 ± 5.6-243 ± 17.148.9 ± 0.4CIU:G6.20 ± 0.53 × 10-2-11.1 ± 0.20.353.52-83.3 ± 3.1-236 ± 9.550.4 ± 0.4BrU:G2.40 ± 0.15 × 10-2-11.1 ± 0.20.383.82-83.7 ± 3.0-238 ± 9.250.0 ± 0.3IU:G3.40 ± 0.10 × 10-3-11.1 ± 0.40.354.23-85.7 ± 5.5-244 ± 17.149.9 ± 0.3T:G2.50 ± 0.20 × 10-6-11.3 ± 0.3-0.073.50-86.6 ± 3.2-246 ± 9.750.2 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Thermodynamic parameters were calculated in two ways: 1) averages from fits of individual melting curves at different concentrations using Van't Hoff calculation in the Cary WinUV Thermal software; 2) the 1/Tm versus ln CT plots fitted to the following equation (data shown as supplementary figures) for the self-complementary sequences examined here. Tm-1=(R/ΔHo)lnCT+ΔSo/ΔHo(Eq. 1) Both methods assume a two-state model and ΔCp = 0 for the transition equilibrium. The two-state approximation was assumed to be valid for sequences in which the ΔH values derived from the two methods agreed within 15% (29Allawi H.T. SantaLucia J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10581-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The ΔH values derived from the two methods agree within 15%, indicating that the two-state approximation is valid for all other sequences employed in this study. The thermodynamic parameters from fits of melting curves are reported in Table 1. The rates of MUG cleavage of oligonucleotides were determined from a gel-based electrophoresis assay as described above. To obtain data under single turnover conditions, an excess of MUG was used, and time points were obtained using a Kintec™ rapid kinetics instrument. Illustrative data are shown in Fig. 3. Kinetic constants for the single-turnover reactions against the 11 substrates examined here are shown in Table 1. The trends observed are similar to those observed previously by us under steady-state conditions (25Liu P. Burdzy A. Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); uracil mispaired with guanine (U:G) is repaired faster than uracil paired with adenine (U:A). Cleavage is observed with the halogenated uracil analogs, with cleavage rates inversely proportional to substituent size. Cleavage against mispaired 5-fluorouracil is the fastest of the series, and in this study, we can observe and measure the rate of thymine cleavage. Helix melting was measured, and the results are reported in Table 1 for each of the 11 substrates examined. The oligonucleotide substrates used in the thermal analyses are shorter than the oligonucleotides used in the enzyme cleavage assay so that the melting temperatures were within a range observable by this method. The sequence surrounding the target uracil, however, is identical for the series of oligonucleotides used in the enzyme cleavage assay and in the thermal denaturation assays. The oligonucleotides used in the thermal studies are symmetric and contain two substitutions per duplex. The duplex containing the U:G mispair has a lower helix formation energy than the U:A duplex, a result in accord with previous studies of duplexes containing mispairs (29Allawi H.T. SantaLucia J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10581-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Based upon the ΔG values, the U:HX base pair (Fig. 2) is the least stable of the base pairs examined. Both the U:G and U:HX base pairs are presumed to be in a wobble geometry (Fig. 2). The difference is the guanine 2-amino group that does not participate in base-base hydrogen bonding. The base pair formed with purine (nebularine) would likely have one hydrogen bond, whereas uracil paired with 2-aminopurine and 2-aminoadenine would form two and three hydrogen bonds, respectively (30Watkins Jr., N.E. SantaLucia Jr., J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6258-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Eritja R. Horowitz D.M. Walker P.A. Ziehler-Martin P. Boosalis M. Goodman M.F. Itakura K. Kaplan B.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8135-8153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Cheong C. Tinoco Jr., I. Chollet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5115-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Law S.M. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12329-12337Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The results observed here are in accord with the proposal that differences in oligonucleotide melting temperatures for the series of oligonucleotides examined here can be attributed to differences in base-stacking interactions, as opposed to the number of hydrogen bonds formed between bases in opposing strands (34Petruska J. Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and that base pair geometry (pseudo wobble versus pseudo Watson-Crick) modulates base stacking and melting behaviors. Upon the basis of previous studies, we examined the impact of three parameters on the rates of glycosylase cleavage: 1) stability of the helix containing the target pyrimidine, 2) size of the pyrimidine 5-substituent, and 3) the electronic-inductive property of the 5-substituent of 5-substituted pyrimidines. To investigate the impact of helix stability, we compared the rates for the subset of duplexes containing uracil paired with a series of purines. In this series, the target pyrimidine, uracil, was constant allowing the isolation of the contribution of helix stability to the relative glycosylase rate. To examine the impact of substituent size, we compared the subset of pyrimidines including the 5-fluoro, 5-chloro, 5-bromo, and 5-iodo substituents paired with guanine. Within this series of halogens, substituent size increases through the series, however, the electronic-inductive property and helix stability are relatively constant. To estimate the impact of the electronic-inductive property, we compared a subset including uracil, thymine, and 5-fluorouracil, representing an electronically neutral substituent, an electron-donating substituent, and the smallest of the electron-withdrawing substituents. The relationship between helix formation energy and MUG cleavage kinetics is shown in Fig. 4. In this series, the target pyrimidine, uracil, is constant, and the purine in the opposing strand is varied. A plot of the natural logarithm of the observed rate constant versus the free energy of helix formation reveals an inverse relationship. The trend observed is that the uracil residues from the more easily disrupted helices are most rapidly cleaved. The slope of the line is 0.63, the intercept 3.02, and the correlation coefficient (r2) is 0.85. Upon the basis of the observed relationship (Fig. 4) the relationship between helix formation energy and MUG cleavage rate can be described by Equations 2 and 3. Ink=0.63(ΔG)+3.02(Eq. 2) k=20.5e0.63(ΔG)(Eq. 3) Upon the basis of Equation 3 and the data in Table 1, the expected rate for cleavage of uracil paired with guanine (U:G) would be 2.27 × 10–2 s–1. Using this value, the rate of cleavage of uracil paired with other bases, relative to the U:G mispair, krel, ΔG, can be determined as a function of the free energy of helix formation as shown in Equation 4. krel,ΔG=(9.0×102)(e0.63(ΔG))(Eq. 4) The influence of the 5-substituent size can be estimated by examining the cleavage rates of the 5-halouracils paired with guanine. Within this series, the free energy of helix formation and the electronic-inductive properties of the 5-subsituent denoted by the Hammett meta parameter (35Hansch C. Leo A. Unger S.H. Kim K.H. Nikaitani D. Lien E.J. J. Med. Chem. 1973; 16: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar), σm are similar. In Fig. 5, the observed rate constant for MUG cleavage is plotted versus the size of the 5-substituent. The size of the 5-substituent is estimated to be the sum of the van der Waals radius (36Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1970: J3Google Scholar) and the length of the carbon-halogen bond (37Valinluck V. Wu W. Liu P. Neidigh J.W. Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An inverse relationship (Fig. 5) is observed in that the larger the size of the 5-substituent, the slower the apparent rate of MUG cleavage. The slope of the line in Fig. 5 is –0.118, the intercept is 0.50, and the correlation coefficient is 0.97. The relationship between the expected cleavage rate and the size of the pyrimidine 5-substituent can be described by Equation 5. k=(-0.118)(sizeinÅ)+0.50(Eq. 5) Upon the basis of Equation 5, the expected rate for the cleavage of a uracil analog with a 5-substituent the size of the hydrogen atom, and assuming the same electronic-inductive properties as the halogens would be 2.33 × 10–1 s–1. Therefore, the rate of cleavage of a pyrimidine analog, relative to the cleavage of uracil, can be determined as indicated in Equation 6. krel,size=(-0.05)(sizeinÅ)+2.14(Eq. 6) The predicted rate constant for glycosylase cleavage of uracil from the U:G mispair estimated from Equation 5 is 2.33 × 10–1 s–1, whereas the experimentally determined rate constant is 3.90 × 10–2 s–1. The value predicted from Equation 5 is ∼6-fold higher than the observed rate constant. However, Equation 5 was generated by comparing the measured rate constants for the halogenated derivatives. The difference between the observed rate constant for uracil cleavage and the rate constant predicted from Equation 5 suggests that the impact of substituting a hydrogen atom with a small, electron-withdrawing halogen would increase the rate constant by a factor of ∼6. The influence of the electronic-inductive properties of the 5-substituent can be estimated independently by comparing the cleavage rates for U:G with that of T:G, the only one of the substituents that is electron donating to the ring, and therefore has a negative σm, and that of FU:G, the halogen with the"

Addition of 25 γ thymine per culture to the basal medium leads to accelerated development, pupae being formed seven days after egg-laying. This represents a decrease in developmental time of one day at least over controls without thymine. Further acceleration can be obtained by addition of 20 mgm. of a yeast fraction prepared by treating yeast with hot 2 per cent sodium bicarbonate, filtering, rendering slightly acid with hydrochloric acid, and precipitating the fraction with an excess of ethanol. Pupation can then ensue five days after oviposition. That the active fraction is not nucleic acid as supplied commercially is shown by the fact that parallel cultures without the fraction, but containing additional nucleic acid, do not show the same effect."

The latter granules are not to be confused with those of the basophilic granulocyte, which have also been found in otherwise unaltered 'eosinophiles' in autochthonous hyperheparinsæmias ; truly basophilic granules are metachromatic when stained with toluidine blue, while the dark granules of the 'brassy' eosinophiles (as such cells have come to be termed in laboratory parlance) are not basophilic nor do they stain with toluidine blue. The appearance of the 'brassy' granule does not seem to be a staining artefact, as they appear preponderantly in the blood films of certain individuals even though these blood films have been subjected to identical and concurrent staining procedure with films exhibiting the scarlet eosinophilic granule."
