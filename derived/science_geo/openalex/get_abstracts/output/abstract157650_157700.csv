https://openalex.org/W2049379345,"A class of UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) defined by the presence of a C-terminal consensus sequence is found throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. Whereas mammalian enzymes use UDP-glucuronic acid, the plant enzymes typically use UDP-glucose in the transfer reactions. A diverse array of aglycones can be glucosylated by these UGTs. In plants, the aglycones include plant hormones, secondary metabolites involved in stress and defense responses, and xenobiotics such as herbicides. Glycosylation is known to regulate many properties of the aglycones such as their bioactivity, their solubility, and their transport properties within the cell and throughout the plant. As a means of providing a framework to start to understand the substrate specificities and structure-function relationships of plant UGTs, we have now applied a molecular phylogenetic analysis to the multigene family of 99 UGT sequences in<i>Arabidopsis</i>. We have determined the overall organization and evolutionary relationships among individual members with a surprisingly high degree of confidence. Through constructing a composite phylogenetic tree that also includes all of the additional plant UGTs with known catalytic activities, we can start to predict both the evolutionary history and substrate specificities of new sequences as they are identified. The tree already suggests that while the activities of some subgroups of the UGT family are highly conserved among different plant species, others subgroups shift substrate specificity with relative ease."
https://openalex.org/W2113907939,"The physiological effects of estrogens are mediated by two intracellular transcription factors, the estrogen receptors (ERs), that regulate transcription of target genes through binding to specific DNA target sequences. Here we describe alterations in cellular responses to different ER agonists and to the anti-estrogenic compound tamoxifen resulting from co-expression of the two ERs in transient co-transfection experiments. Our results demonstrate that ERβ can act as a negative or positive dominant regulator of ER activity. This is manifested through reduced transcriptional activity at low concentrations of estradiol (E2); increased antagonistic effects of tamoxifen on E2 stimulated activity; and enhanced agonistic action of the phytoestrogenic compound genistein. Furthermore, using chimeric proteins lacking the N-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1), we show that the differential responses of ERα and ERβ to different agonists and antagonists are primarily dictated by inherent differences in the C-terminal ligand-binding domains of the receptors, whereas the magnitude of transcriptional activity is influenced by ERα AF-1, but not ERβ AF-1. The ERα AF-1 activity appears to be modulated upon co-expression of both ERs. The alterations in transcriptional activity resulting from co-expression of ERα and ERβ are probably due to the formation of α/β heterodimeric complexes. This study demonstrates that co-localization and subsequent heterodimerization of ERα and ERβ may result in receptor activity distinct from that of ER homodimers."
https://openalex.org/W2048097275,"Activating mutations in the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, both germline and somatic, have been identified in human papillary renal cancer. Here we report a novel germline missense Met mutation, P1009S, in a patient with primary gastric cancer. The dosage of the mutant Met DNA was elevated in the tumor when compared to its matched normal DNA. Therefore, as with hereditary renal papillary cancer, the mutant Met allele may also be selectively duplicated in the tumor. Different from previously reported Met mutations, which occur in the tyrosine kinase domain, this missense mutation is located at the juxtamembrane domain, and is not constitutively activated. However, following treatment with HGF/SF, the P1009S mutant Met protein, expressed in NIH3T3 cells, displays increased and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation compared to the wild-type Met. Importantly, these cells also form colonies in soft agar, and are highly tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. A second nucleotide change in this region of Met, T1010I, was found in a breast cancer biopsy and a large cell lung cancer cell line. Although this previously reported ‘polymorphism’ did not stimulate NIH3T3 cell growth in soft agar, it was more active than the wild-type Met in the athymic nude mice tumorigenesis assay, suggesting that it may have effects on tumorigenesis. Met has been shown to be highly expressed in human gastric carcinoma cell lines, and our results raise the possibility that activating missense Met mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2023472659,"Akt activation requires phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and 2 (PDK1 and PDK2), respectively. While PDK1 has been cloned and sequenced, PDK2 has yet to be identified. The present study shows that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent p38 kinase activation regulates Akt phosphorylation and activity in human neutrophils. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity with SB203580 inhibited Akt Ser473phosphorylation following neutrophil stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, FcγR cross-linking, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Concentration inhibition studies showed that Ser473 phosphorylation was inhibited by 0.3 μm SB203580, while inhibition of Thr308phosphorylation required 10 μm SB203580. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with adenoviruses containing constitutively active MKK3 or MKK6 resulted in activation of both p38 kinase and Akt. Immunoprecipitation and glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down studies showed that Akt was associated with p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27 in neutrophils, and Hsp27 dissociated from the complex upon activation. Active recombinant MK2 phosphorylated recombinant Akt and Akt in anti-Akt, anti-MK2, anti-p38, and anti-Hsp27 immunoprecipitates, and this was inhibited by an MK2 inhibitory peptide. We conclude that Akt exists in a signaling complex containing p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27 and that p38-dependent MK2 activation functions as PDK2 in human neutrophils.

Akt contains a pleckstrin homology domain at its N terminus, a catalytic domain, and a short C-terminal tail, and is closely related to protein kinase A and protein kinase C in its amino- and C-terminal regions. Akt plays a critical role in mediating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival signals propagated from certain growth factors (4Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem.

Akt activation is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K),1 since wortmannin and dominant negative mutants of PI-3K block Akt activation (6Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar) and constitutively active mutants of PI-3K activate Akt (7Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M.

Activation of Akt requires that the products of PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate interact with the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and recruit it to the plasma membrane (4Marte B.M.

Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and PIP3 activate 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates Thr308 (4Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem.

Phosphorylation of Ser473 is also dependent on products of PI-3K; however, the identity of this kinase, termed PDK2, is unknown (11Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Cellular stresses, such as heat shock and hyperosmolarity, stimulate both p38 kinase and Akt activity (13Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). p38 kinase, a homologue of the yeast HOG1, is activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif by MAP kinase kinases MKK3 and MKK6 (14Garrington T.P.

Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). The activation of MKK3 and MKK6 is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues by one of several MAP kinase kinase kinases. Chemoattractant stimulation and cross-linking of Fcγ receptors stimulate PI-3K-dependent transient activation of Akt and p38 kinase in human neutrophils (16Tilton B. Andjelkovic M. Didichenko S.A.

MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), a direct target of p38, has been reported to phosphorylate Ser473 of Akt in vitro (19Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar), and activated Akt associates with a substrate of MK2, heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) (20Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Direct regulation of Akt activity by p38 kinase, however, has not been demonstrated previously. Additionally, Alessi et al. (19Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar) suggested that a role for the p38 kinase module in Akt activation was unlikely in intact cells, since IGF-1 activates Akt, but not MK2, in HEK 293 cells. The present study examined the hypothesis that p38 kinase regulates Akt activation in human neutrophils. We show for the first time that Akt activation is regulated by PI-3K-mediated p38 kinase activity in intact cells. We also report that Akt forms a stable complex with p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27 and that, upon stimulation with fMLP, Hsp27 dissociates from this complex. PD98059, SB203580, wortmannin, and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. Final concentrations used were 50 μm PD98059, 10 μm SB203580, 100 nm wortmannin, and 100 μm LY294002, except where otherwise indicated. fMLP and histone H2B were obtained from Sigma.

The synthetic EGFR peptide (NH2-RRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR-COOH) was obtained from Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO). Neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors using plasma-Percoll gradients, as described previously (21Dooley D.C. Simpson J.F. Meryman H.T. Exp. Hematol. 1982; 10: 591-599PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, neutrophils were washed and resuspended with lipopolysaccharide-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2% dextrose (Krebs). Microscopic evaluation of isolated cells treated by trypan blue exclusion indicated that 95% of cells were neutrophils and those were >98% viable. FcγR cross-linking was performed as described previously (17Coxon P.Y. Rane M.J. Powell D.W. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6530-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes 1 day prior to transfection. Immediately prior to transfection, the medium was replaced by 4 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were infected with 500 plaque-forming units of appropriate adenovirus. Following incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h, 6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum was added back to each plate. Following 20 h of incubation, cells were lysed and assayed for p38 kinase or Akt kinase activity. The synthetic MK2 inhibitory peptide or control peptide representing a portion of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was introduced into human neutrophils by incubating cells with peptide for 40 min at 37 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose before exposing the cells to hypotonic shock for 20 s to stimulate intracellular delivery of the peptide, as described previously by Zu et al. (22Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Akt kinase activity was measured by the ability of immunoprecipitated enzyme to phosphorylate histone H2B. Briefly, 1 × 107 neutrophils were prewarmed for 5 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with fMLP. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 2500 × g followed immediately by lysis in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with 2 μl of anti-Akt antiserum rotating continuously for 1 h at 4 °C and protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional 1 h. Beads were washed once each in lysis buffer and kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) and incubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 85.7 μg/ml histone H2B, and kinase buffer. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 6× Laemmli buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min, the products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and products were visualized by autoradiography. p38 MAP kinase activity was measured by assaying the ability of immunoprecipitated enzyme to phosphorylate ATF2, as described previously (23Rane M.J.

MK2 activity was measured by assaying the ability of immunoprecipitated enzyme to phosphorylate recombinant Hsp27, as described previously by Krump et al.(24Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). GST-pGEX-2T and MK2-GST-pGEX2T cDNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21PlysS, and the expression and purification of GST and GST-MK2 fusion protein was performed as described previously (25Zu Y.L. Takamatsu Y. Zhao M.J. Maekawa T. Handa H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20181-20187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK and p38 kinase and phosphorylation of Ser473 or Thr308 on Akt was determined by Western blotting with phosphospecific antisera. Following lysis, proteins were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% milk in Tween 20 Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (w/v) for 1 h. Blots were probed with appropriate phosphospecific antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin/TTBS overnight, and antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated, secondary antibody in 5% milk/TTBS for 1 h. Products were visualized by chemiluminescence. To verify equal loading of protein in each lane, the blots were stripped and reprobed for total p38, ERK, or Akt. Neutrophils (2 × 107) were prewarmed at 37 °C for 5 min prior to stimulation with or without 0.3 μm fMLP. The reactions were stopped by centrifugation followed immediately by the addition of 200 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 20 mmNaF, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, cleared lysates were incubated with 5 μl of anti-Akt antiserum, 3 μl of anti-p38, 2 μl of anti-Hsp27, or 2 μl of anti-MK2 overnight with continuous rotation at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (15 μl) were then added, and samples were rotated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed once by centrifugation in Krebs buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 3 min. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% milk/TTBS for 1 h. Blots were probed with anti-p38 (1:1000), anti-Hsp27 (1:1000), anti-MK2 (1:2000), or anti-Akt (1:1000) antiserum in 5% BSA/TTBS (w/v) and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% milk/TTBS (w/v). Products were visualized by chemiluminescence. Neutrophils (2 × 107) were lysed with 200 μl of IP lysis buffer. GST-Akt agarose, GST-MK2 Sepharose, protein A-agarose, protein A-Sepharose, or GST-Sepharose beads were added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. The beads were washed three times with Krebs buffer, and 15 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to each tube. The samples were boiled for 3 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted for p38, MK2, Hsp27, and Akt as described above. Neutrophils (2 × 107) were lysed with 200 μl of IP lysis buffer. Lysates were precleared with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Anti-Akt (3 μl), anti-MK2 (3 μl), anti-Hsp27 (3 μl), or anti-p38 (3 μl) antiserum was added to the precleared neutrophil lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Protein A-Sepharose beads (15 μl) were then added to lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Beads were washed once each in lysis buffer and kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2) and incubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 3 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1 mCi/100 μl) or 1 μm ATP, 1 μl of active recombinant MK2 (25 ng/μl), and 26 μl of kinase buffer. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min, and products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Coomassie Blue-stained regions from one-dimensional PAGE were cut from the gel in ∼1-mm3 sections and were taken for tryptic hydrolysis using a modification of the method of Jensen et al. (26Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, the gel was washed using NH4HCO3and CH3CN, and then proteins were reduced using dithiothreitol and alkyated using iodoacetamide. After washing, proteins were hydrolyzed using modified trypsin (Promega). Differences from the method of Jensen et al. (26Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar) were the use of higher (20 mm) dithiothreitol concentration, larger volume (0.1-ml) washes following alkylation, and exclusion of calcium from the trypsin mixture. Peptides were then taken for thin film spotting for matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization using α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as matrix on stainless steel targets with 1–2-μl spots. Mass spectral data were obtained using a Tof-Spec 2E (Micromass) and a 337-nm N2 laser at 20–35% power in the reflector mode. Spectral data were obtained by averaging 10 spectra, each of which was the composite of 10 laser firings. Mass axis calibration was accomplished using peaks from tryptic autohydrolysis. Data were analyzed using MassLynx ProteinProbe software and the Mascot data base. Both formyl peptide receptors and Fcγ receptors stimulate Akt phosphorylation in human neutrophils (16Tilton B. Andjelkovic M. Didichenko S.A. Hemmings B.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28096-28101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal time of stimulation, a time course of Akt Ser473phosphorylation following the addition of 3 × 10−7m fMLP or FcγR cross-linking was performed. Both agonists stimulated optimal Akt phosphorylation at 2 min (data not shown). To investigate the involvement of ERK and p38 in PI-3K-dependent Akt activation in neutrophils, we measured fMLP-stimulated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of LY294002, wortmannin, PD98059, or SB203580. Fig.1 a shows that wortmannin, LY294002, and SB203580 inhibited fMLP-stimulated Akt Ser473phosphorylation, while PD98059 had no effect. To determine whether p38 regulation of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was unique to chemoattractant receptors, we examined the effect of SB203580 on FcγR-stimulated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig.1 b). Pretreatment with SB203580 blocked Akt Ser473 phosphorylation stimulated by FcγIIa and FcγIIIb receptor cross-linking. Thus, p38 kinase inhibition attenuates both formyl peptide receptor and FcγR-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. A previous study found that SB203580 inhibited PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 at concentrations greater than 3 μm (27Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol.

To separate the effects of SB203580 on PDK1 and p38 kinase, we performed concentration inhibition experiments on phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473. Neutrophils were pretreated with varying concentrations of SB203580 for 1 h prior to stimulation with fMLP. Concentration inhibition studies showed that SB203580 reduced fMLP-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser473 at 0.3 μm, while at least 10 μm SB203580 was required to see a diminution of Thr308 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). The concentrations of SB203580 required to inhibit Akt Thr308 phosphorylation (10 μm) are ∼20-fold higher than the IC50 for p38 kinase inhibition (0.3–0.5 μm) (27Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), while Akt Ser473 phosphorylation is inhibited by SB203580 at the IC50 for p38 kinase. These results suggest that inhibition of p38 kinase attenuates Ser473 phosphorylation, while Thr308 phosphorylation is independent of p38 kinase. To determine whether p38 kinase is upstream or downstream of PI-3K in the pathway leading to Akt activation, we examined the ability of PIP3 to stimulate p38 kinase and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in neutrophils. PIP3stimulated both p38 kinase (Fig.3 a) and Akt Ser473phosphorylation (Fig. 3 b) in a time-dependent manner with optimal stimulation at 1 min. To determine whether PIP3-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was mediated by p38 kinase, neutrophils were pretreated with 10 μm SB203580 prior to the addition of PIP3. Fig. 3 b shows that SB203580 inhibited PIP3-mediated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, indicating that p38 kinase activation is necessary for PI-3K-mediated activation of Akt in human neutrophils. PIP3 also stimulated ERK activation with a time course similar to p38 activation (data not shown). Since neutrophil half-life is not long enough to allow genetic manipulation, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with adenoviruses containing empty vector, MKK3bE (constitutively active MKK3), MKK3A (dominant negative MKK3), MKK6bE (constitutively active MKK6), or MKK6A (dominant negative MKK6) to directly examine the ability of p38 kinase to stimulate Akt activation. Fig.4 a shows that MKK3bE and MKK6bE stimulated increased Akt activity, while the dominant negative mutants had no effect. Both MKK3bE and MKK6bE stimulated increased p38 kinase activity (Fig. 4 b), as measured by an in vitro kinase assay using ATF2 as substrate. Previous studies reported that MK2 phosphorylates Akt Ser473 in vitro and that Hsp27 associates only with active Akt (19Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar, 20Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Coupled with our data showing that phosphorylation of Ser473 is dependent on p38 kinase, we postulated that Akt exists in a signaling complex with MK2 and p38 kinase. Therefore, the association of Akt with p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27 was examined in unstimulated and stimulated neutrophils. Lysates prepared from unstimulated and fMLP-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody. Proteins in the immunoprecipitate were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Akt, anti-p38, anti-MK2, and anti-Hsp27. Fig.5 a shows that p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27 were all present in Akt immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells. Stimulation with fMLP resulted in a time-dependent dissociation of Hsp27 from the complex. Additionally, neutrophil lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-Hsp27, anti-MK2, or anti-p38 were immunoblotted for Akt. Akt was detected in all three immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Another method for detecting protein-protein interactions is a GST pull-down assay. GST-fused Akt or MK2 proteins were expressed inE. coli and were immobilized on glutathione-agarose or glutathione-Sepharose beads. Neutrophil lysates were incubated with the protein-immobilized beads or GST-Sepharose beads. The proteins attached to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for Akt, p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27. Fig. 5 b shows that GST-Akt was associated with p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27 and that GST-MK2 associated with Akt, p38 kinase, and Hsp27. GST-Sepharose beads alone did not bind to Akt, p38 kinase, MK2, or Hsp27 from neutrophil lysates (data not shown). A direct target of p38 kinase, MK2, phosphorylates Akt in vitro (19Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). A previous report suggested, however, that MK2 is unlikely to mediate Akt activation because agonists that activate Akt in HEK 293 cells failed to activate MK2. We examined the ability of recombinant active MK2 to phosphorylate recombinant Akt (Fig. 6 a) and Akt present in anti-Akt, anti-MK2, anti-p38, and anti-Hsp27 immunoprecipitates from human neutrophils. Fig. 6, a andb, shows that MK2 stimulated phosphorylation of a 66-kDa protein in all conditions. The phosphorylated protein was trypsin-digested, and resulting peptides were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopic analysis and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting to be Akt. Recombinant MK2 also stimulated phosphorylation of Ser473 Akt in anti-Akt, anti-MK2, and anti-Hsp27 immunoprecipitates from neutrophils (Fig.6 c). To determine whether the differences in the role of MK2 as PDK2 could be due to cell-specific differences in the Akt isoforms, we immunoblotted neutrophil lysates with anti-Akt1, anti-Akt2, and anti-Akt3 antibodies. All three isoforms of Akt were present in human neutrophils (data not shown). Zu et al. (22Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a peptide representing the phosphorylation site of Hsp27 inhibited MK2 phosphorylation of substrates. A concentration inhibition study showed that a 160 μm concentration of the MK2 inhibitory peptide was required to reduce fMLP-stimulated MK2 phosphorylation of Hsp27 (Fig. 7 a). A nonrelated peptide at the same concentration did not reduce MK2-mediated Hsp27 phosphorylation. The concentration of the MK2 peptide required was significantly greater than the 30 μm concentration reported by Zu et al. (22Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar concentration of the MK2 peptide was required to inhibit the ability of active recombinant MK2 to phosphorylate Akt from neutrophil anti-Akt immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7 b). To determine the role of MK2 in Akt phosphorylation and activation, we preincubated neutrophils with the MK2 inhibitory peptide prior to stimulation with fMLP. Intracellular delivery of the inhibitory peptide reduced both fMLP-stimulated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig. 7 c) and Akt activity (Fig. 7 d), while a nonrelated peptide had no effect. Taken together, our results indicate that MK2 phosphorylates Ser473, which leads to activation of Akt in human neutrophils. We examined the effect of pretreatment with 50 μm PD98059 on PIP3-stimulated Akt 473 phosphorylation and found that PD98059 did not alter PIP3-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting that ERK is not upstream of Akt. To determine whether ERK is downstream of Akt, we pretreated neutrophils with SB203580 prior to stimulation with fMLP and measured ERK activity by an in vitro kinase assay and by immunoblot for phospho-ERK. Inhibition of p38 kinase did not alter fMLP-stimulated ERK activity by either of the two methods (data not shown). These data suggest that ERK does not participate in the Akt signaling pathway, despite the requirement of PI-3K for ERK activation. Both Akt and p38 kinase are rapidly activated in neutrophils by a number of inflammatory mediators, and one or both kinases participate in respiratory burst activity, chemotaxis, priming, and apoptosis (17Coxon P.Y.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that activation of both kinases is mediated by products of PI-3K (18Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Our study provides evidence for the first time that p38 kinase participates in the signal transduction pathway leading to Akt activation. Akt activation requires its translocation from a cytosolic location to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation of Thr308 by PDK1, and phosphorylation of Ser473 by an unknown kinase heretofore called PDK2 (12Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). All three of these activation steps are dependent on products of PI-3K (30Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 33Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggested that phosphorylation of Ser473 was the result of autophosphorylation following PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 or was due to sequential phosphorylation of Thr308 and then Ser473 by PDK1 (34Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p38 kinase is required for PIP3-stimulated activation of p38 kinase and Akt in human neutrophils, and PIP3-dependent phosphorylation of Ser473 on Akt is inhibited by SB203580. The pyridinyl imidazole SB203580 is a relatively specific inhibitor of the α and β isoforms of p38 kinase (35Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) reported that SB203580 inhibited PDK1 at concentrations significantly greater than the IC50 for p38 kinase. We excluded this explanation for our results by demonstrating different SB203580 concentration-inhibition curves for Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation. SB203580 at the IC50for p38 kinase (0.3 μm) inhibited Ser473phosphorylation, while concentrations of SB203580 below 10 μm failed to inhibit Thr308 phosphorylation. Further evidence that p38 kinase participates in Akt activation was provided by the ability of constitutively active MKK3 and MKK6 to stimulate Akt activation following transfection into HEK 293 cells. These studies also suggest that p38 kinase-mediated Ser473phosphorylation is sufficient to induce Akt activation independent of PI-3K. Neutrophils were inadequate for these genetic studies, since they undergo constitutive apoptosis in culture resulting in survival of less than 40% of cells at 48 h (36Klein J.B. Rane M.J. Scherzer J.A. Coxon P.Y. Kettritz R. Mathiesen J.M. Buridi A. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4286-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Alessi et al. (19Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar) previously showed that MK2 phosphorylates recombinant Akt on Ser473; however, they discounted a role for MK2 in intact cells, since fibroblasts showed IGF-1-dependent Akt activation in the absence of MK2 activation. The present study demonstrates that p38 kinase-stimulated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation is mediated by MK2. Not only did active recombinant MK2 phosphorylate recombinant Akt in vitro, but Akt immunoprecipitated from neutrophil lysates was phosphorylated by active recombinant MK2 as well. Direct evidence for MK2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 in intact neutrophils was obtained using an MK2 inhibitory peptide described by Zu et al. (22Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of the inhibitory peptide into freshly isolated neutrophils inhibited phosphorylation of Hsp27 following immunoprecipitation of MK2 from fMLP-stimulated cells. Similarly, the MK2 inhibitory peptide reduced fMLP-stimulated Akt activation and Ser473 phosphorylation, while the control EGFR peptide had no affect. Taken together, these data indicate that MK2 acts as PDK2 in human neutrophils. The concept that signal transduction pathway components form multimeric complexes held together by scaffolding proteins, rather than existing free in the cytosol, has received significant experimental support recently. Scaffolding proteins have been described for two other MAP kinase modules, ERK and JNK (37Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 38Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that p38 kinase, MK2, and Akt form a signaling complex was examined. Using two separate methods, immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down, the present study shows for the first time that p38 kinase, MK2, and Akt exist as a complex that does not dissociate upon activation. Hsp27 was previously reported to associate with activated Akt (20Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the association of Hsp27 with Akt, MK2, and p38 kinase following Akt, p38, or MK2 immunoprecipitation and following GST pull-down with MK2 or Akt. Hsp27 was present in these complexes in unstimulated neutrophils. As opposed to MK2 and p38 kinase, Hsp27 dissociated from Akt immunoprecipitates following neutrophil stimulation with fMLP. Taken together, our data indicate that three components of the p38 kinase module, p38 kinase, MK2, and Hsp27, form a signaling complex with Akt. MK2, which has been shown to phosphorylate Hsp27 (39Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 40Rouse J. Cohen P.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), directly phosphorylates Ser473 on Akt. Hsp27 dissociates from the complex during stimulation, suggesting that Hsp27 performs a regulatory function. Our data do not indicate whether Hsp27 dissociates from the complex before or after translocation or phosphorylation of Akt; therefore, no conclusion as to whether Hsp27 acts as a positive or negative regulator is possible. The presence of other components in the signaling complex and the scaffolding protein that binds the complex together remain to be determined. Identity of scaffolding protein is unknown.

Hughes M.A. DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Using the motif to screen sequences in the genome and expressed sequence tag data bases ofArabidopsis, a large multigene family has been defined (2Li Y. Bauldauf S. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In plants, the conjugation of glucose to small hydrophobic molecules can lead to the formation of glucose esters or glucosides. The former are high energy compounds and have long been regarded as biosynthetic intermediates (3Mock H.P. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 575-579Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas glucosides are generally considered to represent the storage forms of the aglycones (4Höstel W. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 725-753Google Scholar). Both transfer reactions are suggested to occur in the cytoplasm of cells (5Pflugmacher S. Sandermann H. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 507-511Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with the attachment of glucose providing access to membrane transport systems and passage into either the vacuole (6Schmitt R.

It has been known for many years that plant hormones can be glycosylated, although the role of the conjugates is not well defined (8Sembdner G. Atzorn R. Schneider G. Plant Mol.

The maize iaglu gene encodes a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT)1 that forms the 1-O-indole acetyl glucose ester (IAGlc), the glucosylated conjugate of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA plays a central role in most, if not all, aspects of a plant's existence, providing a means of transducing external environmental changes into internal adaptive responses. The hormone is known to exist as the free acid and in conjugated form linked to a wide variety of compounds such as amino acids, peptides, and sugars (10Cohen J.D. Bandurski R.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 403-430Crossref Google Scholar). Many studies have used maize as a model to analyze IAA conjugates. In this species, the glucose conjugate is found in small amounts in vegetative tissue and has been shown to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of IAA-myoinositol (19Michalczuk L. Bandurski R.S. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a putative intercellular transport form of IAA from endosperm to shoot (20Nowacki J. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 422-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The myoinositol conjugate has been found to be further glycosylated to form IAA-myoinositol galactoside and IAA-myoinositol arabinoside (21Corcuera L.J. Michalczuk L. Bandurski R.S. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All of these conjugates of IAA have been identified in maize seeds and are thought to represent storage forms, which upon hydrolysis could release free IAA to the seedling (22Epstein E. Cohen J.D. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the principal conjugates found in vegetative tissue are the amide-linked conjugates (90%). The ester-linked conjugates are also found, but in much smaller amounts (10%). IAGlc makes up about 34% of this ester pool in 12-day-old plants (23Tam Y.Y. Epstein E. Normanly J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The IAA conjugates are suggested to be storage forms of IAA (24Bandurski R.S. Cohen J.D. Slovin J.P. Reinecke D.M. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones: Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 39-65Crossref Google Scholar, 25Bartel B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Clearly, the field of IAA conjugation is complex and, while many of the enzymes involved in these interconversions have been partially purified, the identification of their corresponding genes would open up the possibility of taking a genetic route to understanding the events that occur and their consequences in the plant. Although theiaglu gene of maize was identified 6 years ago, its product was neither purified nor characterized biochemically, and no further studies on the gene have been undertaken. Despite the availability of the iaglu for cross-hybridization and homology searching within the Arabidopsis genome, no corresponding gene product with demonstrable IAA conjugating activity has been published to date. The availability of a detailed phylogenetic analysis of theArabidopsis UGT multigene family has now made it feasible to screen likely family members for IAA-UGT activity. This study identifies an Arabidopsis gene encoding an IAA-UGT and provides detailed biochemical analysis of the gene product. Wild-type Arabidopsis, ecotype Columbia, were grown in Levington's seed and modular compost in a controlled environment of 16/8 h light-dark cycle (22 °C, 220 microeinsteins−2 s−1light, 18 °C, dark). After 4 weeks, tissue from leaf, stem (all vertical nonleaf or nonflower tissue), root, and inflorescence (flowers at all stages of development including siliques) were harvested for RNA extraction. 6-Week-old tissue was used to analyze the steady-state levels of mRNA in siliques. Young siliques were the first nine from the tip, and all of the subsequent siliques were classified as old.

Voges D. Huber R. Demange P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Lysozyme (1 mg) and 14 ml of half-strength Spheroblast buffer were added immediately. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the cells were harvested again by centrifugation and osmotically shocked in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The protein in the supernatant fraction was collected by adding 100 μl of 50% glutathione-coupled Sepharose gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and recovered in elution buffer (20 mm reduced form glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein assays were carried out with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye using bovine serum albumin as reference. The purified recombinant proteins were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE following the methods described by Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The general glucosyltransferase activity assay mix (200 μl) contained 2 μg of purified recombinant proteins, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm UDPG, 1 mm IAA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 20 μl of trichloroacetic acid (240 mg/ml). The reaction mix was analyzed using the HPLC method. Reverse phase HPLC was performed with a Waters HPLC system (Waters Separator 2690 and Waters Tunable Absorbance Detector 486; Waters Ltd., Herts, UK) and a Columbus 5-μm C18 column (250 × 4.60 mm; Phenomenex). A linear gradient with increasing methanol (solvent B) against distilled H2O (solvent A) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 30 min was used to separate the glucose conjugates from their aglycone. Both solvents contained 0.01% H3PO4 (pH 3.0). The following elution conditions were used: IAA, 10–48% B, λdetection 230 nm; IBA, IPA, NAA, 5-OH-IAA, and 2-ox-IAA, 10–70% B, λdetection 230 nm; 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and pichloram, 10–100% B, λdetection 287 nm. The cinnamic acids were analyzed under the conditions described previously (27Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in 200 μl of 100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm UDPG, 1 mm IAA. After 1 h of incubation (or 6 h for isomer analysis) with 5 μg of the enzyme at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of acetone. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried in vacuo. The product of the reaction was then separated from the substrates using two Isolute SPE columns, SAX (anion exchanger) and Env+ (hydrophobic), arranged in tandem. Eluate from the Env+ column was dried, dissolved in 500 μl of acetonitrile, and derivatized withN,O-bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide/trimethylchlorosilane (Pierce), and 1 μl was injected into the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. Half of the sample for isomer analysis was treated with hydroxylamine prior to the silylation withN,O-bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide/trimethylchlorosilane. The column used for analysis was a 15-m × 0.25-mm Chromopack CP-SIL 24CB, and injector temperature was set to 280 °C. After the injection (splitless), the column temperature was held at 80 °C for 2 min and then increased at the rate of 20 °C/min to 200 °C, and 4 °C/min to 280 °C. Column effluent was introduced into the ion source of a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer. Ion source and a gas chromatography interface were held at 270 °C. Ions were generated with 70 eV at an ionization current of 300 μA. A mass spectrometer operated in full scan mode with an acceleration voltage of −10 kV, scan range between m/z 40 and 800, and ion multiplier set to −1.2 kV. The IAA-UGT activity was determined as the release of UDP, which can be measured using a coupled assay containing UGT, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (30Kowalczyk S. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanisms are shown as the following. IAA+UDPG⇔IAA­Glc+UDPPEP+UDP⇔UTP+pyruvatePyruvate+NADH+H+⇔lactate+NAD+REACTIONS1–3The reaction mix, in a total volume of 1.0 ml, contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 2.5 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 0.15 mm NADH, 2.0 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 μl of UGT solution (diluted into 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6), 3.0 units of pyruvate kinase, and 4.0 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The coupled enzyme assay was analyzed over the range 0–5 mm UDPG and 0–1 mm IAA together with a control at the same concentration of UDPG but with no IAA nor UGT. The change of NAD+ was detected at 340 nm, and the reaction rate was converted to the unit millikatals kg−1 using the extinction coefficient 6.22 × 103m−1 cm−1for NADH. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared using the sucrose solution method (31Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). A 100-μl bed volume of phospholipids (Sigma) was homogenized in distilled H2O, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. the pellet was resuspended in 240 mm sucrose and was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The liposomes were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in 100 μl in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, with or without 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2). An aliquot of 10 μl was used for inhibition assays, and 80 μl was used for binding assays. UGT84B1 or a recombinant tomato annexin Rp35 (32Lim E.-K. Roberts M.R. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34920-34925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with liposomes in the presence of binding buffer. Nonbound protein in the supernatant was separated from the liposomes by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (100 μl) was added to 20 μl of SDS loading buffer. The pellet was washed in 5 volumes of binding buffer, and 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES containing 5 mm EDTA was added to elute protein bound to the liposomes. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing EDTA-eluted protein was added to 20 μl of SDS loading buffer. All of the samples were subsequently boiled for 5 min, and 25 μl of each sample was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Total RNA was extracted from plant tissue by the hot phenol method (33Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) and quantified by spectrophotometry. The integrity was checked by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 15 μg of each sample was then treated with RNase-free RQ1 DNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was then extracted with phenol and chloroform, and the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol. The integrity of the RNA was again checked by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. Reverse transcription was carried out using a superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) for first strand cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer's instructions using an oligo(dT) primer. UGT84B1-specific PCR was then performed using primers 5′-CGGCATATGATGGGCAGTAGTGAGGGTC-3′ (5′ for 84B1) and 5′-CGGGTCGACGGCGATTGTGATATCACTAATG-3′ (3′ for 84B1). The PCR (100 μl) was set up by mixing 2 μl of first strand cDNA, 1× PCR buffer (Promega), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.25 mm each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The PCR was carried out in an MJ Research PTC-200 thermal cycler with 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 2 min of annealing at 62 °C, and 4 min of extension at 74 °C. The reaction was completed by one cycle of 5 min at 74 °C. The PCR products were then analyzed by 1% (w/v) agarose gel. After separation, the PCR products were transferred onto nylon membrane and probed with a radiolabeled UGT84B1 DNA fragment (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Earlier work suggested that only one subgroup of putative glucosyltransferase sequences in the Arabidopsis genome encodes enzymes forming glucosyl esters (2Li Y. Bauldauf S. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 27Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This subgroup was analyzed for activity in synthesizing the glucose ester of IAA. The sequences were cloned and used to produce soluble recombinant fusion proteins with GST inEscherichia coli (Fig.1 A). Following purification, some of these fusion proteins proved to be particularly unstable, releasing GST (26 kDa) as a separate polypeptide. This is a common observation with this fusion system (34Piers K.L. Brown M.H. Hancock R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Each of these 10 recombinant proteins was screened for putative UGT activity toward IAA including the protein corresponding to the previously annotated IAA-UGT inArabidopsis data bases (35Graham R. Thornbury C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1004Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Only four out of all of the sequences consistently produced a more hydrophilic compound eluting more rapidly in the methanol gradient. The data shown correspond to an assay time of 1 h at 30 °C to visualize the trace activities seen for UGT75B1, UGT75B2, and UGT84B2. The major activity was always observed with UGT84B1, which reached equilibrium rapidly and did not go beyond 32% conversion under any of the conditions assayed. A pH profile of enzyme activity indicated a broad optimum from pH 6 to 7.5 (data not shown). Under conditions described above, in which the assay was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid, only a single peak of product was observed, and this comigrated on HPLC with a known standard of IAGlc (Fig.1 B). However, spontaneous nonenzymatic rearrangement into the 2-O, 4-O, and 6-O glucose esters of IAA (30Kowalczyk S. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) could be observed when the reaction was not stopped by trichloroacetic acid addition (Fig. 1 C). These multiple peaks were found to be hydrolyzable by 1 n NaOH (Fig.1 C), and all, as shown in Fig. 1 D, contained radioactive glucose from UDP-[U-14C]glucose. The mass spectrum of the main reaction product (Fig.2) was identical to the previously published spectrum (36Ehmann A. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 34: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the spectrum of synthetic IAGlc (37Jakas A. Magnus V. Horvat S. Sandberg G. J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 1993; 33: 933-939Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Transitions from the molecular ion (m/z 697) tom/z 653 (expulsion of CO) andm/z 450 (hydrogen rearrangement and cleavage of the ester linkage) are specific for glucose 1-O esters. Ions of m/z 229 and 247 indicate the presence of the ester-linked indole-3-acetyl group, while the ion series ofm/z 147, 191, 204, 217, 271, and 361 is characteristic for the glucosyl part of the molecule. Three isomers were also identified as 2-O-, 4-O-, and 6-O-(indole-3-acetyl)-d-glucose, and the position of IAA linkage was verified by analysis of the corresponding oximes (data not shown). Enzyme activity was first compared using two assays: one based on HPLC and a second based on a coupled assay in which NADH oxidation was followed. Both methods gave comparable results (data not shown). However, the use of the coupled assay can avoid the establishment of equilibrium of the glucosyltransferase reaction, so it was employed in most of the following studies. The data shown are those for the intact fusion protein; however, removal of GST from the recombinant UGT was found to have no effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). A range of compounds with similar structure to IAA (Fig.3) were tested as potential substrates for both UGT84B1 and UGT84B2, UGT75B1, and UGT75B2 that had also been shown to have trace activities against IAA. As shown in TableI, at a substrate concentration of 1 mm, UGT84B1 has the highest activity toward IAA, with significant activity also shown toward IBA, IPA, and cinnamic acid. The other proteins only showed low activity toward these additional substrates. The activity of UGT84B1 toward indole acetyl aspartate, indole acetyl glutamate, indole acetyl alanine, and indole acetaldehyde was also tested and found to be zero (data not shown). In addition to UDPG, the ability of UDP-galactose and UDP-xylose to act as sugar donors was investigated and found to be negative.Table ISpecific activity of UGT84B1, UGT84B2, UGT75B1, and UGT75B2 with different substratesSubstrateSpecific activity (mkat/kg)UGT84B1UGT84B2UGT75B1UGT75B2ICA 5.9NDNDNDIAA159.07.22.72.8IPA97.03.710.85.5IBA112.06.225.32.85-OH IAA57.42.31.33.6tryptophan 2.2NDNDND2-Ox-IAA 2.2NDNDNDCinnamic acid71.62.310.71.4p-Coumaric acid26.9NDNDNDCaffeic acid 2.8NDNDNDFerulic acid28.8NDNDNDSinapic acid 5.6NDNDNDNAA33.01.22.70.82,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2.1NDNDNDPichloram 0.7NDNDNDIAA + UDP-galactose 0.2NDNDNDIAA + UDP-xylose 0.2NDNDNDAll assays were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmpotential substrate, 5 mm UDPG, and 0.5–25 μg/ml enzyme.

The effect of metal ions on UGT activity is shown in Table II. Some increase in relative activity was observed with Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+, which was abolished by the addition of EGTA/EDTA. Inclusion of UDP led to a decrease in activity, either arising from product inhibition or from a shift in equilibrium of the reaction that is known to be reversible (30Kowalczyk S. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). No effects were observed with the addition of either zeatin or dihydrozeatin.Table IIEffect of potential activators and inhibitors on the activity of UGT84B1Potential inhibitor or activatorRelative activity%3 mmMgCl2125.2 ± 3.53 mm CaCl2122.2 ± 3.73 mmMnCl2151.4 ± 6.85 mm EDTA98.4 ± 6.35 mm EGTA96.0 ± 3.73 mm MgCl2 + 5 mm EDTA + 5 mmEGTA96.2 ± 4.23 mm CaCl2 + 5 mm EDTA + 5 mm EGTA94.1 ± 1.83 mm MnCl2 + 5 mm EDTA + 5 mmEGTA92.9 ± 2.44 mm pyrophosphate96.0 ± 5.31 mm UDP37.3 ± 2.31 mmzeatin97.3 ± 2.01 mm dihydrozeatin95.9 ± 1.01 mm cinnamic acid95.2 ± 1.2Each assay contained 1 μg/ml UGT84B1, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm IAA, and 5 mm UDPG and was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min.

Results represent the average of three independent replicates ± S.D. The initial rate of activity (millikatals kg−1) at differing concentrations (mm) of both IAA and UDPG is plotted in Fig.4. The results indicate that a ternary complex is required for catalysis. Confirmation of this requirement for both IAA and UDPG binding to the enzyme before catalysis was obtained by results of incubations involving only UGT84B1 and UDPG, in which no free UDP could be detected (data not shown). The inset shows the secondary plots of these data. TableIII summarizes the kinetic analysis for IAA and three other substrates: IBA, IPA, and cinnamic acid. The data show that, in vitro, IBA, IPA, and cinnamic acid are substrates comparable with IAA. Competition experiments were used to compare IAA with the other two naturally occurring substrates, IBA and cinnamic acid (Fig. 5). Conjugation of IAA or IBA is barely affected by the presence of cinnamic acid. When IAA and IBA compete with each other, IAA is found to be a better competitor. This suggests that IAA is the preferred substrate when compared with cinnamic acid and IBA.Table IIIKinetic parameters for UGT84B1SubstrateK msubstrateK m UDPGV maxmmmmmillikatals/kgIAA0.24 ± 0.090.25 ± 0.07180 ± 30IBA0.15 ± 0.03ND122 ± 28IPA0.14 ± 0.03ND113 ± 32Cinnamic acid0.18 ± 0.04ND83 ± 8The coupled assay was used to determine the kinetic parameters of UGT84B1.

A hydrophobicity plot of UGT84B1 indicated hydrophobic regions in the protein sequence, suggesting a possible site(s) of interaction with hydrophobic substrate(s) and/or membrane phospholipids. The effect of phospholipids on UGT84B1 was investigated in two ways. First, a direct effect of including phospholipids with differing charges (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidic acid) on enzyme activity was analyzed, but no change was observed (data not shown). Second, binding of the UGT84B1 to phospholipids was investigated: again, no effect was observed. As shown in Fig. 6, in contrast to a tomato annexin (Rp35), a soluble protein known to bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent interaction (32Lim E.-K. Roberts M.R. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34920-34925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), UGT84B1 was recovered in the soluble fraction under all conditions assayed. The sequenceUGT84B1 was identified in the genome data base as a putative UGT on the basis of a UDP-glucose binding motif previously reported (1Hughes J. Hughes M.A. DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, no expressed sequence tag had been found to correspond toUGT84B1; therefore, there was no direct evidence to show the gene is expressed in planta. Fig.7 shows the results of analyzingUGT84B1 mRNA levels. Clearly, the data, based on RT-PCR, show that UGT84B1 transcripts are highly abundant in siliques and inflorescence with relatively low levels of expression observed in root tissue. The near completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequencing project provides an opportunity to identify novel plant genes on the basis of homology searching. In this study, we have used a characteristic signature motif, previously shown to define a family of UGTs encompassing UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and UDP-glucosyltransferases from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Hughes J. Hughes M.A. DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A detailed phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis multigene family encoding the enzymes has shown that 12 groups (A–L) can be distinguished on the basis of their sequence and pattern of intron gain (2Li Y. Bauldauf S. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In particular, a subfamily in group L has been identified in biochemical analyses of recombinant proteins to form glucose esters (27Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These studies provided the basis for screeningArabidopsis UGTs for their ability to form the glucose ester conjugate of IAA. When the recombinant proteins were analyzed for their ability to glucosylate IAA, only one, UGT84B1, showed high activity. Interestingly, the closest relative of UGT84B1, with greater than 80% identity, had only trace activity toward IAA. Six of these recombinant proteins, including UGT84B1, are active toward cinnamates (27Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Previously, the only gene that has been identified to encode a UGT of IAA is the maize iaglu (16Szerszen J.B. Szczyglowski K. Bandurski R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 1699-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In that study, the gene was found by screening an expression library with antibodies raised against a maize UGT. Following heterologous expression of the gene in E. coli, the bacterial extract was shown to have UGT activity toward IAA. The maize sequence has been used for many years to identify putative IAA-UGT in the Arabidopsis genome and expressed sequence tag data bases. For example, based on their close sequence homology, UGT75D1 has been annotated as an IAA-UGT (34Piers K.L. Brown M.H. Hancock R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, analysis of recombinant protein from this sequence for activity toward IAA has proved negative. The fact that UGT84B2 with greater than 80% identity to UGT84B1 and existing within the same plant species has only negligible activity toward IAA demonstrates that sequence comparison alone cannot be used to predict substrate specificity. This study shows that in the in vitro assay, the recombinant enzyme from UGT84B1 conjugates IBA, IPA, and cinnamic acid in addition to IAA. The K m values for IAA, IBA, IPA, and cinnamic acid are nearly identical, although competition experiments indicate that IAA is the preferred substrate for UGT84B1 when compared with cinnamic acid and IBA (Table III, Fig. 5). The interaction of UGT84B1 and IAA is complex and can be affected by a number of factors. The specificity studies indicate that the chain length of the carboxyl group is important, since UGT84B1 has very low activity toward ICA. The enzyme activity is further affected by the hydroxyl groups on the indole and benzyl rings. A 64% decrease in the activity has been observed with 5-OH IAA compared with that with IAA. A similar effect has been found with the cinnamates. Caffeic acid, which has two hydroxyl groups on the benzyl ring, shows the lowest activity among the cinnamates. In addition, the enzyme has extremely low activity toward 2-oxIAA, an IAA derivative containing a carbonyl group at position 2 on the indole ring (Table I, Fig. 3). There are no previous data available on a purified IAA-UGT, since the maize enzyme was analyzed only as a partial purified extract (38Kowalczyk S. Bandurski R.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Leznicki A.J. Bandurski R.S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the recombinant product of the maize iaglu gene was neither purified nor characterized (16Szerszen J.B. Szczyglowski K. Bandurski R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 1699-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The properties of the recombinant enzyme analyzed in this study are different from those described for the partially purified IAA-UGT from maize, with respect to the lack of inhibition by cytokinins and lack of effect of phospholipids, whereas the dependence on metal ions and reducing conditions are identical. Cinnamic acid, IPA, and IBA were not tested as potential substrates of the maize enzyme. Similar levels of trace activities for enzymes of the two species were observed toward ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid. This study is a biochemical characterization of a recombinant protein using an in vitro assay. As yet, the relationships of this activity to events that occur within the plant are unknown. For example, both IBA and IAA glucose conjugates have been identified in plants, including Arabidopsis (23Tam Y.Y. Epstein E. Normanly J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Epstein E. Ludwig-Müller J. Physiol. Plantarum. 1993; 88: 382-389Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 41Ludwig-Müller J. Epstein E. Plant Growth Regul. 1993; 13: 189-195Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). IAA is the preferred substrate for UGT84B1 in vitro, but in planta the enzyme may glucosylate both IAA and IBA dependent on cell specificity of expression, relative availability of substrate(s), and relative compartmentalization of enzyme and substrate(s). Preliminary analysis of the tissue-specific expression ofUGT84B1 in Arabidopsis plants showed the highest level of expression in the siliques, when steady-state levels ofUGT84B1 mRNA were detectable even in Northern analysis of total RNA. Results from RT-PCR, however, demonstrate transcripts of the gene are also present in the root. Experiments are currently under way using a UGT84B1 promoter-reporter gene system to define more closely which cells express the UGT. Parallel phenotypic characterization of transgenic Arabidopsis plants either overexpressing UGT84B1 or with the gene knocked out by a nonautonomous dSpm transposable element insertion will provide essential information on the function of the IAA-UGT.

https://openalex.org/W2022965367,"Sinapic acid is a major phenylpropanoid in Brassicaceae providing intermediates in two distinct metabolic pathways leading to sinapoyl esters and lignin synthesis. Glucosyltransferases play key roles in the formation of these intermediates, either through the production of the high energy compound 1-<i>O</i>-sinapoylglucose leading to sinapoylmalate and sinapoylcholine or through the production of sinapyl alcohol-4-<i>O</i>-glucoside, potentially leading to the syringyl units found in lignins. While the importance of these glucosyltransferases has been recognized for more than 20 years, their corresponding genes have not been identified. Combining sequence information in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genomic data base with biochemical data from screening the activity of recombinant proteins<i>in vitro</i>, we have now identified five gene sequences encoding enzymes that can glucosylate sinapic acid, sinapyl alcohol, and their related phenylpropanoids. The data provide a foundation for future understanding and manipulation of sinapate metabolism and lignin biology in <i>Arabidopsis</i>."

The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that metallothionein also protects from DNA and lipoprotein damage induced by peroxynitrite, an important reactive nitrogen species that causes a diversity of pathological processes. A cell-free system was used. DNA damage was detected by the mobility of plasmid DNA in electrophoresis. Oxidation of low density lipoprotein was measured by a thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance, which was confirmed by lipid hydroperoxide assay. Plasmid DNA damage and low density lipoprotein oxidation were induced by 3-morpholinosydnomine, which produces peroxynitrite through the reaction between nitric oxide and superoxide anion or by synthesized peroxynitrite directly. DNA damage by 3-morpholinosydnomine was prevented by both metallothionein and superoxide dismutase, whereas the damage caused by peroxynitrite was prevented by metallothionein only. The oxidation of low density lipoprotein by 3-morpholinosydnomine and peroxynitrite was also significantly inhibited by metallothionein.

Several studies have demonstrated that MT is able to quench a wide range of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS or RNS) including superoxide (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO⋅), and nitric oxide (NO) at a higher efficiency than other well known antioxidants such as GSH, SOD, and catalase (6Thornalley P.J.

Whether MT reacts with ONOO− is unknown. Many studies have demonstrated that exposure of cells to 3-morpholinosydnomine (SIN-1) or directly to ONOO− caused apoptotic cell death through an activation of p38 MAPK (9Schieke S.M. Briviba K. Klotz L.O. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Oh-hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

There is also increasing evidence indicating that ONOO− causes mitochondrial structural changes, leading to the release of cytochromec and thereby activating caspase-3 and causing apoptosis (12Gadelha F.R.

It is well known that the cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), an important anticancer agent, is mainly due to the formation of ROS and RNS (4Kang Y.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Among these reactive free radicals derived from DOX, ONOO− has been considered as the major species that leads to the oxidative damage (15Vasquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 16Weinstein D.M. Mihm M.J. Bauer J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar). Because MT inhibits both DOX-activated p38 MAPK and DOX-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (17Kang Y.J. Zhou Z.X. Wang G.W. Buridi A. Klein J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13690-13698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it is possible that MT reacts with ONOO−. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that MT directly protects from ONOO−-induced oxidative damage. A cell-free system was used to avoid the influence of other cellular enzymes and antioxidants and the interaction of ONOO− with other ROS and RNS in the cell. DNA damage and oxidation of LDL were determined as indexes of ONOO−-induced oxidative damage, because DNA is a sensitive target (18Szabo C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 19Grace S.C. Salgo M.G. Pryor W.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and lipoproteins are also sensitive to ONOO−-induced oxidative damage (20Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 21Hermann M. Kapiotis S. Hofbauer R. Exner M. Seelos C. Held I. Gmeiner B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). MT, SOD, LDL, pTZ 18U plasmid DNA, agarose, and SIN-1 and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Phosphate buffer was prepared to contain 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.4 (21Hermann M. Kapiotis S. Hofbauer R. Exner M. Seelos C. Held I. Gmeiner B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To eliminate the contamination of transition metals such as copper and iron, the phosphate buffer was treated by Chelex 100 according to the instruction manual from Bio-Rad. Lipid hydroperoxide assay kit was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Peroxynitrite was synthesized from nitrite and H2O2 in an acidic medium and rapidly quenched in NaOH as described previously (22Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The solution was frozen at −20 °C, and ONOO− concentrated in the upper layer was collected. Its concentration was measured at 302 nm and calculated with a molar extinction coefficient of 1670m−1 cm−1(22Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA strand breaks in supercoiled DNA were analyzed after agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (19Grace S.C. Salgo M.G. Pryor W.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pTZ 18U plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) was treated with 0.1–1.0 mm SIN-1 at 37 °C or with 0.05–1.0 mm ONOO− at room temperature (22–23 °C) in phosphate buffer with or without the presence of MT. The solution was immediately mixed after addition of SIN-1 or ONOO− because under these conditions ONOO− spontaneously decays with a half-life of less than 2 s. The reaction solution (30 μl) was mixed with 3 μl of electrophoresis loading buffer and loaded onto a 1.0% agarose gel prepared in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was carried out for 2 h at 71 mV. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 15 min, destained for 30 min, and then visualized under UV light and photographed. To quantitatively analyze DNA damage, the density of supercoiled (SC) DNA band and open circle (OC, see Fig. 1 A) DNA band was measured by Multi-Analysis Software from Bio-Rad. The percentage of density of the OC DNA band to total density of the OC and SC DNA bands was considered the percentage of DNA damage as shown in Fig. 1. LDL (1 mg/ml) was treated with 0.05–1.0 mm SIN-1 at 37 °C or ONOO− at room temperature for 18 h in the phosphate buffer with or without MT. LDL oxidation products were measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS). Briefly, a 20-μl LDL sample (1 mg/ml) was added into 20 μl of 8.1% SDS, 150 μl of 20% acetate buffer (pH 3.5), and 210 μl of 0.57% thiobarbituric acid (TBA buffer, made fresh) (23Wang G.W. Schuschke D.A. Kang Y.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H167-H175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 70 min. After cooling and addition of 100 μl of deionized water, 500 μl of a butanol/pyridine mixture (15:1) was added. They were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The absorbance was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 540 nm. Malondialdehyde concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1.78 × 105 nmol of TBARS/g of protein. All experiments were performed three times, and results were presented as mean ± S.E. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and multiple comparison. The significant level was accepted at p < 0.05(*). When pTZ 18U plasmid DNA was exposed to SIN-1, the native SC DNA was converted to a relaxed OC DNA with single strand breaks (Fig. 1 A). This effect of SIN-1 was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). Although this damage was also time-dependent, it reached a maximum damage level within 3 h of exposure to SIN-1 at 37 °C (Fig. 1, Aand C). In the presence of MT, the extent of SIN-1-mediated DNA damage decreased in a MT dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1,D and E). Because SIN-1 produces NO and O⨪2 simultaneously in physiological solution at 37 °C and the reaction between NO and O⨪2 leads to the formation of ONOO−, DNA damage by SIN-1 is thus assumed to be the effect of ONOO−. To explore the possibility that MT prevents SIN-1-induced DNA damage through the reaction between MT and ONOO−, synthesized ONOO− was added directly to the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 2 A, ONOO− is able to induce DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner, and MT conveyed significant protection from this damage (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that MT is a potent scavenger of the ONOO−radical. To further determine the specificity of MT reaction with ONOO−, the effect of SOD on DNA damage induced by SIN-1 and ONOO− was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, SOD (12.5 units in 30-μl reaction system, which equals about 4.0 μm SOD) is able to prevent DNA damage caused by 0.1 mm SIN-1, but not by ONOO−.Figure 2Effect of MT on ONOO−-induced DNA damage in the presence or absence of MT. Experimental conditions were as described in Fig. 1, except that room temperature (22–23 °C) was used for ONOO−.

Experiments are carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Exposure time is 3 h for both SIN-1 and ONOO−, and 37 °C and 25 °C were used for SIN-1 and ONOO−, respectively. N represents no additions other than SC DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When LDL was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with SIN-1 (1.0 mm), lipid peroxidation was detected by the TBARS assay. The same oxidative damaging effect of the synthesized ONOO− on LDL was also detected. Both SIN-1 and synthesized ONOO− induced a dose-dependent oxidative injury to LDL (Fig. 4 A). MT significantly protected LDL from peroxidation by SIN-1 or ONOO− (Fig. 4 B). The TBARS result was confirmed by a lipid hydroperoxide assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), and the same protective effect of MT was observed (data not shown). In the present study, we provide, for the first time, direct evidence that MT can react with ONOO− to protect DNA and lipoprotein from oxidative damage. This further extends our understanding of the characteristics of MT antioxidant action. The reaction of MT with ONOO− is particularly important in preventing oxidative tissue injury because ONOO− has been shown to be highly responsible for pathogenesis under a diversity of disease conditions. These include inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease, myocardial dysfunction, and environmental toxicity (19Grace S.C. Salgo M.G. Pryor W.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 24Mates J.M. Sanchez-Jimenez F.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The role of ONOO− in pathogenesis has been demonstrated to be associated with its interaction with the MAPK signaling pathway. Exposure of cultured cells to SIN-1 or directly to ONOO−caused immediate activation of p38 MAPK with the induction of apoptotic cell death, suggesting the role of ONOO− in activating signaling transduction pathways capable of inducing apoptosis (9Schieke S.M. Briviba K. Klotz L.O. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Oh-hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Jope R.S. Zhang L. Song L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190, only partially reduced the activation of caspase-3 and apoptotic cell death caused by ONOO− (10Oh-hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggests that the activation of p38 MAPK is only one of the pathways induced by ONOO− for the activation of caspase-3 and induction of apoptosis. Other pathways leading to caspase-3 activation and apoptosis may be involved in ONOO−-induced pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that ONOO− causes mitochondrial structural and functional alterations through lipid peroxidation and protein sulfhydryl oxidation (12Gadelha F.R. Thomson L. Fagian M.M. Costa A.D. Radi R. Vercesi A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Borutaite V. Morkuniene R. Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These changes lead to cytochrome c release from mitochondria. This in turn results in activation of caspase-3 through activated caspase-9 by cytochrome c. In addition, it has been shown that ONOO− directly reacts with cytochromec in a cell-free system (14Cassina A.M. Hodara R. Souza J.M. Thomson L. Castro L. Ischiropoulos H. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In our recent studies, we have demonstrated that MT prevents DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis through inhibition of p38 MAPK activation (17Kang Y.J. Zhou Z.X. Wang G.W. Buridi A. Klein J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13690-13698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We also have observed that MT inhibited mitochondrial cytochrome c release induced by DOX. 2G. W. Wang, J. B. Klein, and Y. J. Kang, submitted for publication. It has been well known that DOX generates ROS and RNS in the myocardium. However, the species of ROS or RNS responsible for the pathogenesis has not been known until recently. DOX binds to the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase and undergoes endothelial nitric-oxide synthase-mediated reduction to become the semiquinone radical (15Vasquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This leads to generation of ONOO− and H2O2. Furthermore, the hypothesis that DOX-induced cardiac toxicity is associated with the accumulation of ONOO− formation has been proven in the intact animals treated with DOX (16Weinstein D.M. Mihm M.J. Bauer J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar). The present study has an important implication of understanding the mechanism of action of MT in preventing DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The induction of apoptotic cell death is an important mechanism of cardiotoxicity, and the formation of ONOO− plays a critical role in this mechanism. In particular, the protection by MT against DOX-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes has been shown to be associated with inhibition of both p38 MAPK activation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. MT may react with ONOO− to block the activation of p38 MAPK and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. This consequently leads to the protection by MT against DOX-induced apoptosis in mouse myocardiumin vivo and cardiomyocytes in vitro. In this study, we observed that ONOO−-induced DNA damage was protected by MT, but the protection was not directly dose-dependent on MT concentrations (Fig. 2 B). It is possible that the kinetics of reactions of ONOO−with MT and DNA define the protective effect of MT rather than its concentration because ONOO− is a very short-lived species in solution (t12 ≈ 2 s). Another explanation is the use of commercial MT, which may contain a limited amount of copper. Copper is a transition metal that generates HO⋅ radical in the presence of reductant such as ascorbate and O⨪2 through the Fenton reaction. DNA is a very sensitive target of HO⋅ (25Cai L. Koropatnick J. Cherian M.G. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1995; 96: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The fact that commercial MT contains copper and that RNS can react with MT to release metals from MT have been demonstrated (26Misra R.R. Hochadel J.F. Smith G.T. Cook J.C. Waalkes M.P. Wink D.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility in the present study, we have monitored the absorbance at 480 nm in the presence of bathocuproinedisulfonic acid along with MT, ONOO−, and H2O2. If copper is released from MT, a complex of cuprous with bathocuproinedisulfonic acid will be formed (25Cai L. Koropatnick J. Cherian M.G. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1995; 96: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the increase in the absorbance in proportion to MT concentrations will be observed. This phenomenon was indeed apparent (data not shown). Therefore, a balance between MT protection and more DNA damage induced by copper released from MT may be reached, leading to no further protection with increased MT concentrations (Fig. 2 B). Although further study is required to fully understand the characteristics of MT protection against ONOO−-induced DNA damage, the present study provides the first evidence that MT protects from ONOO−-induced DNA and protein damage."
https://openalex.org/W2256062038,"Adult T cell leukemia (ATLL) develops in 3–5% of HTLV-1 carriers after a long period of latency during which a persistent polyclonal expansion of HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes is observed in all individuals. This incubation period is significantly shortened in HTLV-1 carrier with Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) infection, suggesting that Ss could be a cofactor of ATLL. As an increased T cell proliferation at the asymptomatic stage of HTLV-1 infection could increase the risk of malignant transformation, the effect of Ss infection on infected T lymphocytes was assessed in vivo in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers. After real-time quantitative PCR, the mean circulating HTLV-1 proviral load was more than five times higher in HTLV-1 carriers with stongyloidiasis than in HTLV-1+ individuals without Ss infection (P<0.009). This increased proviral load was found to result from the extensive proliferation of a restricted number of infected clones, i.e. from oligoclonal expansion, as evidenced by the semiquantitative amplification of HTLV-1 flanking sequences. The positive effect of Ss on clonal expansion was reversible under effective treatment of strongyloidiasis in one patient with parasitological cure whereas no significant modification of the HTLV-1 replication pattern was observed in an additional case with strongyloidiasis treatment failure. Therefore, Ss stimulates the oligoclonal proliferation of HTLV-1 infected cells in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers in vivo. This is thought to account for the shortened period of latency observed in ATLL patients with strongyloidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2322812254,"Deregulation of E2F transcriptional control has been implicated in oncogenic transformation. Consistent with this idea, we recently demonstrated that during hepatocarcinogenesis in c-myc/TGFα double transgenic mice, there is increased expression of E2F-1 and E2F-2, as well as induction of putative E2F target genes. Therefore, we generated transgenic mice expressing E2F-1 under the control of the albumin enhancer/promoter to test the hypothesis that E2F family members may contribute to liver tumor development. Overexpression of E2F-1 resulted in mild but persistent increases in cell proliferation and death during postnatal liver growth, and no increases in hepatic regenerative growth in response to partial hepatectomy. Nevertheless, from 2 months postnatally E2F-1 transgenic mice exhibited prominent hepatic histological abnormalities including preneoplastic foci adjacent to portal tracts and pericentral large cell dysplasia. From 6 to 8 months onward, there was an abrupt increase in the number of neoplastic nodules (‘adenomas’) with 100% incidence by 10 months. Some adenomas showed evidence of malignant transformation, and two of six mice killed at 12 months showed trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma. Endogenous c-myc was up-regulated in the early stages of E2F-1 hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas p53 was overexpressed in the tumors, suggesting that both E2F-1-mediated proliferation and apoptosis are operative but at different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. In conclusion, E2F-1 overexpression in the liver causes dysplasia and tumors and suggests a cooperation between E2F-1 and c-myc oncogenes during liver oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2319433899,"We have previously shown an important function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)alpha(p85alpha-p110alpha) and PI3Kbeta (p85-alpha-p110beta) for DNA synthesis induced by various mitogens in non transformed fibroblasts and we now report a specific role of these enzymes in human colon cancer cell growth. Using antibodies specific to p110alpha and to p110beta catalytic subunits, increase in PI3Kalpha and PI3Kbeta activities was detected in 15/19 human tumour biopsies relative to adjacent normal mucosa of human colon and bladder. Increase in such activities was also observed in adenocarcinoma cell lines CaCo2, CO115, HCT 116, LS 174T and WiDr relative to non-transformed fibroblasts. Maximal PI3Kalpha activity was observed for LS 174T and PI3Kbeta activity for WiDr cells. This was partly correlated with an increase in p110alpha and p110beta protein levels both in some primary tumours and established cell lines, suggesting that PI3K overexpression is involved in enzymatic deregulation. Functional consequence of such activation was assessed by a microinjection approach. An injection of neutralizing antibody specific to p110beta in WiDr, HCT116 and CO 115 cells inhibited de novo DNA synthesis, whereas antibodies specific to p110gamma had no effect. Neutralizing antibodies specific to p110alpha induced apoptosis, a response that was reverted by treating cells with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. However anti-p110beta and anti-p110gamma antibodies did not affect cell survival.

Recent studies have established that BTK transmits signals from the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) to transcription factor NF-κB, which in turn reprograms a set of genes required for normal B cell growth. We now demonstrate that induction of NF-κB via this pathway requires the intermediate action of the -γ2 isoform of phospholipase C (PLC-γ2), a potential phosphorylation substrate of BTK. Specifically, pharmacologic agents that block the action of either PLC-γ2 or its second messengers prevent BCR-induced activation of IκB kinase. Moreover, activation of NF-κB in response to BCR signaling is completely abolished in B cells deficient for PLC-γ2. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that PLC-γ2 functions as an integral component of the BTK/NF-κB axis following BCR ligation. Interference with this NF-κB cascade may account for some of the B cell defects reported forplc-γ2 −/− mice, which develop an X-linked immunodeficiency-like phenotype.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which BTK effects B cell proliferation and survival are not well understood. Like BTK, transcription factor NF-κB has been implicated in the regulation of genes essential for B cell responses including proliferation and survival (13Bendall H.H. Sikes M.L. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Miyake K. Sha W. Gerondakis S. J. Exp.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment via its association with a family of inhibitory proteins, termed IκBs (16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified a cytokine-inducible IκB kinase complex (IKK) consisting of two catalytic (IKKα and IKKβ) and one regulatory subunit (IKKγ) (17Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In response to NF-κB activating signals, IKK phosphorylates and targets IκB for degradation (17Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We and others (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Bajpai U.D. Zhang K. Teutsch M. Sen R. Wortis H.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have recently shown that BTK couples the BCR to IKK and NF-κB. However, the biochemical mechanism by which BTK activates NF-κB remains largely undefined. BTK, in concert with the protein tyrosine kinase Syk and the adaptor protein BLNK, has recently been demonstrated to phosphorylate and activate PLC-γ2 (22Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 23Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp.

In response to BCR signals, PLC-γ2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol facilitates the activation of PKC isoenzymes (20Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar, 21Imboden J.B. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Thus, BTK-dependent activation of PLC-γ2 is essential for BCR-initiated calcium fluxes (22Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of PLC-γ2 signaling in the activation of nuclear factors that direct B cell responses are not known. In this report, we provide two lines of evidence indicating that BCR-initiated activation of NF-κB is mediated by PLC-γ2. First, DT40 chicken B cells deficient for PLC-γ2 fail to translocate NF-κB to the nucleus upon BCR activation. Second, pharmacologic inhibition of PLC-γ2 or its second messengers prevents BCR-responsive activation of IKK and phosphorylation of IκBα in primary B cells. These biochemical findings provide a potential molecular explanation for the B cell defects recently reported forplc-γ2 −/− mice, which display an xid-like phenotype reminiscent of animals lacking functional BTK (10Khan W.N. Alt F.W. Gerstein R.M. Malynn B.A. Larsson I. Rathbun G. Davidson L. Muller S. Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A. Rosen F.S. Sideras P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 283-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The chicken B cell line DT40, DT40 cells deficient for either BTK or PLC-γ2 (DT40.BTK, DT40.PLC-γ2), or mutant DT40 cells reconstituted with either human BTK or PLC-γ2 (DT40.BTKR, DT40.PLC-γ2R) were a kind gift of Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki, Riken Cell Bank, Japan (23Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). DT40 cells were maintained as described previously and were cultured in low serum media (RPMI with 0.5% FCS, 0.05% chicken serum) for 8–12 h prior to stimulation (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Splenocytes and primary B lymphocytes were isolated from spleens of C57Bl6 mice. For phospho-IκBα Western analyses, RBC-depleted splenocytes were cultured and stimulated as indicated. For IKK in vitro kinase assays, B cells were purified by a process of negative selection on an affinity chromatography column (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada). The purity of B cells isolated in this manner was ∼90–95% as verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using anti-B220 and anti-IgM antibodies (PharMingen). All purifications were performed at 4 °C, and primary cells were used immediately upon purification. All pharmacological reagents were purchased from Calbiochem. For inhibition of BCR signaling, cells were incubated with EGTA (5 mm), BAPTA-AM (20 nm), cyclosporin A (20 μg/ml), bisindolylmaleimide I (20 μm), or U-73122 (5 μm) for 30 min prior to and during stimulation. Except where indicated in the figure legends, DT40 B cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with a 1:2 dilution of hybridoma supernatants containing anti-chicken IgM monoclonal antibody (M4) or PMA and ionomycin, 1 μm each. Purified B cells (3–5 × 106 cells per sample) were incubated with 10 μg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 10 μg/ml anti-mouse CD40 (PharMingen), or with PMA and ionomycin (1 μm each) at a cellular density of 2 × 106/ml in culture media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% serum). To monitor any effects of serum on the activation of NF-κB, cells that were not stimulated were also incubated in medium containing 10% serum for the duration of stimulation. Nuclear extracts were prepared and used in DNA-binding reactions as described previously (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For EMSAs, an [α-32P]CTP- and [α-32P]ATP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe derived from the κB enhancer element of the IL-2Rα receptor promoter (5′-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTT-3′) was used. To verify equal amounts and integrity of proteins in the nuclear extracts, a control oligonucleotide for NF-Y was used. DNA-binding reactions were resolved by PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For Western blot analysis of RelA and c-Rel, nuclear extracts equivalent to 2 × 107 cells were denatured in Laemmli reducing buffer by boiling at 95 °C for 3 min, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RelA, c-Rel, or SP1 as described previously (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For IκBα degradation assays, 4 × 106cells/sample were preincubated for 30 min in medium containing 50 μm cycloheximide and then stimulated as indicated. Cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, probed with antibodies against chicken IκBα (pp40; gift of C. Chen) and p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and detected using the ECL system. Western blot analyses of IκBα phosphorylation were performed as above and probed with antibodies against mouse IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phosphorylated Ser-32/Ser-36 IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The κB reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of a promoter containing six consensus NF-κB binding sites (6κB) and a control vector containing a Renilla luciferase gene fused to a thymidine kinase promoter have been described previously (25Chen C.L. Yull F.E. Kerr L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The indicated DT40 cell lines were each cotransfected by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarads, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) with 5 μg of the 6κB reporter construct and 1 μg of theRenilla construct. 18 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 h with anti-IgM. Cells were harvested, and levels of both firefly and Renilla luciferase were determined using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Levels of firefly luciferase expression were normalized against Renilla as a control for transfection efficiency. In vitro kinase assays were performed on the cytosolic fraction of 5 × 106 B cells as described previously (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts from 0.5 × 106 cell equivalents were removed for Western blot analysis, and the remaining cell extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IKKα plus anti-IKKβ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplexes were then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, MgCl2 (2 mm), MnCl2 (2 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), ATP (20 μm)) containing 1.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 50 μg/ml wild type GST-IκBα substrate. The reaction was allowed to continue for 30 min at 30 °C under agitation and then was terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the GST-IκBα substrate. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film to visualize γ-32P-phosphorylated GST-IκBα. In prior studies, we established that BTK is required for nuclear translocation of NF-κB in BCR-stimulated B cells (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which BTK facilitates NF-κB activation is poorly defined. Recent findings suggest that BCR-directed nuclear translocation of NF-κB requires the activation of the calcium-responsive phosphatase calcineurin (26Venkataraman L. Burakoff S.J. Sen R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To define further the mechanism employed by BTK to effect NF-κB activation, we investigated a role for calcium and calcineurin in BCR-responsive nuclear translocation of NF-κB in DT40 B cells. The DT40 B cell system is amenable to genetic manipulation and has thus proven invaluable for biochemical analysis of BCR-signaling events (27Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To determine whether calcium and calcineurin play a role in BCR-responsive activation of NF-κB in this cellular background, EMSA analyses were performed on nuclear extracts prepared from DT40 cells preincubated with pharmacological inhibitors of calcium, calcineurin, and PKCs. We used BAPTA-AM/EGTA to chelate intra- and extracellular calcium and cyclosporin A (CsA) to inhibit the calcium-responsive phosphatase calcineurin or bisindolylmaleimide (Bis I), a broad spectrum inhibitor of PKC isoenzymes (Fig.1). We also treated DT40 cells with PMA and ionomycin, pharmacological agents known to activate NF-κB via IKK, as a positive control (28Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As expected, BCR cross-linking or PMA/ionomycin treatment resulted in the rapid nuclear accumulation of NF-κB (compare lane 1 with 2 and10). However, BCR-directed nuclear translocation of NF-κB was inhibited by treatment with BAPTA-AM/EGTA or CsA (lanes 3 and 4). Bis I treatment significantly, although not completely, inhibited this response (lane 5). However, preincubation with Bis in combination with either BAPTA-AM/EGTA or CsA resulted in a complete block in NF-κB nuclear translocation upon BCR activation (lanes 6 and 7). This result demonstrates that inhibition of either calcium or calcineurin and PKC completely abolishes BCR-directed activation of NF-κB in DT40 B cells. Upon BCR ligation, BTK activates a distinct set of signal transducers to initiate downstream signaling events (3Fruman D.A. Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Satterthwaite A.B. Li Z. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Of these, Akt, MAPK, and PLC-γ2 have the capability to activate NF-κB via IKK. Although both Akt and MAPK have been directly linked to IKK activation (30Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 31Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar), such a role has not been demonstrated for PLC-γ2. However, our finding that calcium and PKC are essential for nuclear translocation of NF-κB in BCR-stimulated DT40 cells implicates PLC-γ2 in this response (Fig. 1). Therefore, we next explored an involvement of PLC-γ2 in NF-κB nuclear translocation in B cells stimulated via the BCR. To determine whether PLC-γ2 is critical for BCR-directed nuclear translocation of NF-κB, we used mutant chicken DT40 B cells lacking PLC-γ2 (DT40.PLC-γ2) along with BTK-deficient (DT40.BTK) and parental DT40 B cells. Cells were induced via the BCR, and their nuclear NF-κB content was assessed by EMSA (Fig.2 A). Although BCR cross-linking leads to a marked increase in nuclear NF-κB in DT40 cells (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 1 and4), both DT40.PLC-γ2 and DT40.BTK B cells failed to demonstrate this response (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5 and 3 and 6). However, PMA and ionomycin mobilized similar levels of nuclear NF-κB in all three cell types (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–9). These results strongly suggest that like BTK, PLC-γ2 plays an essential role in the transmission of BCR signals to activate NF-κB. To ascertain whether the observed defect was due to delayed kinetics of NF-κB activation, we compared BCR-responsive nuclear translocation of NF-κB in DT40.PLC-γ2 cells with that in DT40 B cells over a period of 4 h (Fig. 2 B). Upon BCR cross-linking, DT40 B cells rapidly translocated NF-κB to the nucleus and maintained elevated levels up to 4 h after activation. In contrast, nuclear levels of NF-κB did not increase in DT40.PLC-γ2 B cells at any time point within that period (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 with 2, 4, 6, and 8). To verify further that the NF-κB activation defect in DT40.PLC-γ2 B cells was due to PLC-γ2 deficiency, reconstitution experiments were performed. In response to BCR engagement, DT40.PLC-γ2 B cells expressing wild type human PLC-γ2 (DT40.PLC-γ2R (23Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) were capable of NF-κB nuclear translocation as determined by EMSA and a NF-κB responsive luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 2, C andD). These data strongly suggest that PLC-γ2 is critical for transmission of BCR-dependent signals that lead to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Members of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins include p50/NF-κB1, p52/NF-κB2, RelA, c-Rel, and RelB, which have the capacity to form either homo- or heterodimers (16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). NF-κB dimers containing the Rel family proteins RelA or c-Rel have been demonstrated to be the principal transactivating species activated in response to BCR engagement in B cells (35). We previously demonstrated that RelA and c-Rel fail to undergo nuclear translocation upon BCR stimulation in BTK-deficient B cells. To test whether BTK-mediated RelA and c-Rel nuclear translocation requires PLC-γ2, we compared the ability of DT40.PLC-γ2, DT40.BTK, and DT40 B cells to translocate these subunits to the nucleus upon BCR-cross-linking (Fig.3, A and B). Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts from unactivated (lanes 1–3), anti-IgM stimulated (lanes 4–6), and PMA/ionomycin treated (lanes 7–9) cells with Rel subunit-specific antibodies revealed that nuclear accumulation of both RelA and c-Rel occurs in DT40 B cells following BCR stimulation (Fig.3, A and B, lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, BCR-responsive nuclear translocation of RelA and c-Rel is not observed in either DT40.PLC-γ2 or DT40.BTK B cells. Treatment with PMA/ionomycin induced nuclear translocation of both Rel species (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 7–9) in all three cell lines. Furthermore, the observed differences in Rel subunit translocation are not attributable to either variation in total protein content of the nuclear extracts or their integrity, because similar amounts of the constitutively expressed transcription factor SP1 are detectable in all samples (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels). Thus, BCR-directed nuclear translocation of RelA and c-Rel is PLC-γ2-dependent. NF-κB dimers are found in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells, bound to members of a family of inhibitory molecules termed IκBs. BCR-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB is contingent upon the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκBα, a process that requires BTK. We compared the ability of DT40.PLC-γ2 B cells with DT40.BTK and DT40 B cells to degrade IκBα in response to BCR activation. Cells were incubated with anti-IgM antibodies or PMA and ionomycin for indicated periods, and cytoplasmic extracts were immunoblotted for chicken IκBα (Fig. 4, upper panel). As expected, DT40 B cells rapidly degraded IκBα upon BCR activation. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2, DT40.PLC-γ2 B cells failed to degrade IκBα in response to BCR stimulation (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1–4 with 6–9and 11–14). All three cell lines efficiently degraded IκBα in response to treatment with PMA and ionomycin. Therefore, loss of PLC-γ2 does not affect the downstream components necessary for IκBα degradation. These results demonstrate that BCR-directed degradation of IκBα specifically requires PLC-γ2. Prior biochemical studies have identified several NF-κB agonists that converge on IKKα and IKKβ including TNF and IL-1 (17Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have recently established that BCR-initiated activation of NF-κB by BTK proceeds via IKK (18Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To extend our finding that PLC-γ2 is required for BCR-directed nuclear translocation of NF-κB, we explored a role for PLC-γ2 in IKK activation. We tested whether pharmacological agents that block PLC-γ2 and its second messengers could prevent BCR-induced activation of IKK in primary B cells (Fig.5 A). In response to activation signals via the BCR or CD40, or treatment with PMA, IKK enzymatic activity was significantly increased as determined by in vitro kinase assays using recombinant GST-IκBα as the substrate (Fig. 5 A, compare lane 1 with 2, 7, and 8). In contrast, incubation of B cells with either the PLC-γ-specific inhibitor (U-73122) or inhibitors of its second messengers (BAPTA-AM/EGTA, CsA, or Bis I) prior to BCR stimulation abolished this activity (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3–6). These data implicate PLC-γ2, calcium, calcineurin, and PKC in IKK activation upon BCR ligation. Moreover, they verify the role of these signaling molecules in BCR-responsive activation of IKK in a physiologically relevant background. To confirm this observation, we performed Western blot analyses of cytosolic fractions from BCR-, CD40-, or PMA-stimulated splenocytes using an antibody directed against Ser-32/Ser-36-phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). Stimulation via either the BCR or CD40 induced phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 5 B,compare lanes 1, 2, and 6). BCR-responsive IκBα phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment with either BAPTA-AM/EGTA, CsA, or Bis I (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3–5). Also, PMA stimulation resulted in IκBα phosphorylation that was abrogated by pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor Bis I (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7 and 8). These observations implicate PLC-γ2, calcium, and PKC in BCR-responsive activation of IKK and phosphorylation of IκBα. Moreover, the observation that cells pretreated with CsA fail to activate IKK upon BCR cross-linking identifies calcineurin as a critical mediator of this response. This observation is consistent with the recent finding that calcineurin and PKCs synergize to induce IKK activation in T cells (28Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that PLC-γ2 is likely to mediate BCR-responsive activation of IKK, phosphorylation of IκBα, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. We have found that PLC-γ2 and its downstream signals are essential for BCR-directed activation of IKK and NF-κB. Prior studies in BCR-stimulated B cells have revealed that PLC-γ2 is activated via the concerted actions of BTK, Syk, and BLNK (3Fruman D.A. Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Rawlings D.J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 91: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that PLC-γ2 is the principal BTK signal transducer for BCR-directed activation of IKK and NF-κB. Further investigation is required to determine whether additional BTK targets, including Akt and MAPK, synergize with PLC-γ2 to effect nuclear translocation of NF-κB in BCR-stimulated B cells. However, the placement of PLC-γ2 in the BCR/BTK/NF-κB signaling pathway provides the first potential molecular explanation for the similar xid-like B cell deficiencies displayed byplc-γ2 −/− andbtk −/− mice (10Khan W.N.

https://openalex.org/W2314196166,"We have previously demonstrated that the protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a regulator of transcription by RNA polymerase I (rDNA transcription) by inhibiting UBF-mediated transcription. In the present study, we have examined the mechanism by which Rb represses UBF-dependent rDNA transcription and determined if other Rb-like proteins have similar effects. We demonstrate that authentic or recombinant UBF and Rb interact directly and this requires a functional A/B pocket. DNase footprinting and band-shift assays demonstrated that the interaction between Rb and UBF does not inhibit the binding of UBF to DNA. However, the formation of an UBF/Rb complex does block the interaction of UBF with SL-1, as indicated by using the 48 kDa subunit as a marker for SL-1. Additional evidence is presented that another pocket protein, p130 but not p107, can be found in a complex with UBF. Interestingly, the cellular content of p130 inversely correlated with the rate of rDNA transcription in two physiological systems, and overexpression of p130 inhibited rDNA transcription. These results suggest that p130 may regulate rDNA transcription in a similar manner to Rb."
https://openalex.org/W2023886403,"We have identified 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) as an endogenous modulator that inhibits transactivation by the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) through competitive binding against xenobiotic ligands. 7-KC binds AhR and displaces labeled dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo(p)dioxin (TCDD)). IC(50) is 5 x 10(-7) m in vivo and 7 x 10(-6) m in vitro. These figures are consistent with its concentration in human blood plasma and tissues. Association with 7-KC prevents AhR binding to DNA. 7-KC blocks the TCDD-mediated transactivation of stably expressed reporter gene constructs in T47-D cells as well as the expression of the endogenous CYP 1A1 gene in HepG2 cells and in primary porcine aortic endothelial cells. Injection of 7-KC to rats blocks the induction of CYP 1A1 messenger RNA and protein in endothelial cells from myocardial blood vessels. The differential sensitivity of mammalian species to toxic effects of AhR ligands, especially dioxin (TCDD), correlates with the expression of 7-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase, which synthesizes 7-KC from 7-hydroxycholesterol. The documented involvement of AhR ligands in cardiovascular diseases through lipid peroxidation and endothelium dysfunction can now be examined in the context of displacement of this protective modulator."

While the biosynthetic processing of the I-β1a isoform has been well characterized, the processing of III-β1a has not been reported. In this study, we compared III-β1a and I-β1a processing. Both III-β1a and I-β1a were synthesized as transmembrane proproteins that were proteolytically cleaved to produce an N-terminal fragment containing the bioactive epidermal growth factor-like domain. For I-β1a, this product was released into the medium. However, for III-β1a, this product was a transmembrane protein. In cultures of cells expressing III-β1a, the amount of neuregulin at the cell surface was much greater, and the amount in the medium was much less than in cultures expressing I-β1a. Phorbol ester treatment and truncation of the cytoplasmic tail had markedly different effects on III-β1a and I-β1a processing.

The type I and type II isoforms contain an Ig-like domain in the N-terminal region (Ig-NRGs), whereas the type III isoform contain a cysteine-rich domain (CRD-NRGs). Studies of the temporal and spatial expression patterns of NRG isoforms suggest that type I/II and type III NRGs serve distinct functions (10Meyer D. Yamaai T. Garratt A. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E.

With respect to the type III NRGs, analysis of the knockout animals indicates that type III NRGs play a critical role in the interactions of peripheral nerve axons with muscle and with Schwann cells. Defects in animals lacking type III NRGs include retraction of nerve terminals from newly formed synapses, absence of Schwann cells from peripheral nerves, and loss of motor and sensory neurons (8Wolpowitz D.

Most type I NRG isoforms include a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids C-terminal of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like) domain that serves as a transmembrane (TM) domain. These type I isoforms are synthesized as transmembrane “proproteins” from which a paracrine signal can be produced by proteolytic cleavage in the stalk region (Fig. 1 B). The release of the ectodomain into the extracellular space may require transport of the uncleaved proprotein to the cell surface, followed by stalk cleavage and “shedding” of the ectodomain from the surface. Alternatively, after arriving at the surface, the proprotein may be internalized into endocytotic pathway compartments in which proteolytic processing occurs with subsequent secretion of the ectodomain fragment (24Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

This isoform, originally referred to as SMDF, has a β3 type of EGF-like domain, and thus lacks the transmembrane domain C-terminal of the EGF-like domain (Fig. 1 A). Subsequent to the isolation of the III-β3 isoform, a III-β1a isoform (Fig. 1 A) was discovered (Refs. 18Yang X. Kuo Y. Devay P., Yu, C. Role L.

The III-β1a and I-β1a isoforms differ in their N-terminal regions but are identical in their EGF-like, “stalk,” transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 1 A). Based on the similarity in structure of the III-β1a and I-β1a isoforms, schematic diagrams (4Adlkofer K. Lai C. Glia. 2000; 29: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,8Wolpowitz D. Mason T.B. Dietrich P. Mendelsohn M. Talmage D.A. Role L.W. Neuron. 2000; 25: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) have represented the topology of III-β1a as similar to I-β1a (Fig. 1, B and C). This model of III-β1a topology suggests that III-β1a, like I-β1a, will be cleaved in the stalk region and that the consequence of this cleavage will be release of the entire N-terminal fragment into the extracellular fluid. To test this model and to determine whether the cellular mechanisms that regulate I-β1a topology and biosynthetic processing also govern III-β1a, we have compared III-β1a processing to I-β1a processing using biochemical and immunocytochemical techniques. The isoform designation “III-β 1a” refers to a NRG with a “type III” N-terminal region, a “β ” type EGF-like domain, a “1” type sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the EGF-like domain, and an “a” type cytoplasmic tail (see Fig. 1 A for illustration). NRG isoforms can differ in the sequence of their N-terminal region (type I, II, and III), EGF-like domain (α or β), the C-terminal end of the EGF-like domain (1, 2, 3, or 4), and cytoplasmic tail (a, b, c, or none). In NRG isoforms with β1, β2, or β4 EGF-like domains, there is a stalk region, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail C-terminal of the EGF-like domain. (The stalk is the sequence between the EGF-like domain and the transmembrane domain.) These features are not found in NRG isoforms with a β3 EGF-like domain. Most NRGs in the nervous system have a β-type EGF-like domain and a-type tail (12Wen D.Z. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N.L. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Benbaruch N. Trollinger D.B.

Based on the results presented in this study, we propose that the III-β1a proprotein has a cytoplasmic tail at both its N terminus and C terminus. However, to be consistent with the published literature, the term “cytoplasmic tail” used without qualification refers to the cytoplasmic region C-terminal to the EGF-like domain. For example, III-β1a has the “a-tail” type of cytoplasmic tail. We refer to neuregulin proteins with both an ectodomain epitope and cytoplasmic tail epitope as “proproteins,” in recognition of their potential to be biosynthetic precursors to cleaved bioactive products. However, this does not exclude the possibility that these “proproteins” are themselves bioactive signaling proteins. Throughout this paper, “neuregulin” and the abbreviation “NRG” refer only to the proteins encoded by the nrg-1 gene. Three related genes (nrg-2, nrg-3, andnrg-4) have now been identified, but the proteins encoded by these genes are not discussed. All neuregulin proteins analyzed in this study included an HA epitope tag in the ectodomain (Fig. 1 D). The sole exception is untagged I-β1a (labeled “native”) used in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2. Standard recombinant DNA techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

The sequences of I-β1a and III-β1a differ at their N-terminal ends but are identical from a serine residue located 14 amino acids N-terminal of the first cysteine residue of the EGF-like domain through their C termini (Fig.1 A). The PCR-based strategy used to insert the HA tag changes the sequence between this serine and cysteine from STSTSTTGTSHLIKC to STSTSTTGTSIDYPYDVPDYASLHLIKC (underlined residues represent HA epitope tag). All HA-tagged constructs used contained this identical sequence within the ectodomain. A similar polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to introduce a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus of an HA-tagged III-β1a construct for examination of the membrane orientation of the III-β1a N-terminal fragment. In this FLAG-III-β1a construct, the N-terminal sequence was changed from MEIYSP … toMDYKDDDKEFGGMEIYSP … (underlined sequence represents FLAG tag). The fidelity of all sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction was verified by DNA sequencing. The vector backbone for all constructs was pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The tail deletion constructs and NRG I-β1c construct included a C-terminal Myc epitope tag. The Myc tag was not utilized in this study. Details regarding the primers used and the specific procedures employed to create these constructs are available upon request. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. PC 12 cells (N21 strain; Ref. 33Burry R.W. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were a gift from Richard Burry (Ohio State University). PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% horse serum and 5% FetalClone (Hyclone) with 50 ng/ml NGF (Life Technologies, Inc.). Schwann cells were dissociated and purified from neonatal rat sciatic nerves (56Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Purified Schwann cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated slides in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 μm forskolin (Calbiochem), and 5 ng/ml glial growth factor (a gift from Mark Marchionni (Cambridge Neuroscience)). PC12 and COS-7 cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Schwann cells were maintained in 7.5% CO2 at 37 °C. For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated and transfected in eight-well Permanox chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). For biochemical experiments, cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes. Plasmids were prepared for transfection using Qiagen MaxiPrep kits. Transfection of COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran was performed as described previously (34Wang J.Y. Frenzel K.E. Wen D. Falls D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20525-20534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using 0.2 μg of DNA/well and 10 μg of DNA/100-mm dish. Transfection of PC 12 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were transfected 1 day after plating (∼90% confluent); 1 μg of DNA was used per well. Schwann cell cultures were transfected when 50–80% confluent. Transfection of Schwann cells was performed with FuGene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's directions. For each well, 0.75 μl of FuGene was mixed with 25 μl of serum-free DMEM and then incubated with 0.5 μg of DNA for 15 min at room temperature prior to adding to the media of the cultured cells. COS-7 and PC 12 cells were processed 72 h after transfection. Schwann cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. COS-7 cells transfected with the III-β1a construct were washed twice with PBS (0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). One ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) was added per 100-mm dish of transfected cells. The cells were collected in this buffer using a rubber policeman and passed through a 21-gauge needle 30 times. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this low speed spin (Input in Fig. 5 A) was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. To analyze the proportion of cellular III-β1a proprotein and its products bound to membranes, the supernatant (S2) and membrane pellet (P2) from this high speed spin were prepared in SDS sample buffer. For membrane extraction experiments, the membrane pellet was extracted on ice for 30 min in hypotonic lysis buffer with 1 m KCl or with 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 12. Following extraction, the samples were centrifuged at 125,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the soluble (S; supernatant) and insoluble (I; pellet) fractions. An equal percentage of the starting material for supernatant and pellet fractions was analyzed by Western blotting. Triton X-114 partitioning experiments were performed using a modification of Bordier's original protocol (35Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane pellet (see above) was resuspended in 960 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer and mixed with 240 μl of 8% (v/v) Triton X-114 in 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (final volume 1.2 ml; final Triton X-114 concentration of 1.6%). This mixture was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor to produce a soluble and an insoluble (pellet) fraction. To induce phase separation, 200 μl of the soluble fraction was warmed to 28 °C for 3 min. The warmed mixture was then layered onto a 6% sucrose cushion (300 μl) in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. This resulted in a three-phase solution: aqueous, top; sucrose cushion, middle; detergent, bottom. The aqueous phase was mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. The detergent phase was adjusted to 200 μl with lysis buffer and then mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. To prepare lysates for Western blot analysis, cells in 100-mm dishes were rinsed twice with HBS (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and lysed by scraping in 400 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). The lysate was passed through a 27-gauge needle four times to shear DNA and cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples analyzed in Fig. 2 were total cell lysates, not cleared lysates. These samples were prepared by harvesting the cells directly in 400 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer/dish. Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (34Wang J.Y. Frenzel K.E. Wen D. Falls D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20525-20534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to being loaded on a gel for analysis. The antibody dilutions used were as follows: α-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 (raw ascites fluid; Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, CA), 1:3000; α-NRG a-tail rabbit polyclonal antibody SC348 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), 0.1 μg/ml; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Pierce), 1:50,000; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), 1:50,000. Blots were developed using Renaissance chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prestained standards used on Western blots (BenchMark protein ladder; Life Technologies) were calibrated against unstained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad). A standard curve (distance migratedversus log M r) was created based on the migration of the marker proteins, and molecular weights were assigned to each band of interest according to the position of the center of the band. Experiments illustrated in the figures were repeated three times (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, 6, and 7) or twice (Figs. 5 and 8). Each repetition gave results similar to those illustrated. For quantitation of cell surface or released NRG, samples to be compared were analyzed on a single blot along with multiple dilutions of a standard sample. Films were scanned, and band “volume” (summed pixel density) was measured using the NIH Image software. A standard curve was created by plotting the pixel density for each dilution of the standard sample as a function of the relative amount loaded. The relative amount of NRG in each test sample was calculated based on this standard curve.Figure 4The 76-kDa NTF of III-β1a accumulates in the plasma membrane. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with III-β1a or I-β1a expression vectors or mock-transfected. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated (+), and the biotinylated proteins were isolated by precipitation with streptavidin agarose and analyzed by Western blot with α-HA. A strong 76-kDa band is present in the biotinylated III-β1a sample (lane 2). With heavier loadings and long exposures, a weak 140-kDa band was also detected, and this band was also detected with α-a-tail (not shown). 110- and 45-kDa bands are present in the biotinylated I-β1a sample (lane 4). These I-β1a bands are much less intense than the III-β1a NTF band. Control samples (lanes 3 and 5) were prepared identically except that the biotinylation reagent was omitted (−). The absence of signal in these no biotin controls demonstrates that NRG precipitation by streptavidin was dependent on protein biotinylation. An identically prepared sample of biotinylated proteins from mock-transfected cells was loaded in lane 1. Each lane was loaded with 10% of the fraction material derived from a 100-mm dish of transfected COS-7 cells. B, Western blot analysis with α-HA of lysates from which biotinylated proteins (A) were isolated. The band intensities are similar for the lysates prepared from dishes subjected to biotinylation (+) and to mock biotinylation (−). Each lane was loaded with 1% of the total cell lysate prepared from each dish.C, relative amounts of biotinylated NRG proteins. Bands were quantitated by densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of the III-β1a NTF (76 kDa) was assigned a value of 1. Mean ± S.E.

Although the association between APOE4 and AD is well documented, the mechanism by which apolipoprotein E exerts an isoform-specific effect on neurons in disease is unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that apoE4 stimulates the transcriptional activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in rat primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, apoE3 was unable to stimulate CREB transcriptional activity and unable to activate the ERK pathway. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels are also involved because treatment with receptor-associated protein, nifedipine, MK801, removal of Ca2+ from the medium and dantrolene all served to inhibit calcium elevation and attenuate the activation of CREB. Treatment with an apoE peptide was also found to facilitate transcription of the CREB-dependent genes, c-fos and Bcl-2. In contrast to treatment with apoE3, our findings suggest apoE4 and apoE-peptide induce a novel signaling pathway.

To date, four genes have been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease phenotypes including the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (1–4), the presenilin-1 gene on chromosome 14 (5), the presenilin-2 gene on chromosome 1 (6Levy-Lahad E.

Science. 1995; 269: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), and the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) 1 gene on chromosome 19 (8–10). There are three common alleles of the APOE gene: ε3 is the most common representing ∼78% of all APOE alleles, ε4 representing 15% and ε2 representing 7% (11Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3362) Google Scholar). Although these alleles give six possible genotypes, the risk of Alzheimer's disease is increased, and the age of onset distribution is earlier, with each dose of ε4 (8Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskel P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7198) Google Scholar). While the influence of theAPOE-ε4 genotype was clearly demonstrated, the biological mechanism mediated by apoE4, the translated protein isoform derived from the ε4 allele of APOE gene remains speculative. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding potential mechanisms where apoE4 enhances the risk for Alzheimer's disease. One interesting hypothesis is that apoE4 itself causes toxicity to hippocampal neurons, but that apoE3 does not (12Marques M.A. Tolar M. Harmony J.A. Crutcher K.A. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2529-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Miller R.J. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. LaDu M.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 195-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 22-kDa thrombin cleavage fragment of apoE4 known as “truncated apoE4” and an apoE peptide consisting of a tandem repeat of amino acid residues 141–149 of apoE showed higher toxicity to neurons than apoE4 itself (14Tolar M. Marques M.A. Harmony J.A.K. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5678-5686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Moulder K.L. Narita M. Chang L.K. Bu G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Their toxicity was apoE receptor-mediated (14Tolar M. Marques M.A. Harmony J.A.K. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5678-5686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and involved calcium influx (16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these reports, we started to study the mechanism of apoE toxicity using the synthetic apoE peptide. We employed the Mercury Pathway Profiling System (CLONTECH) to elucidate the mechanistic pathways activated in the presence of apoE peptide. This system evaluates several cis-acting enhancer elements such as AP1, CRE, HSE, Myc, NFκB, and serum response element and among them, transcription from the CRE element was found to be activated. In addition to the apoE peptide, a specific isoform of the apoE protein was found to stimulate the phosphorylation that activates CREB. We then examined the pathway upstream of CREB activation and found that ERK and the apoE receptor are involved in this same pathway. Downstream of CREB, the expression of c-fos and Bcl-2 genes that are modulated by activated CREB, were also increased. Our finding that apoE4 stimulates phosphorylation of CREB through an ERK pathway to increase transcription of specific genes while apoE3 does not, suggests a mechanism of apoE isoform-specific function on neurons. Recombinant apolipoprotein E3 andapolipoprotein E4 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); U0126 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase-specific inhibitor from Promega (Madison, WI); nifedipine and dantrolene from Sigma; (+)-MK801 hydrogen malate and KN62 from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA); RAP and anti-apolipoprotein E antibody (IB5-E1) from Progen Biotechnik (Heidelberg, Germany); anti-CREB antibody, anti-phospho-CREB antibody, anti-ERK antibody, and anti-phospho-ERK antibody from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); anti-c-Fos antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (C4) from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) and anti-Bcl-2 antibody from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). A 30-amino acid apoE peptide, which is a tandem repeat of apoE amino acid residues 141–155 (LRKLRKRLLRDADDL) was synthesized by the solid-phase method as described previously (17Clay M.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mistry M.J. Balasubramaniam A. Harmony J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11142-11151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and greater than 95% purity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared from Wistar rats at embryonic day 18 as described previously (18Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). All experiments were performed on cells cultured for 5 to 8 days. Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from neonatalapoE-deficient mice as described previously (19McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, apoE-deficient mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and backbred to C57BL/6 for at least six generations, brains were removed from neonatalapoE-deficient mice within 24 h of birth, meninges were removed, and brain tissues were digested at 37 °C with Dispase II (Rochem Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) in PBS. The mixture was centrifuged (3000 × g for 10 min), plated in 175-cm2 culture flasks (two brains/flask), and cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 10 days, cells were incubated for 48 h with cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μg/ml; Wako, Osaka, Japan) to prevent fibroblast overgrowth. Astrocytes were then separated from microglia and oligodendroglia by agitation on a shaking platform (Bioshaker BR-30L, Tautek, Tokyo, Japan) and identified by immunoreactivity with an anti-GFAP antibody. Cultures used for experiments were >98% astrocytes based on these techniques. Inhibition of secretion of TNFα from primary astrocytes by apoE was quantified as described previously (20Laskowitz D.T. Goel S. Bennett E.R. Matthew W.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary astrocytes from apoE-deficient mice were plated on 96-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 20,000 cells/well and incubated in serum-free media (Opti-MEM I, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% N2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.). The following day, recombinant apoE3, apoE4, or control protein (denatured apoE3 by boiling for 30 min) was added. 24 h later, 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) was added. 60 h later, 50 μl of medium was removed and TNFα secretion measured by Quantikine M Mouse TNFα ELISA kit (R & D systems) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. To detect the pathway activated in the presence of apoE peptide, we utilized the Mercury Pathway Profiling Systems (CLONTECH). Briefly, rat hippocampal neurons were cultured in 6-well dishes, transiently transfected with promoter-reporter plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. These plasmids contained the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene downstream of several copies of specific transcription factors binding sequences such as AP1, CRE, HSE, Myc, NFκB, and serum response element. Transfected neurons were allowed to recover for 24 h before 2 μm apoE peptide was added to the media. Alkaline phosphatase activities in the media, at indicated times after addition of apoE peptide, were measured using Great EscApe SEAP Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured in 6-well dishes, washed three times with PBS, and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl). 20-μg samples were boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (1 × PBS, 5% nonfat dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with a primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After four washes in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, blots were probed with the secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Detection of signal was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The amount of protein (CREB, ERK, phosphorylated CREB, phosphorylated ERK, c-fos, Bcl-2, and actin) was quantified by scanning the density of immunodetected bands on Immobilon membrane using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Fura-2 AM (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR) and an Argus 50/CA system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) were used to quantify the cytoplasmic free calcium as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The recombinant apoE4 and apoE3 proteins used for this study were not degraded as determined by Western blot analysis of denatured and reduced apoE proteins (Fig.1 A). To show that these recombinant proteins also retained biological activity, we examined whether they equally inhibited the secretion of TNFα from astrocytes as described by Laskowitz et al. (20Laskowitz D.T. Goel S. Bennett E.R. Matthew W.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Preincubation of primary astrocytes cultures prepared from neonatalapoE-deficient mice with recombinant apoE3 or with recombinant apoE4, prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide, each decreased the concentration of TNFα released into the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent fashion as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). There was no significant difference in TNFα levels between cells treated with the same concentration of apoE3 or apoE4. Boiled and denatured apoE3 was used as control protein and it did not suppress the secretion of TNFα. To detect the signaling pathway activated in the presence of apoE peptide, we utilized the Mercury Pathway Profiling Systems (CLONTECH). Several cis-acting enhancer elements, such as AP1 (activator protein 1), CRE (cAMP responsive element), HSE (heat shock element), Myc, NFκB (nuclear factor of κB), and serum response element included in this system were assessed in rat primary hippocampal neurons exposed to 1 μm apoE peptide. Among these elements, transcription from the CRE element was found to be activated (Fig. 2). Since apoE peptide stimulated transcription from the CRE element, then the CREB transcription factor could be activated by apoE treatments. Phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 leads to its activation as a transcription factor (21Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar, 22Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). To monitor the activation of CREB directly, Western blots of cell lysates from rat hippocampal neurons stimulated with 1 μm apoE peptide for the indicated times were probed with anti-CREB and anti-phospho-CREB (p-CREB) antibodies. 15 min after addition of apoE peptide, phospho-CREB levels substantially increased followed by a gradual decrease over the next 12 h while the total amount of CREB did not appear to change (Fig. 3 A). In addition to apoE peptide, treatment with 1 μm apoE4 protein also appeared to significantly increase phospho-CREB levels by 1 h after treatment, while 1 μm apoE3 protein did not appear to change phospho-CREB levels significantly at any time (Fig. 3, B-D). Although the molar concentration of apoE4 and apoE peptide added to the media was equivalent, the kinetics (time course) of CREB phosphorylation following treatment with apoE4 protein appeared to be slower than that stimulated by apoE peptide treatment. Since activated CREB is phosphorylated at Ser-133 and apoE treatment increases levels of phosphorylated CREB, then apoE may stimulate a pathway resulting in kinase-mediated phosphorylation of CREB. One candidate for CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 is through the ERK pathway that is activated by a double phosphorylation of ERK at Thr-202 and Tyr-204. We examined ERK activation by measuring phosphorylated ERK levels following treatment with apoE peptide, apoE3, and apoE4 proteins. Treatment with apoE peptide or with apoE4 protein resulted in significantly increased levels of phosphorylated ERK while apoE3 treatment failed to increase levels (Fig. 4). ApoE peptide increased phospho-ERK levels by 15 min of treatment while apoE4 protein increased them by 1 h of treatment. Like the phosphorylation of CREB, phosphorylation of ERK following apoE4 protein treatment appeared to be slower than that following apoE peptide treatment. To confirm that the apoE peptide stimulated phosphorylation that resulted in increased functional activity of CREB, we examined whether apoE peptide treatment led to transactivation of the CRE-dependent genes, c-fos and Bcl-2. As shown in Fig. 5, increased levels of both c-fos and Bcl-2 result from treatment with apoE peptide, whereas the level of a control protein, actin, does not appear to increase. To further elucidate the pathway where CREB is phosphorylated after apoE treatment, we examined the effects of RAP which is a competitive blocker of apoE for its receptor; MK801 which is a selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor; and nifedipine which is a selective antagonist of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (LVDCC). Pretreatment with RAP followed by apoE appeared to attenuate the increase in phospho-CREB levels seen with apoE treatment alone suggesting that the apoE receptor is involved in the pathway (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, pretreatment with MK801 or with nifedipine appeared to attenuate the increase in phospho-CREB levels, suggesting that the NMDA receptor and/or the LVDCC are also involved in the pathway (Fig.6 B). To find out which of the possible pathways involving apoE receptors, LVDCC and/or NMDA receptors, contribute to the phosphorylation of CREB, we examined the effect of inhibiting kinases associated with these receptors by treatment with the U0126 inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and with the c-AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA). Pretreatment with one of these selective inhibitors, as well as pretreatment with both, mostly inhibited CREB phosphorylation suggesting that activation of MEK and PKA are involved in this pathway (Fig. 6 C). To further investigate the apoE stimulation pathway, we examined the effect of inhibiting kinases associated with the receptor signaling by treatment with the SB203580 inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, KN62 inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK II/IV), and the U0126 inhibitor of MEK. Of these selective inhibitors, CREB phosphorylation was mostly inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 while pretreatment with KN62 or SB203580 did not appear to have any significant effect on the phosphorylation status of CREB. This result suggests that the ERK cascade is a major pathway leading to the apoE-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 6 D). To demonstrate if the elevation of intracellular Ca2+parallels the phosphorylation of CREB, we measured the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ under unstimulated or apoE peptide-stimulated conditions. Treatment with apoE peptide significantly raised the concentration of intracellular calcium in rat hippocampal neurons. Preincubation with RAP, MK801, or nifedipine significantly attenuated this elevation, suggesting that the apoE receptor, NMDA receptor, and LVDCC are involved in the pathway to calcium elevation as was observed for the activation of CREB (Fig.7 A). To determine whether calcium influx from the extracellular space or from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contributes to our apoE-mediated Ca2+ increases, we measured the intracellular Ca2+ elevation in rat primary hippocampal neurons cultured in medium lacking Ca2+ and containing 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 7 B). Under these conditions, apoE-stimulated calcium elevation was significantly attenuated suggesting that calcium influx from extracellular sources significantly contributes to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+. To confirm this finding, we also measured the contribution of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum to the increase in intracellular Ca2+. Rat primary hippocampal neurons were preincubated with 10 μm dantrolene, an inhibitor of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel found on the ER membrane, followed by apoE peptide treatment. Interestingly, preincubation with dantrolene also significantly attenuated the elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Combining extracellular Ca2+-free conditions and preincubation with dantrolene also attenuated the calcium elevation, even though there was no significant difference between the calcium levels measured under extracellular Ca2+-free conditions without dantrolene preincubation and the extracellular calcium-free condition with dantrolene preincubation. Taken together, we hypothesize that the calcium influx from extracellular sources triggers the release of Ca2+ from intracellular endoplasmic reticulum sources through its ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Calcium influx from extracellular space seems to be essential for signaling the apoE-stimulated elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, but contributes only a small amount to the rise in intracellular calcium levels compared with the calcium released from the ER. Although evidence of the association between the ε4 allele of the APOE gene and Alzheimer's disease is overwhelming, the mechanism by which the apoE4 protein isoform influences onset and progression of the disease and its pathology is unknown. Of the many suggested mechanisms, we have focused on reports that apoE3 and apoE4 protein isoforms have differential effects on neuronal plasticity and survival (13Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Miller R.J. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. LaDu M.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 195-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sun Y. Wu S. Bu G. Onifade M.K. Patel S.N. LaDu M.J. Fagan A.M. Holtzman D.M. J.

Compared with the apoE3 protein isoform, apoE4 protein, proteolytic fragments of apoE4 protein, and peptides corresponding to the receptor-binding domain of apoE proteins appear to actively injure, and certainly do not support maintenance of healthy neurites and neuronal cells (13Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Miller R.J. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. LaDu M.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 195-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tolar M. Marques M.A. Harmony J.A.K. Crutcher K.A. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the larger scale, the failure of apoE4 protein isoforms and their related fragments to support neuronal plasticity and maintenance may infer a mechanism that underlies the association between APOE gene alleles and disease. Under many conditions that eventually result in neuronal death, the cell struggles to induce protective mechanisms even though destructive forces inevitably march forward. In this report, we have demonstrated one such scenario where apoE4, but not apoE3, activates an ERK cascade that results in activation of CREB and induction of many different genes including the cell-protective gene, Bcl-2. In prior reports, we showed that overexpression of only Bcl-2 protein could inhibit neuronal death following a toxic insult (25Matsuzaki H. Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Miyake S. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2037-2046PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, treatment of neurons with recombinant apoE4 protein or with synthetic apoE peptide resulted in CREB phosphorylation and induced Bcl-2 expression, events which were not observed following recombinant apoE3 protein treatments. Time course experiments showed that the increase in phospho-CREB levels following apoE4 protein treatments appeared to be slower than that by apoE peptide, although their molar concentrations were the same. This time lag is consistent with previous results where protease inhibitors reduced the neurotoxicity of apoE4 (16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through a presumed mechanism where the full-length apoE4 protein must be digested over time to produce a toxic fragment of apoE4. Despite the increases in phospho-CREB and Bcl-2, we also observed apoE4/apoE peptide-mediated increases in calcium levels that were also observed by others in the context of their association with neuronal death (16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang X.S. Gruenstein E. Cell Physiol. 1997; 173: 73-83Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The apoE4/apoE-peptide-mediated increase of intracellular Ca2+ can be generated by calcium influx from the extracellular space and release of calcium from intracellular stores. Significant attenuation of increased intracellular calcium levels was observed when we cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons in the medium lacking Ca2+ and containing EGTA as a Ca2+chelator, suggesting that calcium influx from extracellular sources follows apoE4/apoE peptide treatments. When we measured the intracellular Ca2+ elevation following preincubation with 10 μm dantrolene, an inhibitor of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel on ER membranes, Ca2+ elevation was also significantly attenuated, suggesting the participation of the calcium influx from ER in the elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Interestingly, extracellular Ca2+-free conditions did not seem to have any additional effect on attenuating the Ca2+ elevation following preincubation with dantrolene, suggesting that calcium influx from the extracellular space may serve to trigger a larger amount of Ca2+ release from the ER through ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel in a “Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release” fashion. Thus, calcium influx from extracellular space may be less than calcium release from intracellular sources such as the endoplasmic reticulum. The apoE peptide-mediated increase in phospho-CREB levels and of intracellular Ca2+ levels was inhibited by pretreatment with RAP, MK801, or nifedipine, suggesting that apoE receptors, NMDA receptor, and LVDCC are involved in rat hippocampal neuron responses to apoE. Tolar et al. (16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that RAP and MK801 attenuated the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ caused by truncated apoE. They also reported that nifedipine did not provide any protection against the apoE-mediated rise in intracellular Ca2+ in rat hippocampal neurons, but data was not shown. Wang et al. (26Wang X.S. Gruenstein E. Cell Physiol. 1997; 173: 73-83Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that RAP, MK801, and diltiazem, another inhibitor of LVDCCs, failed to block the apoE peptide-induced calcium influx in rat primary cultured neurons. Assuming that neurotoxicity is caused by calcium influx following apoE treatment, our data are consistent with the data provided by Tolar et al.(16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in that RAP and MK801 attenuated calcium influx (16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that LRP or some other apoE receptors found in neurons may be linked to NMDA receptor. Our finding that preincubation with nifedipine almost completely inhibited the apoE peptide-induced calcium influx is reasonable because calcium entry through NMDA receptors may depolarize the plasma membrane and open LVDCCs that results in larger amount of calcium influx. Compared with the calcium entry from LVDCCs, calcium entry from NMDA receptors may be negligible (27Rajadhyaksha A. Barczak A. Macias W. Leveque J.C. Lewis S.E. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6348-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this calcium elevation can activate kinases such as ERK and calmodulin kinase II that function to phosphorylate CREB (27Rajadhyaksha A. Barczak A. Macias W. Leveque J.C. Lewis S.E. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6348-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further inhibition experiments showed that pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor and/or a PKA inhibitor mostly prevented the apoE-peptide stimulated phosphorylation of CREB, suggesting that activation of both MEK and PKA kinases are involved in the pathway. Ca2+elevation stimulates CREB phosphorylation by activation of a PKA-dependent, Rap1-MEK-ERK pathway (28Grewal S.S. Fass D.M. Yao H. Ellig C.L. Goodman R.H. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34433-34441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with KN62 or SB203580 did not appear to have any effect on the phosphorylation status of CREB, suggesting that the ERK cascade is a major pathway leading the phosphorylation of CREB following apoE treatment. Upon binding to the CRE element of a gene's promoter, the transcription factor known as CREB facilitates transcription of many different genes, such as c-fos, Bcl-2, andBDNF (27Rajadhyaksha A. Barczak A. Macias W. Leveque J.C. Lewis S.E. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6348-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). CREB that actively binds its DNA element, CRE, is typically phosphorylated on serine at position 133. Activation of CREB by its phosphorylation at serine residue 133 is modulated by a variety of effectors. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) /kainate receptors and NMDA receptors are associated with synapses and LVDCCs are involved in neuronal functions like long-term potentiation (32Fantaske R.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10512-10519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of these receptors has also been associated with increased intracellular Ca2+levels, potentiation of kinase activities, and CREB activation. To clarify if calcium influx caused by apoE treatment causes neurotoxicity and parallels phosphorylation of CREB, we measured the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ caused by apoE peptide in rat hippocampal neurons upon exposure to these receptor antagonists. As others has reported (16Tolar M. Keller J.N. Chan S. Mattson M.P. Marques M.A. Crutcher K.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7100-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of apoE peptide to rat primary hippocampal neurons caused calcium influx and intracellular Ca2+ levels to rise. Preincubation with RAP, MK801, or nifedipine clearly attenuated the Ca2+ elevation (Fig.7 A), which parallels our data on CREB phosphorylation mediated by apoE peptide, suggesting the involvement of apoE receptor. We have shown a possible mechanism whereby apoE4 facilitates the expression of CRE-driven genes and apoE3 does not (Fig.8). We hypothesize that apoE4, which stimulates CREB phosphorylation, may be associated with synaptic plasticity. This apparent isoform specificity of the effects might be relevant to the isoform-specific association of apoE4 as a significant risk factor in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. We thank Drs. Kazunori Imaizumi, Yongho Che, Shin-ichi Miyake, and Hideo Matsuzaki for helpful and informative discussions, and Yumiko Hara for technical assistance."

We found that the HD of Csx/Nkx2.5 binds as a monomer as well as a dimer to its DNA binding sites in the promoter of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, an in vivo target gene of Csx/Nkx2.5. Csx/Nkx2.5 physically interacts with each other in vitro as well as in cells, and the HD is critical for homodimerization. Lys193 and Arg194, located at the COOH-terminal end of HD, are essential for dimerization. Lys193 is also required for a specific interaction with the zinc finger transcription factor GATA4. Csx/Nkx2.5 can heterodimerize with other NK2 homeodomain proteins, Nkx2.3 and Nkx2.6/Tix, with different affinities. A single missense mutation, Ile183 to Pro in the HD of Csx/Nkx2.5, preserved homodimerization function, but totally abolished DNA binding. Ile183 → Pro mutant acts in an inhibitory manner on wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 transcriptional activity through the ANF promoter in 10T1/2 cells. However, Ile183 → Pro mutant does not inhibit wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 function on the ANF promoter in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes, possibly due to failure of dimerization in the presence of the target DNA.

Combinatorial use of a limited number of transcription factors allows the regulation of a larger number of biological processes, increasing both the diversity as well as the specificity of control.

The monomer of HD proteins is sufficient to interact with DNA, and the DNA-bound monomer recruits other partners to the complex (11Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C.

Most likely, the monomer HD proteins regulate through the monomeric DNA binding site, whereas homo- or heterodimerized HD proteins regulate through the dimeric sites. These differential interactions would provide more precise gene regulation at each developmental stage (21Wilson D.S. Desplan C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 32-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The biological significance of dimerization of paired-like class HD proteins has been demonstrated in Xenopus Mix.1, which regulates dorsal-ventral patterning (14Mead P.E. Brivanlou I.H. Kelley C.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To date, the significance of homodimerization of HD-containing transcription factors has not been well established in mammals. Interestingly, 10 heterozygous mutations of human CSX/NKX2.5 were recently identified in patients with congenital heart disease. These patients show progressive atrioventricular conduction defects, left ventricular dysfunction, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of Fallot (22Schott J.J. Benson D.W.

Invest. 2000; 106: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that if Csx/Nkx2.5 forms homodimers, the mutants with DNA binding defects may dominantly inhibit CSX/NKX2.5 function in human cardiac development and maturation. InXenopus, injections of mRNA encoding non-DNA binding mutants of Xenopus XNkx2.3 and XNkx2.5 suppressed normal heart formation and resulted in a small heart or no heart formation in the most severe cases (25Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This in vivo evidence suggests that a non-DNA binding mutant of Csx/Nkx2.5 may act in a dominant inhibitory manner on wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 through protein-protein interaction. Therefore, it is critical to examine whether Csx/Nkx2.5 proteins homo- or heterodimerize to regulate their transcriptional activity.The NK2 class of HD proteins, first described in Drosophila(26Kim Y.

The guanine nucleotide at the fourth position is distinct from all other HD·DNA complexes that usually have thymidine at this position, and 54Tyr is responsible for the unique DNA recognition (27Damante G.

In this study, we demonstrate the homodimerization of Csx/Nkx2.5 at ANF −242 site and determine the critical amino acid residues for homodimerization as well as heterodimerization with GATA4. In addition, we generated a single missense mutation, Ile183 to Pro in the HD of Csx/Nkx2.5, which preserved homodimerization function, but totally abolished DNA binding. Ile183 → Pro mutant acted in an inhibitory manner on wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 transcriptional activity through the ANF promoter depending on the cellular context.DISCUSSIONThe NK2 class homeobox-containing transcription factor Csx/Nkx2.5 is one of the earliest cardiogenic markers from insects to vertebrates (28Chen J.N.

Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 23Benson W. Silberbach G.M.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1567-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These patients show progressive conduction delays and in some cases left ventricular dysfunction after birth, suggesting that Csx/Nkx2.5 also functions in the later stages of heart development and maturation. While evidence is accumulating that Csx/Nkx2.5 mutations inhibit normal cardiac development and maturation in both humans andXenopus (22Schott J.J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M.

Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms for these phenotypes remain to be explained. In this study, we report the new finding of protein dimerization of Csx/Nkx2.5, which may yield insights into the dominant effects of CSX/NKX2.5 mutations found in humans.Csx/Nkx2.5 binds to the palindromic Csx/Nkx2.5 consensus binding sites in the ANF promoter as a monomer as well as a dimer, and dimer formation increases the protein-DNA binding affinity. Csx/Nkx2.5 physically interacts with each other in vitro as well as in a cell. Two basic amino acids, Lys193-Arg194, located in the third helix of HD are necessary for dimerization, and Lys193 is also indispensable for the association with GATA4, which is a cofactor for Csx/Nkx2.5 function. To examine the functional significance of dimerization, we generated a converse mutant (Ile183 → Pro) that does not bind DNA, but has preserved homodimerization ability. In transient transfection assays in 10T1/2 fibroblast cells, this mutant acts in an inhibitory manner on wild type Csx/Nkx2.5. Also, this mutant suppresses the ANF-Luc activity in cardiac myocytes, but does not inhibit the ANF-Luc activity that is further induced by wild type Csx/Nkx2.5.Protein Dimerization of Csx/Nkx2.5 through the HDBy using various deletion and point mutants, we found that two positively charged amino acids, Lys193-Arg194 at the COOH-terminal end of HD (Lys57-Arg58 in HD), are critical for protein-protein interaction. As expected, these two amino acids were highly conserved within NK2 class HD (29Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It was shown that three amino acids (Arg58-Val59-Lys60) located at the carboxyl end of the HD of Pit1 are involved in the homodimerization on DNA by forming a protein-protein interface with the POU-specific domain (15Jacobson E.M. Li P. Leon-del-Rio A. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 198-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to Csx/Nkx2.5, Pit1 requires DNA to homodimerize (59Ingraham H.A. Flynn S.E. Voss J.W. Albert V.R. Kapiloff M.S. Wilson L. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1990; 61: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).The Lys193-Arg194 mutation, located at the carboxyl end of the HD in Csx/Nkx2.5, markedly reduced DNA binding, which is consistent with the NMR structure of another NK2 class HD protein Drosophila NK-2. The third α-helix (helix III) of NK-2 extends up to amino acid 62 in the presence of DNA (52Tsao D.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 60Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H. Wang L.H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 529-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Lys193 is required for the Csx/Nkx2.5 and GATA4 interaction as well as for homodimerization of Csx/Nkx2.5.Regions Outside the HD Facilitate Dimerization on DNACooperative dimerization of HD proteins has been characterized in paired and paired-like HD proteins (11Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Paired HD proteins cooperatively bind DNA with a palindromic TAAT sequence separated by 3 bp. The presence of Arg28 or Arg43 prevents cooperative dimerization, and paired class HD proteins do not have Arg residues at the 28 and 43 positions (11Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In contrast, 50% of HD proteins have conserved Arg28 or Arg43 residues among ∼350 HD proteins (53Duboule D. Guidbook to the Homeobox Genes. A Sambrook & Tooze Publication at Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). NK class HD proteins, as well as engrailed, bcd, POU, and msh class proteins do not have Arg28 or Arg43, suggesting the possibilities for cooperative dimerization in these classes of HD proteins.In Csx/Nkx2.5, regions outside of the HD, particularly the region carboxyl terminus to the HD (aa 251–318), appear to facilitate cooperative dimerization on DNA. Compared with the DNA binding of HD of Csx/Nkx2.5 or the COOH-terminal deletion mutant, we found that the full-length protein facilitated dimerization, and the monomer-dimer transition occurred at ∼13-fold lower protein concentrations than that of the HD or the carboxyl terminus deletion mutant. Our observation that Csx/Nkx2.5 homodimerizes through the HD as well as outside of the HD supports the hypothesis that protein-protein interactions play important roles in cooperative dimerization. Alternatively, a full-length Csx/Nkx2.5 molecule may “bend” DNA to facilitate the binding of a second Csx/Nkx2.5 molecule to DNA, or full-length Csx/Nkx2.5 proteins may be more stable than HD proteins in a dimerized form on DNA. It is also possible that these effects may function cooperatively to regulate the transcriptional activation of target genes.Palindromic NK2-specific binding sites are also identified in the enhancer of the Drosophila ind gene, which is the target of another NK2 class HD protein Vnd (61Weiss J.B. Von Ohlen T. Mellerick D.M. Dressler G. Doe C.Q. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3591-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Also, Tinman, theDrosophila homologue of Csx/Nkx2.5, binds the sequence located at −5.4 kilobases of the Dmef2 gene, which contains two NK2 binding sites separated by 165 bp (62Gajewski K. Kim Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt either one of two Tinman binding sites caused loss of activation of the Dmef2 gene, leading to the hypothesis that the physical interaction of Tinman molecules occurs by looping of the 165-bp intervening segment (62Gajewski K. Kim Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although it has yet to be shown that Tinman protein homodimerizes, our data are consistent with this hypothesis.Heterodimerization with Other NK2 Class ProteinsSeveral NK2 class HD proteins are coexpressed both temporally and spatially, suggesting that NK2 class HD proteins may heterodimerize. As shown in Fig. 6, Csx/Nkx2.5 and Nkx2.6/Tix associated with each other, but the association of Csx/Nkx2.5 and Nkx2.3 was significantly weaker. Although further quantitative analyses are necessary, these results suggest that NK2 class HD proteins potentially interact with each other, and the affinity of the interaction is different depending on heterodimer pairs. In this study, we did not examine the possible heterodimerization of Csx/Nkx2.5 with other classes of HD proteins. Of note, mouse Nkx2.3 is not expressed in the heart, and Nkx2.6/Tix expression is restricted to the sinus venosa and outflow tract of the mouse heart. Other NK2 class HD proteins coexpressed temporally and spatially similar to Csx/Nkx2.5 in the heart have not been described in mouse and human (29Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 41Biben C. Hatzistavrou T. Harvey R.P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 63Pabst O.

Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 23Benson W. Silberbach G.M.

Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and on the evidence for the formation of homodimers of Csx/Nkx2.5 in our study, non-DNA binding mutants might act in a dominant inhibitory manner. We generated a single missense mutation in the third helix of the HD, Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro), which abolishes DNA binding, but preserves dimerization ability. The interaction between GATA4 and Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) was significantly weaker than that of wild type Csx/Nkx2.5; therefore, it is likely that Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) will not sequester GATA4 from wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 when it is overexpressed. The transcriptional activation of wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 on ANF(−638) promoter was indeed suppressed by the coexpressed Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) in a dose-dependent manner in 10T1/2 cells.ANF(−638) promoter activity was slightly suppressed by Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) in neonatal cardiac myocytes where endogenous Csx/Nkx2.5 is expressed. However, when both wild type and Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) mutants were overexpressed in cardiac myocytes, transcriptional activation by wild type was not suppressed by the Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) mutant. Thus, unlike in 10T1/2 cells, Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) does not seem to act as a typical dominant inhibitory mutant on the ANF(−638) promoter in cultured cardiac myocytes. The EMSA using cell lysates prepared from adenovirus-infected cardiac myocytes revealed that coexpression of Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) mutant does not inhibit the specific binding of wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 to the ANF −242 site (Fig. 8 E). Since the Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) mutant expressed in cardiac myocytes did not bind to the ANF −242 site (data not shown), it is possible that Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) mutant loses the ability to form dimers with wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 on DNA and, therefore, does not inhibit the function of wild type Csx/Nkx2.5 on the ANF promoter in cardiac myocytes. It is also possible that the inhibitory effect of Csx/Nkx2.5(Ile183 → Pro) observed in 10T1/2 cells may occur through a mechanism independent of wild type Csx/Nkx2.5. Mutant Csx/Nkx2.5 protein may squelch a transcription factor that is critical for the ANF(−638) promoter activity in 10T1/2 cells.Protein homodimerization of Csx/Nkx2.5 yields the potential for it to precisely regulate a number of genes by utilizing monomeric and dimeric binding. It is possible that the genetically dominant effect of the human CSX/NKX2.5 missense mutations (22Schott J.J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E.

Seidman C.E. Izumo S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) may in part be due to an inhibitory effect of the mutant protein over the wild type protein on target genes that require dimeric binding. The homeodomain (HD)1-containing transcription factors, characterized by their 60-amino acid DNA binding domain, play critical roles in developmental patterning and differentiation. The HD forms three α-helices and contacts the major groove of DNA through the third helix (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Contrary to the highly specific biological functions of individual homeobox genes, in vitro DNA bindi"
https://openalex.org/W1993208372,"In a screen designed to discover suppressors of mitotic catastrophe, we identified the Xenopus ortholog of 53BP1 (X53BP1), a BRCT protein previously identified in humans through its ability to bind the p53 tumor suppressor. X53BP1 transcripts are highly expressed in ovaries, and the protein interacts with Xp53 throughout the cell cycle in embryonic extracts. However, no interaction between X53BP1 and Xp53 can be detected in somatic cells, suggesting that the association between the two proteins may be developmentally regulated. X53BP1 is modified via phosphorylation in a DNA damage-dependent manner that correlates with the dispersal of X53BP1 into multiple foci throughout the nucleus in somatic cells. Thus, X53BP1 can be classified as a novel participant in the DNA damage response pathway. We demonstrate that X53BP1 and its human ortholog can serve as good substrates in vitro as well as in vivo for the ATM kinase. Collectively, our results reveal that 53BP1 plays an important role in the checkpoint response to DNA damage, possibly in collaboration with ATM.

To achieve this, it is essential that the successive phases of the cell cycle are coordinated in a precise and punctual manner, since failure to do so may result in abnormal growth and development, probably as a consequence of genomic instability. For this purpose, cells have evolved an elaborate network of “checkpoint controls” that monitor the proper completion of various events in the cycle including DNA replication in S phase and chromosome segregation during mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Upon genetic damage by any of a number of mechanisms (UV light, ionizing radiation (γ-IR), chemicals, etc.), checkpoint response pathways become activated, leading to attenuation in cell cycle progression and a mobilization of the DNA repair machinery. A growing body of information on the mechanisms of checkpoint control in organisms ranging from yeast to humans have shown the importance of these pathways with respect to maintaining genomic stability (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 2Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). For example, patients with the recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT)1 fail to delay DNA synthesis and mitosis in response to γ-IR, suggesting that the gene responsible for this pleiotropic disease, ATM (mutated in ataxia telangiectasia; Ref. 3Savitsky K. Bar-Shira S. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uzeil T. Sfez S.

Indeed, one of the hallmarks of AT is a predisposition to cancer, probably as a result of the failure to repair damaged DNA (5Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition to ATM, many tumors and cancer predisposition syndromes have defects in checkpoint-related gene products that are phosphorylated and controlled, at least in part, by the ATM kinase.

Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In addition, BRCA1 resides in a large complex of proteins (BASC) dedicated to repairing various forms of damaged DNA (19Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This includes DNA mismatch repair proteins, the BLM helicase, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex that is believed to function in the repair of DSBs (21Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 22Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recent work by Elledge and colleagues has suggested that mutations in the ATM/BRCA1 pathway may account for 10% of all cases of breast cancer (11Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The biological response to DNA damage is best understood in both the budding and fission yeast systems (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 24O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In many respects, the general framework of the pathways responsible for checkpoint signaling appears to be conserved from yeasts to humans. Here, DNA damage-sensing proteins (e.g. various Rad gene products) transduce signals to phosphoinositide (PI)-kinase like proteins (Mec1/Tel1 in budding yeast, ATM and ATR in higher eukaryotes) that regulate effector kinases and/or transcription factors (Rad53/Dun1 in budding yeast, Cds1/Chk2 in higher eukaryotes; Refs. 9Matsuoka S.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA damage slows S phase progression and can arrest cells at either the G1/S or the G2/M transitions (31Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 32Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In particular, Rad9 has been shown to be a critical factor for various checkpoint responses (31Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 32Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 33Siede W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to Rad9, several other budding yeast gene products have been identified to play important roles in sensing DNA damage or blocks in DNA replication. These include Rad53, Mec3, Rad1, Rad24, Pol2, Dpb11, and Rfc5 and their orthologous counterparts in other species (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 25Al-Khodairy F. Foton E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5485-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the precise biochemical functions for many of these proteins remain unknown, some DNA damage-sensing factors from various systems appear to possess similarities to DNA polymerase accessory factors, repair proteins, and exonucleases (25Al-Khodairy F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such properties might be expected for proteins whose functions are to sense DNA damage. One major checkpoint response in higher eukaryotes is activated upon exposure to γ-IR or other agents that create DSBs. The PI-kinase like protein ATM responds to this type of genotoxic insult (41Halazonetis T.D. Shiloh Y. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: 45-55Google Scholar) in a manner that is most likely dependent upon DNA damage-sensing proteins. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor is known to mediate cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage (42Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Diery W. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar, 44Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The gene encoding p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in all cases of human cancer (45Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6738) Google Scholar). p53 protein levels are activated and stabilized in cells exposed to γ-IR. Here, the protein can act as a tetrameric transcription factor by inducing the expression of genes involved with the DNA damage response (42Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 44Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which p53 is activated are not well understood and are likely to be cell type-specific (44Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In other instances, p53 directs the apoptotic response (45Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6738) Google Scholar). p53 protein levels are tightly regulated by the Mdm2 protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation by the proteosome. It is believed that multiple modifications at the N and C termini contribute to the activation of latent p53 (44Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 45Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6738) Google Scholar). Such modifications include phosphorylation by ATM on serine residue 15 (7, 8) and phosphorylation of serine 20 by Cds1/Chk2 (46Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Shieh S.-Y. Ahn J. Tamia K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these modifications are believed to contribute to the overall stability of p53, perhaps by interfering with its ability to be degraded by Mdm2. One protein that interacts with p53 is 53BP1 (48Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). 53BP1 was initially identified in a two-hybrid screen with p53 as bait (48Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Using murine p53 amino acids (aa) 73–390 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, two human proteins were identified which bound to p53. These proteins, designated as 53BP1 and 53BP2, bound to the transcriptional activation domain of p53 but not to a version of p53 with a point mutation (R175H) in this domain (48Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). R175H generates a transcriptionally incompetent p53 protein and has been found in patients with cancer (45Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6738) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of 53BP1 and 53BP2 is sensitive to the conformation of p53. Additional studies have shown that 53BP1 can enhance p53-mediated transcription of reporter genes (58Iwabuchi K. Li B. Massa H.F. Trask B.J. Date T. Fields S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26061-26068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 53BP1 possesses strong homology to the C-terminal repeats of BRCA1 (BRCT motifs). BRCT domains are autonomously folding modules consisting of ∼100 aa and are believed to mediate protein-protein interactions, particularly with respect to proteins associated with the cell cycle and the various aspects of DNA metabolism: replication, recombination, and repair (49Callebaut I. Mornon J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 50Bork P. Hoffman K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6404-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Other proteins possessing BRCT motifs include budding yeast Rad9 and Dpb11, fission yeast Crb2 and Cut5, and mammalian XRCC1 and DNA ligase IV (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar,51Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R. Sternberg M.J.E. Lindahl T. Freemont P.S.

The C-terminal 271 aa of human 53BP1, the region encompassing the BRCT folds, was found to interact with p53 through its C-terminal BRCT repeats (48Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Murine 53BP1 has also been isolated in the two-hybrid assay when the inteferon-inducible p202 protein is used as bait (54Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27544-27555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the isolation and characterization of theXenopus ortholog of human 53BP1 (X53BP1). We discovered X53BP1 in a screen designed to identify suppressors of mitotic catastrophe (negative regulators of the cell cycle) of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain SP984 (55Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We have previously exploited the mitotic catastrophe phenotype of SP984 to isolate Xorc2, a component of the origin recognition complex (56Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This strain contains a temperature-sensitive mutation in wee1 and a null mutation in the partially redundant mik1 gene. Both genes encode proteins that modify and negatively regulate the Cdc2 kinase (Cdk1), a Cdk that functions in the progression into mitosis (57Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature of 35.5 °C, SP984 prematurely enters mitosis due to its inability to control the precocious activation of Cdc2. Thus, cDNA molecules capable of rescuing SP984 will express proteins that either directly or indirectly inhibit Cdc2 activity. The complete cDNA encoding X53BP1 presented here, in conjunction with the recently described human sequence (58Iwabuchi K. Li B. Massa H.F. Trask B.J. Date T. Fields S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26061-26068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), reveals that 53BP1 proteins from both frogs and humans are well conserved and contain numerous putative ATM family member phosphorylation sites (59Kim S.-T. Lim D.-S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) in addition to their BRCT motifs. Northern blotting reveals that X53BP1 expression appears largely restricted to ovaries. Consequently, we find that the protein is abundant in eggs but much less so in somatic cells. We present evidence that X53BP1 and Xp53 associate throughout the cell cycle in a cell-free system, confirming the original two-hybrid isolation of 53BP1 (48Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) in a specialized cellular setting. In contrast, no association between X53BP1 and Xp53 can be detected in somatic cells, suggesting that the interaction between these proteins is under developmental control or is restricted to germline tissue. Additionally, we find that X53BP1 is phosphorylated in vivoin response to DNA damage. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that both the frog and human 53BP1 proteins serve as substrates for the ATM kinase in vitro, particularly in an N-terminal region containing numerous ATM phosphorylation motifs. In addition, ATM phosphorylates human 53BP1 in an N-terminal region in vivoin response to γ-IR. Taken together, our data indicate that 53BP1 plays a significant role in the cellular response to DNA damage, classifying it as an important checkpoint response protein. The fission yeast strain SP984 (55Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) was transformed with a Xenopus laeviscDNA library prepared in the S. pombe expression vector pAX-NMT (56Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 60Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) by the spheroplast method using Lipofectin (56Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). pAX-NMT is a fission yeast/Escherichia coli shuttle vector and contains the S. cerevisiae LEU2 gene for selection. From ∼200,000 transformants, about 60 colonies grew at the nonpermissive temperature of 35.5 °C on minimal media lacking leucine and thiamine. One rescuant, pC535, was chosen for further study. pC535 plasmid DNA was isolated and used to re-rescue SP984 from mitotic catastrophe at the nonpermissive temperature. Once the rescuing event was confirmed, the 1.9-kb ApaI/XhoI cDNA insert of pC535 was used to probe a Xenopus oocyte library as described previously (56Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 60Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This screen yielded S48-1, which contains a 5.6-kb cDNA insert corresponding to X53BP1. To isolate the 5′-end of X53BP1, sequence information at the 5′-end of S48-1 was used to perform RACE PCR as described below. DNA sequencing of the cDNA insert of S48-1 was done by primer walking with custom designed oligonucleotides. The complete cDNA sequence for X53BP1 was assembled with information generated from S48-1 and pZX-1 (see below). Various tissues as described under “Results” were collected from adult female X. laevis frogs and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the various tissues or from somaticXenopus tissue culture (XTC) cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) in conjunction with DNase I. 5′-RACE PCR was performed with a RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was synthesized from 1.0 μg of total XTC RNA using the GSP1 primer: 5′-AAAGAAGAATCCTTAG-3′. After dC tailing, a PCR was carried out using the cDNA as a template along with an abridged anchor primer and the nested GSP2 primer: 5′-CAGCATCTTGGGAAGGAGAAACCAGAT-3′. A dilution of the original PCR was reamplified with a nested GSP3 primer: 5′-CAGAAGGATGGAGTAGGCGCAAACTGT-3′. All reactions were carried out under the recommended conditions of the supplier. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels, and a target band of ∼0.9 kb was gel purified and ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), creating pZX-1. DNA sequencing of pZX-1 was performed on both strands by primer walking using an ABI sequencer and shown to unambiguously overlap with S48-1. For Northern hybridization, 10 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.0% formaldehyde agarose gel with a 0.4–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary elution with 20× SSC and fixed with 0.5 n sodium hydroxide. The membrane was prehybridized at 65 °C for 15 min in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with a 0.9-kb probe corresponding to the extreme 5′-end of X53BP1 or a 1.2-kb fragment derived from Xenopus EF-1α (62Krieg P.A. Varnum S.M. Wormington W.M. Melton D.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 65 °C in rapid hybridization buffer. The membrane was washed for 15 min at 65 °C for 15 min in 2× SSC, 1× SSC, and 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS and exposed to film. Xenopus cell-free extracts were prepared by the method of Murray (53Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Interphase extracts were generated by the addition of 0.4 mm calcium chloride to cytostatic factor (CSF)-arrested extracts in the presence of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 25 °C. The entry into interphase was verified through either H1 kinase assays or observation of nuclear envelope formation. To produce polyclonal rabbit antibodies against X53BP1, we generated a GST fusion protein between GST and residues 1652–2055 of X53BP1 by PCR amplification with a high fidelity DNA polymerase, creating GST-XBP1–5. This amplified X53BP1 fragment was ligated in frame into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a BamHI fragment. The resulting recombinant was confirmed and used to transform DH10B cells. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 3 h. Soluble GST-XBP1–5 protein was affinity purified on glutathione-agarose. The purified protein was used as antigen for injection into rabbits (Covance). All other 53BP1 fusion proteins were generated in a similar manner. Various bleeds were tested for antibody production via immunoblotting with a chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and those that were positive were used to affinity-purify αX53BP1. Anti-GST antibodies were selectively removed from the serum by adsorption onto GST-loaded Sepharose beads. The unbound antibodies against X53BP1 were affinity-purified as described (72Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24891-24897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with GST-XBP1–5 protein coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the generation of antibodies against Xp53, the full coding sequence to Xp53 was isolated from aXenopus cDNA library (60Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), amplified with a high fidelity DNA polymerase, and ligated in frame into pGEX4T-1 for protein expression. Soluble GST-Xp53 was expressed in DH10B bacterial cells and affinity-purified as described above. The isolated protein was used as an antigen to generate polyclonal antibodies. XTC cells were cultured in Liebovitz' L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 36 plates were grown to 60% confluency. One half of the plates was treated with 10 Gy of γ-IR with a cesium irradiator, and the other half was left untreated. Samples were allowed to recover for 1 h post-treatment. After the recovery period, the cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed on ice with PBS supplemented with 1% TX-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm CaCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Clarified supernatants were treated for 1 h with αX53BP1 (or αXp53 in some cases) that had been covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed four times with EB+ buffer (20 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm Hepes, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 25 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.5). The beads were further washed twice in an EB+ buffer without detergent and sodium fluoride. Finally, the samples were washed twice in λ phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5) and split in half. One half was treated with phosphatase buffer and the other was supplemented with 1.0 unit of λ-phosphatase (New En"

We now report that another phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a direct inhibitor of initiator caspases 8 and 9, and their common effector caspase 3. PIP2 inhibited procaspase 9 processing in cell extracts and in a reconstituted procaspase 9/Apaf1 apoptosome system. It inhibited purified caspase 3 and 8 activity, at physiologically attainable PIP2 levels in mixed lipid vesicles. Caspase 3 binding to PIP2 was confirmed by cosedimentation with mixed lipid vesicles. Overexpression of phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase α (PIP5KIα), which synthesizes PIP2, suppressed apoptosis, whereas a kinase-deficient mutant did not. Protection by the wild-type PIP5KIα was accompanied by decreases in the generation of activated caspases and of caspase 3-cleaved PARP. Protection was not mediated through PIP3 or Akt activation. An anti-apoptotic role for PIP2 is further substantiated by our finding that PIP5KIα was cleaved by caspase 3 during apoptosis, and cleavage inactivated PIP5KIα in vitro. Mutation of the P4 position (D279A) of the PIP5KIα caspase 3 cleavage consensus prevented cleavage in vitro, and during apoptosis in vivo. Significantly, the caspase 3-resistant PIP5KIα mutant was more effective in suppressing apoptosis than the wild-type kinase. These results show that PIP2 is a direct regulator of apical and effector caspases in the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways, and that PIP5KIα inactivation contributes to the progression of apoptosis. This novel feedforward amplification mechanism for maintaining the balance between life and death of a cell works through phosphoinositide regulation of caspases and caspase regulation of phosphoinositide synthesis. Phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate promote cell survival and protect against apoptosis by activating Akt/PKB, which phosphorylates components of the apoptotic machinery.

The D3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)1 and PI(3,4)P2, have been clearly implicated in the promotion of cell survival.

The D4 phosphorylated phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), has not been directly shown to promote cell survival, although it may contribute in a number of ways indirectly. PIP2 is a substrate for phosphoinositide 3-kinase that synthesizes the pro-survival D3 lipids (5Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Recently, it was reported that PIP2 complexed with gelsolin inhibits caspase 3 and caspase 9, but not caspase 8 (12Azuma T. Koths K. Flanagan L. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3761-3766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and that PIP2 alone does not inhibit caspases. We now report that PIP2 alone inhibits initiator and executioner caspases in the two major apoptotic cascades. These cascades start with death receptor activation of procaspase 8 or mitochondrial activation of procaspase 9, and both converge on procaspase 3. We also present in vivo evidence for the roles of PIP2 in apoptotic signaling. Human type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 kinase α (PIP5KIα) (13Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

These results suggest a novel feedforward amplification mechanism for maintaining the balance between phosphoinositide regulation of caspases and caspase regulation of phosphoinositide synthesis. PIP2 was from either Calbiochem or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3 were gifts of C. S. Chen (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). PI(4)P, PS, and PC were purchased from Avanti Lipids. Phosphoinositide micelles and mixed vesicles were prepared by probe sonication (16Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 and procaspase 9 were expressed in Sf20 cells and purified (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

Recombinant caspase 3 and caspase 8 were purified from bacteria. PCMV2 procaspase 9 vector was as described by Li et al. (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). The human PIP5KIα cDNA was generated by PCR from a HeLa cell cDNA pool. It was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and an expression vector (pCMV5) containing a Myc tag at the 5′ end (18Rozelle A. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H.E. Insall R.H. Roth M.G.

The PIP5KIα cDNA constructs were subcloned into pET-28c(+) (Novagen) with a hexahistidine tag at the 5′ end. Recombinant PIP5KIα was purified from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). Human plasma gelsolin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ion exchange chromatography (16Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The GFP-AktPH cDNA was a gift of T. Balla (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (20Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Adenovirus containing PIP5KIα or β-gal were used to infect cells according to protocol described by Shibaski et al. (21Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were broken by Dounce homogenization in a hypotonic buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The high speed supernatant contained mitochondria-derived cytochrome c, and the caspase 9 cascade was activated by incubation with 1 mm dATP at 30 °C for 1 h (22Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Procaspase 9 was first incubated with PIP2 micelles on ice for 10 min in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF). Apoptosomes were assembled by mixing procaspase 9 with Apaf-1, cytochrome c (0.01 μg/μl), dATP (100 μm), and MgCl2 (2.5 mm) and incubating for 1 h at 30 °C (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the release of AFC from synthetic substrates at 37 °C. Recombinant hamster caspase 3 or human caspase 8 (between 6 to 100 nm) was incubated with 267 μmAc-DEVD-AFC or Ac-IETD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products), respectively, in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA. Results were analyzed as described by Zhouet al. (24Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Inhibition rates were calculated from progress curves that are generated by adding caspase to a fluorogenic substrate in the presence of 0–20 μm phosphoinositide. The rate for the uninhibited reaction (Vo ) was obtained from the linear portion of the time course of the reaction, and the rate for the inhibited reaction (Vi ) was determined from the steady state formation of the product. The apparentK i(app) (apparent inhibition constant), was derived from the slope of the [(Vo /Vi ) − 1]versus PIP2 curve. K i , the inhibition constant, was calculated using the equationK i = (K i )app/(1 + [S]/K m ), where [S] is the substrate concentration. K m , the Michaelis constant for substrate cleavage, was calculated in the range of 5–200 μm for Ac-IETD-AFC, and of 10–700 μm for Ac-DEVD-AFC using the Lineweaver-Burke plot. Mixed lipid vesicles containing 90% PC and 10% of phosphoinositides or PS were prepared by probe sonication in water, and added to caspase 3. The final reaction mixture contained 30 μm amount of the test phospholipid (phosphoinositide or PS) and 2.5 μm caspase 3 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 110 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin was included to reduce nonspecific binding. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatants were collected, and the pellets were resuspended to the original volume. Equivalent volumes were loaded onto SDS gels. HeLa and HEK293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. 2 μg of total DNA was used in all cases. Cells were analyzed within 24 h after transfection. Apoptosis was induced by transfection of pCMV2-FLAG-procaspase 9 (for 24 h), or with apoptotic inducers. These include 1 μm staurosporine or 50 ng/ml TNFα. 10 ng/ml cycloheximide (CHX) or 0.2 μg/ml actinomycin D was added to enhance the apoptotic effect of TNFα. The latter was used in some experiments, because cycloheximide is no longer available commercially. 20 μm z-DEVD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products) or 200 nm wortmannin (Sigma) was added to cells 30 min prior to addition of the apoptosis inducers when indicated. Floating and adherent cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). In some cases, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 45 mm pyrophosphate) were included. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used for Western blotting. Endogenous and overexpressed PIP5KIα were detected with an affinity purified rabbit anti-PIP5KIα antibody (gift of R. A. Anderson, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and with anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz), respectively. Other antibodies used are: anti-caspase 3 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-caspase 9 (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar) (PharMingen), anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (New England Biolabs), anti-PARP p85 (Promega), and anti-FLAG (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Bio-Rad). Apoptotic index was determined using DAPI staining or β-gal staining. For DAPI staining, cells were fixed in formaldehyde and stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI, and with anti-FLAG to detect cells overexpressing procaspase 9. β-Gal-transfected cells were identified after staining with X-gal. Blue round cells with irregularly shaped nuclei (apoptotic) and blue spread cells (nonapoptotic) in randomly chosen fields were counted in a blinded fashion. More than 500 cells were counted per condition. The two methods gave comparable results. PIP5KIα was incubated with caspase or buffer for 60 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm NaEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm PMSF (caspase 3 buffer). The kinase assay buffer had a final concentration of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 180 μm ATP, 70 μm PI(4)P, and a 1:1 w/w ratio of PI(4)P/PS vesicles (13Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C and stopped at timed intervals. Samples were extracted with CHCl3:MeOH:HCl, spotted on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates together with unlabeled PIP2 standards. Phospholipids were resolved with 1-propanol:H2O:NH2OH (65:15:20) and detected by autoradiography. PIP2 standard was visualized with iodine vapor. The mitochondrial pathway was activated by adding dATP to cell extracts to initiate the Apaf-1/procaspase 9/cytochrome c apoptosome cascade (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 22Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). In untreated cytosolic extracts, procaspase 3 was present as an inactive 32-kDa zymogen (Fig.1 A, left panel, lane 1). dATP generated a 17-kDa band corresponding to the larger caspase 3 subunit, and a decrease in the intensity of the procaspase 3 band (lane 3). Pretreatment of extracts with PIP2completely inhibited procaspase 3 processing (lane 2). Since procaspase 3 is a substrate for caspase 9, the lysates were also blotted with anti-caspase 9 (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Procaspase 9 (47 kDa) was detected in the naive lysate (lane 1), and dATP converted all of the procaspase 9 to a 37-kDa mature form. PIP2 blocked procaspase 9 cleavage, suggesting that PIP2 acted at the level of the initiator caspase. 3 μm PIP2/PC vesicles were as inhibitory as 3 μm PIP2micelles (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4). 3 μm PIP3 also decreased pro-caspase 3 cleavage, although to a lesser extent (lane 5). Thus, PIP2 and PIP3 inhibit caspase processing, and inhibition occurs in a physiologically relevant milieu. PIP2 also inhibited procaspase 9 activation in an in vitro reconstituted apoptosome system (23Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). In the presence of Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and dATP, procaspase 9 was cleaved into two smaller polypeptides (Fig. 1 C). Cleavage was dependent on Apaf-1. 5 μm PIP2 partially inhibited procaspase 9 processing, and 20 μmPIP2 inhibited it completely. PIP2 may suppress procaspase 9 activation by inhibiting caspase 9 as soon as it is processed. In this way, further autoprocessing would be blocked. The alternative possibility that PIP2 inhibits procaspase 9 binding to Apaf-1 is less likely, but has not been ruled out. The instability of purified recombinant caspase 9 in vitro (25Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) precluded detailed analysis of the effect of PIP2 on caspase 9 activity. PIP2 inhibited purified caspases 8 and 3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A and B). We used progress curves to calculate an inhibition constant (K i ), according to the method described by Zhouet al. (24Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). This method is used extensively to estimate theK i of many inhibitors of apoptosis (26Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 27Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Among the phosphoinositides tested, PIP2 was most potent (TableI). PIP3 inhibited with a 10-fold higher K i than PIP2. PI(4)P had no effect (Fig. 3 A), so itsK i cannot be calculated. Inositol trisphosphate, the inositol polyphosphate that is equivalent to PIP2 except that it has no diacylglycerol chain, was not inhibitory at high concentrations (>33 μm, data not shown). Thus, caspases 8 and 3 are able to discriminate between phosphoinositide stereoisomers, and caspase inhibition requires the phosphoinositol headgroup and the diacylglycerol chain. These characteristics are similar to that of some, but not all, phosphoinositide-binding proteins (28Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 29Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.-K. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P.

Since PIP2 is much more abundant than PIP3 (40-fold by one estimate) (30Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), PIP2 is likely to be the predominant inhibitor of caspases in quiescent cells, although PIP3 may also directly inhibit caspases in proliferating cells.Table IInhibition constants (Ki ) for caspasesK iPIP2PI(3,4,5)P3PI(3,4)P2μmCaspase-30.232.17.1Caspase-80.187.45.3 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Effects of PIP2 vesicles on caspase 3 activity.

Mixed lipid vesicles containing 90% PC, and 10% of one of the following: PIP3, PIP2, PI(3,4)P2, PS (lanes 1–4, respectively, at a final concentration of 30 μm) were incubated with 2.5 μm caspase 3 and collected by high speed centrifugation. Equivalent fractions of supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inhibitory effect of PIP2 was reduced by gelsolin, a well characterized PIP2-binding protein (11Yin H.L. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32529-32530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This was demonstrated using either caspase 8 or caspase 3. Gelsolin had minimal effect on caspase 8 activity by itself (Fig. 2 C). However, gelsolin prevented PIP2 from inhibiting caspase 8. We tested a range of PIP2 concentrations (5–20 μm). We consistently observed reduced caspase 8 inhibition by PIP2 in the presence of gelsolin (data not shown). Likewise, gelsolin blocked the inhibitory effect of PIP2 on caspase 3 (Fig. 2 D). Our results are different from that of Azuma et al. (12Azuma T. Koths K. Flanagan L. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3761-3766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in two respects. First, they found that PIP2 does not inhibit caspase on its own. However, PIP2 becomes inhibitory when complexed with gelsolin. Second, they reported that, although the PIP2:gelsolin complex inhibits caspase 3 and caspase 9, it did not inhibit caspase 8. Their results suggest that gelsolin may enhance PIP2 regulation of caspases, while ours indicate that gelsolin competes with caspases for PIP2. We cannot explain why our results were different. The Azuma group prepared unilamellar lipid vesicles using an extrusion technique (12Azuma T. Koths K. Flanagan L. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3761-3766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and observed no inhibition of caspase activity between 0.25 and 2 μm PIP2. They did not show results at higher doses. We used PIP2 from two other sources (Calbiochem and Roche Molecular Biochemicals), prepared micelles, and mixed vesicles by probe sonication. We found a dose-dependent inhibition of caspase activity beginning at 2 μm PIP2presented as mixed micelles. Our PIP2 had no detectable impurities, based on a high pressure liquid chromatography analysis that can distinguish between the PIP2 from PI(3,4)P2, PI(4)P, and PIP3. 2D. T. Hilgemann, personal communication. Another potential explanation is that the different assay conditions may affect the outcome. We use a much higher gelsolin:PIP2 ratio to observe inhibition. Decreasing the gelsolin:PIP2 ratio, however, did not promote caspase activity. We have also ruled out that differences in KCl or divalent ion concentration or pH account for our different findings. Although the reason for the discrepancies between the two groups has not yet been resolved, both studies highlight the potential role of PIP2 in caspase regulation. Competition and cooperation among PIP2-binding proteins have been documented previously (31Sun H.-Q. Lin K.-M. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and cross-talk between them may add another level of complexity to their regulation in vivo. PIP2 was also inhibitory when presented to caspases in mixed vesicles with PC (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, 10% phosphatidylserine (PS), 90% PC vesicles and PI(4)P vesicles were not inhibitory even at high concentrations (Fig.3 A). 2 μm PIP2 was inhibitory when presented as 4% PIP2, 96% PC vesicles (Fig.3 B). PIP2 was still inhibitory at even higher dilution (1% PIP2, 99% PC), although more PIP2 was required. A similar dependence on PIP2fractional concentration has been reported for several other PIP2-binding proteins (32Janmey P.A. Iida K. Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12228-12236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase 3 binding to PIP2 and PIP3 was demonstrated by cosedimentation with mixed lipid vesicles (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the lack of inhibition by PI(3,4)P2/PC and PS/PC, caspase 3 did not cosediment with these vesicles. Since caspases do not have recognizable pleckstrin homology domains (PH), which mediate phosphoinositide binding in many proteins (29Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.-K. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), their PIP2 binding domains remain to be identified. PIP2-binding proteins that do not have a recognizable PH domain often bind PIP2 through lysine- and arginine-rich regions (34Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). 3L. Feng, M. Mejillano, H. L. Yin, J. Chen, and G. D. Prestwich, unpublished work. To determine whether PIP2 inhibits caspases in vivo, we overexpressed human type I PIP5KIα (13Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) by transient overexpression and by adenovirus-mediated infection, and examined the effect on apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced by overexpression of procaspase 9 or by treatment with TNFα. Overexpression of procaspase 9 (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar) allowed us to bypass the upstream aspects of apoptotic signaling, and to focus on the effects of PIP2 on procaspase 9 processing and its downstream sequelae. HEK293 cells were used for transient expression studies, because they can be readily cotransfected with multiple expression vectors at high frequency. Control-transfected HEK293 cells had a low level of apoptosis (between 10% and 14%), and PIP5KIα overexpression had no effect on basal apoptosis. However, PIP5KIα overexpression reduced the percentage of apoptotic procaspase 9-transfected cells significantly (Fig.4 A). Apoptosis was assayed by nuclear condensation as visualized by DAPI stain"
https://openalex.org/W2037753872,"Tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by a balance of tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Whereas the contribution of PTKs to breast tumorigenesis is the subject of intense scrutiny, the potential role of PTPs is poorly known. RPTPalpha is implicated in the activation of Src family kinases, and regulation of integrin signaling, cell adhesion, and growth factor responsiveness. To explore its potential contribution to human neoplasia, we surveyed RPTPalpha protein levels in primary human breast cancer. We found RPTPalpha levels to vary widely among tumors, with 29% of cases manifesting significant overexpression. High RPTPalpha protein levels correlated significantly with low tumor grade and positive estrogen receptor status. Expression of RPTPalpha in breast carcinoma cells led to growth inhibition, associated with increased accumulation in G0 and G1, and delayed tumor growth and metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a study correlating expression level of a specific bona fide PTP with neoplastic disease status in humans."

The surface loop at the 50/20-kDa junction of myosin (loop 2) is part of the actin interface. Here we demonstrate that elimination of two highly conserved lysines at the C-terminal end of loop 2 specifically blocks the ability of heavy meromyosin to undergo a weak to strong binding transition with actin in the presence of ATP. Removal of these lysines has no effect on strong binding in the absence of nucleotide, on the rate of ADP binding or release, or on the basal ATPase activity. We further show that the 16 amino acids of loop 2 preceding the lysine-rich region are not essential for actin activation, although they do modulate myosin's affinity for actin in the presence of ATP. We conclude that interaction of the conserved lysines with acidic residues in subdomain 1 of actin either triggers a structural change or stabilizes a conformation that is necessary for actin-activated release of Pi and completion of the ATPase cycle.

This cyclic interaction between actin and myosin is thought to involve the steps illustrated in Scheme 1, whereA is actin and M is myosin.AM+ATP↔K1AM(ATP)↔K2AM·ATP↔AM·ADP·Pi↔K6AM·ADP↔K7AM“Weakly bound”“Strongly bound”↑↓K3↑↓K5K4M·ATP↔M·ADP·Pi“Dissociated states”SCHEME1Hydrolysis of ATP occurs principally with the myosin dissociated from actin. Following hydrolysis, the formation of the weakly bound, A·M·ADP·Pi state (K 5) is governed by electrostatic interactions between myosin and actin. Progression to the strongly bound AM·ADP state (K 6) requires major conformational changes that result in force generation and Pi release and involves structural elements in both the lower and upper 50-kDa domains that lie on either side of a deep cleft within the motor domain (reviewed in Ref. 1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Because actin catalyzes the release of Pi, it must stabilize a myosin conformational state from which Pi can be released and strong binding can then follow. Although a number of the residues on both actin and myosin that are involved in formation of the weak and strong interactions have been delineated (reviewed in Ref.2Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the interactions that trigger the transition from weak to strong binding and concurrent Pi release are unknown. One of the components of the actomyosin interface that is believed to be involved in the initial interaction between actin and myosin is a surface loop at the 50/20-kDa proteolytic junction (loop 2). Although the loop residues are not well resolved in most crystal structures of the myosin head (3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A.

Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), there is a large body of biochemical evidence that implicates loop 2 in the interaction between actin and myosin. Proteolytic cleavage within the C-terminal cluster of lysine residues weakened binding of actin to myosin and markedly reduced actin-activated ATPase activity (6Yamamoto K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and this cleavage was prevented by binding to actin (7Mornet D. Pantel P. Audemard E. Kassab R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, actin can be cross-linked to this lysine-rich region (8Yamamoto K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and a peptide corresponding to loop 2 bound to the N-terminal region of actin (9Cheung P. Reisler E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of a negatively charged “antipeptide” to the lysine-rich region on myosin significantly reduced actin binding (10Chaussepied P. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7471-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sites on actin that presumably interact with positively charged residues on myosin include the acidic cluster of residues at positions 1–4, 24/25, and 99/100, all in subdomain 1 (11Sutoh K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), removed large segments of loop 2 (18Knetsch M.L. Uyeda T.Q.P. Manstein D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3785-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) all concluded that loop 2 affects the affinity for actin in the presence of ATP. In some studies the source of loop 2 also appeared to affectV max of the actin-activated ATPase in a way that reflected the ATPase rate of the donor myosin (21Uyeda T.Q.P. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3785-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such data led Spudich (23Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) to propose the provocative hypothesis that the variable portion of loop 2 determines or tunes the ATPase properties of the myosin motor. Unlike any of the previous mutational studies, we focused on the conserved rather than the variable residues of loop 2. We noted that two positively charged residues (generally two lysines) at the C-terminal end of loop 2 are invariant in all myosins and thus postulated that the positioning and conservation of these residues is a critical feature for actomyosin function. We demonstrate here that these two lysine residues are absolutely required for actin activation of myosin activity. In contrast, 16 residues from the remainder of the loop can be deleted with minimal impact on actin activation of myosin. The cDNA for chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin was truncated after the nucleotides coding for amino acid 1112 to create an HMM1-like fragment. Nucleotides coding for a Myc epitope (24Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) followed by the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and a stop signal were appended. The HMM-like construct was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create three mutant constructs. For “AA” mutant HMM, the nucleotides coding for lysines at amino acids 652 and 653 were replaced with nucleotides coding for two alanines. For “d16” mutant HMM, the nucleotides coding for amino acids 627 through 649 were deleted. For “d18” mutant HMM, the nucleotides coding for amino acids 627 through 651 were deleted. Recombinant baculovirus encoding the HMM-like constructs were prepared by conventional protocols (25O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells in suspension culture were coinfected with virus coding for either a WT HMM or mutant HMM construct and for virus coding for both smooth muscle regulatory light chains (RLC) and essential light chains (in p2Bac vector; Invitrogen). Three days after infection, Sf9 cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.6 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm NaN3, 7% sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmMgATP, 4 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Protein that fractionated between 40 and 70% ammonium sulfate was dialyzed in the presence of RNase A (pretreated with protease inhibitors; Sigma). The HMM was isolated on an anti-FLAG affinity column, eluted with FLAG peptide, and dialyzed against 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50% glycerol. The RLC on HMM was phosphorylated by addition of ATP, Ca2+, calmodulin, and myosin light chain kinase at 0 °C. The purity of the preparations was determined with SDS polyacrylamide gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the RLC was confirmed using 40% glycerol gels with samples dissolved in 7.5 murea (27Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). HMM concentration was determined by Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Phosphorylated HMM at 0.1 mg/ml was mixed with 0.04 mg/ml actin and 1 mm MgATP and centrifuged for 20 min at 350,000 × g to remove HMM that was unable to dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% methylcellulose, 1 mm MgATP, 10 mm DTT, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.018 mg/ml catalase essentially as described (28Warshaw D.M. Desrosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Assays were also conducted with 60 mm KCl and 0.7% methylcellulose. An anti-rod monoclonal antibody (Ab S2.1) (29Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used to bind the HMM to the nitrocellulose-coated coverslip. Actin-activated ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in 8 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μg/ml HMM except for HMM in samples without actin and for the AA mutant HMM, which was 50 μg/ml. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 mm MgATP. The reactions were stopped with SDS at six time points per actin concentration, and inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically (30White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NH4+-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in 0.4 m NH4Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris base, 0.2 msucrose, and 1.5 μg/ml phosphorylated HMM. The reactions were initiated by addition of 4 mm NH4ATP. The reactions were stopped at six time points with SDS, and inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically. Varying concentrations of actin were mixed with 0.2 mg/ml HMM and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm MgCl2 and allowed to sit for 10 min at room temperature. 3 mm MgATP was added, and the samples were centrifuged in the Beckman TL-100 at 350,000 × g for 20 min. Equal proportions of supernatant and dissolved pellet were run on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Gel images were captured in digital format using a Kodak Digital Science DC120 zoom digital camera. The band intensities were quantified using the Kodak Digital Science 1D image analysis software package to determine the percentage of HMM bound to pelleted actin. A plot of band intensityversus micrograms of HMM per lane gave a linear relationship over the range of band intensities found in the experimental samples. Actin was labeled with pyrene-iodoacetamide as described (31Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of pyrene-labeled actin was determined by Bradford reagent with unlabeled actin as standard. Fluorescence titrations were carried out on an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer at 20 °C using excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 407 nm, respectively, and excitation/emission bandwidths of 1 nm. 1 μm pyrene-actin in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm NaN3 was titrated with increments of 0.25 μm dephosphorylated HMM until the fluorescence was maximally quenched. 1 mm MgATP was added to reverse the actin-HMM binding, and fluorescence was remeasured. All kinetic experiments were done in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT using a Kin-Tek stopped flow spectrophotometer and a 100-watt mercury lamp. For tryptophan fluorescence (ATP binding measurements), the exciting beam was passed through a 294-nm interference filter, and the emission was detected after passing through a 340-nm interference filter. For 90° light scattering (ADP release measurements), the exciting beam was passed through a 294-nm interference filter, and the emission was detected with a 294-nm interference filter. For pyrene-actin fluorescence (ADP release measurements), pyrene-actin was excited using a 360-nm interference filter, and emission was detected with a 400-nm cut-off filter. ATP and ADP stocks were prepared with an equimolar amount of magnesium. All of the transients shown are the average of three or four independent mixings. The signal averaging and fitting were done using Kin-Tek software. Single exponential data were fit to the equation y = a × exp (−λt) + c, where c is a constant, and a is the amplitude of the signal. WT HMM and three mutant HMM constructs derived from chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin were coexpressed with light chains in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. The AA mutant HMM has two highly conserved lysines (amino acids 652 and 653) at the C-terminal end of loop 2 mutated to alanines (Fig.1). The d16 mutant HMM has 16 amino acids (amino acids 627 through 649) deleted from loop 2 (Fig. 1). The d18 mutant HMM has 18 amino acids (amino acids 627 through 651) deleted from loop 2; the d18 mutant HMM was examined in only one assay (in vitro motility). The yields of WT, AA mutant, and d16 mutant HMM constructs were similar at about 2 mg/billion cells; the d18 mutant HMM yielded about 0.5 mg/billion cells. The HMM constructs showed no major contaminants on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were indistinguishable from each other in their heavy and light chain components. The RLCs of the four HMM constructs were completely phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase as judged by electrophoresis of HMM samples in 7.5 m urea on 40% glycerol gels. In vitro motility assays were performed at two KCl concentrations (25 and 60 mm) to determine whether the mutations made in loop 2 of HMM affect the ability of the HMM to move actin (Fig.2). Essentially all actin filaments moved in motility assays performed with WT HMM. However, in motility assays performed with two different preparations of phosphorylated AA mutant HMM, less than 1% of actin filaments moved, and with a third preparation no movement of actin filaments was detected. The velocity of the few filaments of actin moved by phosphorylated AA mutant HMM was ∼90% slower at both salt concentrations compared with WT HMM. In contrast, essentially all actin filaments moved in motility assays with phosphorylated d16 mutant HMM, with a velocity that was reduced 29% at 25 mm KCl and 16% at 60 mm KCl compared with WT HMM. Thus, the loss of two lysines from loop 2 had a drastic effect on in vitro motility, whereas deletion of 16 other amino acids from loop 2 had a minimal effect. The amino acids deleted in the d16 mutant HMM included one of the two lysines in the variable portion of loop 2. Because deletion of this one lysine did not have a major effect on in vitro motility, we performed motility assays with a phosphorylated d18 mutant HMM in which both of the lysines in the variable portion of loop 2 have been removed. Essentially all actin filaments moved in the assays. The velocity was reduced 41% at 25 mm KCL and 29% at 60 mm KCl compared with WT HMM (average of three separate preparations). Thus loss of the two lysines in the variable portion of loop 2 had much less effect on motility than mutation of the two conserved lysines. We first established that the WT and mutant HMM constructs had the same NH4+-ATPase activity, indicating that the mutations do not interfere with the intrinsic catalytic ATPase function in the absence of actin (TableI). The actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated WT HMM, AA mutant HMM, and d16 mutant HMM was then measured as a function of actin concentration (Fig.3). The AA mutant HMM had essentially no actin-activated ATPase activity. In sharp contrast, the extrapolatedV max values obtained from the illustrated best fit curves were essentially identical for WT HMM and d16 mutant HMM (4.4 ± 0.3 and 4.4 ± 0.2 s−1, respectively). Interestingly, the K m for the d16 mutant HMM was much lower than the K m for WT HMM (11 ± 2versus 41 ± 6 μm) indicating that the deletion of 16 amino acids in loop 2 increased the affinity for actin. Note that the deletion of the 16 amino acids increases the net positive charge of loop 2 by one (Fig. 1). Thus, loss of two lysines from loop 2 essentially abolished actin-activated ATPase activity, but deletion of 16 other amino acids from loop 2 had no effect onV max.Table INH4+-ATPase activity of WT and mutant HMMsHMM constructRate (s −1)WT36 ± 2d1636 ± 2AA34 ± 2Values are averages ± S.D. of six assays for WT HMM and four assays for d16 mutant and AA mutant HMM, with three independent preparations of each HMM (37 °C). Open table in a new tab Values are averages ± S.D. of six assays for WT HMM and four assays for d16 mutant and AA mutant HMM, with three independent preparations of each HMM (37 °C). To determine whether the loss of motility and actin-activated ATPase activity for AA mutant HMM could be due to changes in the weak binding affinity for actin, cosedimentation assays were performed. Phosphorylated WT HMM and mutant HMMs were cosedimented with increasing concentrations of actin in the presence of 3 mm ATP (Fig.4). The points in the graph are fitted to curves that assume 100% binding at infinite actin concentration, because all three constructs show complete binding to actin in the absence of nucleotide. The K d values from these curves are 14 ± 1 μm for WT HMM, 89 ± 15 μm for AA mutant HMM, and 5.4 ± 0.4 μm for d16 mutant HMM. Although the AA mutant HMM in the presence of ATP has a weaker affinity for actin than WT HMM, the reduction in affinity is not sufficient to explain the drastic effect that the loss of two lysines has on motility and actin-activated ATPase activity. Under conditions where about 40% of the AA mutant HMM is bound to actin, there is still no detectable actin-activated ATPase activity. The d16 mutant HMM's stronger affinity for actin in the presence of ATP than that of WT HMM corroborates the decrease in K m determined in the actin-activated ATPase assay. Because the degree of reduction in weak binding affinity for actin shown by AA mutant HMM was inadequate to explain the drastic reduction in motility and actin-activated ATPase activity, the ability of AA mutant HMM to form a strongly bound rigor state with actin was investigated. When HMM binds to pyrene-labeled actin, the fluorescence of pyrene-actin undergoes quenching as the weakly bound state converts to a strongly bound rigor state. The fluorescence of pyrene-actin was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of WT HMM or AA mutant HMM (Fig.5). The degree of quenching of pyrene-actin fluorescence by AA mutant HMM and WT HMM was identical in two independent experiments using different preparations of both HMMs. At the end of the experiment, addition of ATP dissociated the actin·HMM complex and restored 80–90% of the pyrene-actin fluorescence for both the WT HMM and AA mutant HMM samples, confirming that the quenching was because of binding of actin to HMM. Hence AA mutant HMM is capable of forming a strongly bound rigor state with actin. Pyrene-actin was also titrated with d16 mutant HMM. The degree of fluorescence quenching by d16 mutant HMM was identical to that of WT HMM, and pyrene-actin fluorescence was restored by addition of ATP (data not shown). To determine whether the loss of motility and actin-activated ATPase activity seen with AA mutant HMM could be because of impaired binding of ATP, the rate of ATP binding was determined from the increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.6). At low ATP concentrations, the rate of the transient increased linearly with ATP, yielding a second order rate constant for ATP binding of 8 × 105m−1 s−1 for WT HMM and 1 × 106m−1 s−1 for the AA mutant HMM. Thus ATP binding was not reduced for AA mutant HMM. Fitting the data at all ATP concentrations to a hyperbola yielded a maximum rate of of 33 s−1 for WT HMM and of 25 s−1 for the AA mutant HMM. The maximum rate of the fluoresence change has been equated with the rate of ATP cleavage determined by quench flow experiments (32Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W.

The rate of ADP release was also examined as a possible explanation for the decrease in motility and actin-activated ATPase seen with AA mutant HMM. The rate of ADP release was measured at three temperatures (Table II). An actoHMM·ADP complex (actin or pyrene-labeled actin) was rapidly mixed with ATP in a stopped flow apparatus. The rate of dissociation of the actoHMM complex by ATP is rate-limited by the rate of ADP dissociation. Thus the rate of the decrease in light scattering or the rate of increase in pyrene fluorescence measures the rate of ADP release. Both methods showed very similar values for WT HMM, AA mutant HMM, and d16 mutant HMM. This step cannot account for the abnormal motility and actin-activated ATPase seen with AA mutant HMM.Table IIRate of ADP release from actoHMMLight Scatterings −1TempWTd16AA15 °C26.0 ± 0.229.8 ± 0.124.6 ± 0.220 °C47.7 ± 0.252.1 ± 0.152.1 ± 0.325 °C74.0 ± 0.791.4 ± 0.292.8 ± 0.3Fluorescences−120 °C52.3 ± 0.3ND53.3 ± 0.525 °C83.1 ± 0.7ND74.8 ± 1.0The dephosphorylated actoHMM · ADP complex (0.8 μmHMM, 1 μm actin, 100 μm MgADP) was mixed with 2 mm MgATP.

Each value is the average of four traces ± S.D. ND, not determined. Here we show that the highly conserved C-terminal lysines of loop 2 are essential residues for triggering actin-induced phosphate release and the concurrent strong binding to actin (K 6in Scheme 1) that is necessary for actin-activated ATPase activity and actin movement. In previous mutational studies, these two lysines have never been altered, because other investigators focused on the variable portion of loop 2. Mutation of the conserved two lysines to alanines essentially obliterates both actin activation of ATPase activity and the ability of myosin to move actin filaments in a motility assay. A number of assays verified that the major functional defect caused by mutation of the two conserved lysines occurs only as actoHMM progresses through the cycle from weak to strong binding and that other steps in the cycle are not compromised. The intrinsic myosin ATPase activity and the rate of ATP binding and hydrolysis of the AA mutant HMM are similar to WT. The rate of ADP release from actoHMM and the ability to strongly bind actin in the absence of ATP are also native. The reduction in affinity for actin in the presence of ATP is not sufficient to account for the complete loss of actin-activated ATPase activity and motility. This reduction in affinity implies that either these two lysines are also involved in the weak binding to actin or that the loss of strongly bound intermediates (because the mutant cannot proceed through the cycle) results in an apparent decrease in actin affinity. Because substantial binding of the mutant myosin to actin did remain, other residues must contribute to weak binding. In striking contrast to the effect of removing the conserved lysines, the deletion of 16 residues from loop 2 that precede the lysine-rich region had little negative impact on myosin function. Extending the deletion to 18 residues (thereby removing both of the lysines in the variable portion of loop 2) did reduce motility. However, the reduction was small compared with the complete lack of motility observed upon deletion of the conserved lysines. This highlights the greater importance of the conserved lysines. Consistent with these observations, earlier biochemical studies had shown that cleavage at residues in loop 2 N-terminal to the conserved lysines had little effect on actin-activated ATPase activity (6Yamamoto K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Chaussepied P. Bertrand R. Audemard E. Pantel P. Derancourt J. Kassab R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we find that the affinity for actin in the presence of ATP was actually significantly increased by the deletion of 16 residues, as evidenced by a 3.7-fold decrease in K m in an actin-activated ATPase assay and by an increase in affinity for actin in a cosedimentation assay. This increase in weak binding affinity may relate to the fact that the deletion of 16 residues increased the net positive charge of the loop by one. Notably, this increase in net positive charge had no effect on the V max of the actin-activated ATPase activity. Consistent with this observation, Furch et al. (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported that adding 4 to 12 positive charges to loop 2 of Dictyostelium myosin motor domain significantly decreased the apparent K m for actin by 10-fold. The only functional deficit resulting from the deletion of the 16 amino acids was a modest reduction in the rate at which the d16 mutant HMM moved actin in a motility assay. The slower in vitro motility may result from the fact that increasing the strength of the weak pre-powerstroke states creates a larger internal drag on the actin filament. Increasing the ionic strength would reduce this effect by decreasing the weak interactions, consistent with less inhibition at higher salt levels (16% decrease at 60 mm KClversus 29% at 25 mm KCl). Our results with the 16-residue deletion in loop 2 differ markedly from the results of Knetsch et al. (18Knetsch M.L. Uyeda T.Q.P. Manstein D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20133-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) who shortened theDictyostelium myosin loop 2, which is already much shorter than the smooth muscle myosin loop, by 8 residues. Their mutation reduced actin activation of ATPase activity 5-fold, lowered the affinity for actin 100-fold, reduced the rate of ADP dissociation 2.5-fold, and abolished the ability of the mutant to enter the strong binding state as judged by pyrene-labeled actin. The mutation inDictyostelium myosin reduced the loop size to about six flexible residues, whereas our d16 mutant myosin retained 14 flexible residues in loop 2. We interpret these differences between our results and those of Knetsch et al. (18Knetsch M.L. Uyeda T.Q.P. Manstein D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20133-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to mean that there is a minimal size of loop 2 that is required to allow opening of the cleft in the 50-kDa fragment and release of phosphate. Two studies have reported an effect of the variable portion of loop 2 on the V max of actin-activated ATPase activity in a way that reflects the ATPase activity of the donor myosin (21Uyeda T.Q.P. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,22Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3785-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furch et al. (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported an increase inV max of 2–3-fold upon addition of more positive charge to loop 2. The rate-limiting step for actin-activated ATPase activity is thought to be K 6 (Scheme 1), which involves a conformational change in myosin, and the release of Pi as the weakly bound state isomerizes to the strongly bound state (34Taylor E.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 6: 103-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 35Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Accurate determination ofV max, which is necessary to prove an increase in the rate-limiting step, is difficult when K m values are high, because the viscosity of actin does not allow accurate activity measurements at high actin concentrations. For example, in the Furch et al. (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) study, their conclusion was based on an extrapolated V max for the WT construct, which was not reliable because of its very high K m(102 ± 20 μm) value. Regardless of theV max values, the studies cited above are consistent with the interpretation that most of loop 2 (other than the two C-terminal lysines) is involved in modulating the occupancy of the weakly bound M·ADP·Pi state, which changes the flux through the cycle and causes a change in the apparentK m for actin. The actin partners of the C-terminal lysine residues of loop 2 are likely in subdomain 1 of actin. The effects of removing negative charge from the N terminus, residues 24/25, or residues 99/100 of actin (15Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,16Miller C.J. Wong W.W. Bobkova E. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) are similar to the effects of removing two conserved positive charges from loop 2 of myosin. Mutations in either myosin or actin caused a large decrease in actin activation of ATPase activity, a more modest reduction in binding to actin in the presence of ATP, and impairments in motility. Our HMM mutation was more severe in that even at low ionic strength, motility was not observed. Based on mutations in actin, Reisler and colleagues (16Miller C.J. Wong W.W. Bobkova E. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16557-16565Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) proposed that the interaction between acidic residues in subdomain 1 of actin and the residues in loop 2 facilitates the flux from weak to strong binding states. Here we come to similar conclusions but further show that the conserved positive residues in loop 2 of myosin are essential for triggering any flux from the weak to strong binding state. Because loop 2 straddles a cleft separating the upper and lower domains of the 50-kDa fragment from which phosphate is thought to be released, we propose that the interaction of the lysines of loop 2 with acidic residues in subdomain 1 of actin facilitates the opening of this cleft and thus the release of phosphate (1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 4Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In summary, the data suggest that more than half of loop 2 is not essential for in vitro function of the myosin, although it plays a modulatory role by altering the affinity of myosin for actin. In striking contrast, the two highly conserved lysines at the C-terminal end of loop 2 are essential for triggering Pirelease concurrent with the transition between the weakly bound and strongly bound actomyosin states. It is interesting to note that the properties of the AA mutant are identical to the properties displayed by the inhibited, dephosphorylated state of WT smooth HMM. It is possible that in the inhibited state, the presentation of these essential lysine residues to actin is not allowed and that this is also a component of the mechanism that prevents dephosphorylated smooth muscle HMM from proceeding through the contractile cycle."

Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have indicated that factor-independent growth of myeloid leukemia cells is reversible by activation of PKC-mediated signaling. The PKC family of serine/threonine kinases consists of at least 12 isoforms that are involved in diverse cellular responses (2Nishizuka Y.

The available evidence indicates that PKCβII is essential for the TPA response of myeloid leukemia cells. In this context, TPA-resistant U-937 and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell variants exhibit defects in PKCβII expression (4Hass R. Hirano M. Kharbanda S. Rubin E. Kufe D.

Moreover, defects in the TPA response of myeloid leukemia cell variants are reversed by transfection of the PKCβII gene (9Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol.

Other work has demonstrated that PKCβII is necessary for TPA-induced activation of SAPK and that PKCβII associates directly with MEK kinase-1 (MEKK-1), an upstream effector of the SAPK cascade (11Kaneki M.

The results demonstrate that PKCβII is required for TPA-induced ROS production. We also show that ROS production is necessary for TPA-induced activation of the MEKK-1→SAPK pathway. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and the TPA-resistant TUR clone (4Hass R. Hirano M. Kharbanda S. Rubin E. Kufe D. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. TUR cells overexpressing PKCβII were prepared as described (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 32 nm TPA, 30 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), 1 mmpyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), or 50 μmH2O2 (all from Sigma). Cells were incubated with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C to assess ROS-mediated oxidation of DCF-DA to the fluorescent compound DCF (24LeBel C. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of oxidized DCF was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm using a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson and Co., Lincoln Park, NJ). Generation of ROS was also measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as described by Pick and Mizel (25Pick E. Mizel D. J. Immunol. Meth. 1981; 46: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 106/ml) suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 10 mm HEPES and 50 μm cytochrome c(Sigma) were incubated with TPA in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochromec reduction was assayed as described (25Pick E. Mizel D. J. Immunol. Meth. 1981; 46: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described (10Yang K. Mizobuchi T. Kharbanda S. Datta R. Huberman E. Kufe D. Stone R. Blood. 1994; 83: 490-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in TEM lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated. After sedimentation of nuclei, the extracts were centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. The pellets were solubilized in TEM buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell fractions were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Residual binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters with 5% dry milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20). The filters were incubated with anti-PKCβII (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing twice with PBST, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MEKK-1 kinase assays were performed as described (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were incubated with anti-MEKK-1 (provided by Dr. Gary Johnson, University of Colorado, Denver, CO) for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 30 min after addition of protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed and resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μmATP/[γ-32P]ATP) containing 5 μg of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-SEK1(K-R) (Lys-129 to Arg mutant) (provided by Dr. Leonard Zon, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. SAPK kinase assays were performed as described (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned, and intensity of signals was quantitated by laser densitometry. To determine whether treatment of myeloid leukemia cells with TPA is associated with ROS generation, U-937 cells were incubated with DCF-DA, and ROS-mediated oxidation of the fluorochrome was assayed by flow cytometry. Compared with control cells, treatment with TPA was associated with increases in ROS that were detectable at 5 and 15 min (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). To extend these findings, ROS generation was also assessed by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c. Using this approach, the results confirmed that TPA induces the production of ROS (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). As additional controls, cells were preincubated with NAC, a precursor of glutathione and scavenger of reactive oxygen intermediates (26Roederer M. Staal F.J. Raju P.A. Ela S.W. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 27Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenber L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). As assessed by both oxidation of DCF-DA and cytochrome c reduction, NAC treatment was associated with abrogation of TPA-induced ROS production (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Similar findings were obtained with the ROS scavenger PDTC (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that the response of myeloid leukemia cells to TPA includes the generation of ROS. Treatment of myeloid leukemia cells with TPA is associated with translocation of PKCβII from the cytosol to the cell membrane (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether ROS generation is essential for TPA-induced translocation of PKCβII to the cell membrane, cells were pretreated with NAC or PDTC. TPA treatment of U-937 cells resulted in the detection of PKCβII in the cell membrane fraction at 5–30 min (Fig. 2 A). Pretreatment with NAC had no effect on the distribution of PKCβII in control cells (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, NAC had no detectable effect on TPA-induced translocation of PKCβII to the cell membrane (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained with cells pretreated with PDTC and then exposed to TPA (Fig. 2 C). These findings indicate that TPA-induced ROS production is dispensable for translocation of PKCβII from the cytosol to the cell membrane. To determine whether PKCβII is essential for TPA-induced ROS production, we used the U-937 cell variant, designated TUR, which is deficient in PKCβII expression (4Hass R. Hirano M. Kharbanda S. Rubin E. Kufe D. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar), and TUR cells stably transfected to express the PKCβII gene (TURβII) (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R.

Immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCβII confirmed that, although PKCβII levels were decreased in TUR cells, expression of PKCβII in TURβII cells was comparable with that in U-937 cells (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to wild-type U-937 cells, treatment of the TUR variant with TPA resulted in no detectable induction of ROS production (Fig. 3 B). However, the results demonstrate that expression of PKCβII in TUR cells restores TPA-induced ROS production (Fig. 3 B). Using the reduction of cytochrome c as an additional assay system, the results confirmed that TURβII cells, but not TUR cells, respond to TPA with generation of ROS (Fig. 3 C). These findings demonstrate that TPA induces ROS production by a PKCβII-dependent mechanism. Previous studies have demonstrated that PKCβII interacts with MEKK-1 as an upstream effector of SAPK activation in the TPA response (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether ROS generation contributes to the activation of MEKK-1, we assayed anti-MEKK-1 immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-SEK1. The results demonstrate that, as shown previously (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), TPA treatment is associated with induction of MEKK-1 activity (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether ROS production is involved in activation of MEKK-1, the cells were pretreated with NAC and then assayed for MEKK-1 activity. The results demonstrate that NAC blocks TPA-induced activation of MEKK-1 (Fig. 4 A). The activation of MEKK-1 by TPA was also inhibited by PDTC (Fig. 4 A). To further assess involvement of ROS in induction of MEKK-1 activity, the cells were treated with H2O2 as a source of reactive oxygen intermediates. The results demonstrate that H2O2 induces the activation of MEKK-1 (Fig. 4 A). The finding that NAC blocks H2O2-induced MEKK-1 activity provided further support for involvement of ROS (Fig. 4 A). Cell lysates were also subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SAPK, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for phosphorylation of GST-Jun. The results demonstrate that treatment with NAC blocks TPA-induced SAPK activity (Fig. 4 B). Similar findings were obtained with PDTC (Fig. 4 B). As a control, the treatment of U-937 cells with H2O2 was associated with SAPK activation and, like induction by TPA, this response was sensitive to NAC and PDTC treatment (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). These findings indicate that TPA activates the MEKK-1→SEK1→SAPK pathway by a ROS-dependent mechanism. The finding that human myeloid leukemia cells respond to inducers of differentiation with growth arrest and the induction of a differentiated phenotype has indicated that their growth factor-independent phenotype is reversible. The induction of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation by TPA is dependent on expression of the PKCβII isozyme (4Hass R. Hirano M. Kharbanda S. Rubin E. Kufe D.

Other studies have demonstrated that PKCβII functions as an upstream effector of SAPK activation in the TPA response of myeloid leukemia cells (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The available findings indicate that TPA induces the interaction of PKCβII and MEKK-1 and thereby activation of the MEKK-1→SEK1→SAPK pathway (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that TPA induces the generation of ROS and that this response is also regulated by a PKCβII-dependent mechanism. TUR cells deficient in PKCβII failed to respond to TPA with ROS production. Moreover, transfection of TUR cells to stably express PKCβII was associated with TPA-induced generation of ROS. These findings support the involvement of PKCβII in TPA-induced ROS generation. The PKCβI and PKCβII isozymes are expressed from a single gene by alternate splicing and differ by 50 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (28Kubo K. Ohno S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that PKCβI and PKCβII have different functional roles. In contrast to PKCβII, transfection of PKCβI into U-937 cells is associated with the induction of apoptosis (29Pongracz J. Deacon E.M. Johnson G.D. Burnett D. Lord J.M. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, selective activation of PKCβI with the deoxyphorbol ester Doppa induces apoptosis of U-937 and HL-60 cells (6MacFarlane D.E. Manzel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4327-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pongracz J. Deacon E.M. Johnson G.D. Burnett D. Lord J.M. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The finding that apoptosis of neutrophils is associated with induction of PKCβI but not PKCβII expression has provided further support for functional differences between these two isoforms (29Pongracz J. Deacon E.M. Johnson G.D. Burnett D. Lord J.M. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, although PKCβI is evidently involved in the induction of apoptosis, other studies have demonstrated that PKCβII is required for proliferation (31Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results support a role for PKCβII in the generation of ROS, an event that has also been linked to proliferative responses (32Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). In the response of myeloid leukemia cells to TPA treatment, cytosolic PKCβII translocates to the cell membrane (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The results of the present studies demonstrate that TPA-induced ROS production is dispensable for translocation of PKCβII to the cell membrane. Moreover, the present findings support a role for ROS generation in TPA-induced activation of the MEKK-1→SAPK pathway. The results demonstrate that pretreatment with NAC or PDTC blocks the induction of MEKK-1 in the response to TPA. These findings and the demonstration that H2O2 directly activates MEKK-1 provide evidence for involvement of ROS in TPA-induced MEKK-1 activity. In concert with a ROS-dependent pathway, PKCβII is required for TPA-induced activation of MEKK-1 (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the present results show that PKCβII is required for TPA-induced ROS generation. Although these findings support a PKCβII→ ROS→MEKK-1→SAPK cascade, PKCβII has also been shown to directly interact with MEKK-1 in TPA-treated cells (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PKCβII phosphorylates and activates MEKK-1 in vitro (11Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results support a model in which TPA induces: (i) a direct interaction between PKCβII and MEKK-1, and (ii) PKCβII-dependent generation of ROS required for MEKK-1 activation. Although MEKK-1 activity is induced by diverse signals (30Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M. Johnson G. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar), these findings represent the first demonstration that MEKK-1 is activated by ROS-mediated mechanisms."

Here we report on properties of the extracellular ectodomain of collagen XVII, which harbors multiple collagenous stretches. We have recombinantly produced subdomains of the collagen XVII ectodomain in a mammalian expression system. rColXVII-A spans the entire ectodomain from δNC16a to NC1, rColXVII-B is similar but lacks the NC1 domain, a small N-terminal polypeptide rColXVII-C encompasses domains δNC16a to C15, and a small C-terminal polypeptide rColXVII-D comprises domains NC6 to NC1. Amino acid analysis of rColXVII-A and -C demonstrated prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation with ratios for hydroxyproline/proline of 0.4 and for hydroxylysine/lysine of 0.5. A small proportion of the hydroxylysyl residues in rColXVII-C (∼3.3%) was glycosylated. Limited pepsin and trypsin degradation assays and analyses of circular dichroism spectra clearly demonstrated a triple-helical conformation for rColXVII-A, -B, and -C, whereas the C-terminal rColXVII-D did not adopt a triple-helical fold. These results were further substantiated by electron microscope analyses, which revealed extended molecules for rColXVII-A and -C, whereas rColXVII-D appeared globular. Thermal denaturation experiments revealed melting temperatures of 41 °C (rColXVII-A), 39 °C (rColXVII-B), and 35 °C (rColXVII-C). In summary, our data suggest that triple helix formation in the ectodomain of ColXVII occurs with an N- to C-terminal directionality.

Collagen XVII, also known as the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP180), is a transmembrane protein that is widely known as a structural component of hemidesmosomes, although structures at cell-tissue interfaces other than hemidesmosomes may also contain collagen XVII (1Jones J.C. Hopkinson S.B. Goldfinger L.E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Mutations in the collagen XVII gene,COL17A1, lead to junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a hereditary blistering skin disease with epidermal detachment from the basement membrane (3Bruckner-Tuderman L. Royce P. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular , Genetic , and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of collagen XVII encodes a type II integral transmembrane protein of 1497 amino acid residues (4Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It consists of an intracellular domain of 466 residues, a transmembrane domain of 23 residues, and an extracellular collagenous domain of 1008 amino acids with multiple non-collagenous interruptions. The length of the individual collagenous regions varies from 14 to 242 amino acid residues (4Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Collagen XVII exists in two molecular forms,i.e. as a full-length transmembrane homotrimer of three 180-kDa α1(XVII) chains and as a 120-kDa soluble form. The latter corresponds to the extracellular domain and is presumably released from the cell surface by furin-mediated proteolytic processing (5Schäcke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In some instances, an even shorter fragment with ∼90–100 kDa has been observed (6Hirako Y. Usukura J. Uematsu J. Hashimoto T. Kitajima Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9711-9717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Some information about the molecular shape of collagen XVII under physiological conditions can be deduced from rotary shadowing electron microscopy of collagen XVII from bovine cell lines or from recombinant fragments. These studies revealed asymmetric molecules with an elongated shape and a globular, ball-like structure at one end (6Hirako Y. Usukura J. Uematsu J. Hashimoto T. Kitajima Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9711-9717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Balding S.D. Diaz L.A. Giudice G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8821-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A 90-kDa pepsin/trypsin fragment of collagen XVII in detergent extracts of keratinocytes was resistant to further trypsin digestion at physiological temperatures, therefore suggesting that it was of triple-helical structure (5Schäcke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The entire collagen XVII as well as the C15 collagenous domain could be recombinantly produced in protease-resistant conformation, apparently not requiring propeptides (7Balding S.D. Diaz L.A. Giudice G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8821-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Triple helix formation of fiber-forming collagens was defined as a two-step process initiated by annealing and aggregation of the C-propeptides followed by C- to N-terminal folding of the three α-chains (8Olsen B.R. Hoffmann H. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A higher content of hydroxyproline residues in the C-terminal region of the amino acid sequence of fibrillar collagens has been considered as evidence that the C terminus is the locus of initiation of triple helix formation (8Olsen B.R. Hoffmann H. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Opposite to this, there is also experimental evidence that C-propeptides can be substituted for by other peptide sequences or can be deleted without apparent harm for helix formation (9Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices, C-propeptides are completely missing, and even if nonhelical ends at the C terminus are deleted in recombinantly produced collagenous molecules, as shown for collagen XII, correct triple helix formation takes place (12Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to address the role of subdomains of collagen XVII ectodomain in triple helix formation and stability, in particular to delineate information on the directionality of the assembly process. With a variety of recombinant polypeptides expressed in a mammalian system, we obtained structural information by circular dichroism studies, protease sensitivity assays, and electron microscope studies that strongly suggest triple helix formation from the N to the C terminus of collagen XVII. Human cDNA coding for collagen XVII (4Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) was used as the template for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers. The numbering of nucleotides in cDNAs are according to Giudice et al. (Ref. 4Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, GenBankTM accession number M91669), and the deduced protein sequence was counted from the methionine start codon (position 36 in M91669). All fragments were digested by appropriate restriction enzymes and were cloned into an episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu containing the signal peptide sequence of BM-40 and a puromycin resistance gene (13Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cloning of inserts into pCEP-Pu via a NheI restriction site resulted in secreted polypeptides with four additional N-terminal amino acid residues (APLA) preceding the expressed sequence (13Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Sequences and correct in-frame insertions of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Medigenomix). An expression plasmid for rColXVII-A corresponding to the extracellular domain of collagen XVII (amino acid residues 527–1497) was constructed by amplification of the cDNA with the sense primer 5′-TTCGCTAGCTATGGCACCCGCGGCGGGAGCAGAC-3′ (nucleotides 1684 to 1707) and the antisense primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCACGGCTTGACAGCAATACTTCTTC-3′ (nucleotides 4574 to 4596). The NheI-SalI fragment of the product was subcloned into pCEP-Pu, resulting in plasmid pCEP-rColXVII-A. This expression plasmid generates a 971-amino acid residue protein with the N terminus within the NC16a domain and the C terminus at the cognate end of the ectodomain. The expression plasmid for rColXVII-B (amino acid residues 527–1482) was constructed by amplification of the cDNA with sense primer 5′-TTCGCTAGCTATGGCACCCGCGGCGGGAGCAGAC-3′ (nucleotides 1684 to 1707) and antisense primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCATTGGTCACCTTTGTCTCCTTTTTCTC-3′ (nucleotides 4526 to 4551). The NheI-SalI-restricted fragment from the amplification product was ligated into pCEP-Pu, resulting in plasmid pCEP-rColXVII-B. This plasmid encodes 956 amino acid residues and is identical to rColXVII-A except for a 15-amino acid deletion (NC1 domain) at the C-terminal end. To prepare the expression plasmid for rColXVII-C (amino acid residues 527–808), the cDNA was amplified with sense primer 5′-TTCGCTAGCTGAGGAGGTGAGGAAGCTG-3′ (nucleotides 1573 to 1590) and the antisense primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGATCTTGCCTGGAG-3′ (nucleotides 2516 to 2529). The NheI-SalI fragment from this product was ligated into pCEP-Pu, resulting in plasmid pCEP-rColXVII-C. This plasmid encodes a 282-amino acid residue polypeptide comprising 40 residues of the NC16a domain (δNC16a) and the C15 domain. The expression plasmid for rColXVII-D (amino acid residues 1188–1497) was generated by cDNA amplification using the sense primer 5′-TTCGCTAGCTCCAGGCAATGTGTGGTCCAGCATC-3′ (nucleotides 3670 to 3693) and the antisense primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCACGGCTTGACAGCAATACTTCTTC-3′ (nucleotides 4574 to 4596). The NheI-SalI fragment was ligated into pCEP-Pu, resulting in plasmid pCEP-rColXVII-D. This plasmid encodes a 310-amino acid polypeptide spanning from the NC1 to the NC6 domain. Human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.25 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), 0.1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrom KG), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Biochrom KG). The pCEP-rColXVII plasmids (25 μg) were separately transfected into 293-EBNA cells (one million cells/10 cm2 culture dish) using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (14Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After a selection with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem), the transfected cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and switched to serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), freshly prepared. The media were collected every 24 h, cooled, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, supplemented with 1 mm protease inhibitor Pefablock (Roth), and frozen at -80 °C until further use. The serum-free media (2–3 liters) containing recombinant fragments of rColXVII-A and rColXVII-B were concentrated to ∼80 ml by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, at 4 °C. The material was passed over an anion exchange column (HiTrapQ, 5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer and subsequently eluted with a linear 0–0.4 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the recombinant fragments were concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼0.5 ml and passed over a Superose 6 column (30 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 150 mmNaCl at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions containing recombinant fragments were detected by SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The serum-free cell culture media (2–3 liters) containing recombinant fragments of rColXVII-C and rColXVII-D were concentrated to ∼70 ml, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, at 4 °C, passed over a cation exchange column (HiTrapS; 5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted with a linear 0–0.4 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the recombinant fragments were concentrated to ∼0.5 ml and passed over a Superose 12 column (30 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 200 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected, and recombinant fragments were identified as described above. SDS gel electrophoresis (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis (16Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Zelickson B.D. Anhalt G.J.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 5742-5750PubMed Google Scholar) were performed according to standard procedures. 6% polyacrylamide gels were used for rColXVII-A and -B, and 10% polyacrylamide gels were used for rColXVII-C and -D. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum NC16a was used 1:1000 diluted for rColXVII-A, -B, and -C (17Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K. Wojnarowska F. Schäcke H. Zillikens D. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Am. J.

The antisera were a generous gift of Dr. L. Bruckner-Tuderman. Goat-anti rabbit (1:1000; Dako) or goat anti-chicken (1:100; Dako) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies. Purified recombinant rColXVII polypeptides were adjusted to a concentration of 20 μg/ml and dialyzed against 0.05% acetic acid. Far UV circular dichroism spectra (190–260 nm) were recorded in a 1-cm quartz cuvette on a Jasco J-715 A spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature controller. The molar ellipticities were calculated on the basis of a mean residue molar mass of 96 g/mol. Thermal transition curves were recorded at a fixed wavelength (221 nm) by raising the temperature linearly at a rate of 30 °C/h using a Gilford temperature programmer. No deviation from the melting profiles were observed with extended temperature gradients. The degree of triple helicity at various temperatures was calculated by setting the 221-nm signal at 20 °C to 1 (maximal amount of triple helicity) and at 45 °C to zero (completely denatured collagen). rColXVII polypeptides were dialyzed against a solution of 50% glycerol in 0.05% acetic acid for 16 h at 4 °C. Samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica using an air brush. The droplets on the mica were dried at room temperature at 10−6 mm Hg for 12 h in a vacuum coater (Edwards 306). The dried specimens were rotary-shadowed with platinum using an electron gun positioned at 6° to the mica surface and then coated with a film of carbon generated by an electron gun positioned at 90° to the mica surface. The replica were floated on distilled water and collected on formvar-coated grids. The replicas were examined on a Zeiss 109 transmission electron microscope. Length and diameter of molecules and aggregates were determined with the Scion Image program (Scion Image Corporation). For amino acid analyses, purified recombinant rColXVII polypeptides were hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. Samples were analyzed on an amino acid analyzer (Biochrom 20, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using ninhydrin for post-column color development. For determination of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine and galactosylhydroxylysine samples, up to 1 mg of purified rColXVII-C was hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 2 n KOH for 24 h at 110 °C. After hydrolysis, 100 μl of glacial acetic acid and 150 μl of 70% perchloric acid were added, mixed, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was decanted and lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were re-dissolved in 1 ml of water and passed over a CF1 (Whatman) column to remove the majority of amino acids. Eluates were lyophilized and analyzed on an amino acid analyzer (Biochrom 20, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified native or pepsin-digested rColXVII-C and -D was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a Mini Pro Blott membrane (Applied Biosystems). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and identified by comparison with immunoblotted material. Relevant protein bands were excised and loaded directly onto a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) for N-terminal sequencing. For assessment of the domain structure and stability of collagen XVII, purified recombinant rColXVII polypeptides were subjected to treatment by various enzymes. Collagenase treatment was used to release collagenous peptides, and pepsin treatment was used to remove protease-sensitive non-collagenous regions. Trypsin digestion was used to determine the melting temperature of the rColXVII fragments A and C. Digestion of purified polypeptides with highly purified bacterial collagenase (Sigma) was performed with 40 units/ml enzyme in 0.2m NH4HCO3, freshly prepared, at 37 °C for 2 h (18Fietzek P.P. Rexrodt F.W. Wendt P. Stark M. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For pepsin digestion, 100 μl of rColXVII polypeptides (∼25 μg) were acidified by dialysis against 0.05% acetic acid and incubated with 1 μg/ml pepsin (Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for 24 h (19Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After neutralization with saturated Tris solution, samples were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using anti-NC16a and anti Col17ecto-1 antisera. For testing the triple-helical conformation with trypsin (20Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the purified samples (∼20 μg/ml) were dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl and preheated for 5 min at each desired temperature between 20 and 46 °C (2 °C steps). An aliquot of 10 μl was removed, cooled quickly to 20 °C, and treated with 10 μl of trypsin (1 mg/ml; Sigma) for 2 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 mg/ml; Sigma) to each individual sample. The incubated samples were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Intensities of the immunoblotted bands were quantified with Gel-Pro-Analyzer (Media Cybernetics). To investigate triple-helix formation and stability of the collagen type XVII ectodomain, we have produced several recombinant subfragments of the ectodomain in mammalian 293 cells. These subdomains included the full-length ectodomain rColXVII-A (positions 527–1497), a C-terminal truncated form thereof, rColXVII-B (positions 527–1482), the largest collagenous stretch, C15 (positions 527–808), and a short C-terminal subdomain rColXVII-D (positions 1188–1497) spanning the NC6 to the NC1 domain. These recombinant fragments are schematically summarized in Fig. 1. Each of the constructs were designed with a heterologous signal peptide to enable secretion into the cell culture medium and proper post-translational modifications. The recombinant cell clones produced each subdomain in quantities of 1–2 μg of protein/ml medium/day. Ion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography resulted in highly purified recombinant subdomains with apparent molecular masses of 101 kDa (rColXVII-A), 96 kDa (rColXVII-B), 30 kDa (rColXVII-C), and 33 kDa (rColXVII-D), which corresponded well with the calculated values (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the collagenous domain fragment rColXVII-C migrates as a broad band, similar to what has been published recently for a corresponding construct (21Tasanen K. Eble J.A. Aumailley M. Schumann H. Baetge J. Tu H. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3093-3099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). No multimers have been observed after electrophoresis by SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). N-terminal sequencing of rColXVII-C, which N-terminally starts at the same position as rColXVII-A and -B, demonstrated the expected N-terminal sequence (APLAMA) but also some minor N-terminal truncations of 2–5 amino acid residues (TableI). Sequencing of the C-terminal construct rColXVII-D resulted in a sequence (APGNVWSSIS) that was three amino acid residues shorter than expected (Table I). These results indicate that the sequence APLA, which represents an artificial sequence due to the expression strategy (see “Experimental Procedures”), is not stable in the recombinant constructs. The authentic collagen type XVII sequences, however, were stable.Figure 2Purification of recombinant extracellular subdomains of human collagen type XVII. rColXVII polypeptides were purified, separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Blue.

The rColXVII-A and rColXVII-C polypeptide were further analyzed by amino acid analysis. Within the limits of error, the amino acid compositions determined correlated well with the expected compositions calculated from the cDNA (Table II). For rColXVII-A, about 30% of the total prolyl and 34% of the total lysyl residues were hydroxylated. For rColXVII-C, about 29% of the total prolyl and 36% of the total lysyl residues were hydroxylated (Table II). Some of these residues in rColXVII-C were also further modified by the attachment of a small but significant number of mono- and disaccharides (0.01 monosaccharide and 0.17 disaccharide per molecule; Table II).Table IIAmino acid and glycosylation analysis of rColXVII-A and -CResiduerColXVII-A residues/moleculerColXVII-C residues/moleculeDeterminedCalculated (cDNA)DeterminedCalculated (cDNA)HypHyp36.7Not possible14.3Not possibleAsx54.435 (Asp) 11 (Asn)13.310 (Asp) 2 (Asn)Thr31.3265.65Ser99.59911.011Glx77.840 (Glu) 38 (Gln)30.216 (Glu) 12 (Gln)Pro86.517935.155Gly257.822984.284Ala56.24812.914Cys0.000.00Val36.3359.19Met15.2237.711Ile27.8275.35Leu63.36116.115Tyr16.0241.60Phe21.0183.42His19.5124.54Hyl11.7Not possible5.5Not possibleLys22.7279.717Arg37.14213.313Hyp/Pro0.4Not possible0.4Not possibleHyl/Lys0.5Not possible0.5Not possibleTrpNot determined2Not determined1MonosaccharideNot determinedNot possible0.01Not possibleDisaccharideNot determinedNot possible0.17Not possible Open table in a new tab Limited enzymatic digestion with pepsin converted rColXVII-A into a ∼30-kDa fragment via an intermediate protein of the apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa (Fig.3, panel A, lane 2), whereas digestion with bacterial collagenase completely degraded this recombinant ectodomain under the experimental conditions. Similar data were obtained for the C-terminally truncated rColXVII-B (Fig. 3, panel B). The 30-kDa pepsin fragments corresponded to the size and the immunoreactivity of rColXVII-C (collagen XVII domain C15), indicating that this domain adopts a stable triple-helical conformation in rColXVII-A and -B and, thus, resists degradation by pepsin. Recombinant rColXVII-C itself was also resistant to limited degradation with pepsin, whereby a slightly (∼ 3 kDa) faster electrophoretic mobility of the pepsin-treated material was observed (Fig. 3, panel C). N-terminal sequencing of the pepsin-treated rColXVII-C revealed a N-terminally truncation of 32 amino acid residues, corresponding to parts of the non-collagenous δNC16a domain (Table I). Accordingly, the Gly-X-Y repeats of rColXVII-C were not degraded by pepsin. These results suggest a triple-helical conformation for rColXVII-C and indicate that more C-terminally located domains are not required for triple helix formation of domain C15. Treatment of the C-terminal rColXVII-D with pepsin resulted in a complete degradation, indicating the absence of a stabilizing triple-helical conformation (Fig. 3, panel D). Controls with bacterial collagenase demonstrated complete degradation of all recombinant polypeptides (Fig. 3, lanes 3). To obtain information of the molecular shape, the recombinant rColXVII subdomains were analyzed by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing (Fig. 4). The full-length ectodomain rColXVII-A displayed a long extended shape with a globular portion on one end (Fig. 4 A). Measurement of the lengths of individual particles revealed 3 groups of about 60–70 nm, 130–140 nm, and 240–250 nm. A length of 130–140 nm corresponds well with expected values for the ectodomain (22Hirako Y. Usukura J. Nishizawa Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13739-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A length of 240–250 nm may represent dimers that occur through lateral alignment, whereas shorter fragments may derive from proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide. The globular domain at one end is about 11–12 nm in diameter. The widths of t"

It has previously been shown that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras in these cells is associated with elevated expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in high constitutive levels of prostaglandin production. To determine whether expression of constitutively active Ras is sufficient to induce expression of these enzymes in nontransformed cells, normal lung epithelial cells were transfected with H-Ras. Stable expression of H-Ras increased expression of cPLA2 and COX-2 protein. Transient transfection with H-Ras increased promoter activity for both enzymes. H-Ras expression also activated all three families of MAP kinase: ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinase. Expression of constitutively active Raf did not increase either cPLA2 or COX-2 promoter activity, but inhibition of the ERK pathway with pharmacological agents or expression of dominant negative ERK partially blocked the H-Ras-mediated induction of cPLA2 promoter activity. Expression of dominant negative JNK kinases decreased cPLA2promoter activity in NSCLC cell lines and inhibited H-Ras-mediated induction in normal epithelial cells, whereas expression of constructs encoding constitutively active JNKs increased promoter activity. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or NF-κB had no effect on cPLA2 expression. Truncational analysis revealed that the region of the cPLA2 promoter from −58 to +12 contained sufficient elements to mediate H-Ras induction. We conclude that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras directly increases cPLA2 expression in normal epithelial cells through activation of the JNK and ERK pathways.

Activating mutations in Ras are associated with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),1occurring in ∼30% of adenocarcinomas, and just under 10% of other NSCLC types (1Giaccone G. Chest. 1996; 109: 130S-134SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is presumed that expression of these forms of Ras, which lack intrinsic GTPase activity, mediate transformation by constitutively activating downstream effector pathways. We recently reported that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras was associated with increased expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a panel of NSCLC lines (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that mediate induction of cPLA2 and COX-2 in these cells are undefined. cPLA2 is the major intracellular form of PLA2, which selectively hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position and is the rate-limiting enzyme in the regulated release of arachidonic acid (AA) (3Bonventre J.V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 128-150PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Free AA is metabolized through three major pathways to produce eicosanoids. Cyclooxygenases (COX) convert AA to prostaglandins and thromboxane; lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase produces epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Two forms of cyclooxygenase have been identified (5DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Smith W.L. Am. J. Med. 1993; 95: 40S-44SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). COX-1 appears to be constitutively expressed in most cell types and is associated with maintenance of vascular tone. COX-2, first identified as an immediate early response gene (6Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is induced in response to mitogenic stimuli and associated with inflammation. High levels of cPLA2 and COX-2 expression result in constitutively high levels of prostaglandin production by NSCLC (7Hubbard W.C. Alley M.C. McLemore T.L. Boyd M.R.

Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, which are inhibitors of eicosanoid production, blocked the transformed growth of NSCLC expressing Ras mutations. Because these agents do not inhibit the growth of most nontransformed cells, it suggests that this pathway plays a critical role in transformed growth. Ras has been demonstrated to couple to multiple effector systems, resulting in activation of distinct physiologic responses (see Ref. 12Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholarfor review). These pathways regulate cell proliferation as well as changes in the cytoskeleton. An important class of Ras effectors is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family. The “classic” Ras-mediated pathway involves binding and activation of the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, which in turn activates the dual specificity kinase MEK, resulting in activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (13Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). ERKs phosphorylate a number of target proteins, including transcription factors and intracellular enzymes (14Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively active forms of Ras also can lead to increased activity of the other members of the MAP kinase family: the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) and the p38 family of MAP kinase (15Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 16Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The physiologic roles of JNKs and p38 MAP kinase appear to be complex and may depend on the context in which these enzymes are activated. Activation in response to cell stresses or growth factors is mediated through specific upstream kinases: MKK4/7 for JNKs (17Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 18Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MKK3/6 for p38 MAP kinase (19Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Both JNKs and p38 MAP kinase have been shown to phosphorylate transcription factors, including c-Jun, ATF-2, and members of the ets family including Elk-1 (21Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Multiple additional Ras effectors have been described. Ras activation also leads to stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in some cell types (22Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (23Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt may be critical for cell survival, possibly through inhibition of apoptotic pathways (24Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 25Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Expression of Ras mutants containing mutations in the effector domains suggests that activation of multiple effector pathways is required for the full physiologic response to activated Ras (26Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although studies in NSCLC cell lines have implicated a role for Ras in induction of cPLA2, these cells contain large number of mutations and aberrations in signaling pathways, making it difficult to define the critical molecular pathways regulating cPLA2expression. We have therefore sought to examine the effects of constitutively active forms of Ras on cPLA2 expression in an untransformed lung epithelial cell line. In this study we report that expression of H-Ras is sufficient to mediate induction of cPLA2 expression in RL-65 cells, a neonatal, untransformed, immortalized rat epithelial cell line (27Roberts P.E. Phillips D.M. Mather J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L415-L425PubMed Google Scholar), and have begun to define the downstream effector pathways. The cPLA2 reporter construct contains 2.4 kb of a 5′-region ligated into the promoterless luciferase vector PA3luc (28Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The COX-2 promoter ligated to a promoterless luciferase vector was a gift of Dr. Harvey Herschman (UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). The Elk-Gal4, Jun-Gal4, and ATF-2-Gal4 plasmids encode the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 fused to the activation domain of Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF-2, respectively. The UAS-luc plasmid contains five Gal4 DNA-binding sites upstream from a minimal thymidine kinase promoter with a luciferase reporter. The κB-luc reporter consists of three consensus NF-κB sites upstream from a promoterless luciferase vector. The dominant negative form of I-κB (I-κB-(Δ1–36)) encodes an amino-terminal truncation of the first 36 amino acids of I-κB, which contain two phosphorylation sites required for NF-κB activation (29Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 30Siebenlist U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: R7-R13PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative forms of JNK kinases (DN-MKK4 and DN-MKK7), containing Lys to Met mutations in the ATP binding sites, were prepared as described previously (31Higashita R. Li L. Van Putten V.

Fusion proteins consisting of MKK7 fused to specific JNK isoforms were prepared as described by Zheng et al. (32Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol.

The dominant negative form of ERK-1 contained similar Lys to Met mutations in the ATP-binding site. Antibodies against cPLA2 and COX-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). [14C]Arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The truncation mutant encoding the region from −102 to +12 (28Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochim.

The following primers were used: for the −58 mutant sense primer: GGTACCACCTTAACATCCACAGAG; for the −37 mutant sense primer: GGTACCAGCCCATTTCTTAGCCCCT; for the −12 mutant sense primer: GGTACCAGCGGGAGAAGACTTTCTCA. The antisense primer for all three was the same and was derived from the PA3-Luc vector: CCACACCCTTAGGTAACCCAGTAGATCC. RL-65 lung epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with NaHCO3 (25 mm), sodium selenite (25 nm), insulin (5 μg/ml), human transferrin (10 μg/ml), ethanolamine (100 μm), phosphoethanolamine (100 μm), hydrocortisone (0.5 μm), forskolin (5 μm), retinoic acid (50 nm), bovine pituitary extract (150 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml), according to the producer's recommendation. A549 human lung cancer cells were obtained from the University of Colorado Cancer Center Tissue Culture Core and grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfections, cells were electroporated as described previously (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, two million cells were electroporated in duplicate dishes using a geneZAPPER electroporator (IBI). Unless otherwise stated cells were transfected with 2 μg of the cPLA2 promoter, 2 μg of CMV-β-gal, and 2 μg of other DNA (e.g. H-Ras, BxB-Raf). Total DNA concentration for each transfection was matched with plasmid lacking an insert. Following electroporation, cells were incubated in standard media for 48 h. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as luciferase units normalized to β-gal. For stable transfection, H-Ras cDNA was inserted at the HindIII site of the retroviral expression vector pMV7 (34Kirschmeier P.J. Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Perkins A.S. Weinstein I.B. DNA. 1988; 7: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and packaged into a replication-deficient retrovirus as described previously (35Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Polybrene (8 μg/ml) was added to the retroviral-containing medium from the 293T packaging cells and filtered prior to a 24-h incubation with subconfluent monolayers of RL-65 cells. The infected cells were replated, selected for G418 resistance, and expanded. Control cell lines (Neo) were selected by infecting cells with virus lacking a cDNA insert. Clones were selected by immunoblotting with anti-H-Ras antibodies. Measurements of cPLA2 activity were performed as described previously (36Gronich J.H. Bonventre J.V. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16645-16651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell were scraped into a homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors using a Dounce homogenizer. Extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and high speed supernatants were matched for protein. Activity was determined using [14C]arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine in the presence of 4 mm Ca2+. Results are expressed as picomoles of arachidonic acid released/mg of protein. For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100. Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were matched for protein. Extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. Blots were probed with either a monoclonal antibody against cPLA2 or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against COX-2. Blots were visualized using the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL). For measurement of ERK activity, cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding HA-tagged ERK-1, along with either H-Ras, BxB-Raf, or empty vector. After 48 h, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.06 unit of aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm leupeptin). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 × g), and supernatants were matched for protein. ERKs were immunoprecipitated by incubating for 2 h with anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and kinase activity was determined using epidermal growth factor-receptor peptide as described previously (35Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on our studies in NSCLC, we sought to determine whether expression of constitutively active forms of Ras is sufficient to induce cPLA2 in normal lung epithelial cells. We therefore examined the effects of H-Ras expression in a normal lung epithelial cell line (RL-65). RL-65 cells, derived from rat lung, display an epithelial morphology (27Roberts P.E. Phillips D.M. Mather J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L415-L425PubMed Google Scholar) and do not form colonies in soft agar. Stable cell lines expressing H-Ras were obtained by retroviral infection of RL-65 cells and selection in G-418 as described previously (35Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Control cells (Neo) were infected with retrovirus lacking a cDNA insert. Expression of cPLA2and COX-2 were determined by immunoblotting and quantitated by densitometry. The results of two representative clones of 10 examined are shown in Fig. 1. Expression of cPLA2 was increased 3- to 4-fold in these clones (Fig.1 A). Both clones expressing H-Ras also had significantly increased levels of cPLA2 activity, as measured in cell-free extracts with exogenous substrate (Fig. 1 B). Increased expression of COX-2 was also observed in both clones (2- to 3-fold). To examine mechanisms leading to increased cPLA2expression, RL-65 cells were transiently cotransfected with a construct encoding 2.4 kb of the rat cPLA2 promoter ligated to a promoterless luciferase reporter (PA3-Luc) along with an expression plasmid for H-Ras. Transient cotransfection of H-Ras increased cPLA2 promoter activity 5- to 8-fold (Fig.2 A). Treatment of the cells with BZA-5B, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, which has been shown to block Ras function (37James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited the induction of promoter activity, suggesting that this represents a direct effect of Ras. These data are consistent with our previous finding demonstrating inhibition of cPLA2 promoter activity and protein expression in two NSCLC lines (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Transient expression of H-Ras also increased COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 2 B), consistent with increased levels of expression of both enzymes detected in stable transfectants. Ras activation results in activation of multiple MAP kinase pathways in other cell types. Activation of MAP kinase family members was determined by cotransfecting RL-65 cells with plasmids encoding the activation domain of specific transcription factors fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, along with a plasmid containing five Gal-4 binding domains upstream of a promoterless luciferase reporter (UAS-luc). Separate experiments were performed with Elk-Gal4, Jun-Gal4, and ATF-2-Gal4. Elk-Gal4-mediated increases in luciferase are a measure of ERK activity, because ERKs are the major kinase phosphorylating Elk. Jun-Gal4 activation is a measure of JNK activity, and ATF-2-Gal4 activation is a measure of JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity. Expression of H-Ras resulted in increased luciferase activity with all three Gal-4 fusions (Table I), indicating that H-Ras activates all three MAP kinase pathways in these cells. We therefore sought to examine the role of these pathways in regulation of the cPLA2 promoter.Table IActivation of Gal4 fusions in RL-65 cellsConstuctUAS-alone+ElkGal4+Jun-Gal4+ATF-2-Gal4luciferase units/β-gal unitspcDNA-366 ± 1405 ± 22222 ± 37656 ± 119H-Ras405 ± 1628456 ± 9801-ap < 0.05 versus UAS-luc alone.2111 ± 6211-ap < 0.05 versus UAS-luc alone.9601 ± 8161-ap < 0.05 versus UAS-luc alone.BxB-Raf76.9 ± 6.119950 ± 9771-ap < 0.05 versus UAS-luc alone.ND1-bND, not determined.NDMEKK155 ± 16212 ± 2262177 ± 1351-ap < 0.05 versus UAS-luc alone.NDRL-65 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of UAS-luc and 100 ng of plasmid encoding a fusion protein for either Elk-Gal4, Jun-Gal4, or ATF-2-Gal4, along with 2 μg of expression plasmids encoding H-Ras or BxB-Raf. Total DNA concentration for each transfection was adjusted to be the same by addition of pcDNA-3. All transfections also contained 2 μg of CMV-β-gal to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated in standard media for 48 h. Lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase and β-gal.

Open table in a new tab RL-65 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of UAS-luc and 100 ng of plasmid encoding a fusion protein for either Elk-Gal4, Jun-Gal4, or ATF-2-Gal4, along with 2 μg of expression plasmids encoding H-Ras or BxB-Raf.

Cells were incubated in standard media for 48 h. Lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase and β-gal. Results of the mean of three independent experiments are shown as luciferase units/β-gal units with the S.E.M. indicated. Activation of ERKs via Ras is mediated through activation of the serine-threonine kinase Raf. Expression of constitutively active Raf (BxB-Raf) increased ERK activity as assessed with Elk-Gal4 fusions to approximately the same extent as expression of H-Ras (Table I), but did not significantly increase cPLA2 promoter activity (Fig.2 A) or COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). These results were confirmed by transient transfection of cells with epitope-tagged ERK-1, followed by immunoprecipitation and assay of kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). To further assess the role of the ERK pathway in regulation of the cPLA2 promoter, transfected cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Treatment with 50 μmPD98059, a concentration that blocks ERK activation in these cells, decreased the Ras-mediated induction of the cPLA2 promoter by ∼50%(Fig. 3 A). In separate studies, RL-65 cells were cotransfected with a construct encoding a dominant negative form of ERK-1 or (DN-ERK). This construct has been used in studying the COX-2 promoter (39Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Expression of DN-ERK inhibited the Ras-mediated induction of the cPLA2 to a similar extent as seen with PD98059 (Fig. 3 B). Based on these findings we would propose that activation of ERKs is necessary but not sufficient for induction of cPLA2 promoter activity. The role of JNKs in regulation of cPLA2 expression was examined by cotransfection with dominant negative JNK kinases (DN-MKK4/7). Coexpression of either DN-MKK4 or DN-MKK7 inhibited the H-Ras-mediated induction of cPLA2 promoter activity by ∼60–70% (Fig. 4 A). Expression of both dominant negative constructs did not result in any further inhibition. Blocking both the ERK and JNK pathways resulted in somewhat greater inhibition but failed to completely suppress in the induction of the promoter by H-Ras (DN-MKK4, 40% inhibition; PD98059, 50% inhibition; DN-MKK4+PD98059, 61% inhibition). Expression of wild-type MKK4 or MKK7 had no effect (data not shown). Correspondingly, expression of DN-MKK4 or DN-MKK7 also inhibited steady-state cPLA2 promoter activity in A549 cells (Fig.4 B), a human NSCLC line expressing oncogenic forms of Ras (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that chimeric proteins of JNK kinases fused to JNKs act as constitutively active JNKs (32Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed expression plasmids encoding MKK7 fused to different JNK isoforms.2 Cells were cotransfected with these constructs along with the cPLA2 promoter vector. As shown in Fig. 5, expression of MKK7/JNK fusions increased promoter activity to ∼50% of the level achieved with expression of H-Ras. Combined, the data in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that JNKs are involved in the induction of the cPLA2promoter. The ability of ERKs to synergize with JNKs was examined by cotransfection of cells with BxB-Raf along with the MKK7/JNK constructs. However, no further increase in promoter activity was found with the combination of enzymes above that obtained with the MKK7/JNK constructs alone (data not shown). To further test a cooperative role for JNKs and ERKs in driving the promoter, we performed transient transfection experiments with a constitutively active form of MEKK1. Expression of MEKK1 in transient transfections increased both ERK and JNK activity, as assessed by cotransfection with either Elk-Gal4 and Jun-Gal4 (Table I). Expression of constitutively active MEKK1 also markedly increased cPLA2 promoter activity (Fig.6). Because expression of MEKK1 appeared to systematically increase expression of β-gal, presumably by activating the CMV promoter, we chose t"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate showed steady state levels of nucleolin mRNA that were 2–2.5-fold greater than untreated control cells. The up-regulation of nucleolin mRNA was substantially repressed by U0126, a specific inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK). Calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin also activated ERK and substantially elevated nucleolin mRNA levels, demonstrating phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium signaling converge on ERK. Drugs that affected protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and phospholipase C signal transduction pathways did not alter nucleolin mRNA levels significantly. The half-life of nucleolin mRNA increased from 1.8 h in resting cells to 3.2 h with phorbol ester activation, suggesting ERK-mediated posttranscriptional regulation. Concomitantly, full-length nucleolin protein was increased. The higher levels of nucleolin protein were accompanied by increased binding of a 70-kDa nucleolin fragment to the 29-base instability element in the 3′-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA in gel mobility shift assays. Supplementation of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with nucleolin decreased APP mRNA stability and protein production.

The major proteinaceous material in the senile plaques is β-amyloid, a 40–42-amino acid peptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP).1 Investigation of the molecular regulation of APP mRNA and protein levels is vital to understanding β-amyloid accumulation and deposition in Alzheimer's disease. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that two RNA-binding proteins, nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C), bind to a 29-base instability element in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of APP mRNA (1Zaidi S.H. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17292-17298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), hnRNP C binding to the 29-base element stabilized APP mRNA resulting in a 6-fold increase in APP protein production (2Rajagopalan L.E. Westmark C.J.

Nucleolin (C23) is a 110-kDa multifunctional phosphoprotein. It is an abundant nucleolar protein (3Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cDNA for nucleolin has been cloned and codes for a 707-amino acid protein with at least three functional domains (3Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 5′-flanking region and the first intron contain a high GC content similar to the housekeeping genes. The 5′ promoter has one atypical TATA box (GTTA), one CCAAT box, three reverse complements of CCAAT (ATTGG), two pyrimidine-rich stretches, and numerous potential transcription factor-binding sites, whereas the 3′-UTR has five homology blocks in a 100-base region (23Srivastava M. McBride O.W. Fleming P.J. Pollard H.B. Burns A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14922-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are several distinct features in the amino acid sequence of nucleolin that enable this extraordinary protein to display such a vast array of functions (3Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7Jordan G. Nature. 1987; 329: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). At the amino-terminal end of the molecule, there are six (G/A/V)TP(G/A/V)KK(G/A/V)(G/A/V) repeats followed by several glutamic/aspartic acid stretches separated by basic sequences and four potential serine phosphorylation sites. The central region, a putative globular domain, contains alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic stretches. There are four 90-residue repeats, each containing an RNP-like consensus sequence (24Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J.H. Amalric F. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10922-10925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus is glycine/arginine-rich with regularly spaced phenylalanine and dimethylarginine residues (25Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Ghaffari S.H. Rao S.V. Dumbar T.S. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9167-9173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The central 40-kDa domain of nucleolin containing the four RNA recognition motifs is responsible for the specificity of RNA binding, and the carboxyl-terminal domain enhances interaction but does not contribute to ligand specificity (26Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain contains an ATP-dependent duplex-unwinding activity, and phosphorylation enhances this helicase activity (21Tuteja N. Huang N.W. Skopac D. Tuteja R. Hrvatic S. Zhang J. Pongor S. Joseph G. Faucher C. Amalric F. Falaschi A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were initially interested in determining how nucleolin regulation might affect APP mRNA levels and stability. Preliminary studies suggested cytokine-mediated signaling through protein kinases altered nucleolin mRNA levels in PBMC. We found that activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway significantly up-regulated nucleolin mRNA levels independently of protein kinase C (PKC). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment also resulted in higher levels of full-length nucleolin protein and the disappearance of the 47-kDa nucleolin cleavage fragment. In gel mobility shift assays, lysates from phorbol ester and ionomycin-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) contained nucleolin that bound to the 29-base instability element of APP mRNA. In RRL supplemented with nucleolin protein, APP mRNA decayed with a shortened half-life of 105 min but was indefinitely stable in RRL supplemented with globin. The loss of APP mRNA stability resulted in decreased APP production. Therefore, ERK activation stabilizes nucleolin mRNA resulting in increased nucleolin levels and accelerated decay of APP mRNA.

Klenow enzyme, RNasin, bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene (U0126), and RRL were from Promega (Madison, WI). Lymphoprep density gradient medium and RPMI 1640 were from Life Technologies, Inc., and TRI-reagent was purchased from Molecular Research Center, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection kit, [α-32P]dCTP andl-[35S]methionine were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the nylon transfer membrane was from Fisher, and the QuikHyb hybridization solution and NucTrap probe purification columns were supplied by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The T7 and SP6 mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kits and oligo(dT)-cellulose were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Peripheral blood was collected by phlebotomy from consenting, healthy laboratory personnel and was anticoagulated with heparin. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Wisconsin Hospital Human Subjects Review Committee, which meets National Institutes of Health guidelines. PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation, stimulated with various kinase effectors, and lysed in Tri-reagent as described previously. 2C. J. Westmark and J. S. Malter, submitted for publication. RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes. The samples were assayed in at least triplicate, normalized to a control RNA (18 S or ribosomal protein S26 mRNA), and plotted as a percentage of total nucleolin mRNA. Error bars depict the standard error of the mean, and p values were calculated by the Student's t test. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared as described previously (29Fukuda H. Nishida A. Saito H. Shimizu M. Yamawaki S. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 25: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured PBMC (2 ml at 5 × 106 cells/ml) were scraped from tissue culture wells, spun at 2,000 × g for 30 s in a Stratagene picofuge microcentrifuge, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The resuspended cells were lysed by five freeze (−80 °C)/thaw (37 °C) cycles and spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytoplasmic lysates) were transferred to fresh tubes and frozen at −80 °C. The protein concentration of the lysates was quantitatively determined with Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. Lysate (10 μg) in a 12-μl volume was mixed with 4 μl (4×) SDS reducing buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.06% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was equilibrated in Bjerrum and Schafer-Nielsen transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 1.3 mm SDS, pH 9.2), and the proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm pure nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer on a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD apparatus at 15 V for 45 min. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk and stained by ECL per the manufacturer's directions. The primary antibody was anti-nucleolin (1:1000) (kindly provided by Dr. Raymond Petryshyn, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D. C.) and the secondary antibody was anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 1 min. APP106 template was prepared by amplification of nucleotides 2415–2520 of the plasmid pT7APP751wtΔHindIIIT90 (2Rajagopalan L.E. Westmark C.J. Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3418-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with the primers 5′-CACAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACTTGAATTAATCCACA-3′ (APP cDNA(2415–2432)) and 5′-ACAGCTAAATTCTTTACAGT-3′ (APP cDNA(2520–2501)) by PCR (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles). The 5′ primer included a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, which is underlined. The PCR product was extracted with Tris-saturated phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 0.1 volume of sodium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol before gel purification on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled RNA probes were prepared according to Promega's standard transcription protocol for T7 RNA polymerase with each labeling reaction containing 200 ng of APP106 template and 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 2 units of RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were extracted with water-saturated phenol/chloroform, and unincorporated isotope was removed by passage through NucTrap probe purification columns. The binding reactions were performed similarly to the procedures used in Ref. 28Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar. Briefly, 2 μg of cytoplasmic lysates were incubated with 1 × 105cpm of APP106 RNA probe in 10% glycerol, 15 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 200 ng/μl E. coli tRNA, and 1 unit/μl RNasin in a total volume of 10 μl for 10 min at 30 °C. RNase TI (20 units in 1-μl volume) was added, and samples were digested for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were cross-linked on automatic for 5 min in a UV Stratalinker 2400 from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) on ice prior to the addition of 3.5 μl of 4× SDS reducing buffer, heat denaturation for 3 min at 100 °C, and analysis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen. The construction of pT7APP751wtΔHindIIIT90 has been described (2Rajagopalan L.E. Westmark C.J. Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3418-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSPκβc containing the β-globin gene cloned between an SP6 promoter and a T stretch was provided by Richard Spritz (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and the nucleolin gene in the pMAM plasmid was a gift from Meera Srivastava (Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D. C). The pMAMnucleolin plasmid was digested with XhoI and NheI to liberate the nucleolin gene. The insert ends were blunted with Klenow and ligated with SmaI-digested pT7T90 transcription vector (provided by Jeff Ross, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) to generate pT7nuclcodingT90. The 3′-UTR of nucleolin cDNA was amplified from Jurkat genomic DNA with the primers 5′-ACGAAGTTTGAATAGCTTCT-3′ (nucleolin cDNA(2221–2240)) and 5′-GTAGGAAAAAATGGTTTTGT-3′ (nucleolin cDNA(2518–2499)) by PCR (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles). The ends were blunted with Klenow and ligated with SmaI-digested pUC-18 generating pUCnucl3′-UTR. pUCnucl3′-UTR was digested with EcoRI and XbaI to liberate the nucleolin 3′-UTR sequence, and the ends were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated with pT7nuclcodingT90 previously digested with EcoRI and blunted with T4 DNA polymerase. The resulting plasmid, pT7nucleolinT90, contained the entire nucleolin coding region, a short spacer, and the complete nucleolin 3′-UTR sequence cloned between a T7 promoter and a 90-base poly(T) stretch. The plasmids pT7APP751 wtΔHindIIIT90 and pSPκβc were linearized with HindIII, and the plasmid pT7nucleolinT90 was digested with EcoRV. The digests were extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with 0.1 volume ammonium acetate and 2 volumes ethanol, resuspended in water to 0.5 μg/μl, and used as templates (1 μg each) for in vitro transcription with Ambion's T7 and Sp6 mMessage mMachine kits per the manufacturer's directions for 2 h at 37 °C. The capped, polyadenylated mRNA reactions were digested with RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C, extracted with water-saturated phenol and chloroform, and purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The oligo(dT)-cellulose was equilibrated in high salt binding buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA. The mRNA was heat-denatured for 5 min at 65 °C, chilled in ice, adjusted to high salt binding buffer conditions, and bound to the oligo(dT)-cellulose for 30 min at ambient temperature with mixing. The resin was washed with high salt binding buffer followed by low salt binding buffer (0.1 m NaCl) and finally eluted with TE (pH 7.5) (65 °C). The purity of the mRNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration was measured by A260. RRL was programmed with 100 ng of heat-denatured globin versus nucleolin mRNA, and translation proceeded for 3.5 h at 30 °C per the manufacturer's directions. Aliquots of globin- and nucleolin-supplemented RRL were frozen at −80 °C. APP mRNA (50 ng) was incubated with 2 μl of globin- versusnucleolin-supplemented RRL in 10-μl reactions containing 10% glycerol, 15 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 ng/μl E. coli tRNA for 10 min at 30 °C. Translation was initiated by the addition of 33 μl of fresh RRL, 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture minus methionine, 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture minus leucine, 1.4 μl of KCl, and 4.6 μl of water. Reactions (50 μl each) were incubated at 30 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were removed at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. RNA was isolated with Tri-Reagent, and RNA pellets were dissolved in 25 μl of formamide, and 5 μl of each sample was analyzed on formaldehyde-agarose gels. For translation measurements, RRL reactions were similar to the RNA decay reactions althoughl-[35S]methionine was included. Aliquots (2.5 μl each) were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h, diluted with 7.5 μl of water, mixed with 3.5 μl of 4× SDS reducing buffer, heated for 20 min at 60 °C, and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. We examined the effect of several drugs that influence MAPK, PKC, protein kinase A (PKA), and phospholipase C (PLC) activity as well as calcium mobilization on the steady state level of nucleolin mRNA in PBMC. To investigate the role of PKC, cells were cultured for 3.25 h in the presence of the phorbol ester PMA. Compared with untreated controls, nucleolin mRNA levels increased by 2.5-fold (Fig.1, lane 2). In all cases, nucleolin mRNA was a single 3.0-kilobase pair transcript. The inactive phorbol ester, 4α-phorbol, did not stimulate nucleolin mRNA accumulation. Two additional activators of PKC, SC-9 and OAG, that stimulate calcium/phospholipid-dependent PKC were also tested (Fig. 1, lanes 3–4). SC-9 had no effect, whereas OAG, a diacylglycerol analog, had a small stimulatory effect (29%) on nucleolin mRNA levels. The PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I and staurosporine did not block the PMA-mediated increase in nucleolin mRNA levels indicating that PMA acts independently of PKC (data not shown). The effect of several calcium mobilization drugs on nucleolin mRNA levels was next assessed. The ionophores A23187 and ionomycin, which transport calcium from the medium into cells, as well as thapsigargin, which causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores, all increased nucleolin mRNA levels 1.5–2.5-fold above unstimulated controls (Fig. 1, lane 6–8). Dantrolene (lane 9), which blocks intracellular calcium release, had no effect on nucleolin mRNA levels. Therefore, nucleolin mRNA levels were up-regulated in response to drugs that increase intracellular calcium concentrations via release from intracellular stores or import from the extracellular environment. We examined the influence of several activators and inhibitors of PKA and PLC signal transduction on the steady state level of nucleolin mRNA in PBMC. Cyclic AMP, a known activator of PKA, and (Rp)-cAMPS, an inhibitor of PKA, did not change the steady state level of nucleolin mRNA (Fig.2, lanes 4–5). Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase resulting in increased cAMP levels. 1,9-Dideoxyforskolin, a negative control for forskolin, is unable to stimulate adenylate cyclase. Activation of the adenylate cyclase pathway with forskolin did not influence the steady state level of nucleolin mRNA in PBMC (Fig. 2, lane 3). We did observe a 24% increase in nucleolin mRNA levels upon treatment with imipramine, a drug that stimulates PLC in rat brain by a calcium-dependent process (29Fukuda H. Nishida A. Saito H. Shimizu M. Yamawaki S. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 25: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig.3, lane 4). We did not observe any significant change in nucleolin mRNA levels with D-609, Et-18-OCH3, or wortmannin (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 3and 5), drugs that inhibit phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively. The steroid hormones, estrogen and corticosterone, also did not affect nucleolin mRNA levels (Fig. 3, lanes 7and 8). Therefore, the imipramine-mediated effects suggest that the PLC pathway partially modulates nucleolin mRNA levels in PBMC.Figure 3PLC pathway agonists do not significantly alter nucleolin mRNA levels in PBMC. Cells were treated 4 h with 20 ng/ml PMA (lane 1), 19 μm D609 (lane 2), 15 μm ET-18-OCH3(lane 3), 100 μm imipramine (lane 4), 10 nm wortmannin (lane 5), 100 nm 17β-estradiol (lane 6), 1.5 μm corticosterone (lane 7), 100 nm17β-estradiol with 1.5 μm corticosterone (est + cort, lane 8), and 0.1% PBS (lane 9) followed by a 15-min chase with DRB. Total RNA (10 μg per lane) was analyzed by Northern blotting. A, representative Northern blot of the nucleolin-specific hybridization signals. B,representative Northern blot of the S26-specific hybridization signals.C, histogram depicting nucleolin mRNA levels normalized to S26 and plotted as a percentage of total nucleolin mRNA. The error bars represent the S.E. for triplicate samples. Student's t test results are as follows: PMA,p = 0.0029; D609, p = 1.0; Et-18-OCH3, p = 0.11; imipramine,p = 0.036; wortmannin, p = 0.17; 17β-estradiol, p = 0.23; corticosterone,p = 0.68; and 17β-estradiol + corticosterone,p = 0.16.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PMA is a known activator of the MAPK signal transduction pathway, so we next assessed the ability of U0126 to block the PMA-mediated increase in nucleolin mRNA levels (Fig. 4). Cells were pretreated with 10 μm U0126 for 15 min prior to the addition of 20 ng/ml PMA for 3 h. The cultures were spiked with 5 μm U0126 after 1 and 2 h with PMA to maintain anti-MEK activity. U0126 blocked the PMA-mediated increase in nucleolin mRNA levels (Fig. 4, lane 3) pointing to the ERK-specific MAPK pathway as a major player in regulating nucleolin mRNA levels. Nucleolin mRNA accumulation could be secondary to increased transcription, decreased degradation, or both. Thus, nucleolin mRNA decay was measured in resting or PMA-treated PBMC. In resting PBMC, the half-life of nucleolin mRNA was 1.8 h (Fig.5), which increased almost 2-fold (t12 = 3.2 h) after treatment for 3.5 h with PMA. Therefore, nucleolin mRNA accumulation after ERK activation can be accounted for by enhanced stability of the message. As mentioned earlier, nucleolin protein has been implicated in many functions including APP mRNA stability. Thus, we examined cell lysates for nucleolin expression by Western blotting and nucleolin binding activity by RNA gel mobility shift assays. There was a time-dependent increase in nucleolin protein levels upon PMA treatment (Fig. 6). On ECL-stained Western blots probed with a polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibody, we observed two prominent nucleolin bands at 47 and 65 kDa in unstimulated PBMC. After PMA stimulation for 15 min, there was an increase in nucleolin fragments of ∼70 kDa, and after 1 h, an increase in the 80-kDa nucleolin fragment. We observed full-length nucleolin protein (100 kDa) after 2 h of PMA treatment which continued to increase for several hours. As full-length nucleolin increased there was a decrease in the 47-kDa nucleolin cleavage product. RNA mobility shifts with radiolabeled APP RNA demonstrated a 2.8-fold increase in nucleolin binding after only 20 min of PMA treatment and a 5.1-fold increase by 135 min (Fig. 7). Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the 70-kDa nucleolin polypeptide is responsible for the 84-kDa nucleolin/29-base element RNA-protein complex (1Zaidi S.H. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17292-17298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, there were faint nucleolin-APP RNA complexes in the 60–70-kDa range (Fig. 7, lane 1) which were previously observed only in stimulated cells (16Zaidi S.H. Denman R. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24000-24006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These lower molecular weight complexes are not due to cell stimulation during the PBMC isolation procedure but rather are a consequence of including"
https://openalex.org/W2318329767,"p27Kip1 is a regulator of the mammalian cell cycle and a putative tumor suppressor. Distinct altered patterns of p27Kip1 protein expression are found in a variety of human carcinomas, and p27Kip1 expression levels usually correlate directly with disease-free survival. The mechanism(s) by which p27Kip1 expression is reduced or lost during tumorigenesis remains unclear. Specific alterations of the p27Kip1 gene, including mutations and homozygous deletions, are exceedingly rare in human cancers. We have used methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing to examine the methylation status of p27Kip1 in 61 primary and metastatic tumors and 35 cell lines from patients with malignant melanoma. Dense methylation of a CpG island in the promoter region of p27Kip1 was detected in four of 45 metastatic tumors (9%) and three of the cell lines (9%), including two cell lines established from two different metastases from the same patient. Examination of a naturally occurring, allele-specific sequence variant demonstrated that p27Kip1 methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing in situ. Cell lines with p27Kip1 methylation showed retention of the wild-type allele and detectable p27Kip1 protein whose abundance was reduced compared with normal melanocytes. Collectively, our data suggest that DNA methylation may be a cause of monoallelic p27Kip1 silencing in malignant melanoma, which would support a role for p27Kip1 haploinsufficiency in human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2333285528,"The retinoblastoma family of proteins including pRB, p107 and p130 undergoes cell cycle dependent phosphorylation during the mid-G1 to S phase transition. This phosphorylation is dependent upon the activity of cyclin D/cdk4. In contrast to pRB and p107, p130 is phosphorylated during G0 and the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. We observed that p130 is specifically phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in T98G cells arrested in G0 by serum deprivation or density arrest. Identification of the phospho-serine and phospho-threonine residues revealed that most were clustered within a short co-linear region unique to p130, defined as the Loop. Deletion of the Loop region resulted in a change in the phosphorylation status of p130 under growth arrest conditions. Notably, deletion of the Loop did not affect the ability of p130 to bind to E2F-4 or SV40 Large T antigen, to induce growth arrest in Saos-2 cells, and to become hyperphosphorylated during the proliferative phase of the cell cycle. p130 undergoes specific G0 phosphorylation in a manner that distinguishes it from pRB and p107."

A switch from expression of FGFR2IIIb to FGFR2IIIc accompanies the transition of nonmalignant rat prostate tumor epithelial cells (DTE) to cells comprising malignant AT3 tumors. Here we used transfection of minigenes with and without alterations in reading frame and with and without introns to examine how translation affects observed FGFR2 splice products. We observed that nonsense mutations in other than the last exon led to a dramatic reduction in mRNA that is abrogated by removal of downstream introns in both DTE and AT3 cells. The mRNA, devoid of both IIIb and IIIc exons (C1-C2), is a major splice product from minigenes lacking an intron downstream of the second common exon C2. From these observations, we suggest that repression of exon IIIc and activation of exon IIIb inclusion in DTE cells lead to the generation of both C1-IIIb-C2 and C1-C2 products. However, the C1-C2 product from the native gene is degraded due to a frameshift and a premature termination codon caused by splicing C1 and C2 together. Derepression of exon IIIc and repression of exon IIIb lead to the generation of both C1-IIIc-C2 and C1-C2 products in AT3 cells, but the C1-C2 product is degraded. The C1-IIIb-IIIc-C2 mRNA containing a premature termination codon in exon IIIc was present, but at apparently trace levels in both cell types.

Paracrine signaling from FGF-7/FGF-10 in the stroma to FGFR2IIIb in the epithelium has been implicated in the maintenance of homeostasis between compartments and has an overall effect of limiting cell proliferation and maintaining cell differentiation (11Yan G. Fukabori Y. Nikolaropoulos S. Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Feng S. Wang F. Matsubara A. Kan M. McKeehan W.L.

The loss of FGFR2IIIb activity severs the epithelial cells from the controlling signals of the stroma. A loss of expression of FGFR2IIIb in epithelial cells concurrent with a switch to exclusive expression of FGFR2IIIc has been observed during the progression of transplantable rat prostate tumors from a nonmalignant (DT) to a malignant (AT) phenotype (4Carstens R.P.

The switch from exclusive expression of exon IIIb- to IIIc-containing mRNA in epithelial cells appears to be clonal, unidirectional, and irreversible. Cell type-specific transfection of FGFR2 minigenes and trace analysis of mRNA products by the PCR has been employed by others to screen for cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors that are involved in cell type-specific alternative splicing of FGFR2 pre-mRNA (5Carstens R.P.

These studies have employed diverse minigene constructs in which partial FGFR2 or viral cDNAs flank the genomic sequence containing exons IIIb and IIIc. The studies noted that transient or permanent transfection and the reading frame of the constructs affected apparent exon inclusion, which complicated interpretation of results (6Del Gatto F. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4825-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined in detail how the translational reading frame affects the alternative splicing of the FGFR2 pre-mRNA and the stability of the spliced FGFR2 mRNA. Experimental minigenes were constructed from FGFR2 sequences and gave rise to translatable mRNAs containing either an artificial last exon harboring the termination codon or an upstream exon harboring a premature termination codon (PTC). Modes of transfection and analysis of mRNA products by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) were compared. Our results confirm those of others that suggested that inclusion and exclusion of both exons IIIb and IIIc can occur during pre-mRNA splicing in addition to inclusion of only one or the other (5Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although results based solely on PCR analysis could be interpreted as PTC-dependent shifts in exon recognition during FGFR2 pre-mRNA splicing, the collective results after quantitative analysis suggested that the effect of a PTC was simply to depress the particular transcript containing the PTC. The results suggest that the mutually exclusive expression of only FGFR2 exon IIIb and IIIc is a result of cooperation between cell-specific splice-site regulation (5Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L.

Minigenes were constructed by generating fragments of rat genomic DNA in the PCR followed by ligation with the luciferase gene into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). FGFR2 cDNA fragments were then inserted 5′ and 3′ to the rat genomic DNA such that following pre-mRNA splicing, the constructs would encode a functional membrane-bound FGFR2 extracellular domain fused to an intracellular luciferase. These constructs are preceded by the designation, “M.” cDNA constructions identical to the minigenes, except for the absence of introns, are preceded by the designation, “C.” The pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ vector contains a cytomegalovirus promoter and an SV40 polyadenylation signal, but codes for no Kozak consensus sequence for translational initiation. The natural FGFR2 ATG was utilized as the translational start site. Minigenes and predicted products are summarized in Fig. 1 (A and B). Rat FGFR2 genomic DNA was obtained from the prostate tissue of F344 Fisher rats by standard methods. The PCR was carried out in a final volume of 100 μl using 1 μg of genomic DNA with reaction conditions specified in the LA PCR Kit (PanVera, Madison, WI). All products of the PCR were sequenced. Stock cultures of cloned cell lines from the Dunning R3327PAP and R3327AT3 tumors were prepared and maintained by previously described methods (14Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropoulos S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Liposomes were prepared according to manufacturer protocols (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Transfection conditions were optimized for: cell density, liposome reagent, liposome volume, DNA amount, time of liposome incubation, and time after transfection by varying the conditions and assaying for luminescence following transfection of the pGL-3 Control vector (Promega). Cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 25-cm2 (T25) flasks for the RT-PCR analysis. Cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded in 75-cm2(T75) flasks for the ribonuclease protection assays. 5 μg of DNA vector along with 15 μl of CellFectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for transfecting DTE cells, whereas LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for transfecting AT3 cells. DNA (5 μg) was mixed with 15 μl of liposomes in a total volume of 100 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for a total of 45 min for cells in T25 flasks. DTE and AT3 cells were transfected and analyzed for luminescence 48-h post transfection. Liposome-DNA complexes were incubated with all cell types for 4 h at which time the serum-free medium was exchanged for serum-containing media. Cells were analyzed for luminescence, FGF binding, or by RPA or RT-PCR analysis 48-h post transfection. Volumes were tripled for cells in T75 flasks. Following transfection of the pGL-β-Gal vector (Promega) and staining for β-galactosidase activity following the manufacturer's protocol, the transfection efficiency of DTE cells was estimated to be ∼15%, whereas AT3 cell transfection efficiency was found to be ∼1%. Stably transfected cell lines were transfected by the same optimized methods. Following transfection with the Zeocin (Invitrogen) resistant minigenes for 3 days, cells were detached, subcultured, and reseeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/T25 flask and selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml Zeocin as per manufacturer's instructions for 2 weeks. Stable cell lines were thereafter maintained in the presence of 100 μg/ml Zeocin. Sources, recombinant production, iodination, and recovery of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7, as well as conditions for measuring specific and nonspecific binding and covalent affinity cross-linking to FGFR, have been described in detail previously (25Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5774-5779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang F. Kan M. McKeehan K. Jang J.H. Feng S. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated from transfected rat prostate tumor cells using the Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx, Houston, TX) per the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was used for generation of cDNA template by reverse transcription with a random 6-mer as primer in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. A 5-μl portion was used for subsequent PCR reactions. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Along with 20 μl of the PCR mixture, 2 μl of React 2 buffer (Life Technologies) was added along with the restriction enzymes Ava I, Eco RV, or Sac II for restriction analysis and were incubated for 1 h. This method reproducibly digested the products to completion. Each transient transfection, RT-PCR, and restriction enzyme analysis was carried out at least three times, and the figures displayed are a single representative of the three. RT-PCR and restriction analysis of products from stably transfected cell cultures were repeated at least three times. The figures displayed are a single representative of three reproductions. Total RNA was isolated as described above and subjected to ribonuclease protection using the Hybspeed RPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using the following probes transcribed with the Maxiscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's suggested procedures. All probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]UTP during transcription by either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. The FGFR2IIIb probe was constructed by excising a 224-bp Hae III-Sac II fragment from the CIIIb construction and ligation into pBluescript SK that was digested with Sma I and Sac II. Following digestion byHin dIII, the probe was transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. The FGFR2IIIc probe construction was made by excising a 218-bpEco RV-Sac II fragment from the CIIIc construct, and following Klenow treatment, ligating it into pBluescript SK digested by Sma I. Following linearization byEco RI, the construct was transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. Rat β-actin probe was made by ligation of a 117-bp Alu I fragment from a rat β-actin cDNA into pBluescript SK digested byEco RV. Following linearization with Eco RI, the construct was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. The predicted products of the two probes and their location within FGFR2 minigenes are illustrated schematically in Fig. 3. Each probe was hybridized with the corresponding RNA sample for 10 min and incubated in the presence of Ambion RNase A1/T1 mixture for 30 min. Protected fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide-sequencing gels and subjected to autoradiography, and the relative intensities of products was quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis using the ImageQuaNT program. Unless otherwise noted, RPA experiments were reproduced at least three times. Sequences of minigenes have been submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AF147757). FGFR2 minigenes and cDNAs used in the study are summarized in Fig.1 A. Minigenes were designed using rat genomic DNA, employed the natural FGFR start codon, encoded the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains of FGFR2, and are predicted to yield FGF-binding transmembrane receptors following translation. Minigenes were also fused with the coding sequence for luciferase at the COOH terminus of full-length expression products. Initially, four minigenes were constructed. MWt contained no mutations. MIIIb-stop contained mutations that caused a PTC in exon IIIb. MIIIb-frsh contained an insertional mutation that caused a reading-frame shift within exon IIIb. The shift resulted in a termination codon in exon C2 of the C1-IIIb-C2 product but also resulted in stop codons (PTCs) in exon IIIc of any C1-IIIb-IIIc-C2 transcripts. MIIIc-stop contained mutations causing a PTC in exon IIIc. FGFR2 cDNAs (CIIIb and CIIIc) were constructed and employed as controls for the expression of minigenes in the absence of pre-mRNA splicing. Additionally, a construct, MIIIc-1bpstop, containing a single-base pair mutation that generated a PTC in exon IIIc, was constructed (Fig. 1 A). The predicted cell type-specific translation products of the minigenes are illustrated in Fig. 1 B. Functionality of minigene constructs from transcription to protein product was first validated prior to use in prostate DTE and AT3 epithelial cells by transient transfection and subsequent measurement of cell surface FGF binding to COS monkey kidney cells. [125I]FGF-1 binding was used to assess binding to all FGF receptor products, whereas [125I]FGF-7 binding was used to assess binding specifically to FGFR2IIIb (11Yan G. Fukabori Y. Nikolaropoulos S. Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropoulos S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). COS cells transfected with all minigenes and cDNAs except those with a PTC in exon IIIc exhibited a 3- to 5-fold increase in [125I]FGF-1 binding over untransfected cells (Fig. 2 A). COS cells transfected with all minigenes except those with a stop codon or frameshift in exon IIIb exhibited a 5- to 15-fold increase in the binding of FGF-7 (Fig. 2 B). Covalent affinity cross-linking confirmed that the binding reflected formation of specific radiolabeled FGF-1·FGFR complexes of expected molecular mass of about 133 kDa (Fig. 2 C). A separate analysis of luciferase activity from cells transfected by the minigenes yielded insufficient differences between constructs with and without upstream nonsense mutations to be of utility in monitoring cell type-specific alternative splicing. Luciferase activity was subsequently used to monitor transfection efficiency among minigenes and different cell types. Once minigenes were validated as capable of producing sufficient levels of translation product in COS cells, expression was then examined at the mRNA level in DTE and AT3 cells, which mutually exclusively express FGFR2IIIb or FGFR2IIIc, respectively (5Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropoulos S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We first screened for the presence of the four possible mRNA products of the minigenes, C1-IIIb-IIIc-C2, C1-IIIb-C2, C1-IIIc-C2, and C1-C2, by RT-PCR using paired primers to C1 and C2. Expression was examined with a 5′-primer specific for the upstream exon common to all FGFR2 cDNAs and a 3′-primer specific for the luciferase sequence, a downstream sequence common to minigene-derived cDNAs, to amplify only minigene products. Restriction enzymes Ava I andEco RV, which recognize sequences in FGFR2 exon IIIb and IIIc, respectively, were used to distinguish between exon IIIb-containing and exon IIIc-containing cDNAs in the PCR. Products generated in the PCR following treatment with the two restriction enzymes are summarized in Fig. 3. Analysis by ribonuclease protection was subsequently employed to verify that mRNA products indicated by the PCR were present in greater than trace amounts and to quantify amounts of exon IIIb-C2 or IIIc-C2 products relative to other FGFR2 mRNAs. Amounts of mRNA were standardized by an internal β-actin control. Transfection efficiency, measured as intensity of minigene bands relative to β-actin bands, varied slightly among transfections but exon inclusion ratios did not (data not shown). All RPAs were reproduced at least three times, unless otherwise noted, and inclusion ratio data varied less than 5% from transfection to transfection. Additionally, because the exon inclusion analysis involves quantitative comparison of bands within the lanes and not from different lanes, slight variability in transfection efficiency will not affect the analysis. The RPA probes and products that resulted from the four potential variants of the FGFR2 minigenes are summarized in Fig. 3. RPA probes were validated and conditions standardized with mRNA from cells transfected with intronless cDNAs, CIIIb and CIIIc, which were comprised of the identical coding sequences corresponding to the C1-IIIb-C2 and C1-IIIc-C2 products of the minigenes. The IIIb and IIIc cDNAs yielded the expected probe-specific bands at 224 and 218 nucleotides (nt), respectively, and bands that were 13 and 5 nt shorter. This was presumably due to “breathing” of the RNA duplex at the 3′-end of the constant exon C2 in both probes and sensitivity to RNase at that site. The three bands were included in the quantitative analyses. About 67% of cell lines derived from malignant AT3 tumors express exclusively the FGFR2IIIc mRNA, whereas the other 33% express no FGFR2 products at all (14Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropoulos S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 16Feng S. Wang F. Matsubara A. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5369-5378PubMed Google Scholar). An initial analysis by RT-PCR of mRNA from AT3 cells following transient transfection with minigenes MWt, MIIIb-stop, and MIIIb-frsh revealed only the FGFR2IIIc cDNA band expected of the cell type (Fig.4). The nonsense mutation in exon IIIc in the MIIIc-stop caused a reduction in the C1-IIIc-C2 product concurrent with an apparent increase in the C1-C2 product devoid of both exons. Employment of different primers complementary to C2 confirmed the predominant expression of the C1-IIIc-C2 mRNA from MWt, MIIIb-stop, and MIIIb-frsh, and the apparent increase in the C1-C2 product from the MIIIc-stop (results not shown). Minor bands that were resistant to both enzymes and correlated in size with the C1-C2 transcript were sometimes detected. Dependent on primers and conditions, faint bands appeared from MWt that correlated with the expected size of the C1-IIIb-IIIc-C2 transcript. However, we failed to detect the presence of the C1-IIIb-C2 cDNA by Ava I treatment. At first glance, these results suggested the predominant recognition of exon IIIc by the splicing machinery in AT3 cells and that the nonsense mutation in exon IIIc caused an increase in the C1-C2 splice product. To confirm results from the PCR, we employed ribonuclease protection analysis (RPA) with IIIb-C2 (Fig.5 A)- and IIIc-C2 (Fig.5 B)-specific probes. The results revealed that the C1-IIIc-C2 mRNA comprised 63–80% of FGFR2 mRNAs from AT3 cells. The RPA analysis confirmed that expression of C1-IIIc-C2 from the MIIIc-stop was dramatically reduced, but yielded no evidence of a significant increase in either the C1-IIIb-C2 or C1-C2 mRNA products. In contrast to RT-PCR, the RPA analysis suggested that the C1-C2 product comprised a constant 20–40% of the FGFR2 products in AT3 cells. The comparative analysis between RPA and RT-PCR approaches illustrate limitations in the RT-PCR analysis in estimate of minority products when common primers across alternative splice sites are employed. Pitfalls in interpretation of the increase in otherwise minority products due to a PTC in the majority product in RT-PCR analysis has been described and reviewed by others (27Valentine C.R. Heflich R.H. RNA. 1997; 3: 660-676PubMed Google Scholar, 28Valentine C.R. Mutat. Res. 1998; 411: 87-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). DTE cells, which express exclusively the IIIb isoform of the FGFR2 receptor, were transfected transiently with minigenes MWt, MIIIb-stop, MIIIc-stop, and MIIIb-frsh. Surprisingly, when the products were assessed by PCR, the transfection of DTE cells with all four minigenes yielded no apparent C1-IIIb-C2 cDNA band expected of the cell type (Fig. 6). Instead, bands corresponding to C1-IIIc-C2 cDNA and C1-C2 cDNA, in which both exons IIIb and IIIc were excluded, were the majority products from all minigenes except MIIIc-stop. MIIIc-stop gave rise to predominately the 589-bp band indicative of the C1-C2 cDNA devoid of both exons. To determine whether this unexpected pattern was a consequence of transient transfection rather than the assay method, DTE cells were stably transfected (see “Experimental Procedures”), and expression products were again analyzed by RT-PCR. In contrast to the results from transiently transfected cells, DTE cells stably transfected with the MWt and MIIIc-stop gave rise to exclusively the expected C1-IIIb-C2 cDNA (Fig. 7). However, minigene MIIIb-stop still gave rise to bands indicative of the C1-IIIc-C2 and C1-C2 cDNAs, although the apparent levels of expression were reduced. As in AT3 cells, these PCR-based results again indicated that a PTC in the respective exon that is characteristic of the cell type potentially caused a shift to other alternatively spliced products.

Removal of the α-subunit did not appear to significantly alter binding of guanine nucleotide or Met-tRNAiMetligands by eIF2 in vitro. Qualitative assays to detect 43 S initiation complex formation and eIF5-dependent GTP hydrolysis revealed no differences between eIF2βγ and the wild-type eIF2 heterotrimer. However, steady-state kinetic analysis of eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange revealed that the absence of the α-subunit increased Km for eIF2βγ·GDP by an order of magnitude, with a smaller increase in Vmax. These data indicate that eIF2α is required for structural interactions between eIF2 and eIF2B that promote wild-type rates of nucleotide exchange.

This complex binds at or near the 5′-end of capped mRNAs and “scans” the mRNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction until an AUG start codon in proper context is encountered. Genetic analyses in yeast have demonstrated a function for eIF2 in the selection of the translational start site (6Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dorris D.R. Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recognition of the start codon is accompanied by eIF5-mediated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP, which facilitates release of an inactive eIF2·GDP binary complex as well as several other initiation factors. The 40 S/mRNA/Met-tRNAiMet complex interacts with a 60 S ribosomal subunit to form an 80 S initiation complex that can then enter the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Conversion of the inactive eIF2·GDP binary complex to eIF2·GTP, which is capable of rebinding initiator tRNA, is catalyzed by the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. To execute its functions in translation initiation, eIF2 must interact with multiple ligands as well as other components of the translational apparatus. The former include guanine nucleotides and initiator tRNA, whereas the latter may include ribosomes, mRNA, and other initiation factors including eIF2B and eIF5. Several studies have been conducted to characterize the function of individual eIF2 subunits. Both yeast and mammalian eIF2γ proteins exhibit a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to bacterial EF1A (formerly EF-Tu) and SELB proteins (8Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The implied functional similarity with EF1A-like proteins was substantiated by mutational analysis, where point mutations in the structural gene encoding yeast eIF2γ (GCD11) conferred specific biochemical defects in either nucleotide or tRNA binding in the altered eIF2 proteins (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These defects were predicted by the EF1A structural model, confirming the notion that eIF2γ provides EF1A-like function to the eIF2 complex. Other studies demonstrated cross-linking of the γ-subunit to 18 S rRNA, suggesting an involvement in ribosome interaction and/or 43 S complex formation (15Westermann P. Nygard O. Bielka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3065-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the role of eIF2γ in GTP binding implies a further role in GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, there is currently no data to support direct contact between the γ-subunit of eIF2 and either eIF5 or eIF2B. Cross-linking studies have also implicated the β-subunit of eIF2 in nucleotide- and Met-tRNAiMet binding (8Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M. Hershey J.W. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3415-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Bommer U.A. Kraft R. Kurzchalia T.V. Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20638-20642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating at the very least a proximity of this subunit to binding sites present on eIF2γ. A role for eIF2β in tRNA binding was suggested by analysis of partially purified eIF2 preparations from yeast strains harboring mutations in the eIF2β structural gene (SUI3) (18Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Valavicius B.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The function of eIF2β has also been examined using preparations of mammalian eIF2αγ obtained as a result of proteolysis of the β-subunit either during purification or purposefully at the hands of the experimenter (Ref. 19Flynn A. Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and references therein). These studies demonstrated little effect on the binding of guanine nucleotides in the absence of intact eIF2β. However, the eIF2αγ complex was severely defective in the formation of ternary complexes, suggesting the β-subunit was involved in Met-tRNAiMet binding. The eIF2αγ preparations also showed reduced rates of eIF2B-catalyzed exchange in vitro, suggesting that the β-subunit plays a role in catalyzed nucleotide exchange. This is consistent with recent reports demonstrating interaction between the C terminus of eIF2β and the δ- and ε-subunits of mammalian eIF2B (20Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.K. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3039-3044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as between the N terminus of eIF2β and the ε-subunit (Gcd6p) of yeast eIF2B (21Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-subunit of eIF2 also appears to interact directly with eIF5 (21Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Das S. Maitra U. Mol. Cell.

Das K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31712-31718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Curiously, both eIF5 and eIF2Bε contain C-terminal bipartite motifs rich in aromatic and acidic amino acids that are important for interactions with eIF2β (21Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas many functions ascribed to eIF2 can be attributed to the β- and γ-subunits, comparatively little is known about the contribution of the α-subunit to eIF2 function. Two prior biochemical studies using α-deficient forms of eIF2 (i.e. containing low levels of contaminating eIF2α protein) yielded different results in comparing specific activities of α-deficient and wild-type eIF2 preparations (16Anthony Jr., D.D. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Mouat M.F. Manchester K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 183: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The α-subunit has been cross-linked to 18 S rRNA, suggesting an involvement in 43 S complex formation (15Westermann P. Nygard O. Bielka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3065-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and also appears to contain conserved sequences similar to the S1-RM repeated sequence motif present in bacterial ribosomal protein S1 and thought to be involved in RNA binding (26Gribskov M. Gene. 1992; 119: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the best-characterized aspect of eIF2α is its role in regulating eIF2 function (reviewed in Refs. 5Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20823-20826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Proud C.G. Curr. Top.

Phosphorylation of the α-subunit at a conserved serine residue (Ser-51) converts eIF2 to a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange (30Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This results in functional sequestration of limiting amounts of eIF2B and leads to decreased levels of active eIF2 and global protein synthesis. Regulation of eIF2 activity in this manner is conserved across species (29Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wek R.C. Trends Biochem.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (40Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated 2F. L. Erickson, J. Nika, and E. M. Hannig, submitted for publication.2F. L. Erickson, J. Nika, and E. M. Hannig, submitted for publication.that lethality associated with deletion of the yeast SUI2gene (eIF2α) could be suppressed by cooverexpressing wild-type SUI3, GCD11, and IMT (initiator methionyl-tRNA). Suppression was more efficient when the wild-type GCD11 allele was replaced with gcd11-K250R, which altered the NKXD element conserved in GTP-binding proteins and led to increased dissociation of guanine nucleotides in vitro (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because this effect mimics the function of eIF2B in nucleotide exchange, co-overproduction of eIF2γK250R and initiator tRNA also bypassed eIF2B function in vivo and, as with bypass of SUI2, was more efficient than overproduction of wild-type eIF2. This suggested that the nucleotide exchange reaction was a rate-limiting step in translation initiation in these strains. Based upon these observations, we proposed that the eIF2βγ complex was sufficient for providing eIF2 function, whereas eIF2B and the α-subunit of eIF2 served primarily to regulate eIF2 activity. The construction of strains completely lacking eIF2α provides a unique opportunity to address basic aspects of eIF2α function. In this study, we purified both eIF2βγ and eIF2βγK250Rand compared their biochemical activities in vitro with heterotrimeric wild-type eIF2 and eIF2γK250R. Removal of the α-subunit had little effect on dissociation of guanine nucleotides and GTP-dependent tRNA binding (ternary complex formation). In vitro, ternary complexes formed with eIF2βγ interacted with the AUG codon and ribosomes to form 43 S preinitiation complexes, which served as substrates for eIF5-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Kinetic analysis of eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange using eIF2βγ·GDP as substrate revealed a 16-fold increase in Km and an 8-fold increase in Vmax when compared with wild-type eIF2·GDP. These data suggest that the α-subunit of eIF2 plays a crucial role in structural interactions with eIF2B that determine wild-type rates of nucleotide exchange in vivo. [8,5′-3H]GDP (5–15 Ci/mmol) andl-[methyl-3H]methionine (70–85 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; [γ-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Protease inhibitors, GDP, and Gpp(NH)p were purchased from Sigma. Bulk yeast tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 40 S ribosomal subunits were purified from brine shrimp eggs (Artemia; San Francisco Bay Brands) as described (41Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at 0.1–0.4 A260 units/μl. All buffers and reagents were prepared with purified water (MilliQ; Millopore Corp.). Yeast methionyl initiator tRNA was aminoacylated withl-[3H]methionine as described previously (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except that methionine was present at 3 μm, and tRNA was present at 12.5 μg/μl. Typically, 200–400 pmol (specific activity 7.8–9.0 × 104 cpm/pmol) of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [3H]methionine was obtained from a 1-ml reaction. His8-tagged (C terminus of eIF2γ) eIF2 and eIF2γK250R were purified from overexpressing yeast strains, as described previously (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The His8-tagged eIF2βγ isoforms were overproduced in a derivative of EY841 (MATα leu2–3 leu2–112 trp1-Δ63 sui2Δ gcd11::hisG GAL2 +)2 and purified similarly with the following modifications. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, the protein pellet was suspended 100 ml of nickel column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm KCl, 1 μm GDP, 6.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of nickel column buffer. Insoluble material and ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Dialysis after chromatography on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was reduced to 2 h against two liters of heparin buffer. These modifications reduced the purification time from 3 days to 2 and also resulted in increased specific activity of the eIF2βγ preparations. Purification of yeast eIF2B from an overexpressing yeast strain (H2649) and steady-state kinetic analysis of eIF2B-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange were performed as described previously (42Nika J. Yang W. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, the presence of 5 mm GDP as chase was determined to be saturating for the eIF2βγ substrate, since GDP at 10 mm did not lead to further increase in initial reaction velocities. The wild-type TIF5 (yeast eIF5) open reading frame plus 290 base pairs of 3′-flanking sequence was subcloned as a 1.5-kilobase NdeI/BamHI polymerase chain reaction product into a pET-3A expression vector (Novagen) such that the NdeI site included the authentic eIF5 start codon. The entire polymerase chain reaction fragment was sequenced to ensure the absence of polymerase chain reaction-derived mutations. The expression construct or the pET-3A vector alone (for preparation of a control extract) was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3/p LysS) (43Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The purification procedure was modified from Chaudhuri et al. (23Chaudhuri J. Das K. Maitra U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cultures for protein purification (500 ml) were grown at 37 °C, 300 rpm to an A600 of 1.25, induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown an additional 3 h, harvested, and rinsed with 0.9% ice-cold NaCl. Cells (15 g wet weight) were resuspended in 36 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then lysed by one cycle of freezing at −20 °C followed by thawing at room temperature. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C using 18 ml of lysate. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm (SS34 rotor) for 10 min, and 50 μl of a freshly prepared DNaseI (1 mg/ml stock) was added to the supernatant. After a 30-min incubation on wet ice, the sample was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 150 min, and the pellet was discarded. KCl (2.5 m) was slowly added to supernatant with constant stirring to bring the salt concentration to 250 mm. The sample was applied to a DE-52 column (Whatman, 28-ml bed volume) at a linear flow rate of 56.5 cm/h with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 250 mm KCl. The flow-through (140 ml) was collected and fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The 50–65% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 7 ml of buffer B (buffer A with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 70 mm KCl and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of the same buffer. The dialysate was applied to a DE-52 column (6.5-ml bed volume) at a linear flow rate of 33 cm/h and washed with buffer B, 90 mm KCl until the absorbance of the eluate was below 0.1 A254. The column was developed with a 50-ml linear KCl gradient (90 to 450 mm) in buffer B. Peak fractions containing eIF5, identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled (10 ml) and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B, 100 mm KCl for 3 h. The dialysate was applied to a heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (6.4-ml bed volume) at a linear flow rate of 33 cm/h in buffer B, 100 mm KCl. The column was washed with four column volumes of the same buffer, then developed using a 52-ml linear KCl gradient (100 to 800 mm) in buffer B. eIF5 eluted from the column as a single peak at ∼280 mm KCl. Peak fractions containing eIF5 were dialyzed against 1 liter of storage buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), spin-concentrated (Centricon 30, Millipore Corp.) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml, then frozen on dry ice and stored at −70 °C. Preparations of eIF5 were 80–85% pure, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Assays to determine intrinsic dissociation of guanine nucleotides from eIF2 complexes were performed at 0 °C as described previously (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 43 S complex stability assay was conducted in a three-stage reaction at 22 °C. The first stage consisted of ternary complex formation by incubation of 4.4 μg of yeast eIF2 with 24 pmol of [3H]Met-tRNAiMet for 15 min in a total volume of 110 μl (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GTP (or Gpp(NH)p), 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol). Stage two consisted of the addition of 1.0 A260 unit of 40 S Artemia ribosomes and 0.2 A260 units of AUG codon (Oligos, Etc., Wilsonville, OR) followed by a 10-min incubation. For stage 3, the reaction mixture was split into 2 equal aliquots, and 1 μg of eIF5 or an equal volume of a control extract without eIF5 (see above) was added. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction mixture was chilled on wet ice, layered onto a 5-ml 5–25% sucrose gradient (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2), and centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 2 h 20 min. Fractions (300 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient using an ISCO model 640 gradient fractionator with continuous monitoring at 254 nm. The percentage of each fraction was measured for radioactivity by scintillation counting in 5 ml of UltimaGold (Packard Instrument Co.). We purified eIF2βγ and eIF2βγK250R heterodimers from overexpressing yeast strains in which the eIF2α structural gene (SUI2) was deleted. Yields were comparable with those of heterotrimeric eIF2 proteins reported previously (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were 80–85% pure, as judged by densitometric analysis of stained gels (Fig.1). In addition, the two subunits (β and γ) were present in an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 1,lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that the absence of the α-subunit does not affect association of β- and γ-subunits. To determine the requirement for the α-subunit in guanine nucleotide binding, we measured nucleotide off-rates for eIF2, eIF2βγ, eIF2γK250R, and eIF2βγK250Rusing a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Reactions were performed at 0 °C to retard the rapid dissociation of nucleotide from γK250R-containing complexes. At 0 °C, wild-type eIF2 complexes showed little or no dissociation of eIF2·[3H]GDP (Fig.2 A), consistent with previously reported results (42Nika J. Yang W. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The absence of the α-subunit did not further enhance dissociation of the GDP-containing eIF2 binary complexes. Dissociation of GTP (Fig. 2 B) from wild-type eIF2 complexes, which is more rapid than GDP, was unaffected by the absence of the α-subunit. As expected, the presence of the K250R form of the γ-subunit increased the intrinsic dissociation rate for both GDP and GTP, and the rate of GDP dissociation was not significantly altered in the absence of eIF2α (the GTP reaction is essentially complete at the first time point in both cases). These data suggest that the α-subunit of eIF2 does not play a role in guanine nucleotide binding. We examined the affinity of the different eIF2 isoforms for Met-tRNAiMet by measuring equilibrium binding at various concentrations of [3H]Met-tRNAiMet in the presence of saturating levels of GTP. Both eIF2βγ and eIF2βγK250R bound Met-tRNAiMet in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Scatchard analysis was used to calculate apparent dissociation constants of 19, 62, and 107 nm for eIF2, eIF2βγK250R, and eIF2βγ, respectively (Fig. 3 B). This compares with previously reported apparent Kd values of 15 and 25 nm for eIF2 and eIF2γK250R, respectively (14Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The largest difference, approximately 5-fold, was observed between eIF2 and eIF2βγ, although this difference in our filter binding assay is of questionable significance and is discussed further below. We suggest that the absence of the α-subunit has, at best, a very mild effect on tRNA binding in vitro. In vitroeIF2·GTP·[3H]Met-tRNAiMet(ternary complex) interacts with the 40 S ribosomal subunit in an AUG codon-dependent fashion to form a stable 43 S preinitiation complex. This complex serves as a substrate for eIF5, which is required for hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP. Under these conditions, [3H]Met-tRNAiMet is released from the resulting eIF2·GDP binary complex. We developed an assay to measure this activity based upon similar assays reported by Chakrabarti and Maitra (41Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Chakravarti and Maitra (44Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using yeast eIF2, recombinant yeast eIF5, and 40 S ribosomal subunits purified from brine shrimp eggs. Formation of 43 S complexes in this assay was dependent upon the presence of ternary complex, 40 S ribosomes, and AUG codon triplet (data not shown). Complexes were treated using either purified recombinant yeast eIF5 or extract prepared from recombinant bacteria harboring the expression vector alone (control extract), then subjected to centrifugation through sucrose gradients. The addition of control extract (Fig. 4 A) or no treatment (data not shown) resulted in cosedimentation of 40 S ribosomes and [3H]Met-tRNAiMet using wild-type ternary complexes. The addition of yeast eIF5 led to the disappearance of radioactivity from the 40 S peak, presumably as a result of GTP hydrolysis. Because eIF2·GDP no longer binds the initiator tRNA, the weak association between the tRNA, AUG triplet, and the ribosome forms an unstable complex that is revealed by centrifugation through the sucrose gradient. That the disappearance of radioactivity from the 40 S complex is due to eIF5-mediated GTP hydrolysis is demonstrated by the persistence of radioactivity in the 40 S peak in eIF5-treated 43 S complexes assembled using ternary complexes containing the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog Gpp(NH)p (Fig.4 C). In the absence of the α-subunit, eIF2βγ readily formed 43 S complexes that appeared qualitatively identical to those formed using the wild-type eIF2 heterotrimer and were also effective substrates for"
https://openalex.org/W2331870383,"The ternary complex factors (TCFs), Elk-1, Sap-1a and Net, are key integrators of the transcriptional response to different signalling pathways. Classically, three MAP kinase pathways, involving ERK, JNK, and p38, transduce various extracellular stimuli to the nucleus. Net is a repressor that is converted into an activator by Ras/ERK signalling. Net is also exported from the nucleus in response to stress stimuli transduced through the JNK pathway, leading to relief from repression. Here we show that ERK and p38 bind to the D box and that binding is required for phosphorylation of the adjacent C-terminally located C-domain. The D box as well as the phosphorylation sites in the C-domain (the DC element) are required for transcription activation by Ras. On the other hand, JNK binds to the J box in the middle of the protein, and binding is required for phosphorylation of the adjacent EXport motif. Both the binding and phosphorylation sites (the JEX element) are important for Net export. In conclusion, specific targeting of Net by MAP kinase pathways involves two different docking sites and phosphorylation of two different domains. These two elements, DC and JEX, mediate two distinct functional responses."

The conversion of MPT into Moco by molybdate chelation apparently occurs concomitantly with the insertion of MPT into sulfite oxidase. molybdenum cofactor molybdopterin high-performance liquid chromatography bovine serum albumin nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Sulfite oxidase belongs to the family of molybdenum cofactor (Moco)1-containing enzymes characterized by the presence of a mononuclear molybdenum coordinated to the unique dithiolene group of a pterin derivative named molybdopterin (MPT). The overall reaction catalyzed by most Moco-containing enzymes, including sulfite oxidase, involves the transfer of an oxygen atom between the substrate and water in a two-electron oxidation-reduction reaction. Sulfite oxidase is ubiquitous among animals and catalyzes the physiologically vital oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, the terminal reaction in the oxidative degradation of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. The enzyme is a homodimer located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Each 52-kDa subunit of the human enzyme contains a small N-terminal heme domain and a large C-terminal Moco-binding domain (1Rajagopalan K.V. Coughlan M.P. in Molybdenum and Molybdenum-containing Enzymes. Pergamon, Oxford, U. K.1980: 241-272Google Scholar). Genetic deficiency of sulfite oxidase, which can be caused by either a mutation in its structural gene (isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency) or a defect in the synthesis of Moco (molybdenum cofactor deficiency), results in neurological abnormalities and often leads to death at an early age (2Johnson J.L. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Intern. Pediatr. 1997; 12: 23-27Google Scholar). The basic structure of Moco has been shown to be identical in all organisms, and its biosynthetic pathway seems to be conserved because genes encoding highly homologous proteins for Moco biosynthesis have been found in archaea, bacteria, higher plants, Drosophila, and higher animals including humans. Biosynthesis of Moco has been studied most extensively in Escherichia coli, and several genetic loci (moa, mob, mod,moe, and mog) have been implicated in the pleiotrophy of the molybdenum enzymes, most of them being involved in the biosynthesis of Moco (3Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The reactions of the Moco biosynthetic pathway comprise three stages that are identical in all organisms using molybdoenzymes: (i) conversion of a guanine nucleotide into the meta-stable precursor Z, (ii) conversion of precursor Z into MPT, and (iii) insertion of molybdenum into MPT, thus forming Moco. However, in most bacteria an additional stage in the biosynthetic pathway involves further modification of Moco leading to the formation of dinucleotide variants of MPT containing GMP, CMP, AMP, or IMP (4Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Conversion of precursor Z to MPT requires the opening of a cyclic phosphate to produce a terminal monoester as well as the transfer of sulfur to generate the dithiolene group essential for molybdenum ligation (5Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pitterle et al. (6Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that incubation of purified precursor Z with MPT synthase resulted in the formation of MPT. MPT synthase forms a heterotetramer composed of two small MoaD subunits (8.5 kDa each) and two large MoaE subunits (16.8 kDa each). In the activated form of MPT synthase, the C terminus of the small subunit is converted to a glycine thiocarboxylate that acts as the sulfur donor for the conversion of precursor Z to MPT. In turn, MPT synthase is resulfurated by the MoeB protein designated as MPT synthase sulfurase. The involvement of proteins analogous to MoaD and MoeB in pathways leading to the biosynthesis of thiamine and ferredoxin led to the proposal that those pathways also operate by the thiocarboxylate mechanism (3Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.

Based on the observation that high concentrations of molybdate in the growth medium can partially rescue a mogA mutant, the MogA protein has been suggested to catalyze the in vivoinsertion of molybdenum into MPT (8Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free Moco is extremely unstable (9Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1783-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus cannot be used in studies on the reconstitution of Moco-free proteins. In this paper, we describe an in vitro system for the incorporation of nascent Moco into Moco-free human sulfite oxidase expressed and purified from anE. coli strain with a mutation in the early steps of Moco biosynthesis. We show that MPT, produced in vitro from precursor Z by MPT synthase and stabilized by tight binding to the synthase, can be incorporated into aposulfite oxidase in the absence of molybdate and without the requirement of any other proteins. We were also able to reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity by the inclusion of molybdate in the in vitro system. These results reveal that no other proteins are required for the in vitro insertion of MPT into sulfite oxidase or for the conversion of MPT into Moco under the conditions used in the reconstitution mixture. E. coli chlAI, chlN, andchlM strains, now designated moaA −,moeB −, and moaD −, are isogenic mutants that were described previously (10Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were obtained from Novagen. The λ DE3 lysogenization kit from Novagen was used to integrate the gene for T7 RNA polymerase into the chromosome of the E. coli moeB − strain. Analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in a discontinuous gel system (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) using 4–20% nondenaturing gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Gel filtration molecular mass standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. Precursor Z was isolated from E. coli moaD − cells using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with reverse phase and anion exchange columns (12Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloned MPT synthase was expressed in a pET15b vector (Novagen) in E. coli BL21(DE3) andmoeB −(DE3) cells, and the protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration according to the procedure described by Rudolph et al. (13Rudolph, M., Wuebbens, M. M., Rajagopalan, K. V., and Schindelin, H. (2001) Nat. Struct. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The human sulfite oxidase gene was cloned into a pTrc-His vector resulting in an N-terminal fusion to a 6xHis-tag, expressed in E. coli moaA − cells and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (14Temple C. Graf T. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For comparison, non-His-tagged human sulfite oxidase was used, which was expressed and purified from E. coli as described by Temple et al. (14Temple C. Graf T. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Sulfite oxidase activity was assayed at room temperature by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm (15Jones H.P. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4988-4993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ferricyanide at 420 nm (16Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu 1601 spectrophotometer. One unit of sulfite oxidase activity is defined as an absorbance change (ΔA) of 1/min. MPT was produced in vitro by the method described by Pitterleet al. (6Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using purified precursor Z in 10 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 3, that was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH, and MPT synthase in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2. For a standard reconstitution assay, 30 nmol of precursor Z and 100 μg of MPT synthase were allowed to react at room temperature in the presence or absence of 20 mm sodium molybdate. After 15 min, 12 μg of sulfite oxidase in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, was added, and the reaction mixture, in a total volume of 80 μl, was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before aliquots were taken and either analyzed for MPT content or assayed in appropriate dilutions for sulfite oxidase activity. To analyze the amount of MPT present in sulfite oxidase or MPT synthase, the purified protein was subjected to a procedure that converts MPT to the stable oxidized fluorescent degradation product form A by treatment of the protein at pH 2.5 in the presence of iodine at room temperature, as originally described by Johnson et al. (17Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with alkaline phosphatase, dephospho form A was identified by HPLC analysis at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with an Alltech C18 HPLC column equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium acetate, 10% methanol. Form A was assayed by monitoring its fluorescence with an excitation at 297 nm and emission at 440 nm. All HPLC analyses were performed using the Hewlett Packard 1090 solvent delivery system, and eluting material was monitored either for absorbance using a Hewlett Packard 1040A diode array detector or for fluorescence using a Hewlett Packard 1046 fluorescence detector. To obtain human sulfite oxidase without bound Moco, the enzyme was expressed heterologously in an E. coli chlAI mutant strain. This strain contains a point mutation in themoaA gene, which is required for the first step of Moco biosynthesis, namely the conversion of a guanine nucleotide into precursor Z. The enzyme was expressed as an N-terminal fusion to a His-tag and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography as described by Templeet al. (14Temple C. Graf T. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of the purified inactive protein showed the typical spectrum of a cytochromeb 5, representing the N-terminal part of the protein (data not shown). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the inactive enzyme, without the molybdenum cofactor bound to its C-terminal part, retained its ability to form a homodimer with a molecular mass of ∼110 kDa (Fig.1). To synthesize MPT in vitro, purified precursor Z and purified MPT synthase were incubated at room temperature as described by Pitterle et al. (6Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified precursor Z was obtained from cells that contain a mutation inmoaD and thus accumulate the precursor (12Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active MPT synthase was purified after expression in BL21 cells (13Rudolph, M., Wuebbens, M. M., Rajagopalan, K. V., and Schindelin, H. (2001) Nat. Struct. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Inactive recombinant MPT synthase was purified from amoeB − strain deficient in MPT synthase sulfurylase activity (5Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the results obtained by Pitterle et al. (6Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MPT formed by incubation of active MPT synthase with precursor Z remains bound to MPT synthase (Fig.2). For these experiments, active or inactive MPT synthase was incubated with precursor Z at room temperature and dialyzed afterward to remove excess precursor Z. Subsequent heat treatment in the presence of acidic iodine released form A, the oxidized fluorescent degradation product of MPT. HPLC analysis revealed that form A could be obtained from active MPT synthase (Fig. 2 A), whereas no form A was obtained from inactive MPT synthase (Fig. 2 B). The fluorescence peak eluting at 3.8 min from the C18 reverse phase HPLC column after iodine treatment of inactive MPT synthase was identified as compound Z, the oxidized product of precursor Z (data not shown). Therefore, MPT remains tightly bound to active MPT synthase after dialysis, whereas inactive MPT synthase binds precursor Z tightly but is unable to convert it to MPT because of the absence of the glycine thiocarboxylate at the C-terminus of the small MoaD subunit. E. coli MPT synthase was previously shown capable of donating bound MPT to the inactive aponitrate reductase present in Neurospora crassa nit-1 extracts (6Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether MPT synthase is also capable of donating MPT to human sulfite oxidase, purified aposulfite oxidase was incubated with active MPT synthase and precursor Z under aerobic conditions. MPT synthase and precursor Z were incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of aposulfite oxidase. Sulfite oxidase activity was analyzed after a 30-min incubation of the enzyme with the mixture of MPT synthase/precursor Z. Somewhat unexpectedly, the inclusion of sodium molybdate in the in vitro incubation mixture prior to the addition of sulfite oxidase gave rise to sulfite oxidase activity (TableI). The specific activity of reconstituted sulfite oxidase was about 50% that of native sulfite oxidase (Table I). In contrast, incubation of aposulfite oxidase with MPT synthase and precursor Z without the addition of molybdate or with inactive MPT synthase and precursor Z did not reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity.Table IActivity of native sulfite oxidase or in vitro reconstituted aposulfite oxidase using cytochrome c or ferricyanide as electron acceptorsTreatmentSulfite oxidase activityCytochromec1-aSulfite oxidase activity was assayed at room temperature by monitoring the reduction of cytochromec at 550 nm or ferricyanide at 420 nm.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the maximum of 50% reconstitution of sulfite oxidase activity was due to limited incorporation of MPT into the enzyme or limited molybdate insertion into MPT, an analysis of the amount of cofactor present in reconstituted sulfite oxidase was carried out. Purified His-tagged aposulfite oxidase was added to the reconstitution mixtures in the presence or absence of sodium molybdate. After incubation as described above, sulfite oxidase was isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography. To determine the amount of MPT present in reconstituted active and inactive sulfite oxidase as well as native sulfite oxidase, the proteins were subjected to iodine oxidation to produce the form A derivative of the cofactor. HPLC analysis revealed that the amount of form A obtained from reconstituted active sulfite oxidase (Fig. 3 D) was about 57% of that obtained from native sulfite oxidase (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, the same amount of form A was obtained from inactive sulfite oxidase after incubation with MPT synthase and precursor Z in the absence of molybdate (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that MPT can be incorporated into sulfite oxidase even in the absence of molybdate. As expected, no form A could be obtained from aposulfite oxidase treated with inactive MPT synthase and precursor Z (Fig.3 B). Because the enzyme activity obtained from reconstituted sulfite oxidase correlated with the amount of cofactor present in the enzyme, it can be concluded that the less than maximal reconstitution of activity is due to the correspondingly lesser incorporation of MPT and that the molybdenum content of the reconstituted enzyme corresponds to the MPT content. To determine the effect of incubation time on the reconstitution of sulfite oxidase with Moco, a time course experiment was carried out. Sulfite oxidase was added under aerobic conditions to a mixture of MPT synthase, precursor Z, and sodium molybdate, which were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature. Aliquots of the aerobic incubation mixture were assayed at specific intervals for sulfite oxidase activity. Following the addition of sulfite oxidase (Fig. 4), maximum sulfite oxidase activity was achieved 10 min after the addition of sulfite oxidase to the in vitro system. Longer incubation times failed to yield a higher than 50% reconstitution of enzyme activity compared with native sulfite oxidase (Table I). Because Moco is known to be very sensitive to aerobic oxidation, the effect of anaerobiosis on thein vitro reconstitution assays was examined. Surprisingly, generation of MPT and insertion of Moco into sulfite oxidase under anaerobic conditions did not increase the extent of sulfite oxidase reconstitution (data not shown). Under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions, maximum activation of sulfite oxidase was achieved after an incubation time of 10 min and corresponded to reconstitution of about 50–60% of the enzyme molecules. To determine whether any components of the in vitro activation of sulfite oxidase were limiting for obtaining complete reconstitution of sulfite oxidase, the dependence of activation on the concentrations of the reactants was investigated. In general, the reactivation mixtures consisted of 100 μg of MPT synthase, 30 nmol of precursor Z, 12 μg of aposulfite oxidase, and 20 mm sodium molybdate. When the sodium molybdate concentration was varied over a range of 0–50 mm, maximal sulfite oxidase activity was attained at a concentration of 5 mm (Fig. 5 A). When precursor Z concentration was varied from 0 to 50 nmol, a maximum of sulfite oxidase activity was obtained at a concentration of 6–8 nmol (Fig. 5 B). When MPT synthase concentration was varied over a range of 0–250 μg, maximum reconstitution of sulfite oxidase was achieved at a concentration of ∼50 μg of the enzyme (Fig.5 C). Collectively, for the reconstitution of 12 μg of sulfite oxidase present in the in vitro activation system, none of the components were limiting under the standard conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 D, sulfite oxidase concentrations greater than 50 μg/reactivation mixture were required to produce a decrease in specific activity. Because this is approximately 4 times the amount of sulfite oxidase used in the standard reconstitution assay, it can be concluded that all components required for the in vitrosynthesis of Moco are present in optimum amounts in the in vitro assay and that the extent of reconstitution cannot be increased with higher concentrations of any of the components of the reconstitution mixture. With the knowledge that MPT can be inserted into sulfite oxidase in vitro, it was of further interest to study the mechanism of insertion of MPT and molybdate into aposulfite oxidase. To determine whether molybdenum is incorporated into MPT at a nonprotein bound stage before the insertion of MPT into sulfite oxidase, the stability of MPT produced by MPT synthase over time after the addition of sodium molybdate was investigated. MPT synthase, precursor Z, and sodium molybdate were preincubated under aerobic conditions for 15–75 min before the addition of sulfite oxidase. After sulfite oxidase was added, the reactivation mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before aliquots were removed and assayed for sulfite oxidase activity. As shown in Fig. 6, the ability to reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity did not decrease with an increase in elapsed time before the addition of aposulfite oxidase. Because MPT is very sensitive to air oxidation, these results reveal that MPT remains bound to MPT synthase and is therefore protected from air oxidation prior to its insertion into sulfite oxidase. To analyze whether release of MPT from MPT synthase is specifically induced by aposulfite oxidase or by a nonspecific protein interaction, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to the preincubation mixture. As shown in Fig. 6, the addition of BSA had little, if any, effect on sulfite oxidase reconstitution. Therefore, it is very likely that MPT is released from MPT synthase by a specific protein interaction with sulfite oxidase. To determine whether MPT is released from MPT synthase by interacting nonspecifically with any form of sulfite oxidase or is only released from MPT synthase for incorporation into the molybdopterin-free form of sulfite oxidase, the MPT content of MPT synthase after incubation with MPT-containing and MPT-free sulfite oxidase was analyzed. MPT synthase was incubated with precursor Z and sodium molybdate for 15 min before the addition of either His-tagged active sulfite oxidase purified from a wild-type strain (14Temple C. Graf T. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or His-tagged MPT-free aposulfite oxidase purified from the moaA − mutant strain. After the addition of sulfite oxidase, the reactivation mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To analyze the MPT content of MPT synthase, the incubation mixtures were dialyzed and applied on a Ni-NTA column to remove His-tagged sulfite oxidase. The flow-through from the Ni-NTA column, containing MPT synthase, was collected, dialyzed, and concentrated. Form A was generated from equal amounts of MPT synthase by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 7, HPLC analysis revealed that form A was obtained from MPT synthase incubated with cofactor-containing sulfite oxidase but not from MPT synthase, which was incubated with MPT-free sulfite oxidase. Therefore, MPT seems to be released from MPT synthase in a specific interaction with the MPT-free form of sulfite oxidase only. The data presented above demonstrate that MPT exists only in a protein-bound stage and is transferred specifically to MPT-free sulfite oxidase. To determine whether molybdenum is inserted into MPT bound to MPT synthase before being transferred to sulfite oxidase, precursor Z, MPT synthase, and sodium molybdate were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and MPT synthase was purified afterward over a gel filtration column to remove free molybdate. Sulfite oxidase was added to the gel-filtered MPT synthase, and the ability of MPT synthase to reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity without the addition of extra molybdate was analyzed. No sulfite oxidase activity was reconstituted under these conditions. However, inclusion of molybdate in the reconstitution mixture did produce the expected level of activity (data not shown). From these data it can be concluded that MPT synthase is unable to bind molybdate or convert MPT to Moco. The ability to reconstitute demolybdo-sulfite oxidase with molybdatein vitro was already observed by Jones et al.(15Jones H.P. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4988-4993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that molybdate could reconstitute a maximum of 30% of the demolybdo-sulfite oxidase isolated from tungsten-treated rats. To examine the conditions for molybdenum insertion into sulfite oxidase-bound MPT, MPT synthase was preincubated with precursor Z for 15 min at room temperature, and molybdate was added either before or at different time points after the addition of sulfite oxidase. After molybdate was added, the reactivation mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Aliquots were then removed and assayed for sulfite oxidase activity. As shown in Fig.8, the ability to reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity decreased steadily with increasing time before molybdate addition to the reconstitution mixture. The extent of reconstitution of sulfite oxidase activity reached its minimum at 10 min and did not decrease further. These data show that optimal reconstitution of sulfite oxidase is achieved when molybdate is added to the reconstitution mixture either at the same time or prior to the addition of sulfite oxidase. It may also be concluded that molybdate is inserted into MPT as soon as the latter is bound to sulfite oxidase, but perhaps because a conformational change of sulfite oxidase after the insertion of MPT, a less than maximal reconstitution with molybdate is achieved when its addition is delayed from time of MPT transfer. After showing that the molybdenum atom is inserted into MPT concomitant with or prior to MPT insertion into sulfite oxidase, it was of further interest to analyze whether time courses of cofactor handoff from MPT synthase to sulfite oxidase differ in the presence and absence of molybdate in the reconstitution mixture. For this purpose, MPT synthase and precursor Z were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in parallel sets with and without the addition of sodium molybdate. After the addition of sulfite oxidase to the reconstitution mixture, the transfer of MPT from MPT synthase to sulfite oxidase was inhibited at different time points by the addition of 200 mmiodoacetamide to convert MPT to its alkylated product, carboxamidomethyl (cam) MPT. Iodoacetamide has been shown to act on MPT bound to MPT synthase in the absence of denaturing agents (5Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cofactor bound to sulfite oxidase, which is buried deeply in the enzyme, remains unaffected by the addition of iodoacetamide. Because carboxamidomethyl (cam) MPT, in contrast to form A, is nonfluorescent, it is possible to convert specifically the MPT bound to sulfite oxidase to form A and thus identify the amount of MPT present in sulfite oxidase without separating it from MPT synthase. As shown in Fig. 9, HPLC analysis revealed that, within experimental error, the time course of MPT transfer to sulfite oxidase was not significantly influenced by the presence of sodium molybdate in the reconstitution mixture. In the presence or absence of sodium molybdate (Fig. 9, A andB), a maximum incorporation of MPT into sulfite oxidase was achieved at ∼10 min after the addition of sulfite oxidase to thein vitro system. These findings are in agreement with the data obtained for the time-dependent reconstitution of sulfite oxidase activity shown in Fig. 4. It can therefore be concluded that molybdate does not affect the kinetics of MPT handoff from MPT synthase to MPT-free sulfite oxidase. In most reconstitution studies on cofactor-containing proteins, the standard procedure is to obtain the apoprotein by a resolution procedure to remove the cofactor and use a source of the cofactor to reconstitute the apoprotein. In the case of sulfite oxidase, this approach is not possible because of the size of the protein, the presence of two prostetic groups, and the extreme instability of released Moco. To obtain Moco-free sulfite oxidase, the cloned gene of human sulfite oxidase was expressed in the Moco deficientmoaA − mutant of E. coli as a His-tagged protein. The purified apoprotein contained stoichiometric amounts of heme, showing that the absence of Moco does not prevent heme binding to the N-terminal domain of sulfite oxidase. The data presented in Fig. 1 also showed that the apoprotein is a dimer just like native sulfite oxidase. The x-ray structure of the highly homologous chicken sulfite oxidase revealed that the sulfite oxidase monomer actually folds into three domains, the N-terminal heme domain, the central domain containing Moco, and the C-terminal domain entirely responsible for the dimeric structure of sulfite oxidase (18Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The fact that the apoprotein of human sulfite oxidase is a dimer demonstrates that, despite the absence of Moco in the central domain, the C-terminal domain folds in the correct manner to generate the dimer interface. The data presented in this paper have shown that the central domain of the apoprotein is sufficiently unfolded to be able to bind MPT and form Moco in vitro. These findings support the conclusion that each of the three domains of sulfite oxidase can attain its folded structure independently of the other two domains. As for a source of the extremely unstable cofactor, the data presented here demonstrate that Moco can be synthesized in vitro by ligation of molybdate to MPT generated de novo from precursor Z and MPT synthase. This was a somewhat surprising observation because genetic and biochemical studies in E. coli have implied the involvement of the MogA and MoeA gene products in cofactor biosynthesis. It has been proposed that molybdenum, which enters the cell as the stable oxyanion molybdate by a high affinity molybdate transport system (19Grunden A.M. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), undergoes some type of modification prior to incorporation into MPT within the cell. For example, a role for the MoeA protein in generating a thiomolybdenum species that might be used in Moco biosynthesis has been suggested (20Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that in vitro, molybdate can be inserted into MPT and reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity without further modification by any other proteins. So far, E. coliMogA has been proposed to act as a molybdochelatase incorporating molybdenum into MPT in vivo (21Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an observation based on the finding that high concentrations of molybdate can partially rescue a mogA mutant. Although MogA binds MPT tightly and a putative binding pocket for MPT has been identified in the crystal structure of E. coli MogA, binding of molybdate could not be demonstrated for MogA to date (22Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Liu M.T.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the MogA protein is not required for in vitro insertion of molybdate into MPT, its function in the cell still remains unclear. It can only be speculated that MogA might act as an MPT carrier or storage protein because MogA has a high affinity for MPT or that MogA might be required for the insertion of molybdate into MPT under low molybdate concentrations, a function not required in vitro with concentrations of sodium molybdate of 5 mm and higher. The data presented above indicate that the in vitroreconstitution of aposulfite oxidase proceeds as shown in Fig.10. As already reported by Pitterleet al. (6Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MPT synthase is required for the conversion of precursor Z to MPT, a reaction that can be carried out in vitro with the purified components. MPT produced in vitro by active MPT synthase remains bound to the system, whereas inactive MPT synthase, lacking the thiocarboxylate at the terminal glycine of the small subunit, is unable to convert precursor Z to MPT but does bind precursor Z tightly. Because MPT synthase was shown to be incapable of binding molybdate or forming Moco, MPT must be released from MPT synthase for the conversion of MPT into Moco. Free MPT has previously been shown to be highly sensitive to aerobic oxidation. Because all reactions for the successful in vitroreconstitution of aposulfite oxidase were performed under aerobic conditions, it would appear that MPT is transferred directly to MPT-free sulfite oxidase so that MPT stays protein bound and is therefore protected from aerobic oxidation. In our system, 50% reconstitution of sulfite oxidase was achieved when molybdate was added to the in vitro reconstitution mixture prior to or at the same time as the addition of sulfite oxidase. After the insertion of MPT into sulfite oxidase, the ability to reconstitute sulfite oxidase activity with added molybdate decreased with time. This might indicate that after MPT is incorporated into sulfite oxidase, the structure of the enzyme changes such that conditions are no longer optimal for insertion of molybdate into sulfite oxidase. Because molybdate is very similar to sulfate, it is possible that molybdate can be bound to the substrate-binding site present in sulfite oxidase, (18Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) which enables the insertion of molybdate into MPT even after a structural change of the enzyme. Even though we could show that the cofactor handoff from MPT synthase to sulfite oxidase is a specific reaction in which the cofactor is released from MPT synthase only after incubation with MPT-free sulfite oxidase, it still remains unclear whether this reaction will occur in the same manner in vivo. In the cell, it is likely that molybdate is inserted into MPT before its incorporation into sulfite oxidase, a reaction that might be carried out by the MogA protein. We could show that MPT synthase is also able to pass MPT to the MogA protein (data not shown) so that in vivo a possible pathway for cofactor handoff might be that MPT synthase interacts with MogA, the molybdenum atom is inserted into MogA-bound MPT, and the molybdenum-containing cofactor is inserted into sulfite oxidase by the MogA protein. Overall, the maximum activation of sulfite oxidase obtained in ourin vitro system corresponded to reconstitution of about 50% of the enzyme molecules with Moco. It is likely that the isolated sulfite oxidase contains improperly folded molecules and only about 50% of enzyme molecules can be reconstituted. This finding is in agreement with the observation that aposulfite oxidase is extremely unstable, and maximum reconstitution of aposulfite oxidase was achieved only with freshly prepared enzyme. In summary, the work presented above describes for the first time thein vitro reconstitution of aposulfite oxidase with MPT and molybdate. Sulfite oxidase deficiency in humans, which can be caused by either a mutation in the gene encoding sulfite oxidase alone or a mutation in one of the genes involved in Moco biosynthesis, results in neurological abnormalities and often leads to death at an early age. It is an autosomal recessive disease and no therapy is known to date. Thein vitro reconstitution of sulfite oxidase, with Moco yielding in an active enzyme, might present a starting point for the reconstitution of sulfite oxidase activity in patients with mutations in the biosynthetic pathway of Moco. A search of completed and incomplete genomes shows that the Moco biosynthestic pathway has widespread phylogenetic existence and is present even in pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori,Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and several others. The roles of molybdoenzymes in these pathogens are unknown, but one possibility is that the ability of molybdoenzymes to hydroxylate or dehydroxylate certain compounds enables these pathogens to detoxify such compounds. Indeed, recently Kozmin et al.(24Kozmin S.G. Pavlov Y.I. Dunn R.L. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that the extreme sensibility of the E. colimutant Δ(uvrB-bio) to 6-hydroxylaminopurine and other base analogs is due to mutations in the Moco biosynthestic pathway. This finding raises the possibility that inhibition of the Moco biosynthetic pathway could provide an avenue for developing bacteriocidal compounds to counter the effects of infection by bacteria including pathogens. The reaction catalyzed by MPT synthase,i.e. the conversion of precursor Z to MPT, is the best defined step in the Moco biosynthetic pathway and, as demonstrated here, can be accomplished in vitro. The present studies have enabled the coupling of the reaction catalyzed by MPT synthase to the activation of aposulfite oxidase, providing an extremely sensitive assay for the activity of MPT synthase. In the future, this procedure should prove valuable for assessing the potential pharmacological usefulness of putative inhibitors of MPT synthase. We thank C. Temple and R.

SHP-1 effects on the antigen receptor reflect its capacity to dephosphorylate this receptor as well as several inhibitory comodulators. In view of our observation that antigen receptor-induced CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation is constitutively increased in B cells from SHP-l-deficient motheaten mice, we investigated the possibility that CD19, a positive modulator of antigen receptor signaling, represents another substrate for SHP-1. However, analysis of CD19 coimmunoprecipitable tyrosine phosphatase activity in CD19 immunoprecipitates from SHP-1-deficient and wild-type B cells revealed that SHP-1 accounts for only a minor portion of CD19-associated tyrosine phosphatase activity. As CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation is modulated by the Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase, Lyn activity was evaluated in wild-type and motheaten B cells. The results revealed both Lyn as well as CD19-associated Lyn kinase activity to be constitutively and inducibly increased in SHP-1-deficient compared with wild-type B cells. The data also demonstrated SHP-1 to be associated with Lyn in stimulated but not in resting B cells and indicated this interaction to be mediated via Lyn binding to the SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain. These findings, together with cyanogen bromide cleavage data revealing that SHP-1 dephosphorylates the Lyn autophosphorylation site, identify Lyn deactivation/dephosphorylation as a likely mechanism whereby SHP-1 exerts its influence on CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation and, by extension, its inhibitory effect on B cell antigen receptor signaling.

The signals transmitted consequent to antigen engagement drive B lymphocyte activation via a complex signaling network, which biochemically links the receptor complex to cellular responses such as to proliferation, differentiation, and antibody secretion. Transmission of BCR signals via this intracellular circuitry is further regulated by the integration of accessory signals from BCR comodulators (3Campbell K.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and is highly dependent on reversible protein-tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the balanced activities of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs) (4Tedder T.F. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Siminovitch K.A. Neel B.J. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The initial events of BCR signal relay are characterized by the activation of several PTKs, including Lyn, Fyn, Blk, Syk, and Btk, and the subsequent recruitment of secondary signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Shc, BLNK/SLP-65, Vav, SOS1, and phospholipase Cγ (6De Franco A.L.

These initial interactions induce Ras activation, phosphoinositide turnover, increases in intracellular free calcium, and other intermediary events, which ultimately transduce the BCR-evoked signal to the nucleus and consequent proliferation, apoptosis, maturation, or other physiological responses. The mechanisms whereby BCR ligation can induce such a wide diversity of biological outcomes are not well understood but are likely to involve modulation of the BCR signaling pathway by a spectrum of transmembrane and cytosolic signaling effectors that qualitatively and/or quantitatively alter the relay and downstream interpretation of BCR signal (13Smith K.G.C. Fearon D.T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 195-212PubMed Google Scholar). Among the myriad of proteins implicated in the regulation of BCR signaling, the cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-1 is distinguished by its predominant role as an inhibitor of BCR-driven activation events (5Siminovitch K.A. Neel B.J. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of SHP-1 on BCR signaling was initially revealed by the demonstration that BCR-evoked proliferation of mature B cells and clonal deletion of self-reactive B cell precursors are aberrantly increased in the context of SHP-1 deficiency (14Pani G. Kozlowski M. Cambier J.C. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These latter studies involved analysis of B cells from motheaten (me/me) and viable motheaten(me v /me v )mice, animals in which expression of no SHP-1 or a catalytically inactive form of SHP-1 protein, respectively, is associated with increased levels of serum immunoglobulins, high autoantibody titer, and a marked expansion of CD5+ B-1 cells in the periphery (16Kozlowski M.

Immunol. 1987; 5: 367-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). At present, the biochemical basis whereby SHP-1 exerts its inhibitory effects on BCR-evoked responses is not entirely defined. This PTP has, however, been shown to interact with the BCR complex in resting B cells and likely acts in this context to maintain the receptor in a tyrosine-dephosphorylated state (14Pani G. Kozlowski M. Cambier J.C. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Following BCR ligation, SHP-1 no longer associates with the BCR, but instead interacts with a number of BCR-inducible tyrosine-phosphoryated transmembrane coreceptors (18Doody G.M. Justement L.B.

These coreceptors, which include CD22, PIR-B, and CD72, have all been implicated in the down-regulation of BCR signaling (21O'Keefe T.L. Williams G.T. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S.

The inhibitory effects of these receptors depend on their binding to SHP-1 and appear to be realized via SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the receptor cytosolic domains and/or other intracellular signaling effectors recruited to these receptors following BCR engagement. In contrast to the ITIM-containing coreceptor molecules, a number of B cell transmembrane coreceptors modulate BCR signaling so as to amplify the signal and promote its downstream propagation. Among these positive modulatory receptors, the B lineage-specific CD19 molecule appears to play a central role in enhancing BCR coupling to a spectrum of cellular behaviors. CD19, which is expressed as a component of a multimeric complex on the B cell surface (24Bradbury L. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar), becomes rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated following BCR engagement (25Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently interacts with SH2 domain-containing signaling effectors, such as Lyn, Fyn, Syk, Vav, and PI3K, which play integral roles in BCR signal delivery (25Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26van Noesel C.J.M.

Recent data suggest that CD19 effects on BCR signaling reflect its capacity to not only interact with Src-family PTKs but also to amplify the activities of these enzymes (29Fujimoto M. Poe J.C. Jansen P.J. Sato S.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7088-7094PubMed Google Scholar). As is consistent with the positive role for CD19 in regulation of BCR signaling, mice, which overexpress CD19 consequent to the expression of a CD19 transgene, manifest augmented B cell proliferative responses to BCR cross-linking and show markedly increased serum immunoglobulin levels (30Engel P. Zhou L.-J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These animals also display a dramatic increase in the numbers of B-1 lineage cells and a proportionate decrease in the numbers of conventional B cells within the periphery (31Sato S. Ono N. Steeber D.A. Pisetsky D.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4371-4378PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, therefore, reveal the phenotype engendered by CD19 overexpression to be very similar to the B cell phenotype conferred by SHP-1 deficiency, a finding that suggests that the influence of these respective proteins on BCR signaling thresholds reflects the modulation of a common signaling element or cascade. This hypothesis is further supported by our previous data revealing BCR-evoked CD19 phosphorylation to be markedly reduced in cells lacking both the CD45 and SHP-1 PTPs (32Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Paige C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and thus identifying CD19 as a possible target of SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation. In the current study, we have directly investigated the role for SHP-1 in modulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19. The results of these studies confirm that BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 is enhanced in SHP-1-deficient mice but also suggest that the contribution of SHP-1 to the direct dephosphorylation of CD19 is small. Because of these observations, as well as data revealing CD19 to be associated with the Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase following BCR engagement (25Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B.

Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.V. van Lier R.A.W. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and identifying a central role for Lyn in modifying CD19 effects on B cell survival (33Uckun F.M. Evans W.E. Waddick K.G.

A. 1995; 92: 9575-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we next investigated the possibility that SHP-1 influence on CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated via the regulation of Lyn activity. The results of this analysis indicate both BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase to be markedly augmented in me/me andme v /me v compared with wild-type B cells. In addition, Lyn inducibly associates with the SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain and is dephosphorylated at its autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397) by incubation with SHP-1. These data identify Lyn as a substrate for SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation/deactivation and suggest that SHP-1 inhibitory effects on Lyn activity contribute to the down-regulation of CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation and may thereby provide an important mechanism for disrupting CD19 interactions with downstream effectors involved in the relay and amplification of BCR-initiated activation signal. Antibodies used for these studies included the following: PE-conjugated B220 antibody from PharMingen (Mississauga, Ontario), rabbit polyclonal anti-Lyn antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgM antibody from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Rat anti-mouse CD19 antibody was produced by the 1D3 hybridoma (provided by Dr. D. Fearon, University of Cambridge School of Medicine, Cambridge, UK) (35Krop I. de Fougerolles A.R. Hardy R.R. Allison M. Schlissel M.S. Fearon D.T. Eur. J.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP-1 antibody and monoclonal anti-Thy1.2 antibody from the hybridoma clone J1j.10 (ATCCT1B184) were produced in our laboratory as described previously (14Pani G. Kozlowski M.

Low-Tox rabbit complement was purchased from Cedarlane (Hornby, ONT), and chemicals used for immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Single cell suspensions of splenocytes were obtained from 10- to 14-day-old C3HeBFeJ-melme(motheaten), C57BL6-me v /me v (viable motheaten), and congenic wild-type (+/+) mice derived at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute breeding facility by mating C3HeBFeJ-me/+ and +/+ and C57BL/6J-me v /+ and +/+ breeding pairs. Purified populations of splenic B lymphocytes were obtained fromme/me,me v /me v, and wild-type congenic mice by subjecting splenic cell suspensions to erythrocyte lysis in 0.8% ammonium chloride, followed by treatment with anti-Thy1.2 antibody for 30 min on ice and a subsequent 45-min incubation with a 1:15 dilution of rabbit complement (Serotec Ltd., Toronto, Ontario). The cells were then washed and layered over a Percoll gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Province of Quebec) as described previously (14Pani G. Kozlowski M. Cambier J.C. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The resulting cells were >90% mIg and B220 positive as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA) analysis. The CD5+ murine B lymphoma line (36Arnold L.W. La Cascio N.J. Lutz P.M. Pennell C.A. Klapper D. Haughton G. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2064-2268PubMed Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. A. Kaushik, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario) and the WEHI-231 B lymphoma line (purchased from ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sterile System Inc., Logan, UT), 50 μm 2-β mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. WEHI-231, CH12, or purified splenic B cells (2–5 × 107) were resuspended in 5 ml of culture medium and stimulated with 40 μg/ml F(ab′)2antibody for varying periods of time. Stimulations were done on ice to retard biochemical reactions when studying the kinetics of CD19 phosphorylation and Lyn kinase activation (37Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For biotinylation, 5–6 × 107 cells/ml were suspended at 107cells/ml in ice-cold PBS and mixed with 0.3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-Biotin solution (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). After 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by 5-min incubation with 50 mg/ml glycine in PBS. Cells were than washed twice in cold PBS and subjected to stimulation as above. Following stimulation, biotinylated or nonbiotinylated cells were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mmZnCl2, 50 μm o-phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) containing either 1% CHAPS (Sigma) or 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were then determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Anti-Lyn or anti-IgG (isotype control) antibody was incubated at 4 °C overnight under rocking conditions with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS (about 10 μg of antibody per 10 μl of beads). Beads were then washed two times in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.6) and two times in 0.2 m tri-ethanolamine (pH 8.2). Beads were then resuspended in 0.2 m tri-ethanolamine solution containing 40 mm dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (Pierce) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with continual rocking. The antibody-coupled beads were washed two times in 200 mm ethanolamine (pH 8.2), two times in 0.1m sodium borate (pH 8.0), two times in PBS, and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.2% NaN3. Lysates were precleared before immunoprecipitation by incubating 1 mg of cell lysate with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h and for an additional 1 h with 40 μl of rabbit preimmune serum. Lysates were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody (anti-Lyn, anti-IgG isotype control) and 25 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were then collected by centrifugation, washed four times in lysis buffer, and boiled for 5 min in reducing SDS-gel sample buffer. Samples were then electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario). After 1-h incubation in 3% gelatin, the filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-CD19, anti-Lyn, or anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, ICN) or, for analysis of biotinylated cells, with horseradish peroxidase-avidin (Pierce). Immune complexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stripping and reprobing of the blots were performed according to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech's recommended protocol. For analysis of CD19-associated phosphatase activity, anti-CD19 immunoprecipitates were prepared (as described above) from 1 mg of lysates of unstimulated or anti-IgM antibody-stimulated motheaten and wild-type B cells. Phosphatase assays were also performed on anti-CD19 and anti-IgG (control) immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates of wild-type splenic B cells immunodepleted of SHP-1 by overnight incubation with an excess of anti-SHP-1 antibody followed by addition of 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose. For this experiment, the complete immunodepletion of SHP-1 protein was confirmed by Western immunoblotting analysis (data not shown). The amount of SHP-1 antibody utilized to completely immunodeplete SHP-1 protein from lysates was predetermines by titration and Western immunoblotting analysis (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in phosphatase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.34) and then incubated for 12 h at 37 °C overnight in phosphatase buffer containing 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Under these conditions, SHP-1 activity for the substrate has been shown previously to increase linearly with the amount of SHP-1 used in the reaction (38Kon-Kozlowski M. Pani G. Pawson T. Siminovitch K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.2 n NaOH, and absorbance was measured at 410 nm by spectrophotometry. Lyn kinase activity was evaluated using immunoprecipitates prepared as described above from unstimulated and stimulated splenic B cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.25 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm2-β-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) with or without 10 μg of GST-Igα/β fusion protein (provided by Dr. Y. Wu, Toronto, Ontario). Samples were resuspended in SDS-gel sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 10 min and resolved over 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The32P-labeled proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and then visualized by autoradiography. Lyn quantification was performed by anti-Lyn immunoblotting of the membranes using ECL. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-SHP-1 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the following murine cDNA or polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments into pGEX2T: the full-length SHP-1 cDNA (GST-SHP-1), a full-length SHP-1 cDNA containing a Cys-453 → Ser mutation (GST-SHP-1 (C453S)), the SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 1–95), the SHP-1 C-terminal SH2 domain (amino acids 110–205), and the SHP-1 N- and C-terminal SH2 domains (amino acids 1–221). These expression plasmids were transfected intoEscherichia coli JM101, and the fusion proteins were purified from isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacteria using glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equimolar amounts of each GST-SHP-1 fusion protein and GST-beads were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.9 μg of in vitro 32P-labeled purified Lyn protein. Beads were washed seven times, and the complexes were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, boiled, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the Lyn protein was visualized by autoradiography. In vitro[γ-32P]ATP-labeled Lyn was immunoprecipitated using anti-Lyn antibody and incubated at 37 °C with equal amounts of either GST-SHP-1 or GST-SHP-1 (C453S) protein in 200 μl of phosphatase buffer (10 mm Tris-HC1, 1.0 mmEDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.34). The immune complexes were then resolved over SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The 56-kDa Lyn-containing bands were then excised from the membranes and subjected to CNBr cleavage as described previously (40Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The excised Lyn protein was incubated with 60 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid for at least 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed and dried, and the CNBr-generated peptide fragments were resuspended in tricine SDS sample buffer, resolved by separation on 10–20% gradient Tricine SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA), transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. Complete digestion of each sample was confirmed by the absence of higher molecular weight32P-labeled bands, and the CNBr fragments were quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Previous data from our laboratory and others have revealed modulation of inhibitory coreceptors to represent a major mechanism whereby SHP-1 mediates its down-regulatory effects on BCR signaling (5Siminovitch K.A.

However, data garnered from the analysis of mice deficient for both the CD45 and SHP-1 PTPs (31Sato S. Ono N. Steeber D.A. Pisetsky D.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4371-4378PubMed Google Scholar) raised the possibility that SHP-1 also influences the tyrosine phosphorylation and, by extension, signaling functions of the positive regulatory coreceptor, CD19. To begin addressing this issue, SHP-1-deficient B cells from me/me andme v /me v mice were evaluated with regards to the kinetics of CD19 phosphorylation following BCR ligation. As illustrated in Fig.1, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis of CD19 immunoprecipitates from the SHP-1-deficient cells revealed tyrosine phosphorylation of the 115- to 120-kDa species representing CD19 to be markedly increased both constitutively and inducibly in the me v/me vand to a lesser extent in the me/me cells compared with wild-type cells. The increased phosphorylation of CD19 detected in the motheaten cells cannot be attributed to expansion of the CD5+ B-1 cell population in these mice, because CD5+ CH12 cells exhibited normal levels of CD19 phosphorylation both before and after BCR cross-linking (data not shown). These data support the contention that SHP-1 modulates CD19 tyrosine phosphor"

https://openalex.org/W2019555858,"Enzyme IIAGlucose(IIAGlc) is a signal-transducing protein in the phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli. Structural studies of free IIAGlc and the HPr-IIAGlc complex have shown that IIAGlccomprises a globular β-sheet sandwich core (residues 19–168) and a disordered N-terminal tail (residues 1–18). Although the presence of the N-terminal tail is not required for IIAGlc to accept a phosphorus from the histidine phosphocarrier protein HPr, its presence is essential for effective phosphotransfer from IIAGlc to the membrane-bound IIBCGlc. The sequence of the N-terminal tail suggests that it has the potential to form an amphipathic helix. Using CD, we demonstrate that a peptide, corresponding to the N-terminal 18 residues of IIAGlc, adopts a helical conformation in the presence of either the anionic lipid phosphatidylglycerol or a mixture of anionic E. coli lipids phosphatidylglycerol (25%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (75%). The peptide, however, is in a random coil state in the presence of the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine, indicating that electrostatic interactions play a role in the binding of the lipid to the peptide. In addition, we show that intact IIAGlc also interacts with anionic lipids, resulting in an increase in helicity, which can be directly attributed to the N-terminal segment. From these data we propose that IIAGlc comprises two functional domains: a folded domain containing the active site and capable of weakly interacting with the peripheral IIB domain of the membrane protein IIBCGlc; and the N-terminal tail, which interacts with the negatively charged E. coli membrane, thereby stabilizing the complex of IIAGlc with IIBCGlc. This stabilization is essential for the final step of the phosphoryl transfer cascade in the glucose transport pathway.

Glucose transport via the PTS initiates from phosphoenolpyruvate, which auto-phosphorylates enzyme I. Enzyme I transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein, HPr, which in turn donates a phosphoryl group to IIAGlc. Subsequently, IIAGlc transfers the phosphoryl group to the solvent-exposed IIB domain of the membrane protein (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the PTS, IIAGlc also modulates the activity of a number of other proteins, depending on its phosphorylation state. Although dephosphorylated IIAGlc is a negative regulator of glycerol kinase (2Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and various non-PTS permeases (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar), phosphorylated IIAGlc is a positive regulator of adenylyl cyclase activity (3Peterkofsky A. Reizer A. Reizer J. Gollop N. Zhu P.-P. Amin N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Structural studies on phospho- and dephospho-IIAGlc by both x-ray crystallography (4Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Liao D.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5215-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that the protein is composed of a globular core (residues 19–168) comprising a predominantly β-sheet sandwich and an unstructured N terminus (residues 1–18), which is invisible in electron density maps and highly mobile in solution. Recently, we determined the solution structure of the intact IIAGlc-HPr complex by multidimensional NMR (8Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal 18 residues remain disordered. Further, chemical shift mapping has shown that the N-terminal 18 residues are unperturbed upon binding of IIAGlc to the isolated IIB domain of IIBCGlc(9Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and our current structural studies on the IIAGlc-IIB complex indicate that the N-terminal segment of IIAGlcremains unstructured and is not involved in this protein complex. 2Unpublished data.2Unpublished data. Biochemical studies, on the other hand, have shown that whereas the presence of an intact N-terminal segment of IIAGlc is not necessary for the transfer of phosphorus from HPr to IIAGlc it is absolutely required for effective phosphoryl donation from IIAGlc to IIBCGlc (10Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural and functional role of the N-terminal portion of IIAGlc, however, has not been elucidated. In this communication, we show that intact IIAGlc and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 18 N-terminal residues of IIAGlc interact with anionic phospholipids found in the membrane of E. coli, promoting the formation of an amphipathic helix. Based on these data, we propose a two-state model for IIAGlc and discuss the significance of our observations in the context of sugar transport and the PTS in E. coli.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzyme IIAGlc from E. coli was expressed and purified as described (11Wang G. Sondej M. Garrett D.S. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16401-16403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and quantified by UV spectroscopy at 257 nm. The N-terminal 18-residue peptide of IIAGlc was synthesized by solid phase methods with the C-terminal end amidated and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc.). The peptide was greater than 99% pure as judged by mass spectrometry and amino acid compositional analysis. Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) purified from E. coli membranes, and dioleolylphosphatidylcholine (dioleolyl-PC) were purchased from Sigma and were ≥ 98% pure. Vesicles were made by sonication of lipids in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, as reported elsewhere (12Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.-W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).CD spectra were collected at 22 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (calibrated using 0.06%d-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 nm) from 190 to 250 nm using a 2-mm path length cell, with a scan rate of 2 nm/min, a time constant of 0.5 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a sensitivity of 20 millidegrees. Each spectrum is the average of 10 scans. After smoothing and background subtraction, the spectrum was expressed in molar ellipticity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 18 residues of E. coli IIAGlc is Met-Gly-Leu-Phe-Asp-Lys-Leu-Lys-Ser-Leu-Val-Ser-Asp-Asp-Lys-Lys-Asp-Thr. According to the convention adopted for E. coliIIAGlc in the literature (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the N-terminal methionine, which can be hydrolyzed, is numbered as zero. An interesting feature of this sequence is the periodical occurrence of hydrophobic (italicized) and hydrophilic amino acid residues. Such periodicity, previously reported in human apolipoproteins (13McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1977; 267: 465-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is correlated with the potential to form an amphipathic helix. When the sequence is represented on a helical wheel projection (Fig. 1), it is apparent that there is a cluster of hydrophobic residues on one side of the wheel (Leu2, Phe3, Leu6, Leu9, and Val10) and a cluster of hydrophilic residues on the other (Asp4, Ser8, Ser11, and Asp12). Located at the boundary of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces are two lysine residues (Lys5 and Lys7). Such features are reminiscent of the class A amphipathic helix in apolipoproteins (14Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because apolipoproteins bind lipids, we reasoned that the N-terminal sequence of IIAGlc may interact with lipids in the E. coli membrane.To test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction of a synthetic peptide comprising the N-terminal 18 amino acid residues of IIAGlc (referred to as Pep18) with a variety of phospholipid vesicles. Fig. 2 apresents the CD spectra of Pep18 in the presence or absence of anionic lipids. In the absence of lipid (green), there is a strong negative band at 198–200 nm, indicative of a random coil (15Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), consistent with its disordered structure in intact IIAGlc(4Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Liao D. Herzberg O.

In the presence of the anionic lipid PG (red), however, there is a dramatic change in the CD spectrum of Pep18, which displays double minima at ∼208 and ∼222 nm, characteristic of an α-helix (12Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.-W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Holzwarth G.M. Doty P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The helicity was estimated to be ∼50% based on 222-nm band analysis (17Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Pownall H.J. Gotto Jr., A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the helical wheel projection shown in Fig. 1, this suggests that the helical segment comprises residues 2–10. In contrast, essentially no change was seen in the CD spectrum of Pep18 upon addition of the zwitterionic lipid dioleolyl-PC under the same conditions (data not shown). The observation that Pep18 interacts with an anionic but not zwitterionic lipid indicates that electrostatic interactions between the anionic lipid head groups and cationic lysine side chains of Pep18 play a significant role in α-helix stabilization (12Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.-W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Wang G. Treleaven W.D. Cushley R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

In this regard, it is noteworthy that the predominant lipids in the membrane ofE. coli are anionic, comprising ∼25% PG and ∼75% PE (20Kadner R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 58-87Google Scholar). Indeed, Pep18 also forms an α-helix in a 1:3 PG:PE mixture (Fig. 2 a, black) with near identical helicity to that observed with PG alone.Figure 2CD spectra of (a) 52 μm Pep18 and (b) 13 μmIIAGlc in the presence and absence of 2 mm PG, pH 7, and 22 °C are shown. The difference CD spectrum of IIAGlc in the presence and absence of PG is shown inc. Pep18 is a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 18 residues of IIAGlc (see Fig. 1). Ina, green and red lines represent the CD spectra of Pep18 in phosphate buffer alone and in the presence of the anionic lipid PG, respectively. The black line is the CD spectrum of Pep18 in a mixture of the anionic E. coli lipids PG (25%) and PE (75%) (w/w) (total lipid concentration, 2 mm). In b, the black and red lines are the spectra of IIAGlc in the absence and presence of PG, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The interaction of intact IIAGlc with PG was also investigated. The CD spectrum of IIAGlc in phosphate buffer has a negative band at ∼218 nm with shoulders at ∼210 and ∼224 nm (Fig. 2 b, black), consistent with the known secondary structure of IIAGlc, which comprises predominantly β-strands with a few short helices (4Worthylake D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the presence of PG, the CD spectrum of IIAGlc became more negative with double minima at ∼208 and ∼222 nm (Fig. 2 b, red), indicating α-helix formation. The difference in the CD spectra of IIAGlc in the presence and absence of PG (Fig. 2 c) resembles the CD spectrum of Pep18 in the presence of PG (Fig. 2 a, red) and can therefore be attributed to the conformational change of only the N-terminal segment of the protein. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that the migration of IIAGlcin a nondenaturing gel is only slightly different in the presence or absence of PG, indicating that the overall shape of IIAGlcremains essentially unaltered, and no global conformational change has taken place. Moreover, because the CD spectrum of IIAGlc in the presence of PG is given by approximately the sum of the spectra of IIAGlc without PG and Pep18 with PG, the amphipathic helical domain and the folded domain of IIAGlc are independent of each other. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the N-terminal segment of IIAGlc is capable of binding to a negatively charged E. coli membrane surface.The binding of the N-terminal segment of IIAGlc to anionic phospholipids present in the membrane of E. coli suggests a two-state model for the structure of IIAGlc (Fig. 3). In the cytosol, IIAGlc is composed of the previously described globular core (residues 19–168,blue rectangle) and a disordered N terminus (residues 1–18,green tail) (4Worthylake D. Meadow N.D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the second state, the N-terminal tail of IIAGlc (residues 2–10) assumes a helical conformation (red) upon binding to the E. coli membrane via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, whereas the folded core domain interacts with the peripheral IIB domain of the membrane protein IIBCGlc. Residues Asp13-Lys14-Lys15-Asp16-Thr17-Gly18act as a linker between the two domains in the membrane-associated form of IIAGlc. The proposed model provides a biological role for the amphipathic helical domain of cytoplasmic IIAGlc. We suggest that effective phosphoryl transfer from IIAGlcto IIBCGlc requires the formation of a stable complex between the two proteins; the combination of the interaction of the folded domain (residues 19–168) with the IIB domain of IIBCGlc and the helical domain (residues 2–10) with the membrane achieve this stability.Figure 3A two-state model for the functional role of the N-terminal domain of E. coliIIAGlc. The folded core domain of IIAGlc (residues 19–168) is represented by the blue box. The disordered and helical states of the N-terminal segment (residues 1–18) of IIAGlc are colored in greenand red, respectively. Phosphoryl transfer involves formation of protein-protein complexes via contact between active sites (8Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) as depicted here for IIAGlc-IIBCGlc. Attachment of IIAGlc to the E. coli membrane surface stabilizes the complex and consequently enhances its ability to donate the phosphoryl group to the IIB domain (circle), which is also on the membrane surface and covalently linked to the transmembrane domain IIC (rectangle).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was previously shown that IIAGlc could be cleaved at Lys7 by a membrane protease (21Meadow N.D. Coyle P. Komoryia A. Anfinsen C.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13504-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the membrane association of the N-terminal domain of IIAGlc. The clipped IIAGlc (referred to as the “fast” form on account of its behavior during gel electrophoresis) has the same structured domain and ability to accept a phosphoryl group from HPr as does full-length IIAGlc (known as the “slow” form) (6Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Wong C.Y. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3479-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13504-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fast form of IIAGlc is only 2–3% as active as the slow form in donating a phosphoryl group to the membrane protein IIBCGlc (10Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the present data, we suggest that removal of the first seven N-terminal residues of IIAGlc disrupts the amphipathic helix, making it a very poor membrane anchor.Interestingly, IIAGlc of Mycoplasma capricolumis cytoplasmic and contains a similar short N-terminal sequence, Met-Trp-Phe-Phe-Asn-Lys-Asn, which is rich in aromatic residues (italicized). Because aromatic residues can also play an important role in lipid binding (22Wang G. Pierens G.K. Treleaven W.D. Sparrow J.T. Cushley R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10358-10366Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we propose that this segment of M. capricolum IIAGlc has a similar membrane-anchoring role. Indeed, the N-terminal segment of M. capricolum IIAGlc adopts an L-shaped structure (with the Trp sidechain disordered) in the crystal structure (23Huang K. Kapadia G. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Herzberg O. Structure. 1998; 6: 697-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which may be relevant for membrane binding as depicted in Fig. 3 for E. coli IIAGlc. The difference in amino acid sequence, composition, and structure between the N-terminal membrane anchors ofE. coli and M. capricolum IIAGlc may reflect the lipid composition of the respective membranes. For example, cholesterol is one of the major lipid components of the membrane ofM. capricolum (24Rottem S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 604: 65-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because the C terminus of IIAGlc is adjacent to the N terminus with both ends being some 30 Å away from the active site (see Fig. 3 and Refs. 4Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Liao D. Herzberg O. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10382-10386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Feese M.D. Comolli L. Meadow N.D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the two positively charged residues at the C terminus (Lys167 and Lys168) of IIAGlc may also participate in electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged E. coli membrane, further stabilizing the membrane-bound state (Fig. 3). Indeed, C-terminal truncation or mutation of the C-terminal basic residue to an acidic residue in the β-glucoside permease from E. coli results in a 10-fold decrease in the catalytic rate of phosphoryl transfer (25Schnetz K. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Rak B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13464-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The domain structure of the E. coli glucose transport system is IIAGlc + IIBCGlc, whereas that of some other sugar transport systems, for example that of mannitol, is IIABC, where all the domains are covalently linked and membrane-bound (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar). Hence, those covalently linked IIAs are efficient phosphocarriers but are not available for other functions. The two states of IIAGlcallow it to play multiple roles; it is a phosphocarrier in the PTS, as well as a regulator of a variety of other metabolic systems. The anchor function for the N-terminal helical domain defined here permits IIAGlc to overcome the inherent defect in phosphotransfer capacity associated with its free-floating presence in the cytoplasm. The signal-transducing protein IIAGlucose(IIAGlc)1 is an integral component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) in Escherichia coli. Glucose transport via the PTS initiates from phosphoenolpyruvate, which auto-phosphorylates enzyme I. Enzyme I transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein, HPr, which in turn donates a phosphoryl group to IIAGlc. Subsequently, IIAGlc transfers the phosphoryl group to the solvent-exposed IIB domain of the membrane protein (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the PTS, IIAGlc also modulates the activity of a number of other proteins, depending on its phosphorylation state. Although dephosphorylated IIAGlc is a negative regulator of glycerol kinase (2Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and various non-PTS permeases (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar), phosphorylated IIAGlc is a positive regulator of adenylyl cyclase activity (3Peterkofsky A. Reizer A. Reizer J. Gollop N. Zhu P.-P. Amin N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Structural studies on phospho- and dephospho-IIAGlc by both x-ray crystallography (4Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Liao D.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5215-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that the protein is composed of a globular core (residues 19–168) comprising a predominantly β-sheet sandwich and an unstructured N terminus (residues 1–18), which is invisible in electron density maps and highly mobile in solution. Recently, we determined the solution structure of the intact IIAGlc-HPr complex by multidimensional NMR (8Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal 18 residues remain disordered. Further, chemical shift mapping has shown that the N-terminal 18 residues are unperturbed upon binding of IIAGlc to the isolated IIB domain of IIBCGlc(9Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and our current structural studies on the IIAGlc-IIB complex indicate that the N-terminal segment of IIAGlcremains unstructured and is not involved in this protein complex. 2Unpublished data.2Unpublished data. Biochemical studies, on the other hand, have shown that whereas the presence of an intact N-terminal segment of IIAGlc is not necessary for the transfer of phosphorus from HPr to IIAGlc it is absolutely required for effective phosphoryl donation from IIAGlc to IIBCGlc (10Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural and functional role of the N-terminal portion of IIAGlc, however, has not been elucidated."

Odorant receptors have distinct but overlapping affinities for odorants and exhibit a semi-organized pattern of expression in the convoluted topography of the olfactory epithelium (4Mombaerts P.

These features of the sensory apparatus suggest that the initial encoding of odorant features is combinatorial, integrating spatio-temporal differences in receptor activation throughout the epithelium as well as differences in odorant concentration (6Duchamp-Viret P.

Although each of the perhaps ∼1000 individual odorant receptors has unique specificity for ligand binding, most if not all olfactory signaling is mediated through cAMP (7Pace U. Hanski E. Salomon Y.

Odorant receptor activation increases intracellular cAMP via an interaction with Golfor Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation. This leads to opening of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG)1 ion channel, membrane depolarization, and the generation of action potentials (11Nakamura T. Gold G.H. Nature. 1987; 325: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In support of this model, disruption of the genes for Golf(12Belluscio L. Gold G.H. Nemes A.

Furthermore, AC3 mutant mice fail several odorant-based behavioral tests indicating that adenylyl cyclase and cAMP signaling are critical for olfactory-dependent behavior. Activation of the CNG ion channel in OSNs causes a depolarization and a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ (15Zufall F. Shepherd G.M. Firestein S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1991; 246: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Frings S. Benz S. Lindeman B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Leinders Zufall T.

This Ca2+ signal, to the opposing effect, can lead to activation of Ca2+/CaM-activated phosphodiesterase PDE1C2 (18Borisy F.F. Ronnett G.V. Cunningham A.M. Juilfs D. Beavo J. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) which phosphorylates and inhibits AC3 (19Wayman G.A. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

This idea is supported by data showing that treatment of olfactory sensory neurons with CaMKII inhibitors impairs odor adaptation (22Leinders-Zufall T. Ma M. Zufall F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other kinases that contribute to modulation and desensitization of olfactory signaling include GRK-3 (23Dawson T.M. Arriza J.L. Jaworsky D.E.

Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus rapid activation and inactivation of the cAMP signal are at the core of a system developed for transient signaling to the olfactory bulb and higher CNS where olfactory memories are thought to be stored. There are several reports of sensitization of peripheral sensory neurons to odorants at the step of primary detection. By using Pacific Coho salmon, we demonstrated a preference for phenylethyl alcohol in salmon that had been imprinted with the odorant as juveniles, and we found that guanylyl cyclase activity in olfactory cilia isolated from them was enhanced specifically in response to phenylethyl alcohol 2 years after exposure to the odorant (26Dittman A.H. Quinn T.P. Nevitt G.A. Hacker B. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1997; 19: 381-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice chronically exposed to specific odorants develop an enhanced EOG signal in response to these odorants (27Wang H.W. Wysocki C.J. Gold G.H. Science. 1993; 260: 998-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cultured rat OSNs also show an enhanced cAMP signal in response to the second of two odorant exposures (28Ronnett G.V. Parfitt D.J. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2366-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These reports suggest the interesting possibility that olfactory sensory neurons may exhibit some form of cellular memory, and they are not simply conduits for transfer of olfactory information to the olfactory bulb. Because of the well established role of the ERK/MAP kinase regulatory system and CRE-mediated transcription for neuroplasticity in the CNS (for general reviews see Refs. 29Tully T. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Silva A.J. Kogan J.H. Frankland P.W. Kida S Annu. Rev.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), we carried out experiments to determine whether exposure to odorants activates these pathways using cultured OSNs and a CRE/LacZ transgenic reporter mouse strain (32Impey S.

Wade C. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We report the discovery of an unexpected signaling pathway intrinsic to odorant stimulation of mammalian OSNs, providing evidence that this sensory tissue may exhibit neuroplasticity akin to that of CNS neurons. Our data indicate that a brief exposure to odorants activates ERK/MAP kinase signaling and initiates CRE-mediated gene transcription. Cultures of primary OSNs were prepared as described by Ronnett et al. (28Ronnett G.V. Parfitt D.J. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2366-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with modifications. In brief, olfactory turbinates from 20 to 30 rat pups at 1–2 days of age were removed by dissection, minced, and subjected to mild enzymatic digestion with rocking at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the tissue was passed through nylon filters of sequentially smaller pore size (250, 50, and 10 μm), and cells were plated at an approximate density of 10 (10) cells/ml on 12-well tissue culture plates that had been coated with 25 ng/ml mouse laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated and maintained in minimum essential medium containing d-valine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% NuSerum (Becton Dickinson), and 10 μm Ara-C (Sigma). Experiments were typically performed at day 5 in vitro to allow non-neuronal cells to be selected from the culture. Cells were cultured as described above but were plated on glass coverslips coated with 25 ng/ml mouse laminin. One hour prior to stimulation, the culture medium was replaced with pre-warmed serum/growth factor-free minimum essential medium, d-valine supplemented with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 (MEM-H). Cells were stimulated with either 5 μmforskolin or 15 μm odorant (citralva, isoamyl acetate, or ethyl vanillin) for 4 min, immediately after which cells were fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde. Immunodetection of phospho-ERK I/II was performed using standard procedures with a rabbit anti-phospho-ERK I/II antibody (New England Biolabs) at 1:500 dilution and a Texas Red mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals) at 1:500 dilution. Images were captured on a Bio-Rad MRC laser scanning confocal microscope. Neurons were cultured and plated on 12-well tissue culture plates as described above. After 1 h in minimum essential medium, d-valine/Hepes, neurons were stimulated with the indicated odorant at 15 or 20 μmA23187. Inhibitors (U0126 and KN-62) were used at 10 μm for 1 h prior to stimulation. After odorant stimulation for the indicated times, cells were harvested in sample buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 6.9, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.04% bromphenol blue), and extracts were boiled for 10 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked in 10% milk in PBST. Membranes were incubated with antibodies to the phosphorylated and activated forms of Raf, MEK, ERK I/II, p90 rsk , and CREB (New England Biolabs), each at 1:1000 dilution, and an antibody to ERK I/II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 to control for protein loading. EOG recordings were performed as described previously (14Brunet L.J. Gold G.H. Ngai J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), with minor changes. In brief, mice 14–16 weeks old were sacrificed by decapitation, and heads were bisected through the septum. Septal cartilage was peeled away to expose the apical surface of the olfactory turbinates, from which recordings were taken using an agar- and saline-filled glass microelectrode. The EOG, basal potential minus apical potential, was taken in the open circuit configuration, whereas odorants were applied to the epithelia in 1-s puffs interspersed with a continuous stream of moisturized oxygen. Traces were captured and digitized using a Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments) connected to a PC computer, low pass filtered at 30 Hz, and sampled at 125 Hz. Inhibition of MEK was performed by removing the skin, brain, and other superfluous tissue from the bisected heads and incubating them for 90 min in oxygenated MEM-H containing either 50 mm U0126 or Me2SO vehicle. CRE/LacZ transgenic mice of age 14–16 weeks were placed individually into a behavior chamber fitted with an odorant delivery nozzle. Air was passed through the vapor phase of a 1 mm solution of citralva and through the nozzle into the chamber. Mice were allowed 2 min to explore the chamber before the odorant pump was activated and 2 min in the presence of the odorant before being returned to their home cages in an odorant-free fume hood. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation 7 h later to allow transgene expression, and the heads were fixed in 6% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Tissue was decalcified overnight in 0.5 m EGTA, pH 8.0, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose, and frozen in Tissue-TEK/OCT (Miles). Tissue sections were taken at 30-μm intervals on a cryostat and mounted on microscope slides. Immunodetection of β-galactosidase was performed as described previously with a rabbit β-galactosidase antibody (5′–3′) at 1:500 dilution and an Alexa goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) at 1:500 dilution. Images were captured on a Bio-Rad MRC laser scanning confocal microscope. We examined the effect of odorants on ERK/MAP kinase activity because odorants generate transient increases in cAMP and Ca2+, both of which stimulate ERK activity in CNS neurons and PC12 cells (34Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 35Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). OSNs were cultured under conditions designed to minimize serum/growth factor-stimulated ERK/MAP kinase activity and exposed to low concentrations of odorants. Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured OSNs stimulated for 4 min with the odorant citralva revealed robust activation of ERK/MAP kinase in a subpopulation of neurons (Fig. 1 a). Whereas forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclases, stimulated ERK phosphorylation in a majority of neurons (∼85%) (Fig. 1,a and b), citralva produced this effect in only ∼38% of the neurons (Fig. 1, a and b). This observation is consistent with the expression of only a subset of odorant receptors in individual OSNs, yielding a heterogeneously responsive population. The relatively high percentage of cells activated by citralva is not unexpected; the citralva preparation used is a mixture of odorants that stimulates multiple receptors in olfactory cilia. For example, citralva stimulates CaMKII phosphorylation of AC3 in 20–30% of cultured OSNs (21Wei J. Zhao A.Z. Chan G.C. Baker L.P. Impey S. Beavo J.A. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Odorant stimulation of cAMP transients and Ca2+ increases in cultured OSNs is quite rapid and occurs within seconds after exposure to odorants (10Breer H. Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Nature. 1990; 345: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 28Ronnett G.V. Parfitt D.J. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2366-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Zufall F. Firestein S. Shepherd G.M. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3573-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If ERK/MAP kinase activation contributes to primary olfactory signaling, it should also occur within this time scale. The kinetics for odorant stimulation of ERK I/II (p44/p42) activation were monitored by Western analysis of cultured OSNs stimulated with several different odorants (Fig.2). The odorants citralva, isoamyl acetate, and ethyl vanillin stimulated robust phosphorylation of ERK I/II, peaking at 5 min and returning to near control levels by 20 min. Since the kinetics for activation of ERK/MAP kinase were significantly slower than odorant-stimulated increases in cAMP and Ca2+, ERK activation may not play an important role in primary olfactory signaling. This question was addressed by examining the effects of a MEK inhibitor on electro-olfactogram (EOG) responses stimulated by odorants. The EOG is a measure of odorant-stimulated field potentials generated by changes in ion conductance across the ciliary, dendritic, and somatic membranes of OSNs in an intact olfactory epithelium (39Lowe G. Gold G.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 442: 147-168Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Incubating isolated turbinates in oxygenated MEM-H containing the MEK inhibitor, U0126 (40Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), 90 min before recording the EOG response produced no significant perturbation of the amplitude or kinetics of field potentials elicited by a single application of citralva (Fig.3). The response to a train of odorant puffs produced the same characteristic desensitizing response in vehicle and U0126-treated turbinates, and responses to multiple, spaced applications of odorant were also identical. Since we were particularly interested in odorant stimulation of downstream transcriptional events, we also monitored odorant activation of p90 rsk , a CREB kinase that is activated by ERK/MAP kinase. In addition, CREB phosphorylation at its transactivation site, Ser-133 (41Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 42Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar), was also analyzed. Odorants stimulated activation of p90 rsk that persisted for at least 20 min (Fig.4 a). CREB phosphorylation was also transiently increased by citralva, in accord with a previous report that also showed formation of elements of a transcriptional complex (Fig. 4 b) (43Moon C. Sung Y.K. Reddy R. Ronnett G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14605-14610Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ERK activation and phosphorylation of CREB were both inhibited by U0126, consistent with the notion that odorants stimulate CREB phosphorylation through the MEK/ERK/p90 rsk pathway, one of the major pathways that mediates Ca2+ stimulation of CREB phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells (37Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Thus, odorants stimulate a robust induction of ERK/MAP kinase signaling that leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. In attempt to determine mechanisms linking odorant-stimulation to activation of ERK/MAP kinase signaling in OSNs, we measured ERK activation in the presence of several kinase inhibitors after 5 min of odorant stimulation. Interestingly, pretreatment of OSNs with the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 markedly attenuated the induction of phospho-ERK in response to citralva, ethyl vanillin, or the calcium ionophoreA23187 (Fig. 5). Inhibitors of other protein kinases including PKA ((R P)-8-bromo-cAMPs, (R P)-CPT-cAMPs), PKC (Gö 6983, chelerythrin), or PKG (KT5823) produced no discernible effect on odorant-stimulated ERK I/II phosphorylation (data not shown). These data suggest that Ca2+ increases caused by odorants stimulate CaMKII, which in turn leads to activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. Odorant stimulation of ERK/MAP kinase in OSNs may be due to CaMKII phosphorylation and inhibition of p135 SynGAP by CaMKII (44Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Thus, we may have identified another mechanism, in addition to CaMKII inhibition of AC3, by which CaMKII contributes to adaptive responses to odorants. The kinetics of ERK I/II activation, phosphorylation of CREB, and lack of acute effect of MEK inhibition on the EOG response suggested that the target for odorant-stimulated ERK I/II activity may be enhanced transcription. Given that odorants stimulated CREB phosphorylation and Ca2+ stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in CNS neurons is mediated by the MEK/ERK/p90 rsk pathway, we tested the hypothesis that simple odorant exposure may stimulate this pathway in OSNs. This was accomplished using a CRE/LacZ reporter mouse strain we developed to monitor activation of CRE-mediated transcription by various physiological stimuli (32Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 33Impey S. Smith D.M. Obrietan K. Donahue R. Wade C. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). CRE/LacZ mice were exposed to a gentle stream of air carrying the vapor phase of a 1 mmsolution of the odorant citralva for 2 min. The olfactory epithelium was then analyzed for CRE-mediated transcription by Western analysis and immunocytochemistry for β-galactosidase expression. Compared with animals that received no exogenous odorant exposure, the citralva-exposed mice exhibited a substantial induction of transgene expression by Western analysis (Fig.6 a), and ICC analysis revealed that neurons immunopositive for β-galactosidase were restricted predominantly to a layer of the epithelium located in zone four (Fig.6 b). Thus, a simple odorant stimulus is sufficient to lead to a transcription event in OSN that has been implicated in the enactment of long term changes and memory formation in CNS tissue but, until now, was not known to occur in sensory tissue. The concept that sensory tissue might have the ability to adapt to specific, frequently encountered stimuli such that it is optimized for subsequent detection makes intuitive sense. Chemosensation, evolutionarily ancient and essential to the survival of countless organisms, would seem particularly likely to possess such a capacity. Although OSNs exhibit rapid adaptive responses to odorants including desensitization (18Borisy F.F. Ronnett G.V. Cunningham A.M. Juilfs D. Beavo J. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Peppel K. Boekhoff I. McDonald P. Breer H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Menini A. Nature. 1997; 385: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), sensory structures such as OSNs have been generally thought of as conductors of information, not participating actively in its subsequent use. As such, reports of longer lasting olfactory sensory neuron sensitizations are provocative (26Dittman A.H. Quinn T.P. Nevitt G.A. Hacker B. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1997; 19: 381-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Wang H.W. Wysocki C.J. Gold G.H. Science. 1993; 260: 998-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Ronnett G.V. Parfitt D.J. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2366-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, there is currently little insight concerning signaling mechanisms that might mediate long lasting changes in OSNs, other than the initial cAMP and Ca2+ increases caused by odorant stimulation. We describe here the induction of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in mammalian OSNs in response to a variety of odorants, exposing a novel component of their signaling properties that may have an important role in olfaction. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII resulted in a diminished ability of odorants to stimulate ERK I/II phosphorylation. Furthermore, odorants stimulated ERK/MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of CREB, suggesting the possibility that individual OSNs link odorant detection to gene transcription from CRE-containing promoters. However, CREB phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription (32Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 47Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it was critical to determine whether CRE-mediated transcription is activated in OSNs when an animal is exposed to an odorant. We discovered that brief exposure in vivo to an odorant leads to region-specific CRE-mediated gene transcription in the olfactory epithelium. Interestingly, genetic mutation of the Ras homologue LET-60 Ras disrupts chemotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that ERK/MAP kinase may contribute to olfactory detection in simpler organisms (50Hirotsu T. Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to our study with mice that demonstrated odorant stimulation of ERK/MAP kinase maximally at 5 min, odorant stimulation of ERK/MAP kinase in C. elegans occurs within seconds. This suggests that the ERK/MAP kinase pathway may play different roles in vertebrate and invertebrate olfaction. Activation of the MAPK pathway in neurons occurs via differing mechanisms and has a number of physiological consequences (for a review see Ref. 31Impey S. Obrietan K. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Ca2+-stimulated CREB-dependent gene transcription in the hippocampus requires ERKI/II activation and supports learning and memory (37Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G.

Moreover, the same signal transduction pathway that is important for synaptic plasticity also contributes to neuronal survival. For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor blocks apoptosis in cortical neurons by stimulation of the MAPK pathway (53Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar, 54Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms linking odorant receptor stimulation to ERK/MAP kinase activity include those proceeding through Ras-GRF (44Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and cAMP-GEFs (55Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Indirect mechanisms for stimulation of Ras activity via PKA and CaMKII have also been demonstrated (56Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 57Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol.

KN-62 has been reported to have nonkinase-directed effects including blockade of calcium and/or potassium channels. To discount these possibilities from our observations, we also treated cultured OSNs with the calcium ionophoreA23187 with and without KN-62 preincubation. A23187 stimulated a robust ERK I/II phosphorylation that was significantly inhibited by KN-62, indicating that KN-62 most likely exerts its inhibition of odorant-stimulated ERK I/II phosphorylation downstream of membrane ion channels, on CaMKII. Our finding that inhibition of CaMKII activity attenuates the odorant and Ca2+ ionophore stimulation of ERK I/II phosphorylation is, to our knowledge, the first such observation in olfactory neurons. A novel implication is that CaMKII, which phosphorylates and inhibits AC3, links the termination of the cAMP signal to activation of ERK/MAP kinase. This raises the interesting concept that CaMKII functions as a “gatekeeper” in regulating downstream signaling in OSNs. Transcription of gene families activated through the CREB/CRE pathway is thought to a play a major role in several forms of neuroplasticity in the CNS including long lasting long term potentiation and memory for contextual and passive avoidance-associative learning (32Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar,33Impey S. Smith D.M. Obrietan K. Donahue R. Wade C. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a brief exposure to light during the subjective night activates the ERK/MAP kinase signaling cascade in suprachiasmatic nuclei, and there are striking circadian variations in MAPK activity and CRE-mediated transcription within the suprachiasmatic nuclei, suggesting that the MAPK cascade is involved in clock rhythmicity (60Obrietan K.

Activation of CRE-mediated transcription may also play an important role for developmental neuronal plasticity in the CNS (62Pham T.A. Impey S. Storm D.R. Stryker M.P.

In this study, we have discovered a new odorant-stimulated signal transduction pathway in OSNs that activates the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway and provides a mechanistic framework with which to understand long term adaptive changes in OSNs. Our data are the first to show an activity-dependent stimulation of ERK/MAP kinase signaling and CRE-mediated transcription in sensory neurons. This discovery may broaden the regulatory role of the ERK/CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway to include adaptive changes in sensory tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2016602386,"Peroxins are proteins required for peroxisome assembly. The cytosolic peroxin Pex20p binds directly to the β-oxidation enzyme thiolase and is necessary for its dimerization and peroxisomal targeting. The intraperoxisomal peroxin Pex8p has a role in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, including thiolase. We report the results of yeast two-hybrid analyses with various peroxins of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and characterize more fully the interaction between Pex8p and Pex20p. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that Pex8p and Pex20p form a complex, while in vitrobinding studies demonstrated that the interaction between Pex8p and Pex20p is specific, direct, and autonomous. Pex8p fractionates with peroxisomes in cells of a PEX20 disruption strain, indicating that Pex20p is not necessary for the targeting of Pex8p to peroxisomes. In cells of a PEX8 disruption strain, thiolase is mostly cytosolic, while Pex20p and a small amount of thiolase associate with peroxisomes, suggesting the involvement of Pex8p in the import of thiolase after docking of the Pex20p-thiolase complex to the membrane. In the absence of Pex8p, peroxisomal thiolase and Pex20p are protected from the action of externally added protease. This finding, together with the fact that Pex8p is intraperoxisomal, suggests that Pex20p may accompany thiolase into peroxisomes during import. Peroxins are proteins required for peroxisome assembly. The cytosolic peroxin Pex20p binds directly to the β-oxidation enzyme thiolase and is necessary for its dimerization and peroxisomal targeting.

Pex8p fractionates with peroxisomes in cells of a PEX20 disruption strain, indicating that Pex20p is not necessary for the targeting of Pex8p to peroxisomes. In cells of a PEX8 disruption strain, thiolase is mostly cytosolic, while Pex20p and a small amount of thiolase associate with peroxisomes, suggesting the involvement of Pex8p in the import of thiolase after docking of the Pex20p-thiolase complex to the membrane. In the absence of Pex8p, peroxisomal thiolase and Pex20p are protected from the action of externally added protease. This finding, together with the fact that Pex8p is intraperoxisomal, suggests that Pex20p may accompany thiolase into peroxisomes during import. peroxisomal targeting signal(s) 20,000 × g pellet enriched for peroxisomes and mitochondria 20,000 × gsupernatant enriched for cytosol and high-speed pelletable organelles 200,000 × g pellet enriched for high-speed pelletable organelles 200,000 × g supernatant highly enriched for cytosol disrupted 20KgP transcription-activating domain of GAL4 DNA-binding domain of GAL4 glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin maltose-binding protein open reading frame polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Peroxisomes are members of the microbody family of organelles and are found in organisms from yeasts to humans and in most cell types. They are the site of many important biochemical processes that vary depending on the organism or cell type. Among their many metabolic activities, peroxisomes perform the β-oxidation of fatty acids, bile acid synthesis, plasmalogen synthesis, cholesterol metabolism, and methanol oxidation (1Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Soluble enzymes and other proteins found in the peroxisomal matrix are synthesized on polysomes free in the cytosol (1Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and are targeted to peroxisomes by cis-acting peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS).1Matrix proteins are targeted most commonly by a PTS1, a tripeptide of the sequence SKL or a conserved variant thereof, located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of proteins. Less commonly, matrix proteins are targeted by a PTS2, a nonapeptide located near or at the amino terminus of proteins and having the consensus sequence (R/K)(L/V/I)X5(H/Q)(L/A) (reviewed in Refs.2Erdmann R.

Interestingly, unlike other organelles in which proteins traverse the membrane in an unfolded conformation, peroxisomes are capable of importing oligomeric protein complexes (5Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10541-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Peroxins are proteins required for peroxisome assembly. A subset of peroxins is required for the targeting and import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. The PTS receptors Pex5p and Pex7p bind PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins, respectively, and are necessary for targeting these proteins to peroxisomes (reviewed in Refs. 2Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Subramani S. Physiol.

There are conflicting findings regarding the localization of these receptors in the cell. Both receptors have been found in the cytosol, associated with the peroxisomal membrane or in the peroxisomal matrix (reviewed in Refs. 3Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar and 4Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Pex5p and Pex7p have therefore been proposed to be mobile receptors that bind cargo proteins in the cytosol, dock at the peroxisomal membrane, enter the peroxisome, release their cargo in the matrix, and recycle to the cytosol (2Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Subramani S. Physiol.

Pex13p and Pex14p are integral and peripheral peroxisomal membrane peroxins, respectively, necessary for PTS receptor docking (reviewed in Refs. 2Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 4Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Since Pex13p and Pex14p interact with each other and with both PTS receptors, it has been suggested that although PTS1- and PTS2-dependent targeting pathways are divergent, the import pathways are convergent (9Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Girzalsky W. Rehling P. Stein K. Kipper J. Blank L. Kunau W.-H. Erdmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pex8p is a peroxin associated with the inside of the peroxisomal membrane, and, in its absence, PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins are mislocalized to the cytosol (11Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I.

Recently, a physical interaction was detected between Pex8p and the PTS1 receptor Pex5p in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Pex8p was suggested to function in protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane following the docking of Pex5p-cargo complexes (14Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3593-3602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal targeting signals and the peroxisomal import apparatus have been strongly conserved during evolution, but interestingly some divergence has been recognized. In certain mammalian systems, two isoforms of Pex5p have been identified, a short isoform necessary for PTS1 import and a long isoform necessary for the import of both PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins (15Braverman N. Steel G. Obie C. Moser A. Moser H. Gould S.J. Valle D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 16Otera H. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E. Nishimura M. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Ohashi K. Higuchi O. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 388-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Yarrowia lipolytica, the PTS2 receptor Pex7p has not been identified. In this yeast, Pex20p, a peroxin with sequence similarity to Pex5p, is necessary for the dimerization and peroxisomal targeting of thiolase, a PTS2-containing protein (17Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Since Pex20p has been shown to be found in both the cytosol and associated with the peroxisomal membrane, it has been proposed to act as a cycling protein that picks up thiolase in the cytosol, docks at the peroxisomal membrane, and then repeats the circuit (17Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of a direct interaction between Pex8p and Pex20p. Pex20p is apparently not required for the targeting of Pex8p to peroxisomes, because Pex8p is still peroxisomal in cells of a PEX20 disruption strain. Instead, we provide data that are consistent with Pex8p being directly involved in the import of thiolase into peroxisomes at a stage following docking of the Pex20p-thiolase complex at the peroxisomal membrane. Our data also suggest that, like Pex7p and Pex5p, Pex20p may accompany its cargo into peroxisomes during import. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Media components were as follows: YEPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose; YEPA, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% sodium acetate; YPBO, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% K2HPO4, 0.5% KH2PO4, 1% Brij 35, 1% (w/v) oleic acid; YND, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose; YNO, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 40, 0.2% (w/v) oleic acid; YNA, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% sodium acetate. Liquid YNO and YND media and YNO agar plates were supplemented with 2× Complete Supplement Mixture (minus the appropriate amino acids or nucleotides) (Bio 101, Vista, CA). YNA agar plates were supplemented with leucine, uracil, and lysine, each at 50 μg/ml, as required. Growth was at 30 °C. Strains and culture conditions for two-hybrid analyses were as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA).Table IYarrowia lipolytica strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceE122MATA, ura3–302, leu2–270, lys8–11C.

Open table in a new tab Physical interactions between peroxins were detected using the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH). Chimeric genes were generated by amplifying the open reading frames (ORFs) of PEX genes from Y. lipolytica genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ligating them in-frame and downstream of the DNA encoding the transcription-activating domain (AD) and the DNA-binding domain (DB) of the GAL4 transcriptional activator in the plasmids pGAD424 and pGBT9, respectively (Table II). To generate pGAD-P8ΔNC, a plasmid encoding AD-Pex8p-(12–644), a portion of the PEX8 gene with flanking EcoRI sites was amplified from genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 122-1 and 549 (TableIII) and ligated into EcoRI-digested pGAD424. To generate pGAD-P8-(12–370) encoding AD-Pex8p-(12–370), pGAD-P8ΔNC was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the resulting 1080-bp fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites of pGAD424. pGAD-P8-(164–644) encoding AD-Pex8p-(164–644) was generated by digesting pGAD-P8ΔNC with ApoI and EcoRI and ligating the 1442-bp fragment into EcoRI-digested pGAD424. pGAD-P20-(1–76) encoding AD-Pex20p-(1–76) was generated by excising a BalI/SmaI fragment from pGBT-PEX20 (TableII).Table IIGeneration of plasmids for two-hybrid system analysesPlasmid generated2-aParent plasmids are pGAD424 and pGBT9 for constructs beginning with pGAD and pGBT, respectively.Gene ligated2-bPEX2, PEX5,PEX6, PEX8, and PEX9 were formerly designated PAY5, PAY32, PAY4,PEX17, and PAY2, respectively.Oligonucleotides used to amplify geneEnzymes used to digest amplified geneEnzymes used to digest parent plasmid2-bPEX2, PEX5,PEX6, PEX8, and PEX9 were formerly designated PAY5, PAY32, PAY4,PEX17, and PAY2, respectively.pGBT-PEX1PEX1394 and 395EcoRIEcoRIpGAD-PEX1PEX1394 and 395EcoRIEcoRIpGBT-PEX2PEX2337 and 338BamHI/BglIIBamHIpGAD-PEX2PEX2337 and 338BamHI/BglIIBamHI/BglIIpGBT-PEX5PEX5339 and 340EcoRI/BamHIEcoRI/BamHIpGAD-PEX5PEX5339 and 340EcoRI/BamHIEcoRI/BamHIpGBT-PEX6PEX6343 and 344EcoRIEcoRIpGAD-PEX6PEX6343 and 344EcoRIEcoRIpGBT-PEX82-dThe complete ORFs of the PEX genes in these constructs were determined to be correct by sequencing.

Transformants were grown on synthetic media lacking tryptophan and leucine and tested for activation of the integrated lacZ construct using β-galactosidase filter and liquid assays. Both assays were performed according to the manufacturer's (CLONTECH) instructions except that for liquid assays, yeast from 1 ml of culture was used, and cells were broken by three freeze-thaw cycles at −70 °C, and for filter assays, agar plates contained 100 μg/ml adenine to reduce the red color of the yeast. Chimeric genes encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions were generated as described below. The PEX8 ORF was excised from pGAD-PEX8 (Table II) with EcoRI and BglII and ligated into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pBluescript SKII(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate the plasmid pBS-PEX8. To generate pMAL-PEX8 encoding MBP-Pex8p, PEX8 was excised from pBS-PEX8 with EcoRI/XbaI and ligated into EcoRI/XbaI-digested pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To generate pGEX-PEX20 encoding GST-Pex20p, pGBT-PEX20 (Table II) was digested with EcoRI, and the PEX20ORF was ligated into EcoRI-digested pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmids pGEX-4T1, pGEX-PEX20, pMAL-c2, and pMAL-PEX8 were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BLR (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Induction and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) specifications, except that expression of chimeric genes was induced at 30 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were lysed with B-PER reagent (Pierce). Induction and purification of MBP fusion proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's (New England Biolabs) specifications. All purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEDTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol) and stored at −70 °C. An in vitro binding assay was performed using recombinant GST, GST-Pex20p, MBP, and MBP-Pex8p purified as described above. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was washed with RW buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, 0.1% casamino acids, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 0.21 mg/ml NaF, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). GST and GST-Pex20p were tumbled end-over-end in batch with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (2.5 μg of GST or GST-Pex20p and 5 μl of packed beads per reaction) in 0.5 ml of RW buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 0.5 ml of RW buffer. Purified MBP or MBP-Pex8p (5 μg/reaction) was added to 100 μl of RW buffer containing GST or GST-Pex20p linked to beads and tumbled end-over-end for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and supernatants were retained as the unbound fractions. The beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml of RW buffer and applied to spin filters (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA), washed three times with 0.5 ml of RW buffer, and eluted with 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer at room temperature. 50% of bound fractions and 25% of unbound fractions were run on 9% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Aliquots of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (10 μl of packed beads/reaction) were washed four times with 1 ml of RX buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) casamino acids, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 0.21 mg/ml NaF, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of RX buffer. 3 μg of GST or GST-Pex20p was added to the beads, and reactions were tumbled end-over-end at room temperature for 80 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 0.5 ml of RX buffer. YPBO-grown cells of the PEX8-HA c strain (Table I) were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with water, and washed once with RX buffer. Cells were disrupted in RX buffer by agitation with glass beads. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g in a microcentrifuge for 45 min at 4 °C. 120 μl of the cleared supernatant (10 mg of protein/ml) or of RX buffer alone was tumbled end-over-end in batch with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST or GST-Pex20p for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with 0.8 ml of RX buffer, applied to spin filters, and washed four times with 0.5 ml of RX buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins in equal fractions of each sample were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting. A modified PEX8 gene encoding Pex8p tagged at its carboxyl terminus was made by inserting a DNA fragment encoding two copies of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope in frame and downstream of the PEX8 ORF. A fragment containing the PEX8 ORF flanked by 2.0 and 1.2 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was excised from p50LD (13Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Marelli M. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with HindIII and ligated into the HindIII site of pGEM7Zf(+) to make the plasmid pG7PEX8. Next, a BglII site was introduced immediately upstream of the stop codon of PEX8 using sequential PCR. Essentially, two regions of the PEX8 gene flanking the proposed BglII site were amplified from pG7PEX8 using oligonucleotides RP and 761 for the 5′ region and oligonucleotides UP and 760 for the 3′ region (Table III). The two products were used as templates for a second round of PCR with oligonucleotides UP and RP. Since oligonucleotides 760 and 761 have BglII recognition sequences and complementary 5′-ends, the second round of PCR generated a single fragment containing PEX8 with a BglII site immediately upstream of the stop codon. This product was digested with HindIII and ligated into pGEM7Zf(+) to generate the plasmid pG7-PEX8B. Next, a fragment with BamHI/BglII termini encoding the peptide DPLAMYPYDVPDYAAMYPYDVPDYAAMGKGE, which contains two repeats of the HA epitope (underlined residues) (18Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), was ligated in-frame into the BglII site of pG7PEX8B to generate plasmid pG7PEX8-HAc. The region of pG7PEX8-HAcamplified by PCR was confirmed to be correct by sequencing. A fragment containing the modified PEX8 gene was excised from pG7PEX8-HAc with HindIII and integrated into the genome of the pex8–1 mutant strain (Table I) by homologous recombination to replace the pex8–1 allele of PEX8. The pex8–1 allele has a substitution mutation in the PEX8 gene (A1924T), creating a premature stop codon 2J. J. Smith and R. A. Rachubinski, unpublished results. and cannot grow on oleic acid medium (13Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Marelli M. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for reestablished growth on oleic acid medium (YNO agar) and characterized by Southern blotting and electron microscopy. One strain,PEX8-HA c, having the correct genotype and wild-type morphology, was chosen for further study. To make a PEX8-HA c expression plasmid,PEX8-HA c was excised from pG7PEX8-HAc with HindIII and ligated into the HindIII site of the E. coli/Y. lipolytica shuttle vector pINA445 to make the plasmid pPEX8-HAc encoding Pex8p-HAc. pINA445 contains the Y. lipolytica LEU2 gene for positive selection of yeast transformants and the Y. lipolytica ARS68 gene for autonomous plasmid replication in Y. lipolytica cells (19Nuttley W.M.

Coimmunoprecipitation was performed by immunoaffinity chromatography using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma). All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. YPBO-grown PEX8-HA c cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with water, and washed once with RX buffer. Cells were resuspended in RX buffer and lysed by disruption with glass beads. The total cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a TLA120.2 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) for 15 min, diluted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with RX buffer, and divided into 500-μl aliquots. 4.5 μl of immune serum or 18 μl of preimmune serum (volumes of serum containing equal numbers of IgG molecules) was added to each of two aliquots, and reactions were tumbled end-over-end for 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose, preblocked in RX buffer containing 8% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in RX buffer to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). 50 μl of the protein A-Sepharose suspension was added to each reaction, and reactions were tumbled end-over-end for 40 min. Antibody complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of RX buffer. Samples were then applied to spin filters and washed three times with RX buffer, and antibody complexes were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at room temperature.

The 20KgS fraction was further subfractionated by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h to yield a pellet (200KgP) enriched for high-speed pelletable organelles and a supernatant (200KgS) highly enriched for cytosol.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of abrupt cessation of shear stress on pulmonary endothelial NO generation and its relationship to changes in intracellular Ca2+. In situ endothelial generation of NO and changes in intracellular Ca2+ in isolated, intact rat lungs were evaluated using fluorescence microscopy with diaminofluorescein diacetate, an NO probe, and Fluo-3, a Ca2+ probe. The onset of increased NO generation in endothelial cells of subpleural microvessels in situoccurred between 30 and 90 s after onset of ischemia and was preceded by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ due to both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and release from intracellular stores.

This mediator is generated by endothelial cells in response to agonist stimulation and also as a response to increased shear stress (5Fukaya Y. Ohhashi T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H99-H106PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effect of increase in flow on endothelial cell NO generation has been characterized, the effect of abrupt cessation of shear stress (i.e. acute ischemia as in pulmonary embolism or donor lung isolation for transplantation) on pulmonary endothelial NO generation in situ is unknown. Endothelial cells in situ are constantly exposed to shear stress associated with blood flow and thus become flow-adapted. These cells respond with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and generation of reactive oxygen species when flow is stopped but oxygenation is maintained (6Al-Mehdi A.B. Zhao G. Dodia C. Tozawa K. Costa K.

A similar response with reactive oxygen species generation subsequent to the abrupt cessation of flow has been demonstrated with endothelial cells adapted to flow in vitro (8Wei Z. Costa K. Al-Mehdi A.B. Dodia C. Muzykantov V. Fisher A.B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the basis for this early response is mechanotransduction related to removal of endothelial cell shear stress (9Al-Mehdi A.B. Zhao G. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 18: 653-661Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular Ca2+ is known to activate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) resulting in increased NO generation and has been demonstrated in cells exposed to increased shear stress (10Kuchan M.J.

In these nonadapted endothelial cells, shear-stress-induced NOS activation was biphasic, with an initial Ca2+-dependent phase and a second, sustained phase that was Ca2+-independent and phosphorylation-dependent (10Kuchan M.J.

In this study, we evaluated whether the increased intracellular Ca2+associated with the early response to flow cessation leads to increased NO generation. This paradigm constitutes a model for the response to acute ischemia. We have used the term oxygenated ischemia to refer to the abrupt cessation of flow in pulmonary circulation where oxygenation remains adequate during ischemia because of the lung alveolar air, and an analogous effect should apply to the initial several minutes of ischemia in a systemic vessel prior to critical oxygen depletion. Our studies show that in air-ventilated, isolated, intact rat lungs, endothelial cells in situ respond to removal of flow with increased generation of NO. We have used an established fluorescence microscopic technique for visualization of subpleural endothelium in situ in isolated, ventilated, and perfused rat lungs to monitor endothelial cell Ca2+ and NO (6Al-Mehdi A.B.

NO generation was monitored by labeling the pulmonary endothelium with 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA, Calbiochem) that is de-esterified intracellularly to DAF-2. NO and its higher oxides, such as NOx or nitrous anhydride (N2O3), provide the third nitrogen to form a triazo ring from the two amino groups of the nonfluorescent DAF-2 and convert it to diaminotriazolofluorescein (DAF-2T) that is monitored at 490 nm excitation and 530 nm emission (13Nakatsubo N.

Changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored with Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester. DAF-2 DA andN G -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Fluo-3/AM and DiI-acetylated LDL were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). We used an established intact organ microscopy technique to image microvascular endothelial cells in situin isolated, ventilated, blood-free rat lungs in real time using an epifluorescence microscope (6Al-Mehdi A.B.

Briefly, Sprague-Dawley male rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Kingston, NY) weighing 150–200 g were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). A tracheostomy was performed, and artificial ventilation with 95% air + 5% CO2 (BOC Group, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ) was started through a cannula. The abdomen was opened and the animal was exsanguinated by transection of major abdominal vessels. A cannula was inserted into the main pulmonary artery via a puncture in the right ventricle, and another was inserted into the left atrium. The lung was cleared of blood by gravity perfusion via the pulmonary artery with an artificial medium (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer KRB: NaCl, 118.45; KCl, 4.74; MgSO4/7H2O, 1.17; CaCl2/2H2O, 1.27; KH2PO4, 1.18; and NaHCO3, 24.87 in mmol/liter with 5% dextran and 10 mm glucose at pH 7.4). The flow-through perfusate left the lung via the left atrial cannula. Once the lung became visibly cleared of blood (appeared white in color), the heart-lung preparation was dissected en bloc and was placed on a 48 × 60 × 0.16 mm coverglass window in a specially designed Plexiglas chamber with ports for the tracheal, pulmonary, and left atrial cannulae. The cardiovascular ports were connected to a peristaltic pump that recirculated 40 ml of perfusate at a constant flow rate of 8 ml/min through the pulmonary vascular bed. The chamber was placed on the stage of an epifluorescence microscope fitted with a 60× objective (Nikon Diaphot TMD) and equipped with an optical filter changer (Lambda 10–2, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). A local anesthetic (0.05 mg of xylazine, Sigma) was injected subepicardially into the posterior wall of the right atrium to abolish lung movement artifact due to contraction of remaining cardiac muscle. Excitation of the lung surface was accomplished with a mercury lamp fiberoptic light source, a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set for DAF-2T or Fluo-3 (HQ41001 with 480/40 excitation filter, 505 LP dichroic mirror, and 535/40 emission filter; a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set for DiI-acetylated LDL, Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). The integrity of the preparation was continuously monitored by online measurements of intratracheal and pulmonary artery perfusion pressures. Endothelial cells in the subpleural vasculature were positively identified by labeling with DiI-acetylated LDL added to the perfusate. We have used a Nikon Diaphot TMD epifluorescence microscope, a Hamamatsu ORCA-100 digital camera, and MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging) for imaging. After an equilibration period of 45 min with the isolated lung to allow uptake of DAF-2 DA (5 μmol/liter), intravascular dye was removed by perfusion with dye-free medium for 5 min to reduce background fluorescence. Images of DAF-2T- or Fluo-3-stained vascular endothelial cells were taken from the same area as a stream (18 frames per s) or every 3 s for up to 10 min during which ventilation was stopped. As a control, after the equilibration period, images were taken during continuous perfusion. Then the peristaltic pump was stopped to create ischemia. Some lungs were pretreated with l-NAME (1 mmol/liter) by administration of perfusate during the dye equilibration period or with 1 μmol/liter thapsigargin. Additional lungs were perfused with calcium-free KRB containing 1 mmol/liter EGTA prior to ischemia. For quantification, each endothelial cell was outlined and its fluorescence intensity was measured over time. For each lung, mean fluorescent intensities of 4–7 endothelial cells were averaged. Fluorescent intensity of 3–4 lungs for each condition was averaged. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. for each condition. Comparisons were made using analysis of variance with Bonferroni's test using SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS Inc.). Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Endothelial cells in situ in subpleural microvessels of rat lungs exhibited progressive increase in DAF-2T fluorescence during ischemia indicating increased NO generation with abrupt cessation of shear stress compared with control perfusion (Fig. 1 a). The fluorescent endothelial cells in subpleural precapillary arterioles could be readily identified as elongated, flow-aligned structures with tapered ends pointing against the flow direction and most of the fluorescence in the thicker part of the cells in the perinuclear area (Fig. 1 a). Specific endothelial cellular identification was confirmed by colabeling with DiI-acetylated LDL that showed cellular colocalization with DAF-2T fluorescence (data not shown). Quantification of fluorescence intensity in the same endothelial cells over time and averaged for a few cells shows that the increase in DAF-2T fluorescence with ischemia was completely blocked byl-NAME (Fig. 2 a), indicating specificity of the signal for NO.Figure 2a, effect of NOS inhibition on DAF-2T fluorescence with ischemia. l-NAME pretreatment (Ischemia + l-NAME) completely blocked the increase in DAF-2T fluorescence with ischemia (Ischemia).

Waltenberger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). eNOS requires increased levels of Ca2+ and calmodulin binding for its dissociation from caveolin and activation whereas activation of iNOS is Ca2+-independent (15Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Ca2+-free medium containing 1 mm EGTA led a to marked decrease in DAF-2T fluorescence with ischemia (Fig. 2 a), suggesting that eNOS is responsible for endothelial NO generation under these conditions. The calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium chloride, and the PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, markedly inhibited the ischemic increase in DAF-2T fluorescence (Fig. 2 b). These results indicate a role for calmodulin binding and the protein kinase B/Akt-mediated phosphorylation for the activation of NOS in oxygenated ischemia. Dependence of NOS activation on both Ca2+ and PI3-kinase in pulmonary endothelial cells in situ with flow cessation contrasts with the dependence on PI3-kinase alone for sustained NOS activation associated with imposition of shear stress to cells in static culture (16Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Busse R. Fleming I. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2000; 168: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no evidence for a Ca2+-independent component as described previously for increased flow (10Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J.

To establish a temporal relationship between the NO and Ca2+ changes, we used Fluo-3 to monitor changes in endothelial cell Ca2+. Ischemia led to increased Ca2+ in endothelial cells in situ that was partially prevented by perfusion with either Ca2+-free, 1 mm EGTA-containing medium or by pretreatment with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase of endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1 b and Fig. 2, c andd). These results indicated that ischemic increase in endothelial cell Ca2+ is due to both influx and intracellular release. Comparison of the time course for the NO and Ca2+ responses to ischemia revealed that the onset of Ca2+ increase occurs between 10 and 20 s whereas the onset of NO increase is between 30 and 90 s for individual endothelial cells (Fig. 3 a). Therefore, the ischemic increase in NO is preceded by an increase in Ca2+ in endothelial cells in situ. Along with the calmidazolium data (Fig. 2 b), these results indicate that the temporal order of Ca2+ and NO increase with ischemia provides a stimulus and effect relationship between these phenomena. We have shown previously that ischemia in the normoxic lung leads to plasma membrane depolarization, increase in intracellular Ca2+, and reactive oxygen species generation and have hypothesized the involvement of a flow-sensitive K+ channel (6Al-Mehdi A.B. Zhao G. Dodia C. Tozawa K. Costa K. Muzykantov V. Ross C. Blecha F. Dinauer M. Fisher A.B. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7Tozawa K. Al-Mehdi A.B.

Biol. 1997; 18: 653-661Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This study shows that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ in endothelial cells with ischemia results in NO synthesis. We postulate that these ischemic responses are related to mechanotransduction of loss of shear stress, and a schema of this process is shown in Fig. 3 b. Although depolarization-induced phenomena may depend on K+ channels and could trigger Ca2+ increase and the NO response, it is possible that another protein functions as the primary mechanosensor (20Rizzo V. McIntosh D.P. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34724-34729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The study of the response of endothelial cells to mechanical stresses could theoretically utilize cells adapted to no-flow (e.g. in vitro under static culture) or cells that are flow-adapted. Most previous studies of the effect of shear stress examined responses of static cells upon exposure to flow; a few studies including the present one evaluated the responses of in situflow-adapted cells to sudden loss of flow. Strikingly, some responses of the endothelial cells were shown to be identical in nature and direction for both types of stimuli, i.e. increased shear stress in nonadapted cells or loss of shear stress in adapted cells. These responses include pinocytosis (21Davies P.F. Dewey Jr., C.F. Bussolari S.R. Gordon E.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), intracellular calcium (7Tozawa K. Al-Mehdi A.B. Muzykantov V. Fisher A.B. Antiox.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and reactive oxygen species generation (8Wei Z. Costa K. Al-Mehdi A.B. Dodia C. Muzykantov V. Fisher A.B. Circ.

Physiol. 1998; 175: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The present results show that the NO response of flow-adapted endothelial cells to loss of shear stress is similar in direction to the response following onset of flow for cells adapted to static conditions. Thus, the NO response represents another paradigm of alteration from a state of adaptation (24Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). For all of the shear stress-induced responses in the endothelial cell, the current notion of mechanotransduction requires the presence of sensors coupled to signal transduction pathways. Although the precise shear stress sensor is not known, it has been postulated that caveolae (cholesterol-rich microdomains of plasma membrane) may be involved in the NO response (25Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whether these represent a flow sensor remains to be determined. Further, it is not clear whether the same sensor responds to the onset as well as the loss of shear stress. In any event, adaptation of endothelial cells to flow or no flow may be determined primarily by the adaptation of flow sensors to mechanical shear, possibly with retention of similar signal transduction pathways and effectors under both conditions. We thank Maggie Meuler for excellent technical assistance, Dr. Harry Ischiropoulos for helpful discussions, and Dr. Yefim Manevich for suggesting the NO probe."
https://openalex.org/W2324347911,"Transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by the v-Jun oncoprotein correlates with a down-regulation of the extracellular matrix protein SPARC and repression of the corresponding mRNA. Alteration in SPARC expression has been repeatedly reported in human cancers of various origin, and is thought to contribute to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix during neoplastic progression. Transcriptional control of SPARC is poorly understood. We show here that (i) v-Jun-mediated repression of the endogenous SPARC gene is enhanced by Fra2 but alleviated by ATF2, Fra2 and ATF2 being the two major partners of v-Jun in the transformed cells; (ii) high basal activity as well as repression by v-Jun and modulation by Fra2 and ATF2 is restricted to a small proximal fragment (-124/+16) of the chicken SPARC promoter; (iii) the activity of this minimal promoter is modulated by all the AP1 family members known in chickens (c-Jun and JunD; c-Fos and Fra2; ATF2; c-Maf, MafA, and MafB). Taken together these data demonstrate that, at least in avian primary cells, SPARC expression is under the control of the AP1 transcription factor. Further studies with the minimal (-124/+16) promoter fragment are needed to understand how this control takes place at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2005969483,"We previously reported that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) functions as a putative scaffold factor in the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. In that study we also found MEK1 and Raf-1, which are involved in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK cascades, bind to JSAP1. Here we have defined the regions of JSAP1 responsible for the interactions with MEK1 and Raf-1. Both of the binding regions were mapped to the COOH-terminal region (residues 1054–1305) of JSAP1. We next examined the effect of overexpressing JSAP1 on the activation of ERK by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in transfected COS-7 cells and found that JSAP1 inhibits ERK's activation and that the COOH-terminal region of JSAP1 was required for the inhibition. Finally, we investigated the molecular mechanism of JSAP1's inhibitory function and showed that JSAP1 prevents MEK1 phosphorylation and activation by Raf-1, resulting in the suppression of the activation of ERK. Taken together, these results suggest that JSAP1 is involved both in the JNK cascades, as a scaffolding factor, and the ERK cascades, as a suppressor. We previously reported that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) functions as a putative scaffold factor in the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. In that study we also found MEK1 and Raf-1, which are involved in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK cascades, bind to JSAP1. Here we have defined the regions of JSAP1 responsible for the interactions with MEK1 and Raf-1. Both of the binding regions were mapped to the COOH-terminal region (residues 1054–1305) of JSAP1. We next examined the effect of overexpressing JSAP1 on the activation of ERK by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in transfected COS-7 cells and found that JSAP1 inhibits ERK's activation and that the COOH-terminal region of JSAP1 was required for the inhibition. Finally, we investigated the molecular mechanism of JSAP1's inhibitory function and showed that JSAP1 prevents MEK1 phosphorylation and activation by Raf-1, resulting in the suppression of the activation of ERK. Taken together, these results suggest that JSAP1 is involved both in the JNK cascades, as a scaffolding factor, and the ERK cascades, as a suppressor. mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPKK kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase JNK/SAPK-associated protein 1 myelin basic protein open reading frame polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate Raf kinase inhibitor protein thioredoxin embryonal carcinoma The MAP kinase (MAPK)1signaling pathway is an intracellular cascade consisting of MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). Upon stimulation, MAPKKK activates MAPKK by phosphorylation on serine (and/or threonine) residues, which in turn activates MAPK by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues (1Nishida E.

In mammals, five groups of distinguishable MAPK cascades have been identified so far (6Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). They include the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades. The JNK and p38 groups of MAPKs are strongly activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses (7Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 8Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 8Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

For example, the small G protein Ras is activated by many growth factors, and in turn activates the Raf-MEK-ERK cascades (11Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). The mammalian MAPK cascades play key roles in a wide array of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (7Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Thus, mechanisms should exist to ensure specific and efficient activation of the MAPK cascades in response to extracellular stimuli. The recent identification of putative scaffold proteins in the MAPK cascades could account for one of the mechanisms (6Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

We proposed previously that JNK/SAPK-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) (also known as JNK-interacting protein 3 (15Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)) functions as a scaffold factor in the JNK MAPK cascades (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the same study, we reported that JSAP1 binds Raf-1 MAPKKK and MEK1 MAPKK, which are involved in the ERK MAPK cascades. Here, we have mapped the MEK1- and Raf-1-binding regions in JSAP1 and examined the effect of JSAP1 on the activation of the ERK MAPK cascades. Furthermore, we have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying JSAP1's effects on the ERK MAPK cascades. The full-length human Ha-Ras cDNA was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan. The open reading frame (ORF) of Ha-Ras was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The product was subcloned intoBamHI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3-Myc to generate pcDNA3-Myc-Ha-Ras. For the expression of a constitutively active Myc-Ha-Ras, a glycine residue corresponding to codon 12 of Ha-Ras was replaced by a valine residue using overlapping PCR (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M.

The resulting plasmid was termed pcDNA3-Myc-Ras(V12). The COOH-terminal region (residues 316–648) of Raf-1 was amplified by PCR with pcDNA3-Flag-Raf-1 (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S.

The COOH-terminal region (residues 1054–1305) of JSAP1 was amplified by PCR with pcDNA3-His-S-JSAP1 (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T.

The product was subcloned into BamHI/XhoI-digested pET32b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate an expression vector for thioredoxin (Trx)-histidine (His)-S-JSAP1 (residues 1054–1305). The resulting plasmid was termed pET32-JSAP1-C. The region encoding residues 115–504 of JSAP1 was amplified by PCR with pcDNA3-His-S-JSAP1 (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N.

The product was subcloned intoNcoI/BamHI-digested pET32b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pET32-JSAP1(115–504). The ORF of human MEK1 was amplified by PCR with pcDNA3-Flag-MEK1 (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) as the template. The product was subcloned into HindIII/NotI-digested pET32b to generate pET32-MEK1. To prepare a kinase-negative Trx-His-S-MEK1, a lysine residue corresponding to codon 97 of MEK1 was replaced by an arginine residue using overlapping PCR. The resulting plasmid was termed pET32-MEK(R97). All the amplified sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Other expression vectors used in this study were described previously (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. COS-7 cells (1 × 105) in a 35-mm dish were transfected with plasmid DNA using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacture's instructions. P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Anti-Flag M5 monoclonal antibody, anti-His polyclonal antibody, anti-c-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody, and anti-Raf-1 53 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Phospho-specific anti-MEK1/2 polyclonal antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc (Beverly, MA). Trx-His-S-JSAP1 (residues 115–504) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with S-protein-agarose (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The protein was further purified by performing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and extracting the ∼85 kDa fusion protein from the gel. The purified protein was injected into Kbl:JW rabbits to raise anti-JSAP1 antiserum. Protein binding assays in COS-7 cells in vitro and immune-complex kinase assays were performed as described previously (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16Onishi I. Tani T. Hashimoto T. Shimizu K. Yagi M. Yamamoto K. Yoshioka K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). P19 EC cells were lysed at 4 °C in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 mmdithiothreitol) and precipitated with an anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody or anti-JSAP1 antiserum immobilized on Sepharose-coupled protein G (Life Technologies, Inc.). The precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-JSAP1 antiserum or anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody, respectively. Myelin basic protein (MBP) purchased from Sigma was used as substrate to measure the kinase activity of ERK. In some experiments, COS-7 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) for the activation of ERK. To define the region of JSAP1 responsible for its interaction with MEK1, Flag-tagged full-length MEK1 was transiently coexpressed with His-S-tagged full-length or deletion mutants of JSAP1 in COS-7 cells. The His-S-JSAP1 proteins, His-S-JSAP1-FL (residues 1–1305), His-S-JSAP1-ΔC (residues 1–1053), or His-S-JSAP1-C (residues 1054–1305), were recovered from the cell extracts by affinity binding to S-protein-agarose, and the precipitates were examined for the presence of Flag-MEK1 by immunoblotting with an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 1 A). The full-length JSAP1 (JSAP1-FL) and JSAP1-C, which contains only the COOH-terminal region of JSAP1, but not JSAP1-ΔC, in which the COOH-terminal region of JSAP1 is deleted, interacted with MEK1, indicating that the MEK1-binding region of JSAP1 is located between amino acid residues 1054–1305 in JSAP1. We also mapped the Raf-1-binding region in JSAP1 using similar JSAP1 constructs. Because we reported previously that the COOH-terminal half of Raf-1 (residues 316–648, Raf-C) is required for binding to JSAP1 (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), Raf-C was used for this experiment. Flag-Raf-C was copurified with His-S-JSAP1-FL (residues 1–1305) or His-S-JSAP1-C (residues 1054–1305), but not with His-S-JSAP1-ΔC (residues 1–1053) from transiently cotransfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that the COOH-terminal region (residues 1054–1305) of JSAP1 is also responsible for the interaction with Raf-1. We next carried out in vitro binding assays between MEK1 and JSAP1 (Fig. 2, upper panel) and Raf-1 and JSAP1 (Fig. 2, lower panel). A Trx-His-S-JSAP1-C (residues 1054–1305) fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, purified using S-protein-agarose, and assayed for the ability to bind MEK1 and Raf-1. The agarose-bound fusion protein was mixed with in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled MEK1 or Raf-1, recovered, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results indicate that JSAP1 binds Raf-1, but not MEK1 in vitro, suggesting that JSAP1 directly binds Raf-1 but binds MEK1 indirectly. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the binding of MEK1 to JSAP1 is direct, because JSAP1 may adopt different conformations in vivo and in vitro. We further studied whether endogenous JSAP1 and Raf-1 associate in vivo. Lysates prepared from P19 EC cells were first precipitated with an anti-Raf-1 or -JSAP1 antibody. The precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-JSAP1 or -Raf-1 antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, specific bands were detected in both cases, indicating that endogenous JSAP1 and Raf-1 form a complex. The observations that JSAP1 binds Raf-1 and MEK1, which are MAPKKK and MAPKK, respectively, in the ERK MAPK cascades, suggest the involvement of JSAP1 in the ERK cascades. To examine this possibility, we first analyzed the effect of overexpressing JSAP1 on the activation of ERK by PMA. Flag-ERK2 was transiently coexpressed with or without His-S-JSAP1-FL, His-S-JSAP1-ΔC, or His-S-JSAP1-C in COS-7 cells. After treating the cells with PMA (100 ng/ml) for 10 min, the tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody, and the kinase activity was measured using MBP as the substrate (Fig. 4 A). The activation of ERK2 was completely inhibited by the overexpression of JSAP1-FL and JSAP1-C, both of which contain the MEK1- and Raf-1-binding region. In contrast, JSAP1-ΔC, which lacks this region, showed only a marginal effect on the activation of ERK2. These results suggest that JSAP1 suppresses the activation of ERK by PMA through its interaction with Raf-1 and/or MEK1. Because Raf-1 binds directly to JSAP1, and the COOH-terminal half of Raf-1, which contains the kinase domain, is involved in the binding, we investigated whether overexpression of JSAP1 inhibits the activation of ERK2 by truncated Raf-1 (Raf-C; residues 316–648), a constitutively active Raf-1 (17Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The protein kinase activity of ERK2 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells was measured by immune-complex kinase assays as described above. The activation of ERK2 by Raf-C was almost completely inhibited by coexpressing with JSAP1-FL or JSAP1-C, but not with JSAP1-ΔC (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that JSAP1-bound Raf-1 cannot phosphorylate and activate MEK1. To clarify this issue, we investigated whether JSAP1 inhibits the phosphorylation of the active site of MEK1 by Raf-C (Fig. 5). His-S-MEK1 was transiently coexpressed with or without Myc-tagged Raf-C in COS-7 cells, pulled down using S-protein-agarose, and examined by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific anti-MEK antibody. The phosphorylation of MEK1 was completely blocked by coexpressing His-S-JSAP1-FL or His-S-JSAP1-C, but not His-S-JSAP1-ΔC. These results, together with the results shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, indicate that JSAP1 prevents MEK1 phosphorylation and activation by Raf-1 through direct interaction with Raf-1, resulting in suppression of the activation of ERK. We proceeded to confirm the above conclusion. Flag-tagged full-length Raf-1 was transiently coexpressed with or without Myc-tagged Ras(V12), a constitutively active Ha-Ras (18Hancock J.F. Marshall C.J. McKay I.A. Gardner S. Houslay M.D. Hall A. Wakelam M.J.O. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar), in COS-7 cells. The tagged Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts with an anti-Flag antibody and examined for its ability to phosphorylate a Trx-His-S fusion protein of MEK1(R97), a kinase-negative MEK1, in the presence or absence of Trx-His-S-JSAP1-C (residues 1054–1305) (Fig. 6). The Raf-1 kinase activity was inhibited by the JSAP1-C fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner. In the present study, we found that JSAP1 prevents the activation of ERK by PMA or a constitutively active Raf-1 and that it does so by interfering with the phosphorylation and activation of MEK1 by Raf-1. Our and R. J. Davis's groups previously reported that JSAP1 works as a putative scaffold protein in the JNK cascades (14Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, JSAP1 might be involved in determining to what extent the ERK and JNK cascades can be activated. A higher level of JSAP1 would lower the activation of the ERK cascades, and in contrast, would facilitate the activation of the JNK cascades. Recently, Yeung et al. (19Yeung K. Janosch P. McFrran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) reported that the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) interferes with MEK1 phosphorylation and activation by Raf-1. Moreover, they showed that RKIP dissociates a Raf-1-MEK1 complex and behaves as a competitive inhibitor of MEK1 phosphorylation (19Yeung K. Janosch P. McFrran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). JSAP1 also exerted its inhibitory effects at the Raf-1/MEK1 interface, and both the MEK1- and Raf-1-binding regions were mapped to the COOH-terminal region (residues 1054–1305) of JSAP1. JSAP1, therefore, may inhibit Raf-1 in a similar way to RKIP. It is also possible that JSAP1 simultaneously binds MEK1 and Raf-1. If this were the case, JSAP1 might keep Raf-1 separate from MEK1 by forming a complex that prevented MEK1 phosphorylation and activation by Raf-1. Further study will be required to clarify this issue. The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 serves as a useful model of neuronal differentiation. Sustained, but not transient, activation of ERK leads to differentiation of PC12 cells (11Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression level of JSAP1 increased during differentiation induced by nerve growth factor 2M. Ito and K. Yoshioka, unpublished results. (15Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At present it is not clear whether or how JSAP1 is involved in the process of differentiation. After the commitment of PC12 cells to differentiation, the cells would not require prolonged and high levels of ERK kinase activity. JSAP1's inhibition of the ERK cascades might be required for the post-commitment processes. In addition, JSAP1 expression might be up-regulated by ERK, which in turn would lead to the suppression of the activation of ERK. We thank Dr. Takashi Ito for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2313075543,"We have previously identified NPDC-1, a neural factor involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation, and we have shown that the stable introduction of NPDC-1 into transformed cells down-regulates cell proliferation both by increasing the generation time and by suppressing transformed properties. The data presented here indicate that, in vitro, NPDC-1 is able to interact with the transcription factor E2F-1 and some cell cycle proteins, such as D-cyclins and cdk2. In addition, two-hybrid experiments in mammalian cells show that the interaction between NPDC-1 and E2F-1 can also occur in vivo. This interaction reduces the binding of E2F-1 to DNA and its transcriptional activity. Taken together, the data suggest that NPDC-1 could influence cell cycle progression and neural differentiation through its association with E2F-1."
https://openalex.org/W2315508536,"Raf-1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that functions as a central component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Raf-1 activity is currently assayed in vitro by either measuring 32P incorporation into MEK, Raf-1’s only characterized substrate, or by using the phosphorylated MEK to initiate a coupled assay culminating in the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by MAP kinase. These assays are plagued by a potential lack of specificity in the case of the former, and the time consuming and error-prone nature of the later indirect assay. In this report, we demonstrate a novel single step assay for Raf-1 kinase activity based on phosphorylation of recombinant MEK-1, detected using an activation-specific MEK antibody that recognizes MEK only when specifically phosphorylated by Raf-1 on Ser 217 and Ser 221. The assay readily detected stem cell factor-mediated Raf-1 activation. MEK phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated Raf-1 plateaued at 10 min following initiation of the kinase reaction and was completely dependent on the inclusion of Raf-1. There was a linear correlation between the degree of MEK phosphorylation and the amount of Raf-1 protein immunoprecipitated. In addition to detecting growth factor-mediated activation, the assay was also able to detect paclitaxel-mediated Raf-1 activation. This assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific and therefore is a marked improvement over currently utilized techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2312341819,"Type I Interferon (IFN) and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) inhibit cell proliferation of squamous carcinoma cell lines (SCC). Examinations of growth-affected cell populations show that SCC lines ME-180 and SiHa treated with IFN-β undergo a specific slower progression through the S phase that seems to trigger cellular death. In combination treatment RA potentiates IFN-β effect in SCC ME-180 but not in SiHa cell line, partially resistant to RA antiproliferative action. RA added as single agent affects cell proliferation differently by inducing a slight G1 accumulation. The IFN-β-induced S phase lengthening parallels the increased expression of PML, a nuclear phosphoprotein specifically up-regulated at transcriptional level by IFN, whose overexpression induces cell growth inhibition and tumor suppression. We report that PML up-regulation may account for the alteration of cell cycle progression induced by IFN-β in SCC by infecting cells with PML-PINCO recombinant retrovirus carrying the PML-3 cDNA under the control of the 5′ LTR. In fact PML overexpression reproduces the IFN-β-induced S phase lengthening. These findings provide important insight into the mechanism of tumor suppressing function of PML and could allow PML to be included in the pathways responsible for IFN-induced cell growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2327145068,"We examined p53 protein stability and DNA damage-induced p53-dependent responses in a human leukemic CEM cell line and two teniposide-resistant sublines, CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5 ( approximately 40 and 400-fold resistant to teniposide, respectively). Although all cell lines contain the same p53 mutations at codons 175 (Arg-->His) and 248 (Arg-->Gln), the constitutive levels of p53 were progressively increased with the resistance of the cells to teniposide. By pulse-chase experiments, we found that the half-lives of mutant p53 protein were approximately 12, 17, and >30 h in CEM, CEM/VM-1, and CEM/VM-1-5 cells, respectively. The prolonged half-lives of p53 in these cells is consistent with the fact that the protein harbors the indicated mutations. Of note, however, is the fact that the increased p53 protein half-lives in the two drug-resistant cell lines corresponds to a proportional decrease in MDM2 protein levels but an increase in p53-MDM2 binding interactions. This suggests that MDM2-mediated p53 degradation may be altered in our leukemic cell lines. The DNA damage-induced p53 response is fully functional in the drug-sensitive CEM cells containing a mutant p53, but this pathway is attenuated in the drug-resistant cells. Specifically, while the mutant p53 was phosphorylated at serine-15 in response to ionizing radiation in all these cell lines, mutant p53 induction in response to teniposide or ionizing radiation and induction of the p53-target genes, p21 and GADD45 only occurred in the drug-sensitive CEM cells. As assessed by MTT cytotoxicity assay, CEM cells were also significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation, compared to the drug-resistant cell lines, and this correlated with p53 induction. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in constitutive mutant p53 protein levels, p53-MDM2 binding interactions, and altered regulation of the DNA damage-inducible p53-dependent pathway may play a role in drug- and radiation-responsiveness in these cells."

The present article reports, for the first time, an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, ATBI, from an extremophilic Bacillus sp. The inhibitor is found to be a hydrophilic peptide with Mr of 1147, and an amino acid sequence of Ala-Gly-Lys-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Pro-Pro-Glu. Sequence homology exhibited no similarity with the reported peptidic inhibitors of HIV-1 PR. Investigation of the kinetics of the enzyme-inhibitor interactions revealed that ATBI is a noncompetitive and tight binding inhibitor with the IC50 and K i values 18.0 and 17.8 nm, respectively. The binding of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the subsequent induction of the localized conformational changes in the flap region of the HIV-1 PR were monitored by exploiting the intrinsic fluorescence of the surface exposed Trp-42 residues, which are present at the proximity of the flaps. We have demonstrated by fluorescence and circular dichroism studies that ATBI binds in the active site of the HIV-1 PR and thereby leads to the inactivation of the enzyme. Based on our results, we propose that the inactivation is due to the reorganization of the flaps impairing its flexibility leading toward inaccessibility of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme.

During the replication cycle of HIV, gag andgag-pol gene products are translated as polyproteins.

The aspartic proteases are a large family of enzymes with diverse functional roles that also share a number of structural features (11Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

One such feature is called the flap, which lies above the active site cleft. By sequence alignment, the conserved sequence domain of the flap region begins at position 47 of the HIV-1 PR sequence and extends through the Gly at position 52. These residues form a short stretch of β-sheet followed by a turn that ends with the conserved Gly at position 52 (13). The crystallographic structures of HIV-1 PR-inhibitor complexes demonstrated that the binding of a peptide analogue inhibitor or a peptide substrate involves numerous hydrogen-bonding interactions with the highly mobile flaps (13Miller M.

Movement of these flaps apparently accompanies the binding of the peptide analogue or substrate, which binds in an extended β-sheet, such that hydrogen bonds are established between the complementary carbonyl oxygens and the amide protons of the peptide within the flaps. The presumed function of the flap-peptide interactions is to entrap and align the scissile peptide sequence in the HIV-1 PR active site (14Rodriguez E.J. Debouck C. Deckmann I.C. Abu-Soud H.

However, a lacuna of literature on biomolecules from microorganisms still exists. The present study deals with the isolation of an inhibitor, ATBI, of HIV-1 PR from an extremophilic Bacillussp. and the evaluation of its kinetic parameters. Fluorescence spectroscopic studies revealed that ATBI binds in the active site of the HIV-1 PR and is the first report of a noncompetitive inhibitor from an extremophilic microorganism. It is well established that the Trp-42 is present adjacent to the flaps, and the flap regions of HIV-1 PR are the only dynamically flexible portions of the enzyme (19Rutenber E. Fauman E.B. Keenan R.J. Fong S. Furth P.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Meng E. Kuntz I.D. DeCamp D.L. Salto R. Rose J.R. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M. J. Biol.

We have investigated the conformational changes induced in the flap regions of the HIV-1 PR by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp residues and the effects on the secondary structure of the HIV-1 PR, by circular dichroism studies, upon binding of ATBI. We have also compared the results obtained with that of the substrate and active site-directed inhibitors of the HIV-1 PR. These results demonstrated that the enzyme inactivation is caused by the loss of the flexibility of the flaps restricting the entry and exit of the polypeptide substrate and products.DISCUSSIONThe present paper describes a spectrofluorometric approach toward investigating the localized conformational changes induced in the HIV-1 PR upon binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor ATBI. We have shown by analyzing the kinetic parameters of the interactions of the HIV-1 PR and the inhibitor that Michaelis-Menten kinetics cannot be applied for this inhibition study. The failure of substrate protection against HIV-1 PR inhibition by ATBI and the nondissociative nature of the HIV-1 PR-ATBI complex with multiple dilutions and washings led us to apply tight binding inhibition kinetics. The short time observed for the inhibition mandated performance of the kinetics under second-order rate conditions. Observed α and β values for ATBI were independent of the substrate concentration and relatively constant, implying that the binding of the inhibitor was not influenced by the binding of the substrate. However, a typical rectangular hyperbola resulted in a reciprocal plot of 1/β versus [S]. We have concluded, by using a diagnostic plot of Δβ versus [S], that the inactivation of the HIV-1 PR by ATBI was noncompetitive.Deciphering the crystal structure of the HIV PR and its inhibitor complexes has gained immense interest among the crystallographers in the last decade. From the available crystallographic data, it is deduced that binding of substrate or peptide-analogue inhibitors in the substrate-binding site of HIV-1 PR induces conformational changes in the flaps (3Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 14Rodriguez E.J. Debouck C. Deckmann I.C. Abu-Soud H. Raushel F.M. Meek T.D.

Kohlbrenner W.E. Simmer R. Helfrich R. Paul D.A. Knigge M. Science. 1990; 49: 527-533Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The apparent function of these flaps is to force the peptide substrate into a β-sheet in the active site and to correctly position its scissile bond between the two catalytic aspartyl residues. The flaps accomplish this by the establishment of a series of hydrogen-bonding interactions between amide nitrogens and carbonoyl oxygens of the peptide substrate. Our interpretation for the changes observed in the secondary structure of the HIV-1 PR due to the binding of the substrate to the active site can be correlated to the inward movement of the flaps. It is significant to note that the secondary structure of the HIV-1 PR undergoes similar pattern of changes upon binding of the substrate or inhibitor. Thus, we have attributed the observed secondary structure changes in the HIV-1 PR-ATBI complex to the inward movement of the flaps of the HIV-1 PR. The noncompetitive nature of the inhibitor may be addressed due to the better binding affinity of the inhibitor to the active site than the substrate. This, however, does not exclude the possibility of the differential binding pockets for the inhibitor and the substrate in the active site of the enzyme.The tryptophanyl fluorescence appears to be uniquely sensitive to shielding by a variety of ligands because of the propensity of the excited indole nucleus to emit energy in the excited state. The Trp residues (A-42 and B-42) of the HIV-1 PR are present next to the Lys-43, the first residue of the flap region, which extends from Lys-43 to Arg-57 (Fig. 7) (19Rutenber E. Fauman E.B. Keenan R.J. Fong S. Furth P.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Meng E. Kuntz I.D. DeCamp D.L. Salto R. Rose J.R. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15343-15346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There have been reports of introducing a Trp residue, which would act as a highly specific reporter to monitor the structural changes in the flap regions by substrate-inhibitor binding (14Rodriguez E.J. Debouck C. Deckmann I.C. Abu-Soud H. Raushel F.M. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the site-directed mutagenesis studies of the HIV-1 PR have revealed that the enzymatic activity is extremely sensitive to mutations in the flap regions (39Loeb D.D. Swanstrom R. Everitt L. Manchester M. Stamper S.E. Hutchinson III, C.A. Nature. 1989; 340: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The inhibitors that bind to the active site also bind to the inner face of the flaps of the HIV-1 PR. The binding of the inhibitor-substrate and the subsequent movement of the flaps may have influence on the intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp-42 residues. Based on the above assumption, we have exploited these two Trp residues of the HIV-1 PR to investigate the localized conformational changes induced upon substrate or inhibitor binding. Our foregoing results have suggested that ATBI binds in the active site of the enzyme and is a unique example where the conformational changes in the flaps were investigated by monitoring the radiative decay of the π-π* transition from the Trp residues without mutating any of the residues in the flaps. The fluorescence quenching of the HIV-1 PR by ATBI revealed that the binding of the inhibitor reduces the quantum yield of the Trp emission. These results were further corroborated by the quenching studies of the HIV-1 PR in the presence of the substrate and the known competitive inhibitors. The inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by N-acetyl-Leu-Val-Phe-Al (where Al is aldehyde) and pepstatin is well documented. The quenching of the tryptophanyl fluorescence upon binding of the substrate or the active site inhibitors can be very well explained by the shielding effect of the Trp residues due to the inward movement of the flaps. The comparison of the emission spectra of the HIV-1 PR upon binding of ATBI with that of the substrate or the active site inhibitors led us to conclude that ATBI binds to the active site of the enzyme and induces the inward movement of the flaps, thereby reducing the radiative decay of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence. The concentration-dependent quenching of Trp fluorescence showed that λmax did not undergo any red or blue shift, wherein the quenching of fluorescence was considerably high. These findings indicated that the polarity of the Trp environment was negligibly altered after binding of the inhibitor, suggesting minimal conformational changes in the tertiary structure of the HIV-1 PR.The majority of the inhibitors of HIV-1 PR are hydrophobic in nature. There is a scarcity of hydrophilic peptidic inhibitors of HIV-1 PR, which is significant for the bioavailability of the drug. Inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by the hydrophilic peptides derived from the transframe region of gag-pol has been reported (40Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The transframe octapeptide Phe-Leu-Arg-Glu-Asp-Leu-Ala-Phe, the N terminus of the transframe octapeptide, and its analogues are competitive inhibitors of the mature HIV-1 PR. The tripeptides Glu-Asp-Leu and Glu-Asp-Phe derived from the transframe octapeptide were found to be most potent. The x-ray crystallographic studies showed the interactions of Glu at P2 and Leu at P1 of Glu-Asp-Leu with residues of the active site of the HIV-1 PR. As a hydrophilic inhibitor containing residues Asp, Ala, and Glu, ATBI may have a similar mode of interaction with the residues in the active site of the HIV-1 PR to that of the transframe octapeptide, but it is not feasible to understand the interactions at the atomic level at present. However, the crystal structure will aid in understanding the mechanism of inactivation of the HIV-1 PR by ATBI. With the existing experimental evidence, we visualize that the charged side chains of the amino acids, the amide nitrogens, and the carbonoyl oxygen groups of ATBI could form many intermolecular hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions (van der Waals, ionic, etc.) with the β-sheet of the flaps and with the other residues present in or near the active site. Further, we propose that the tight binding and noncompetitive nature of ATBI in conjunction with the multiple nonbonded interactions may be sufficient to cause the loss of the dynamic flexibility of the flaps, which is crucial for the substrate binding and catalysis of the enzyme. A schematic diagram representing the proposed mechanism is depicted in Fig. 7. The noncompetitive nature of the ATBI indicated that the inhibitor-complexed form of the HIV-1 PR loses its binding ability to the substrate, since the flaps can no more open up for the substrate to be aligned in the active site of the HIV-1 PR, which subsequently results in the inactivation of the enzyme. These observations are at variance with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme in the absence of ATBI, where the flexibility of the flaps can be regained after catalysis.Inhibitors directed toward the active site of the HIV-1 PR are well documented (41Swain A.L. Miller M.M. Green J. Rich D.H. Schneider J. Kent S.B. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8805-8809Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 42Jaskolski M. Tomasselli A.G.

Despite their loss in potency due to the spontaneous mutations occurring in the active site (29Gulnik S.V. Suvorov L.I. Liu B., Yu, B. Anderson B. Mitsuya H. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9282-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 43Ermolief J. Lin X. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12364-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) leading toward the drug resistance behavior of the virus, there is a paucity of literature on noncompetitive inhibitors. A constant search for the new class of HIV-1 PR inhibitors with high potency is a frontier area of biomedical research. The side chains of the peptidic inhibitor ATBI, which are capable of forming many nonbonded interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, etc.) with the enzyme, might result in superior resistance characteristics in comparison with the competitive inhibitors. ATBI, as proposed, could interact with the backbone of the β-sheet of the flaps of the HIV-1 PR, thus eliminating the probability of drug resistance by a single mutation. ATBI, by virtue of its unique sequence and noncompetitive mode of inhibition, may represent a new class of inhibitors of the HIV-1 PR and could open up a new horizon for the development of lead molecules. HIV-11 protease (PR) has been classified as an aspartic protease that functions as a homodimer, based on its primary amino acid sequence, its inhibition by pepstatin, and its crystal structure (1Ratner L.

The apparent function of these flaps is to force the peptide substrate into a β-sheet in the active site and to correctly position its scissile bond between the two catalytic aspartyl residues. The flaps accomplish this by the establishment of a series of hydrogen-bonding interactions between amide nitrogens and carbonoyl oxygens of the peptide substrate. Our interpretation for the changes observed in the secondary structure of the HIV-1 PR due to the binding of the substrate to the active site can be correlated to the inward movement of the flaps. It is significant to note that the secondary structure of the HIV-1 PR undergoes similar pattern of changes upon binding of the substrate or inhibitor. Thus, we have attributed the observed secondary structure changes in the HIV-1 PR-ATBI complex to the inward movement of the flaps of the HIV-1 PR. The noncompetitive nature of the inhibitor may be addressed due to the better binding affinity of the inhibitor to the active site than the substrate. This, however, does not exclude the possibility of the differential binding pockets for the inhibitor and the substrate in the active site of the enzyme.The tryptophanyl fluorescence appears to be uniquely sensitive to shielding by a variety of ligands because of the propensity of the excited indole nucleus to emit energy in the excited state. The Trp residues (A-42 and B-42) of the HIV-1 PR are present next to the Lys-43, the first residue of the flap region, which extends from Lys-43 to Arg-57 (Fig. 7) (19Rutenber E. Fauman E.B. Keenan R.J. Fong S. Furth P.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Meng E. Kuntz I.D. DeCamp D.L. Salto R. Rose J.R. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15343-15346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There have been reports of introducing a Trp residue, which would act as a highly specific reporter to monitor the structural changes in the flap regions by substrate-inhibitor binding (14Rodriguez E.J. Debouck C. Deckmann I.C. Abu-Soud H. Raushel F.M. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the site-directed mutagenesis studies of the HIV-1 PR have revealed that the enzymatic activity is extremely sensitive to mutations in the flap regions (39Loeb D.D. Swanstrom R. Everitt L. Manchester M. Stamper S.E. Hutchinson III, C.A. Nature. 1989; 340: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The inhibitors that bind to the active site also bind to the inner face of the flaps of the HIV-1 PR. The binding of the inhibitor-substrate and the subsequent movement of the flaps may have influence on the intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp-42 residues. Based on the above assumption, we have exploited these two Trp residues of the HIV-1 PR to investigate the localized conformational changes induced upon substrate or inhibitor binding. Our foregoing results have suggested that ATBI binds in the active site of the enzyme and is a unique example where the conformational changes in the flaps were investigated by monitoring the radiative decay of the π-π* transition from the Trp residues without mutating any of the residues in the flaps. The fluorescence quenching of the HIV-1 PR by ATBI revealed that the binding of the inhibitor reduces the quantum yield of the Trp emission. These results were further corroborated by the quenching studies of the HIV-1 PR in the presence of the substrate and the known competitive inhibitors. The inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by N-acetyl-Leu-Val-Phe-Al (where Al is aldehyde) and pepstatin is well documented. The quenching of the tryptophanyl fluorescence upon binding of the substrate or the active site inhibitors can be very well explained by the shielding effect of the Trp residues due to the inward movement of the flaps. The comparison of the emission spectra of the HIV-1 PR upon binding of ATBI with that of the substrate or the active site inhibitors led us to conclude that ATBI binds to the active site of the enzyme and induces the inward movement of the flaps, thereby reducing the radiative decay of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence. The concentration-dependent quenching of Trp fluorescence showed that λmax did not undergo any red or blue shift, wherein the quenching of fluorescence was considerably high. These findings indicated that the polarity of the Trp environment was negligibly altered after binding of the inhibitor, suggesting minimal conformational changes in the tertiary structure of the HIV-1 PR.The majority of the inhibitors of HIV-1 PR are hydrophobic in nature. There is a scarcity of hydrophilic peptidic inhibitors of HIV-1 PR, which is significant for the bioavailability of the drug. Inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by the hydrophilic peptides derived from the transframe region of gag-pol has been reported (40Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The transframe octapeptide Phe-Leu-Arg-Glu-Asp-Leu-Ala-Phe, the N terminus of the transframe octapeptide, and its analogues are competitive inhibitors of the mature HIV-1 PR. The tripeptides Glu-Asp-Leu and Glu-Asp-Phe derived from the transframe octapeptide were found to be most potent. The x-ray crystallographic studies showed the interactions of Glu at P2 and Leu at P1 of Glu-Asp-Leu with residues of the active site of the HIV-1 PR. As a hydrophilic inhibitor containing residues Asp, Ala, and Glu, ATBI may have a similar mode of interaction with the residues in the active site of the HIV-1 PR to that of the transframe octapeptide, but it is not feasible to understand the interactions at the atomic level at present. However, the crystal structure will aid in understanding the mechanism of inactivation of the HIV-1 PR by ATBI. With the existing experimental evidence, we visualize that the charged side chains of the amino acids, the amide nitrogens, and the carbonoyl oxygen groups of ATBI could form many intermolecular hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions (van der Waals, ionic, etc.) with the β-sheet of the flaps and with the other residues present in or near the active site. Further, we propose that the tight binding and noncompetitive nature of ATBI in conjunction with the multiple nonbonded interactions may be sufficient to cause the loss of the dynamic flexibility of the flaps, which is crucial for the substrate binding and catalysis of the enzyme. A schematic diagram representing the proposed mechanism is depicted in Fig. 7. The noncompetitive nature of the ATBI indicated that the inhibitor-complexed form of the HIV-1 PR loses its binding ability to the substrate, since the flaps can no more open up for the substrate to be aligned in the active site of the HIV-1 PR, which subsequently results in the inactivation of the enzyme. These observations are at variance with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme in the absence of ATBI, where the flexibility of the flaps can be regained after catalysis.Inhibitors directed toward the active site of the HIV-1 PR are well documented (41Swain A.L.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12364-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) leading toward the drug resistance behavior of the virus, there is a paucity of literature on noncompetitive inhibitors. A constant search for the new class of HIV-1 PR inhibitors with high potency is a frontier area of biomedical research. The side chains of the peptidic inhibitor ATBI, which are capable of forming many nonbonded interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, etc.) with the enzyme, might result in superior resistance characteristics in comparison with the competitive inhibitors. ATBI, as proposed, could interact with the backbone of the β-sheet of the flaps of the HIV-1 PR, thus eliminating the probability of drug resistance by a single mutation. ATBI, by virtue of its unique sequence and noncompetitive mode of inhibition, may represent a new class of inhibitors of the HIV-1 PR and could open up a new horizon for the development of lead molecules. The present paper describes a spectrofluorometric approach toward investigating the localized conformational changes induced in the HIV-1 PR upon binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor ATBI. We have shown by analyzing the kinetic parameters of the interactions of the HIV-1 PR and the inhibitor that Michaelis-Menten kinetics cannot be applied for this inhibition study. The failure of substrate protection against HIV-1 PR inhibition by ATBI and the nondissociative nature of the HIV-1 PR-ATBI complex with multiple dilutions and washings led us to apply tight binding inhibition kinetics. The short time observed for the inhibition mandated performance of the kinetics under second-order rate conditions. Observed α and β values for ATBI were independent of the substrate concentration and relatively constant, implying that the binding of the inhibitor was not influenced by the binding of the substrate. However, a typical rectangular hyperbola resulted in a reciprocal plot of 1/β versus [S]. We have concluded, by using a diagnostic plot of Δβ versus [S], that the inactivation of the HIV-1 PR by ATBI was noncompetitive. Deciphering the crystal structure of the HIV PR and its inhibitor complexes has gained immense interest among the crystallographers in the last decade. From the available crystallographic data, it is deduced that binding of substrate or peptide-analogue inhibitors in the substrate-binding site of HIV-1 PR induces conformational changes in the flaps (3Pearl L.H.

Site-directed mutations at residue 64 had the greatest effect on aspartate binding. No residue could substitute for the native arginine; all changes resulted in an apparentK d of ∼35 mm. These mutations had little impact on maltose responses. At residue Arg-69, a lysine substitution was least disruptive, conferring an apparentK d of 0.3 mm for aspartate. Results obtained for an alanine mutant were similar to those with cysteine and histidine mutants (K d ∼5 mm) indicating that side chain size was not an important factor here. Proline and aspartate caused more severe defects, presumably for reasons related to conformation and charge. The impact of residue 69 mutations on the maltose response was small. Mutations at Arg-73 had similar effects on aspartate binding (K d 0.3–7 mm) but more severe consequences for maltose responses. Larger side chains resulted in the best aspartate binding, implying steric considerations are important here. Signaling in the mutant proteins was surprisingly robust.

The proteins of the chemotaxis system allow the sensing of chemical signals and the use of that information to direct appropriate swimming behavior (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 2Mowbray S.L. Sandgren M.O.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Signal reception is the task of receptors found in the cytoplasmic membrane that either recognize a chemical of interest directly or indirectly through the mediation of a periplasmic binding protein. The best characterized of these proteins is the aspartate receptor, the product of thetar gene. This 60-kDa membrane protein (3Russo A.F. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1983; 220: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) can bind to aspartate or glutamate directly (4Clarke S. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9695-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Tar1 receptors fromEscherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium have 79% sequence identity, only E. coli Tar can recognize the complex between maltose-binding protein (MBP) and maltose (5Mizuno T. Mutoh N. Panasenko S.M. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 890-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that aspartate and maltose responses are largely independent, i.e. both attractants can be recognized simultaneously or sequentially (6Wolff C. Genetic and Biochemical Studies of Maltose Chemotaxis in Escherichia coli.M.Sc. thesis. University of Konstanz, Germany1983Google Scholar, 7Mowbray S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E.

The structure of intact Tar is not yet known, although many studies have combined to give a rather comprehensive picture of its structure. The sequence (3Russo A.F. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1983; 220: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) first suggested its functional organization. The receptor has a short N-terminal segment (residues 1–6) on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. A short hydrophobic segment (residues 7–30) then crosses to the periplasm, where a soluble domain (residues 31–188) capable of binding aspartate is located. A second membrane-spanning sequence (residues 189–212) brings the receptor back to the cytoplasm. The remainder of the protein (amino acids 213–552) composes a soluble cytoplasmic unit that possesses the signaling and adaptation properties of the receptor. That the smallest functional unit is a dimer was first established by cross-linking of mutant cysteine-bearing receptors (9Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was later confirmed by the x-ray structure of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor (Fig.1 A (10Milburn M. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar)). The four-helix bundle of each periplasmic domain is connected to the two transmembrane segments through extensions of α1 and α4. As found for the periplasmic regions, the two α1 extensions of the dimer appear to be in close proximity in the membrane, whereas the α4 extensions are further apart (11Lynch B.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The structure of the greater part of the cytoplasmic domain of the related serine receptor has been shown to consist of a very long coiled coil in which two antiparallel helices from each subunit are packed onto each other in a four-helix bundle; in this portion of the receptor it is the extensions of α4 that form the basis of inter-subunit contacts (12Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). There are two sites for aspartate binding in the dimer, each incorporating residues from both subunits (Fig. 1). Binding of aspartate to one of the sites hinders binding of the second effector molecule through negative cooperativity (13Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19991-19997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect is modest in the case of Salmonella Tar, but the affinity at the second site of E. coli Tar is reduced at least 50-fold (14Biemann H.-P. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Responses resulting from aspartate binding require the action of a set of cytoplasmic and flagellar proteins that control swimming. Adaptation is associated with the reversible methylation of specific glutamates on the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor itself (15Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Terwilliger T.C. Bogonez E. Wang E.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9608-9611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although more is presently known about this signaling system than any other, many mysteries remain, including the means by which the receptor conveys information about ligand binding into the cell. Tar is a dimer both in the presence and absence of ligand (9Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), precluding monomer-dimer equilibria as a mechanism for transmembrane signaling. Key changes within an existing dimer could include relative motions of the two subunits, as well as motions within a subunit. Most structural studies suggest the former (10Milburn M. Privé G.G.

In the present paper, we describe a study of site-directed mutations in the binding site of E. coli Tar. The residues chosen for this work are Arg-64, Arg-69, and Arg-73, which are conserved in all receptors that bind amino acids (21Wolff C. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4509-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and so are presumably central to receptor function. We explore the significance of the results in the light of available data on receptor structure and biology. Maltose (PM grade) was obtained from Merck, and aspartate (ultragrade) was from the Sigma. Unlabeled Ado-Met (Sigma grade I, iodide salt) was purified using an anion exchange resin (Dowex AG 1 × 8) to removeS-adenosylhomocysteine, an inhibitor of methyltransferase, and then stored at −80 °C. Radiolabeled AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4891-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). The final buffer used in dialysis contained 1 mm1,10-o-phenanthroline and 1 mm PMSF; dialyzed cytosols were stored at −80 °C. Strains carrying other Tar mutants (R64C, R69C, R69H, R73W, and R73Q (21Wolff C. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4509-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were the generous gifts of J. S. Parkinson and C. Wolff. The plasmid pMK650, which bearsE. coli Tar as well as ampicillin resistance, was described previously (7Mowbray S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 171-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were 21-mers generating changes of E. coli Tar residues Arg-64 and Arg-69 to Ala, Asp, Lys, Pro, and Ser and Arg-73 to Cys, Asp, Lys, Pro, and Ser by single- or double-base substitutions. Site-directed mutagenesis of pMK650 was carried out by standard methods. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For in vivo chemotaxis assays, cells grown in Luria broth were inoculated with a sterile stick into the center of a Petri dish containing Vogel-Bonner citrate medium (25Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1% glycerol, 0.3% agar (Difco), and 50 μg/ml each His, Leu, Met, Thr, and thiamine, with or without attractant added, as specified, and with or without ampicillin (150 μg/ml) as needed. The radii of swarms were measured during growth at 30 °C, at 4–6 time points between 24 and 48 h. The lines fit to such data points had correlation coefficients ranging from 0.97 to 1.0. Cell growth and membrane preparation were as described earlier (26Mowbray S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15638-15643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were routinely broken using a French press (2 passes at 5000–6000 pounds/square inch) rather than by sonication. Washed membranes were stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm1,10-o-phenanthroline, 1 mm PMSF. Expression of mutant receptors was evaluated by SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blots. In vitro methylation/binding assays (16Terwilliger T.C. Bogonez E. Wang E.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9608-9611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and 1 mm PMSF. Aspartate concentrations were chosen where possible to represent multiple points both above and below theK d of the particular receptor (as determined from preliminary experiments), with the highest concentration always at least 60 mm. Samples were taken at 15 and 90 min to observe both early and late stages of the modification process. The methylation obtained for RP4080pEMBL19 was subtracted from each value to account for methylation due to chromosomal receptor expression (less than 10% of the total). Methylation data were analyzed in terms of two aspartate-binding constants in the program Mathematica (Wolfram Research), using Equation 1, Cb=c(K1[Asp]+2K1·K2·[Asp]2)/(1+K1[Asp]+K1·K2[Asp]2)Equation 1 where Cb is the difference between the counts/min obtained in the sample containing aspartate and that for the corresponding sample without aspartate; c is equal to half the maximum number of counts expected at aspartate saturation (included in the fitting); K 1 is the measured association constant for the first aspartate site, and K 2 is the measured association constant for the apparent second site; the association constants were subsequently converted toK d values for presentation. It was assumed that the concentration of free aspartate was the same as that added, except for the wild-type Tar, where K d 1 was similar to the receptor concentration (4 μm), and so a correction was needed. TableI lists the available x-ray structures of the periplasmic effector-binding region of Tar. Coordinates for most were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (27Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.T. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol.

All aspartate-bound structures have a dimer in the asymmetric unit. As all aspartate-free structures contain only a single subunit in the asymmetric unit, the second subunit of the dimer was first generated using crystallographic symmetry. The dimeric structures were compared with thelsq options of the graphics program O (29Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M.O.

A cut-off of 0.6 Å was used to improvement the alignment and to look for changes greater than the expected level of error in the structures.

The behavior of bacteria can be assessed qualitatively with an in vivo swarm assay, in which cells are inoculated into a semi-solid agar medium with or without attractant (at concentrations of 0.1 or 1 mm aspartate, or 0.1 mm maltose, as indicated). As the cells take up the components of the medium, excrete wastes, and multiply, gradients are built up which cause chemotaxis (32Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the present study, RP4372 (tar − , tap − , tsr − , cheB + , cheR +) was transformed with pMK650 (containing wild-type Tar), with mutated versions of the same plasmid, or tested by itself as a control. Representative swarm results are presented in Fig.2. Although differences in the levels of receptor expression, as well as any in transport or metabolism, make quantitative assessments of receptor function unwise, a number of patterns are clear. The background strain alone (RP4372) lacked Tar and exhibited no chemotaxis to either aspartate or maltose; the rate of swarming in the absence of added attractant is also low, due to the inherent smooth-swimming bias of the strain. Overexpression of the wild-type receptor (with pMK650) in the same strain improved swarming somewhat, presumably by reducing that bias. The overproduced receptor also enabled aspartate and maltose responses, with a characteristic pattern of saturation of the response at higher aspartate concentrations. Most of the mutant receptors also brought about a similar improvement of the unstimulated rate, as well as allowing aspartate responses. Mutants R64P and R73D were essentially blind to both attractants, and indeed cells bearing them behave as though they have no functional receptor. For R64P, this is consistent with the lack of observable Tar on SDS gels; the location of residue 64 in the middle of a helix makes this result unremarkable. As R73D was produced at normal levels, the swarm results presumably indicate severely impaired function rather than grossly altered receptor structure. R64D, R64S, and R69A generated modest increases in the unstimulated swimming rate, which could reflect slightly lower levels of deamidation of these mutant receptors and/or different levels of receptor expression (TableII). R73P showed frequent back mutations and so was not tested further. Most mutations generated behavioral patterns that correlated in a straightforward way with the altered residue. Mutations at residue 64 caused decreases in the aspartate response, with little or no effect on maltose chemotaxis. Mutations at residue 69 produced a similar pattern, although with more variation. R69A had slightly higher unstimulated rates and a large maltose response, suggesting that this Tar form may have some alterations in basic signaling properties. R69D also seemed to have some reduction of signaling to both aspartate and maltose. R69K was the least disruptive change; this mutant even showed saturation at the higher aspartate concentration, as observed for the wild-type Tar. Mutations at residue 73 gave rise to receptors with a relatively effective aspartate response but significantly impaired chemotaxis to maltose. The notable exception here was R73D, which had no apparent response to either ligand. These patterns confirm and extend the results of earlier studies (26Mowbray S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15638-15643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gardina P. Conway C. Kossman M. Manson M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1528-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of problems inherent in measuring aspartate affinity to membrane-bound receptor when the binding is weak, an indirect method (26Mowbray S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15638-15643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used, which exploits the proportional relationship between ligand binding and the modification of a receptor by the chemotaxis methyltransferase (15Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This method has the additional advantage that it gives some measure of the signaling/adaptation properties of the receptor. The results were first analyzed with Scatchard plots, which consistently showed a concave biphasic shape indicative of negative cooperativity. Nonlinear curve fitting of the original data was then applied, as this method is considered to be less vulnerable to distortions from systematic experimental errors (34Kermode J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2053-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two sites were ultimately included in the fitting of both wild-type and mutant receptors, as a single site did not adequately reproduce the shape of the curves (despite suggesting a very similar K d 1; Fig.3). The assumption that aspartate binding to the second site results in the same amount of methylation as binding to the first site is implicit in this treatment, although no molecular model for this exists. Assuming that a different amount of methylation arose from binding at the second site did not improve the fit, and so could not be justified, although it remains a very plausible physical situation. The Hill equation (35Hill A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1910; 90: iv-viiGoogle Scholar) with n of the order of 0.8 (i.e. negative cooperativity) performed as well as the two-site model. The values obtained from the two-site fitting are summarized in Table II. Results with different time points did not differ in any systematic way, and therefore averages are given, along with the observed standard error. The apparent affinity of the second site varied in response to a number of experimental factors (including the properties of the different mutants), and so the estimatedK d 2 values are given only for the sake of completeness, as their physical meaning is still unclear. To allow comparison of the various receptors, extrapolation to the maximum methylation expected appeared to be justified, as the methylation generally covered a significant portion of the binding curve. The largest degree of coupling observed in each case, i.e. the increase in methylation found at the highest concentration of aspartate tested, is also reported, although the size of this quantity varied with the specific methyltransferase and AdoMet preparations. It should be noted that the given values for coupling are underestimates of the maximum, since the receptors were not usually fully saturated with aspartate. The estimated affinity of the first site of the wild-type receptor for aspartate (2 μm) agrees well with earlier data obtained using a variety of methods (summarized in Ref. 2Mowbray S.L. Sandgren M.O.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Binding to the second site of E. coli Tar has previously been shown to be disfavored by negative cooperativity (14Biemann H.-P. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), although to an unknown extent. Our results suggest that the affinity of the second site is reduced at least 500-fold. The strain RP4080, which has chromosomal expression levels of Tar and methylesterase (CheB) but lacks methyltransferase (CheR), was used as the background for the methylation studies here instead of RP4372 (tar−, cheB+, cheR+) as used previously (26Mowbray S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15638-15643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During preparation of most membranes, cells were broken in a French press, and previous results were obtained with membranes prepared by sonication. To be certain that no systematic errors arose from these changes, aspartate binding to wild-type Tar was compared for membrane preparations that differed in these respects. The results obtained were very similar. The pair of experiments shown in Table II represents an extreme case, using older radioactive AdoMet (2 years after purchase); the results demonstrate that although the observed methylation and coupling under these circumstances are lower, there is little impact on estimates of binding to the first site. The K d 1values (4–5 μm) are again in good agreement with previo"

The precursor pre-nsLTP is processed to mature nsLTP by proteolytic removal of the presequence, most likely after being imported into peroxisomes. Sterol carrier protein x (SCPx), a 59-kDa branched-chain fatty acid thiolase of peroxisomes, contains the entire pre-nsLTP moiety at the C-terminal part and is converted to the 46-kDa form and nsLTP after the transport to peroxisomes. We investigated which of these two potential topogenic sequences functions in biogenesis of nsLTP and SCPx. Morphological and biochemical analyses, making use of Chinese hamster ovary cell pex mutants such as the PTS1 receptor-impaired pex5 and PTS2 import-defectivepex7, as well as green fluorescent protein chimeras, revealed that both pre-nsLTP and SCPx are imported into peroxisomes by the Pex5p-mediated PTS1 pathway. Nearly half of the pre-nsLTP remains in the cytosol, as assessed by subcellular fractionation of the wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells. In an in vitrobinding assay, only mature nsLTP, but not pre-nsLTP, from the cell lysates interacted with the Pex5p.

The sequence for SCPx contains the full sequence of pre-nsLTP at the C-terminal part and is suggested to be partly converted to the N-terminal part protein of 46 kDa and nsLTP (1Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem.

It is evident that pre-nsLTP contains a cleavable N-terminal 20-amino acid presequence resembling PTS2, as well as PTS1 tripeptide Ala-Lys-Leu (AKL), whereas SCPx possesses internally this 20-amino acid presequence of nsLTP and the C-terminal AKL. However, despite numerous biochemical findings such as those related to the lipid transfer activity, biogenesis of nsLTP and SCPx has not been well defined at the molecular and cellular levels.To address the underlying mechanisms by which nsLTP and SCPx are transported into peroxisomes, we investigated biogenesis of these proteins at morphological, as well as biochemical, levels using several types of peroxisome biogenesis-defective cell mutants and the PTS1 receptor Pex5p. We herein report that import of nsLTP and SCPx was affected in pex5 mutant of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells deficient in import of PTS1 and PTS2, whereas in PTS2 import-defectivepex7 mutant both proteins were imported into peroxisomes as efficiently as in the wild-type CHO-K1. We also observed that nsLTP and SCPx bound to Pex5p. Therefore, these findings strongly suggest that nsLTP and SCPx are imported by the PTS1 translocation pathway. The function of the 20-amino acid presequence in intracellular transport of pre-nsLTP is also discussed.DISCUSSIONpre-nsLTP can be classified as a unique protein among a number of peroxisomal proteins with respect to its topogenic sequence. The cleavable presequence locates at the N terminus, similar to PTS2 of several peroxisomal enzymes such as 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (20Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and the C terminus carries a typical PTS1 tripeptide motif, AKL. Moreover, the amino acid sequence, -AAPT↓SS- (-, continuing to adjacent residues), near the processing site of pre-nsLTP to form mature nsLTP resembles the sequence of PTS2-thiolase, -AAPC↓SS- (-, continuing to adjacent residues), implying that pre-nsLTP and PTS2 proteins may share a potential, yet unidentified processing protease present in peroxisomes. The nsLTP presequence is relatively positive-charged like PTS2, but it does not contain the consensus PTS2 sequence -(R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(H/Q)(L/A)-. This implies that the presequence may be a novel-type PTS. We investigated in the present work which of two potential PTS sequences destines pre-nsLTP to its final intracellular location in vivo. With the use of several CHO pex mutants, import of pre-nsLTP was verified. pre-nsLTP was affected in import in pex2 andpex5 mutants with a phenotype showing import defect of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins, where pre-nsLTP remained in the cytosol. Other groups of investigators reported that nsLTP is likely to be degraded or barely detectable in ZR82, a pex2 CHO mutant (33van Heusden G.P.H. Bos K. Raetz C.R.H. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4105-4110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome (12Suzuki Y. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Tsuneoka M. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although pre-nsLTP was not fully described. In pex7 cell mutant impaired in PTS2 import, pre-nsLTP was translocated as efficiently as in the wild-type CHO-K1. Transport of pre-GFP-AKL was likewise re-established in wild-type and pex7 mutant CHO cells, consistent with the morphological phenotype as assessed for pre-nsLTP. Taken together, we conclude that pre-nsLTP is imported by the Pex5p-mediated PTS1 pathway.To our surprise, pre-GFP-AKL was targeted to mitochondria when expressed in pex2 and pex5 mutants. These results imply that pre-GFP-AKL behaves differently from pre-nsLTP; PTS1 of pre-nsLTP could not be recognized by Pex5p in vitro, whereas AKL of pre-GFP-AKL readily interacted with Pex5p. Despite such biochemical properties, pre-nsLTP is transported to peroxisomes by a Pex5p-dependent pathway in vivo. Moreover, in mutant cells absent from Pex5p, pre-nsLTP remains in the cytoplasm, whereas pre-GFP-AKL is readily transported to mitochondria at least in an over-expression system. The mitochondrial topogenic activity appears to be interfered with in the presequence of pre-nsLTP. Accordingly, the PTS1 and presequence of pre-nsLTP are most likely to be mutually regulated by unknown mechanisms. One possibility includes modulation of PTS1 of pre-nsLTP by direct steric effect of the presequence or that mediated by a cytosolic factor. Alternatively, PTS1 of pre-nsLTP may be partly modified, whereby a portion of total pre-nsLTP no longer interacts with Pex5p and remains in the cytoplasm. In the case of pre-GFP-AKL, the tripeptide AKL is more likely to be exposed to the surface of the molecule, thereby being readily recognized by Pex5p. The presequence may be unable to modulate the PTS1, possibly because of the configuration of this GFP chimera. Furthermore, we identified the presequence as a mitochondrial targeting signal, based on the observation that pre-GFP was targeted to mitochondria in normal and mutant CHO cells.It is noteworthy that the N-terminal sequence encompassing the 20-amino acid presequence plus Ser at position 21 was predicted as a mitochondrial targeting sequence (44% probability) using a recognition program, PSORT II, minimally requiring 21 amino acid residues to be analyzed, where the prediction also included cytoplasmic (26%) and peroxisomal (4%) localization. Secondary structure analysis of the 20-amino acid presequence using a Chou-Fasman program predicted an α-helix between residues at 3–10 and β-sheet structure between the residues 10–17. These characteristics may contribute as a mitochondrial import signal. Therefore, it is tempting to infer that the presequence may interact with the C-terminal PTS1 and regulate peroxisomal transport of pre-nsLTP, possibly in a concerted manner with other cytosolic factors such as chaperones. How the PTS1 and mitochondrial targeting signal-like presequence are regulated in biogenesis of nsLTP in vivo remains to be defined.pre-nsLTP is rather stably present in the cytosol as assessed by subcellular fractionation study and morphological analysis. The modulated presequence may function in vivo as a signal for pre-nsLTP to be a cytosolic protein. If synthesized pre-nsLTP remains in the cytoplasm, nsLTP in peroxisomes may be all derived from SCPx instead of pre-nsLTP by proteolytic conversion. Although we can not exclude this possibility, this may be less likely based on the findings in pulse-chase experiments, where processing of pre-nsLTP to nsLTP was noted (2Tsuneoka M. Yamamoto A. Fujiki Y. Tashiro Y. J. Biochem. 1989; 104: 560-564Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki Y. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Tsuneoka M. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The physiological consequences of pre-nsLTP in the cytosol, nearly at an equal level as nsLTP in peroxisomes in normal CHO cells, also remain to be investigated. The level of cytosolic pre-nsLTP may vary, depending on the cell types from various tissues and organs that are involved in lipid metabolism and steroid biosynthesis (1Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Seedorf U. Ellinghaus P. Nofer J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is also notable that a role of nsLTP and SCPx in peroxisomal α-oxidation of phytanic acid was implicated from the study using nsLTP/SCPx gene null mice (39Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W. Wanders R.J.A. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).SCPx is exclusively localized in peroxisomes where it is converted to the 46-kDa fragment and nsLTP. SCPx is also transported with use of C-terminal AKL via a Pex5p-mediated PTS1 pathway. InPEX5-deficient mutant cells, SCPx is associated with endomembranes such as peroxisomal remnants and mitochondria. It is noteworthy that not only the 59-kDa form but also the 46-kDa fragment are enzymatically active as a branched-chain fatty acid thiolase (15Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Antonenkov V.D. Van Veldhoven P.P. Waelkens E. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 336-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as revealed using specimens from patients with peroxisome-defective disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. Localization of SCPx on endomembranes may be required for such enzymatic activity of the unprocessed form. However, its underlying mechanisms are presently unclear. Exact cleavage sites initially at position 404–405 or 424–425 or both (see Fig. 1 A), as well as physiological significance of this intraperoxisomal processing of SCPx, are not well understood at present. Interestingly, P-44 with thiolase activity and ZK892.2 apparently corresponding to the 46-kDa form of SCPx and nsLTP in mammals, respectively, have both been identified inCaenorhabditis elegans (41Bun-ya M. Maebuchi M. Hashimoto T. Yokota S. Kamiryo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas an orthologue of 59-kDa SCPx has not been detected. Whether accumulation of SCPx in protease-resistant form in the membrane fraction in pex5 andpex2 mutants, as noted in this work, is physiologically relevant or related to clinical phenotypes of peroxisome biogenesis disorders also remains to be defined. The mammalian nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP)1 functions in vitro as a carrier protein in the transfer of a variety of lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol (for a review, see Ref. 1Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is identical to sterol carrier protein 2, stimulates the enzymatic conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol during the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and enhances the synthesis of bile acids (1Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). But, the physiological role of nsLTP is not yet well defined. nsLTP is localized in peroxisomes, as well as the cytoplasm, in several organs such as rat liver (2Tsuneoka M. Yamamoto A. Fujiki Y.

J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). nsLTP is synthesized as a larger precursor, termed pre-nsLTP, with a mass of 15 kDa on free polyribosomes (4Fujiki Y. Tsuneoka M. Tashiro Y. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and then processed to its mature form of 13 kDa (4Fujiki Y. Tsuneoka M. Tashiro Y. J.

Furthermore, we identified the presequence as a mitochondrial targeting signal, based on the observation that pre-GFP was targeted to mitochondria in normal and mutant CHO cells.It is noteworthy that the N-terminal sequence encompassing the 20-amino acid presequence plus Ser at position 21 was predicted as a mitochondrial targeting sequence (44% probability) using a recognition program, PSORT II, minimally requiring 21 amino acid residues to be analyzed, where the prediction also included cytoplasmic (26%) and peroxisomal (4%) localization. Secondary structure analysis of the 20-amino acid presequence using a Chou-Fasman program predicted an α-helix between residues at 3–10 and β-sheet structure between the residues 10–17. These characteristics may contribute as a mitochondrial import signal. Therefore, it is tempting to infer that the presequence may interact with the C-terminal PTS1 and regulate peroxisomal transport of pre-nsLTP, possibly in a concerted manner with other cytosolic factors such as chaperones. How the PTS1 and mitochondrial targeting signal-like presequence are regulated in biogenesis of nsLTP in vivo remains to be defined.pre-nsLTP is rather stably present in the cytosol as assessed by subcellular fractionation study and morphological analysis. The modulated presequence may function in vivo as a signal for pre-nsLTP to be a cytosolic protein. If synthesized pre-nsLTP remains in the cytoplasm, nsLTP in peroxisomes may be all derived from SCPx instead of pre-nsLTP by proteolytic conversion. Although we can not exclude this possibility, this may be less likely based on the findings in pulse-chase experiments, where processing of pre-nsLTP to nsLTP was noted (2Tsuneoka M. Yamamoto A. Fujiki Y. Tashiro Y. J. Biochem. 1989; 104: 560-564Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki Y. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Tsuneoka M. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The physiological consequences of pre-nsLTP in the cytosol, nearly at an equal level as nsLTP in peroxisomes in normal CHO cells, also remain to be investigated. The level of cytosolic pre-nsLTP may vary, depending on the cell types from various tissues and organs that are involved in lipid metabolism and steroid biosynthesis (1Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Seedorf U. Ellinghaus P. Nofer J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is also notable that a role of nsLTP and SCPx in peroxisomal α-oxidation of phytanic acid was implicated from the study using nsLTP/SCPx gene null mice (39Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W. Wanders R.J.A. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).SCPx is exclusively localized in peroxisomes where it is converted to the 46-kDa fragment and nsLTP. SCPx is also transported with use of C-terminal AKL via a Pex5p-mediated PTS1 pathway. InPEX5-deficient mutant cells, SCPx is associated with endomembranes such as peroxisomal remnants and mitochondria. It is noteworthy that not only the 59-kDa form but also the 46-kDa fragment are enzymatically active as a branched-chain fatty acid thiolase (15Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Antonenkov V.D. Van Veldhoven P.P. Waelkens E. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 336-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as revealed using specimens from patients with peroxisome-defective disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. Localization of SCPx on endomembranes may be required for such enzymatic activity of the unprocessed form. However, its underlying mechanisms are presently unclear. Exact cleavage sites initially at position 404–405 or 424–425 or both (see Fig. 1 A), as well as physiological significance of this intraperoxisomal processing of SCPx, are not well understood at present. Interestingly, P-44 with thiolase activity and ZK892.2 apparently corresponding to the 46-kDa form of SCPx and nsLTP in mammals, respectively, have both been identified inCaenorhabditis elegans (41Bun-ya M. Maebuchi M. Hashimoto T. Yokota S. Kamiryo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas an orthologue of 59-kDa SCPx has not been detected. Whether accumulation of SCPx in protease-resistant form in the membrane fraction in pex5 andpex2 mutants, as noted in this work, is physiologically relevant or related to clinical phenotypes of peroxisome biogenesis disorders also remains to be defined. pre-nsLTP can be classified as a unique protein among a number of peroxisomal proteins with respect to its topogenic sequence. The cleavable presequence locates at the N terminus, similar to PTS2 of several peroxisomal enzymes such as 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (20Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and the C terminus carries a typical PTS1 tripeptide motif, AKL. Moreover, the amino acid sequence, -AAPT↓SS- (-, continuing to adjacent residues), near the processing site of pre-nsLTP to form mature nsLTP resembles the sequence of PTS2-thiolase, -AAPC↓SS- (-, continuing to adjacent residues), implying that pre-nsLTP and PTS2 proteins may share a potential, yet unidentified processing protease present in peroxisomes. The nsLTP presequence is relatively positive-charged like PTS2, but it does not contain the consensus PTS2 sequence -(R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(H/Q)(L/A)-. This implies that the presequence may be a novel-type PTS. We investigated in the present work which of two potential PTS sequences destines pre-nsLTP to its final intracellular location in vivo. With the use of several CHO pex mutants, import of pre-nsLTP was verified. pre-nsLTP was affected in import in pex2 andpex5 mutants with a phenotype showing import defect of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins, where pre-nsLTP remained in the cytosol. Other groups of investigators reported that nsLTP is likely to be degraded or barely detectable in ZR82, a pex2 CHO mutant (33van Heusden G.P.H. Bos K. Raetz C.R.H. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4105-4110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome (12Suzuki Y. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Tsuneoka M. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although pre-nsLTP was not fully described. In pex7 cell mutant impaired in PTS2 import, pre-nsLTP was translocated as efficiently as in the wild-type CHO-K1. Transport of pre-GFP-AKL was likewise re-established in wild-type and pex7 mutant CHO cells, consistent with the morphological phenotype as assessed for pre-nsLTP. Taken together, we conclude that pre-nsLTP is imported by the Pex5p-mediated PTS1 pathway. To our surprise, pre-GFP-AKL was targeted to mitochondria when expressed in pex2 and pex5 mutants. These results imply that pre-GFP-AKL behaves differently from pre-nsLTP; PTS1 of pre-nsLTP could not be recognized by Pex5p in vitro, whereas AKL of pre-GFP-AKL readily interacted with Pex5p. Despite such biochemical properties, pre-nsLTP is transported to peroxisomes by a Pex5p-dependent pathway in vivo. Moreover, in mutant cells absent from Pex5p, pre-nsLTP remains in the cytoplasm, whereas pre-GFP-AKL is readily transported to mitochondria at least in an over-expression system. The mitochondrial topogenic activity appears to be interfered with in the presequence of pre-nsLTP. Accordingly, the PTS1 and presequence of pre-nsLTP are most likely to be mutually regulated by unknown mechanisms. One possibility includes modulation of PTS1 of pre-nsLTP by direct steric effect of the presequence or that mediated by a cytosolic factor. Alternatively, PTS1 of pre-nsLTP may be partly modified, whereby a portion of total pre-nsLTP no longer interacts with Pex5p and remains in the cytoplasm. In the case of pre-GFP-AKL, the tripeptide AKL is more likely to be exposed to the surface of the molecule, thereby being readily recognized by Pex5p. The presequence may be unable to modulate the PTS1, possibly because of the configuration of this GFP chimera.

To examine the role of the B2 insert in the motor activity of the myosin II molecule, we expressed chimeric myosin heavy chain molecules using the Dictyostelium myosin II heavy chain as the backbone. We replaced the Dictyostelium native loop 2 with either the noninserted form of loop 2 from human MHC-IIB or the B2-inserted form of loop 2 from human MHC-IIB(B2). The transformant Dictyostelium cells expressing only the B2-inserted chimeric myosin formed unusual fruiting bodies. We then assessed the function of chimeric proteins, using an in vitro motility assay and by measuring ATPase activities and binding to F-actin. We demonstrate that the insertion of the B2 sequence reduces the motor activity of Dictyostelium myosin II, with reduction of the maximal actin-activated ATPase activity and a decrease in the affinity for actin. In addition, we demonstrate that the native loop 2 sequence of Dictyostelium myosin II is required for the regulation of the actin-activated ATPase activity by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Mermall V. Post P.L. Moosker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). It produces motor activity together with actin filaments coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Myosin II (referred to simply as myosin hereafter) molecules are the best studied members of the superfamily and are composed of a pair of heavy chains and two pairs of light chains. The amino-terminal half of the heavy chain forms the head region, termed subfragment 1 (S1),1 containing both ATP and actin binding sites. It is well known that two proteolytically susceptible areas are present in the head region of skeletal muscle myosin, and the proteolytic cleavage of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) with trypsin produces fragments of 25, 50, and 20 kDa (see Fig. 1) (3Balint M. Wolf I. Tarcsafalvi A. Gergely J. Sréter F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two regions corresponding to the 25/50-kDa and 50/20-kDa junctions were not resolved in the crystal structure of chicken skeletal myosin S1, suggesting that they might exist as flexible surface loops (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The locations of these two loops are of interest, since the 25/50-kDa loop is near the ATP binding pocket, while the 50/20-kDa loop is near the actin binding site. The amino acid sequence and the length of these two loops vary among different kinds of myosin molecules (5Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 379-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, Spudich proposed that these regions (named loop 1 and loop 2 for 25/50-kDa and 50/20-kDa junctions, respectively) would play important roles in the tuning of motor activity of myosin (6Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the amino acid sequences of these loop regions appeared to be more conserved than those of the rest of the myosin molecule among myosins with kinetically or developmentally similar properties, suggesting their functional roles (7Goodson H.V. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nonmuscle myosin plays a role in cell motile processes such as cytokinesis, migration, and shape change (for a review, see Ref. 8Spudich J.A. Finer J. Simmons B. Ruppel K. Patterson B. Uyeda T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To date, two different isoforms of the MHC have been identified in nonmuscle cells of vertebrates (9Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). They were referred to as MHC-A and MHC-B or MHC-IIA and MHC-IIB. These two isoforms are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner. For example, MHC-IIA is abundant in spleen and intestines, while MHC-IIB is abundant in brain and testis (9Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Phillips C.L.

Commun. 1999; 259: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the two loops serve as sites for alternative splicing of mRNA to produce inserted isoforms of MHC-IIB (13Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

One insert of 10 amino acid residues is located at loop 1, and another insert of 21 amino acid residues is located at loop 2. These inserts are referred to as B1 and B2, respectively. These inserted isoforms are expressed specifically in the brain and the spinal cord (12Takahashi M. Hirano T. Uchida K. Yamagishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, to date, there has been no biochemical characterization of myosin IIB(B2) consisting of the B2-inserted MHC. This has mainly been due to the inability to purify sufficient quantities of pure myosin IIB(B2) from brain tissue. The importance of loop 2 for myosin function was first suggested by proteolytic cleavage studies (19Mornet D. Pantel P. Audemard E. Kassab R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto K. Sekine T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto K.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6903-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The actin-activated ATPase activity was decreased by proteolytic cleavage in the loop 2 region (19Mornet D. Pantel P. Audemard E. Kassab R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto K. Sekine T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The proteolytic cleavage of loop 2 was inhibited in the presence of F-actin (19Mornet D. Pantel P. Audemard E. Kassab R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto K. Sekine T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and it reduced the affinity of myosin for F-actin (22Botts J. Muhlrad A. Takashi R. Morales M.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6903-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The importance of loop 2 was also indicated by molecular genetic studies. It was demonstrated that the substitution of loop 2 of Dictyostelium myosin with that of other myosins caused a change in the actin-activated ATPase to values correlating with the activity of the donor myosins (23Uyeda T.Q.P. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A further detailed study by Murphy and Spudich (24Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3785-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that the Vmax of actin-activated ATPase activity and the affinity of myosin for actin are both affected by substitutions with loop 2 sequence. To examine the role of the B2 insert in the motor activity of the myosin molecule, we adopted a similar strategy. We expressed chimeric heavy chains of Dictyostelium myosin and S1 in which the loop 2 sequence was replaced with either the noninserted form or the B2-inserted form of human MHC-IIB (see Fig. 1) and assessed the function of these chimeras using an in vitro motility assay system and by measuring steady state ATPase activities and interaction with F-actin. Our work suggests that the motor activity of myosin is reduced by the insertion of the B2 sequence, with a reduction of Vmax and a decrease of the affinity for actin. In addition, we demonstrate that the native loop 2 sequence of Dictyostelium myosin is required for the proper regulation of the actin-activated ATPase activity by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain. All DNA manipulations were done using standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The template for mutagenesis was pMyDAP (26Egelhoff T.T. Manstein D.J. Spudich J.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), carrying the entire Dictyostelium MHC gene. The plasmids encoding the MHC with chimeric loop 2 replacements were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Uyeda et al. (23Uyeda T.Q.P. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).

The mutagenic primers contain some overlapping sequence to allow subsequent fusion of the 5′ and 3′ fragments by restriction enzyme digestion followed by ligation. The resulting 5′ fragment was digested with EcoRI/SalI and subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBluescriptIISK+. The resulting 3′ fragment was digested with AgeI/KpnI and subcloned into the AgeI and KpnI sites of the plasmid carrying the 5′ fragment. This plasmid was digested with BglII/NcoI, and the resulting BglII–NcoI fragment was used to replace the corresponding wild-type sequence of the MHC gene in pTIKLMyDAP (27Uyeda T.Q.P. Abramson P.D.

Mutant Dic-B2 was made by inserting the B2 insert sequence of the human MHC-IIB(B2) into Dic-B, as follows. The 5′ fragment was synthesized using a 5′ primer, GGAATTCAGATCTCGAACTTTGCTTCA, and a 3′ mutagenic primer starting inside the region of substitution, ACGCGTCGACAAGCTTGCACGCTGGATGTTCTGGATTTCATCTTTCCAAAGTTTGGT.

The resulting 5′ fragment was digested with EcoRI/HindIII and subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pBluescriptIISK+. The resulting 3′ fragment was digested with HindIII/KpnI and subcloned into the HindIII and KpnI sites of the plasmid carrying the 5′ fragment. This plasmid was digested with BglII/NcoI, and the resulting BglII–NcoI fragment was used to replace the corresponding wild-type sequence of the MHC gene in pTIKLMyDAP. All sequences of the primers are shown 5′ to 3′, and mutated sequences are underlined. All DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Transformants were selected in a medium supplemented with 12 μg/ml G418 (Roche Diagnostics) and maintained with 8 μg/ml G418 at 23 °C. For the isolation of myosin or S1-His6 protein, the cells expressing either the mutant or wild-type myosin were grown in 3-liter flasks containing 1.2 liters of medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml G418 on a rotary shaker at 23 °C. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Myosins were purified by the method of Uyeda and Spudich (31Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, cells were harvested and then washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Approximately 10 g of cells were obtained from 1.2 liter of the culture. The volume of the buffer at each step hereafter was determined on the basis of the weight of the cells. The cells were resuspended in five volumes of a lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT)/g of cells. The cell suspension was mixed with four volumes of lysis buffer containing Triton X-100/g of cells. The final concentration of Triton X-100 was 0.4%.

The sample was made 5 mm with respect to ATP and centrifuged immediately at 265,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold with a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT and incubated for 40 min on ice. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 115,000 × g for 30 min and was dissolved in 0.1 volume/g of cells of a high salt buffer. The sample was finally centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 10 min to remove the insoluble materials. The lysis, washing, and extraction buffers contained the following protease inhibitors: 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-l-2-heptanone, 80 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm benzamidine. S1-His6 proteins were purified by the method of Giese and Spudich (32Giese K.C. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, the harvested cells were resuspended in four volumes of lysis buffer (50 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mmMgCl2) containing 3.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm glucose. The cells were lysed by inverting the tube several times with an additional four volumes of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm glucose. The lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min with the addition of 5 mg/ml hexokinase (Sigma) to deplete the endogenous ATP and then centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended with nine volumes of lysis buffer and centrifuged at 36,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended with 1.5 volumes of lysis buffer, made 5 mm with respect to ATP, and immediately centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 10 min. S1-His6 proteins were purified by using a Ni2+affinity resin (His-Bind; Novagen) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The eluted S1-His6 proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) overnight. The sample was finally centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials and made 2 mm with respect to DTT. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified by the method of Pardee and Spudich (33Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an absorption coefficient of 1.1 for a 1 mg/ml solution. The concentration of the purified myosins, S1-His6 proteins, and myosin light chain kinase were measured by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214131) Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains of purified myosins was performed using bacterially expressed Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase, which carried a T166E mutation (35Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), according to the method of Ruppel et al. (29Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified chimeric and wild-type myosins (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in a buffer containing 10 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 60 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml myosin light chain kinase (T166E) overnight on ice. The phosphorylated myosin was recovered by centrifugation at 265,000 × g for 10 min and redissolved in a buffer containing 250 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The solution was finally centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea (36Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Sliding filament in vitro motility assays were performed according to standard methods (37Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) at 30 °C. Phosphorylated myosin was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml with a buffer containing 250 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT and centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 10 min immediately after the addition of 0.2 mg/ml F-actin and 2 mm ATP to remove denatured myosin molecules that bind irreversibly to actin. Velocities of ∼50 filaments were scored for each myosin. The steady-state rate of ATPase was determined from the time course of Pi liberation at 25 °C. The concentration of Pi was determined by the method of Gonzalez-Romo et al. (38Gonzalez-Romo P. Sanchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The assay conditions for Ca2+-ATPase were 0.05–0.2 μmS1-His6, 0.6 m KCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP. The conditions for Mg2+-ATPase were 1–4 μmS1-His6, 25 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP. The conditions for actin-activated ATPase activities were 0.5 μmS1-His6, 0–170 μm F-actin, 8 mmKCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP. In the case of myosin, the conditions for actin-activated ATPase activities were 0.2 μm myosin, 0–140 μmF-actin, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm ATP. The affinity of S1 for actin in the presence of ATP was measured by cosedimentation assays according to the procedure of Giese and Spudich (32Giese K.C. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). F-actin (6 μm) and various concentrations of S1 (0−25 μm) were mixed in a buffer containing 25 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The mixtures were centrifuged at 435,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C immediately after the addition of 2 mm ATP. The resulting supernatant and pellets were run on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). The original uncentrifuged samples were also run on SDS-PAGE gels. The concentration of S1 was determined by densitometry of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands of the gels. The plasmids containing the wild-type MHC gene (pTIKLMyDAP), Dic-B gene with replacement of the loop 2 sequence with that of human nonmuscle MHC-IIB (pTIKLMyDAP-B), or Dic-B2 gene with that of human nonmuscle MHC-IIB(B2) (pTIKLMyDAP-B2) were introduced into the MHC null cell line HS1, and the transformed cells were selected for G-418 resistance. The expression of the full-length chimeric or wild-type MHCs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). We also confirmed that each transformant expressed MHC at levels comparable with the parental wild-type strain, Ax2. To assess chimeric myosin function in vivo, we analyzed the ability of the transformants to form fruiting bodies, a process known to depend on myosin functions (40Knecht D.A. Loomis W.F. Science. 1987; 236: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 41De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The transformants expressing the wild-type myosin and the chimeric myosin Dic-B were capable of forming normal fruiting bodies similar to that of the Ax2 cells (Fig.2). However, the transformant expressing the chimeric myosin Dic-B2 showed an unusual fruiting body. The height of the stalks was only one-fourth of the normal ones. This result suggested that the motor activity of Dictyostelium myosin was apparently modulated by replacement of the loop 2 sequence with that of human nonmuscle MHC-IIB(B2). Each of the chimeric myosins was purified from the transformed cell lines and was completely phosphorylated by recombinant Dictyosteliummyosin light chain kinase. To characterize the chimeric myosins at a molecular level, we first measured the sliding velocities of actin filaments on myosin-coated surfaces using an in vitromotility assay system. The results are summarized in Fig.3. Dic-B myosin moved actin filaments at an average velocity of 1.4 μm/s, which was 75% of the wild-type myosin. On the other hand, the average sliding velocity of actin filaments propelled by Dic-B2 myosin was 0.7 μm/s, which was about 37% of the wild-type and ∼50% of Dic-B myosin. This result demonstrates that the insertion of the B2 sequence into the loop 2 of myosin depresses the motile ability of myosin molecule. We constructed an expression system for Dictyostelium S1 and the chimeric S1s derived from Dic-B and Dic-B2 myosins to analyze the ATPase activity in solution. The high salt Ca2+-ATPase activities of both Dic-B and Dic-B2 chimeric S1 were almost identical, although they were ∼1.3-fold higher than the value of wild-type S1 (Fig. 4 A). The Mg2+-ATPase activities of both chimeric S1s showed comparable values, although they were also 1.4-fold higher than that of wild-type S1 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that the core structure of the motor domain is only slightly affected by replacement of the loop 2 sequence of Dictyostelium wild-type with that of human nonmuscle myosin IIB and that the insertion of the B2 sequence does not have a further effect. We then measured the actin-activated ATPase of the chimeric S1s as a function of actin concentration (Fig.5 A). The Vmax and the apparent Km for actin of the wild-type S1 were 2.37 s−1 and 147 μm, respectively. The activities of Dic-B S1 were ∼60% of those of the wild-type S1 at all actin concentration. Dic-B2 S1 showed much lower activities than those of Dic-B S1. However, in the case of the chimeric S1s, the activities hardly reached the saturation level within the available actin concentrations of our experimental conditions, so that the values for Vmax and the apparent Km obtained by data fitting were uncertain. Fig. 5 B shows the results of measurements of the actin-activated ATPase activities of chimeric myosins as a function of actin concentration. The regulatory light chains of the purified myosins were completely phosphorylated by using recombinant Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase. The activities of both Dic-B myosin and Dic-B2 myosin were lower than that of wild-type myosin at all actin concentration in a manner similar to those of Dic-B S1 and Dic-B2 S1, respectively. Replacement of the amino acid residues of Dictyostelium wild-type myosin loop 2 with that of nonmuscle myosin IIB caused a decrease in Vmaxof 1.4-fold from 1.82 to 1.34 s−1. Furthermore, the insertion of B2 amino acid residues into the Dic-B myosin decreased the Vmax by 2.2-fold from 1.34 to 0.61 s−1. The values for apparent Km of the wild-type, Dic-B, and Dic-B2 myosins were 29.7, 42.6, and 73.0 μm, respectively. These results suggest that the insertion of 21 amino acid residues into loop 2 of the nonmuscle myosin IIB suppresses the actin-activated ATPase activity with a decrease of the Vmax and the increase of the apparent Km for actin. To examine the affinity of chimeric S1s to F-actin, we performed cosedimentation assays in the presence of ATP (Fig. 6). Both Dic-B S1 and Dic-B2 S1 sedimented with F-actin in the absence of ATP (data not shown). In the presence of 2 mm ATP, Dic-B S1 showed a weaker affinity (Kd = 21.2 μm) compared with wild-type S1 (6.3 μm). Dic-B2 S1 showed a slightly weaker affinity (28.7 μm) than Dic-B S1. The maximal, extrapolated binding of the Dic-B S1 and Dic-B2 S1 to actin in the presence of ATP is the same as in wild type S1 (∼1.0). These results indicate that the affinity of S1 for F-actin is affected by the insertion of B2 amino acid residues into loop 2. During the course of this investigation, we noticed an interesting phenomenon on the regulation of the actin-activated ATPase activity by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of Dictyostelium myosin. The actin-activated ATPase activities of unphosphorylated and p"
https://openalex.org/W2315758913,"Friend erythroleukemia induced in mice by the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) is a multi-step process. The pre-leukemic phase of the disease results from the abnormal activation of the Erythropoietin (Epo) receptor by the gp55 env gene product of SFFV. Later in disease progression, the emergence of leukemic clones is associated with recurrent genetic events, in particular the activation of the expression of SPI-1, an ETS family transcriptional regulator. We show here that the expression of either SPI-1 or GP55 with the mouse EPOR in avian primary erythroblasts only marginally affects their normal Epo-induced terminal differentiation. In contrast, the co-expression of GP55 and SPI-1 resulted in inhibition of Epo-induced differentiation of EPOR-expressing erythroblasts, promoting instead their proliferation. Co-expression of SPI-1 and GP55 also inhibited the apoptotic cell death program normally induced in response to Epo withdrawal. This cooperation between SPI-1 and GP55 to induce primary erythroblast transformation suggests that progression of Friend erythroleukemia critically depends upon inter-dependent interactions between the molecular events specific of the early and late phase of the disease."
