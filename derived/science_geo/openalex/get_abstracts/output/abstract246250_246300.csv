https://openalex.org/W2073327993,"Macrophages have a critical role in inflammatory and immune responses through their ability to recognize and engulf apoptotic cells. Here we show that macrophages initiate a cell-death programme in target cells by activating the canonical WNT pathway. We show in mice that macrophage WNT7b is a short-range paracrine signal required for WNT-pathway responses and programmed cell death in the vascular endothelial cells of the temporary hyaloid vessels of the developing eye. These findings indicate that macrophages can use WNT ligands to influence cell-fate decisions--including cell death--in adjacent cells, and raise the possibility that they do so in many different cellular contexts."
https://openalex.org/W1971319017,"Suppose that the variability in our movements is caused not by noise in the motor system itself, nor by fluctuations in our intentions or plans, but rather by errors in our sensory estimates of the external parameters that define the appropriate action. For tasks in which precision is at a premium, performance would be optimal if no noise were added in movement planning and execution: motor output would be as accurate as possible given the quality of sensory inputs. Here we use visually guided smooth-pursuit eye movements in primates as a testing ground for this notion of optimality. In response to repeated presentations of identical target motions, nearly 92% of the variance in eye trajectory can be accounted for as a consequence of errors in sensory estimates of the speed, direction and timing of target motion, plus a small background noise that is observed both during eye movements and during fixations. The magnitudes of the inferred sensory errors agree with the observed thresholds for sensory discrimination by perceptual systems, suggesting that the very different neural processes of perception and action are limited by the same sources of noise."

https://openalex.org/W2036089634,"Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22) is a key enzyme in the generation of cysteine from methionine. A deficiency of CBS leads to homocystinuria, an inherited human disease characterized by mental retardation, seizures, psychiatric disturbances, skeletal abnormalities, and vascular disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show the regional and cellular distribution of CBS in the adult and developing mouse brain. In the adult mouse brain, CBS was expressed ubiquitously, but it is expressed most intensely in the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CBS is preferentially expressed in cerebellar Bergmann glia and in astrocytes throughout the brain. At early developmental stages, CBS was expressed in neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone, but its expression changed to radial glial cells and then to astrocytes during the late embryonic and neonatal periods. CBS was most highly expressed in juvenile brain, and a striking induction was observed in cultured astrocytes in response to EGF, TGF-alpha, cAMP, and dexamethasone. Moreover, CBS was significantly accumulated in reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures, and cerebellar morphological abnormalities were observed in CBS-deficient mice. Taken together, these results suggest that CBS plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the CNS and that radial glia/astrocyte dysfunction might be involved in the complex neuropathological features associated with abnormal homocysteine metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2012046347,"When eukaryotic chromosomes undergo double strand breaks (DSBs), several evolutionarily conserved proteins, among which the MRX complex, are recruited to the break site, leading to checkpoint activation and DNA repair. The function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sae2 protein, which is known to work together with the MRX complex in meiotic DSB processing and in specific mitotic DSB repair events, is only beginning to be elucidated. Here we provide new insights into the role of Sae2 in mitotic DSB repair. We show that repair by single strand annealing of a single DSB, which is generated by the HO endonuclease between direct repeats, is defective both in the absence of Sae2 and in the presence of the hypomorphic rad50s allele altering the Rad50 subunit of MRX. Moreover, SAE2 overexpression partially suppresses the rad50s single strand annealing repair defects, suggesting that the latter might arise from defective MRX-Sae2 interactions. Finally, SAE2 deletion slows down resection of an HO-induced DSB and impairs DSB end bridging. Thus, Sae2 participates in DSB single strand annealing repair by ensuring both resection and intrachromosomal association of the broken ends.

Finally, SAE2 deletion slows down resection of an HO-induced DSB and impairs DSB end bridging. Thus, Sae2 participates in DSB single strand annealing repair by ensuring both resection and intrachromosomal association of the broken ends. DNA double strand breaks (DSB 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; HR, homologous recombination; SSA, single strand annealing; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; I-SceI, intron SceI endonuclease; YEPD, yeast extract peptone dextrose; YEP+raf+gal, yeast extract peptone + raffinose + galactose; GFP, green fluorescent protein.3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; HR, homologous recombination; SSA, single strand annealing; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; I-SceI, intron SceI endonuclease; YEPD, yeast extract peptone dextrose; YEP+raf+gal, yeast extract peptone + raffinose + galactose; GFP, green fluorescent protein.(s)) are a particularly dangerous form of DNA damage, because failure to repair these lesions can lead to loss of genetic information by deletions, duplications, translocations, and missegregation of large chromosome fragments (1.Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). DSBs can arise by failures in DNA replication and by exposure to environmental factors, such as ionizing radiations and genotoxic drugs. However, they also play an important role as intermediates in meiotic and mitotic crossing over, V(D)J recombination and yeast mating type switching. When DSBs occur, many proteins are recruited to the break sites and serve both to promote a checkpoint response and to initiate DNA repair that can occur through non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination (HR) (2.Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Whereas non-homologous end joining implies recombination between sequences with little or no homology, HR involves exchange of genetic information between homologous DNA sequences and is the major DSB repair process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HR initiates with a DSB (3.Sun H. Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 4.Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), whose 5′-ends resection leaves 3′-ended single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. Then, depending on the position of the homologous partner, on the initiation event and on the length of the homology region in the recombinant molecules, HR may occur by different mechanisms, including double strand break repair, synthesis-dependent strand annealing, and break-induced replication (2.Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 5.Paques F. Haber J.E. Micr. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, when a DSB occurs between direct repeats, its repair is primarily achieved by a particular kind of HR named single strand annealing (SSA). SSA requires DSB resection to generate long 3′-ended single-stranded tails that can anneal with each other when resection is sufficient to uncover the duplicated sequences. Single-stranded tails are then removed by nucleases, and the resulting gaps/nicks are filled in by DNA repair synthesis and ligation, resulting in deletion of one repeat and the intervening region (6.Fishman-Lobell J. Rudin N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mitotic HR involves several proteins, including Rad51, Rad52, Rad54, Rdh54/Tid1, Rad55, Rad57, Rad59, and the ssDNA binding complex replication protein A (2.Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for Rad52 in providing the single strand annealing activity (7.Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8.Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), Rad52 is essential for initiation of most HR events, including SSA, whereas Rad51, Rad54, Rad55, and Rad57 are dispensable for SSA-mediated DSB repair (9.Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 693-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different functions in DSB repair can be envisaged also for a protein complex known as MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) in mammals and MRX (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2) in S. cerevisiae, which has been shown to localize at meiotic and mitotic DSBs almost immediately after their formation (10.Borde V. Lin W. Novikov E. Petrini J.H. Lichten M. Nicolas A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae mrx null mutants are severely impaired in meiotic recombination (4.Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 12.Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 419-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and hairpin-capped DSB repair (13.Lobachev K.S. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Cell. 2002; 108: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and exhibit decreased frequencies of ionizing radiation-induced sister chromatid and interhomologue recombination (14.Bressan D.A. Baxter B.K. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7681-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Moreover, they markedly retard the kinetics of DSB repair by SSA, although they do not prevent its completion (15.Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. White C.I. Fabre F. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3414-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The Mre11 subunit of MRX has both exonuclease and endonuclease activities (16.Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17.Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 7: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 18.Trujillo K.M. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that likely function in DSB repair. However, whereas point mutations in the Mre11 phosphoesterase domain result in accumulation of unresected meiotic DSBs and sporulation failure in vivo (19.Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), most S. cerevisiae mre11 nuclease defective alleles cause only a mild sensitivity to ionizing radiations and do not seem to affect either HO-induced DSB resection or ionizing radiation-induced sister chromatid recombination (14.Bressan D.A. Baxter B.K. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7681-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19.Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 20.Lewis L.K. Storici F. Van Komen S. Calero S. Sung P. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21.Llorente B. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9682-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, budding yeast Mre11 associates with a DSB only transiently (11.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), whereas resection of an HO-induced DSB can proceed for several hours until repair occurs (22.Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). This indicates that the functions of MRX in mitotic DSB repair might be partially independent of its nuclease activity, which is instead essential in the single strand endonucleolytic removal of Spo11 from meiotic DNA ends (12.Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 419-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 19.Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the MRX complex has been shown to cooperate with Rad52 in holding the two ends of the broken chromosome together independently of its nuclease activity (23.Kaye J.A. Melo J.A. Cheung S.K. Vaze M.B. Haber J.E. Toczyski D.P. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2096-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24.Lobachev K. Vitriol E. Stemple J. Resnick M.A. Bloom K. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2107-2112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, it promotes the assembly of DSB-specific cohesion domains, thus contributing to maintain association between sister chromatids during DSB repair (25.Strom L. Lindroos H.B. Shirahige K. Sjogren C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1003-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 26.Unal E. Arbel-Eden A. Sattler U. Shroff R. Lichten M. Haber J.E. Koshland D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 991-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 27.Warren C.D. Eckley D.M. Lee M.S. Hanna J.S. Hughes A. Peyser B. Jie C. Irizarry R. Spencer F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1724-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). According to these functions, MRX structure resembles that of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) proteins that are required for sister chromatid cohesion (28.Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The MRX complex associates with DNA ends through the Mre11 protein and the globular domain of Rad50, with the coiled-coil arms of Rad50 extending outwards and interacting with an MRX complex on the other site of the break through Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motifs (29.Stracker T.H. Theunissen J.W. Morales M. Petrini J.H. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae Sae2 protein is known to work together with the MRX complex at least in meiotic DSB processing and in the repair of mitotic hairpin-capped DSBs. In fact, sae2 null mutants show meiotic recombination defects that are undistinguishable from those of hypomorphic rad50s and mre11s mutants (30.Keeney S. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31.McKee A.H.Z. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1997; 146: 797-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Nairz K. Klein F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2272-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 33.Prinz S. Amon A. Klein F. Genetics. 1997; 146: 781-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, similarly to rad50s and mre11s mutants, sae2Δ cells are both hypersensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate and defective in mitotic hairpin-capped DSB repair (13.Lobachev K.S. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Cell. 2002; 108: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 34.Baroni E. Viscardi V. Cartagena-Lirola H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4151-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sae2 has neither known homologues in other species nor obvious motifs, and its function is only beginning to be elucidated. The lack of Sae2 does not affect the overall recombination rate when a DSB is induced between two inverted repeats (35.Rattray A.J. McGill C.B. Shafer B.K. Strathern J.N. Genetics. 2001; 158: 109-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, SAE2 deletion delays Rad52 recruitment at sites of DNA damage after γ-irradiation or I-SceI-induced DSBs (11.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) and increases the frequency of repair events that lead to the duplication of inverted repeats (35.Rattray A.J. McGill C.B. Shafer B.K. Strathern J.N. Genetics. 2001; 158: 109-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to palindromic gene amplification (36.Rattray A.J. Shafer B.K. Neelam B. Strathern J.N. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because similar duplications of inverted repeats have been observed in the repair of an HO-induced DSB with only one end homologous to the donor (37.Colaiacovo M.P. Paques F. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Sae2 may be involved in ensuring that both DSB ends participate in HR. To provide new insights into the Sae2 function in mitotic DSB repair, we have investigated whether the absence of Sae2 affects resection and SSA repair of a single DSB generated by the site-specific HO endonuclease. We show that Sae2 contributes to both resection and intrachromosomal association of DSB ends, thus ensuring efficient DSB repair. Yeast Strains and Media—Strains YMV80 and YMV45 were kindly provided by J. Haber (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA) and were used to disrupt the SAE2 gene and to replace RAD50 with the rad50s K81I allele (12.Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 419-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) or to integrate the GAL-SAE2 fusion at the URA3 locus. YMV45 and YMV80 are isogenic to YFP17 (MATΔ::hisG hmlΔ::ADE1 hmrΔ::ADE1 ade1 lys5 ura3-52 trp1 ho ade3::GAL-HO leu2::cs) except for the presence of a LEU2 fragment inserted, respectively, 4.6 or 25 kb centromere-distal to leu2::cs (38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). SAE2 and MRE11 disruptions were also performed in strains yJK37.2 (MATΔ hmlΔ hmrΔ can1 lys5 ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 his3 ade3::GAL-HO VII::TRP1-HO LacI-GFP::URA3 LacO::KanR), yJK40.6 (MATΔ hmlΔ hmrΔ can1 lys5 ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 his3 ade3::GAL-HO VII::TRP1-HO LacI-GFP::URA3 LacO::LYS5 LacO::KanR), and yJK98.9 (MATΔ hmlΔ hmrΔ can1 lys5 ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 his3 ade3::GAL-HO VII::TRP1-HO LacI-GFP::URA3 LacO-GFP::LYS5 LacO::LEU2) (23.Kaye J.A. Melo J.A. Cheung S.K. Vaze M.B. Haber J.E. Toczyski D.P. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2096-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), kindly provided by D.P. Toczyski (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Strain yJK40.6 was also used to replace RAD50 with the rad50s K81I allele. SAE2 and MRE11 deletions were performed as described previously (34.Baroni E. Viscardi V. Cartagena-Lirola H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4151-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To generate strains carrying three copies of the GAL-SAE2 fusion integrated at the URA3 locus, the YMV80 strain was transformed with ApaI-digested plasmid pML508, carrying the entire SAE2 coding region fused to the GAL1 promoter. The YMV80 derivative SAE2-HA and GAL-SAE2-HA strains, carrying the fully functional SAE2-HA allele at the SAE2 chromosomal locus, or the GAL-SAE2-HA allele at the URA3 chromosomal locus, respectively, were constructed as described previously (34.Baroni E. Viscardi V. Cartagena-Lirola H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4151-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To generate rad50s mutants, YMV80 and yJK40.6 cells were transformed with MscI-digested plasmid pML533, carrying the first 666 bp of the RAD50 coding region with the K81I mutation. Accuracy of all disruptions was verified by PCR, whereas GAL-SAE2 and GAL-SAE2-HA integrations were verified by Southern blot analysis. Standard yeast genetic techniques and media were according to Ref. 39.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar. Cells were grown in YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 50 mg/liter adenine) supplemented with 2% glucose (YEPD) or 2% raffinose (YEP+raf) or 2% raffinose and 2% galactose (YEP+raf+gal). Plasmids—To give rise to plasmid pML508, a fragment spanning from position +1 to position +1162 from the SAE2 translation initiation codon was amplified by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as a template and oligonucleotides PRP559 (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATA TGG TGA CTG GTG AAG AAA ATG-3′) and PRP560 (5′-AAC TGC AGC TGG TAA GTT AGG TGT CAT TTG-3′) as primers and was then cloned together with a 700-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the GAL1 promoter, into the EcoRI-PstI sites of plasmid YIplac211 (40.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). To give rise to plasmid pML533, a 1051-bp fragment containing the promoter and the first 666 bp of the coding region of the rad50s K81I allele was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides PRP706 (5′-CGG AAT TCC CGA TAG TAC TTC CAC TTA CAA TAC-3′) and PRP707 (5′-CGG AAT TCC ATT GCT TTC GAT CTG TCT TTA TCC-3′) as primers and yeast genomic DNA from MJL1699 strain (kindly provided by N. Kleckner, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) as a template and was then cloned into the EcoRI site of plasmid YIplac128 (40.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Other Techniques—Synchronization experiments, protein extract preparation, and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (41.Clerici M. Baldo V. Mantiero D. Lottersberger F. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10126-10144Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DSB formation and repair were detected by Southern blot analysis using an Asp718-SalI fragment containing part of the LEU2 gene as a probe (38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). DSB end resection at the LEU2 locus was analyzed on alkaline-agarose gels as described in Ref. 42.Shroff R. Arbel-Eden A. Pilch D. Ira G. Bonner W.M. Petrini J.H. Haber J.E. Lichten M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1703-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, using a single-stranded probe complementary to the unresected DSB strand. This probe was obtained by in vitro transcription using Promega Riboprobe System-T7 and plasmid pML514 as a template. Plasmid pML514 was obtained by cloning the KpnI-ClaI fragment containing part of the LEU2 gene in the KpnI-ClaI sites of pGEM-7Zf plasmid (purchased from Promega). The Lack of Sae2 Impairs DSB Repair by SSA—We examined the effects caused by lack or excess of Sae2 on SSA repair by using YMV80 derivative strains (38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), carrying either a deletion of SAE2 or a GAL1-SAE2 fusion integrated at the URA3 locus. In these strains, a single DSB can be generated by expressing the site-specific HO endonuclease gene from a galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The normal HO recognition sites at MAT, HML, and HMR loci are deleted, whereas an HO target sequence on chromosome III is flanked on either side by homologous sequence repeats, consisting of the 3′-end of the LEU2 gene. One of these repeats is adjacent to the HO cut site (leu2::cs), whereas the other repeat (his4::leu2) is located 25 kb centromere distal from the break site (Ref. 38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E.

Because of the presence of homologous sequence repeats on either side of the HO cut site, the DSB in the YMV80 derivative strains has been reported to be mainly repaired by a Rad52-dependent SSA pathway (38.Vaze M.B.

In fact, the ends of the DSB are degraded by 5′-3′-exonucleases until complementary sequences flanking the break are exposed and can be annealed. Subsequent ligation of the two chromosomal fragments repairs the break, concomitantly abolishing the HO recognition sequence and one of the repeats (38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Because the ability to repair the HO-induced DSB is influenced by the cell cycle stages (43.Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D. Wan L. Hollingsworth N.M. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Nature. 2004; 431: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), we arrested all cell cultures in mitosis and kept them blocked by nocodazole treatment during break induction by galactose addition. We then monitored the kinetics of HO-cut formation and its subsequent repair by Southern blot analysis. As depicted in Fig. 1A, hybridization with a LEU2 probe of KpnI-digested YMV80 genomic DNA run on a native agarose gel reveals 8- and 6-kb DNA fragments in the absence of HO cut. HO-induced DSB formation results in decrease of the amount of 6-kb species and concomitant appearance of 2.5-kb fragments. The break can be eventually repaired by SSA, leading to a final product of 3.5-kb and disappearance of both the 2.5- and 8-kb fragments. As shown in Fig. 1B, HO-cut induction was rapid and efficient in all cell cultures, because the leu2::cs sequence was cut in more than 90% of cells within 30 min after galactose addition. Then, the 3.5-kb SSA repair products started to accumulate in both wild type and SAE2 overexpressing cells ∼5 h after HO induction, concomitantly with the decrease of both the 2.5- and 8-kb fragments. SSA products were instead detectable only at very low levels even 10 h after HO induction in sae2Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Consistent with defective DSB repair by SSA in the absence of Sae2, only 10% of sae2Δ cells were able to form colonies on galactose-containing plates (HO expression on), whereas cell viability was unaffected in wild type and GAL-SAE2 cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1C). Thus, Sae2 is required for efficient repair of the HO-induced DSB by SSA, which appears to be unaffected by SAE2 overexpression, indicating that increasing Sae2 levels (Fig. 1D) is not sufficient to accelerate this process in wild type cells. The lack of Sae2 severely reduced SSA-dependent recombination events also in YMV45 derivative strains (Fig. 2), where SSA repair of HO-induced DSBs occurs very rapidly (38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In fact, the distal leu2 sequence in these strains is located only 4.6 kb away from the HO recognition site at leu2::cs (Ref. 38.Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 2A). When cell cultures of these strains were arrested in mitosis and kept blocked by nocodazole treatment during break induction, SSA products accumulated in wild type cells already 90 min after HO induction (Fig. 2B). Moreover, they became detectable in sae2Δ cells ∼150 min after galactose addition (Fig. 2B), but their amount was much lower than in wild type, thus confirming a critical role for Sae2 in SSA repair. Consistent with the faster DSB repair by SSA in YMV45 sae2Δ cells compared with YMV80 sae2Δ cells, 50% of YMV45 sae2Δ cells were able to form colonies on galactose-containing plates (Fig. 2C). SAE2 Overexpression Partially Suppresses the SSA Defects of rad50s Mutants—In contrast to the mrx null alleles, which are unable to generate meiotic DSBs, sae2Δ cells display the same meiotic recombination defects as the hypomorphic rad50s and mre11s alleles (30.Keeney S. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31.McKee A.H.Z. Kleckner N.

Genetics. 1997; 146: 781-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing to hypothesize that the Rad50s and Mre11s mutant proteins might specifically impair MRX-Sae2 interaction. We then asked whether rad50s mutant cells were defective in SSA. After construction of a rad50s K81I mutant (12.Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 419-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) in the YMV80 background, cell cultures were arrested in mitosis and kept blocked by nocodazole treatment during break induction by galactose addition. Southern blot analysis was then used to follow the kinetics of DSB repair by SSA. As shown in Fig. 3A, SSA products were barely detectable in rad50s cells even 8 h after HO induction, similarly to what observed in isogenic sae2Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, rad50s cell survival on galactose containing plates was reduced to the same extent as in sae2Δ cells (Fig. 3B). If the rad50s SSA defects were because of altered MRX ability to interact with Sae2, Sae2 overproduction might be expected to suppress it. This was indeed the case, because SSA products in GAL-SAE2 rad50s cells treated as above became detectable and started to accumulate, although to a lower extent than in wild type, ∼5 h after HO induction (Fig. 3A). In agreement with partial suppression of rad50s SSA defects by SAE2 overexpression, GAL-SAE2 rad50s cells showed increased cell survival after HO induction on galactose-containing plates compared with rad50s cells (Fig. 3B). The Lack of Sae2 Slows Down Resection of an HO-induced DSB—Because the HO break can undergo repair by SSA only once 5′-3′-resection has uncovered both direct repeats, allowing their subsequent annealing and ligation, SSA repair defects in sae2Δ cells might be because of impairments in the generation of 3′-ended ssDNA. We therefore used denaturing gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis with a single-stranded LEU2 probe to monitor both HO cut at leu2::cs and the extent of resection, as depicted in Fig. 4A. When these analyses were performed on the same cell cultures shown in Fig. 1, initiation of DSB resection turned out to be delayed in YMV80 sae2Δ cells (Fig. 4B). In fact, 3′-ended resection products (named r1-r6) could be detected in these cells ∼1 h later than in isogenic wild type cells. The sae2Δ DSB resection defects seemed to only partially account for the reduced SSA efficiency. In fact, the amount of SSA products was very low for at least 10 h after HO induction in YMV80 sae2Δ cells (Fig. 1B), whereas the 3′-ended ssDNA products were detectable in the same cells already 2-3 h after galactose addition and remained stable for at least 10 h (Fig. 4B). Conversely, the amount of resection products decreased in the isogenic wild type cells (Fig. 4B) concomitantly with the appearance of SSA products (Fig. 1B). Moreover, DSB resection in the sae2Δ YMV80 derivative strain seemed to proceed for at least 25 kb and to uncover the homologous LEU2 sequence (his4::leu2) located 25 kb away from the HO-cut site. In fact, the amount of the 8-kb his4::leu2 DNA fragment started to decrease ∼6-7 h after HO induction in both wild type and sae2Δ YM"

We have previously shown that a membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is exposed on the cell surface of the cleavage furrow during late cytokinesis and that this PE movement is involved in regulation of the contractile ring disassembly. Here we show that immobilization of cell surface PE by a PE-binding peptide blocks the RhoA inactivation in the late stage of cytokinesis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), but not other RhoA effectors, is co-localized with RhoA in the peptide-treated cells. Indeed, PIP5K and its product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) are localized to the cleavage furrow of normally dividing cells. Both overexpression of a kinase-deficient PIP5K mutant and microinjection of anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibodies compromise cytokinesis by preventing local accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 in the cleavage furrow. These findings demonstrate that the localized production of PI(4,5)P2 is required for the proper completion of cytokinesis and that the possible formation of a unique lipid domain in the cleavage furrow membrane may play a crucial role in coordinating the contractile rearrangement with the membrane remodeling during late cytokinesis.

After segregation of condensed chromosomes toward opposite poles in late anaphase, the contractile ring containing actin and myosin assembles in the center of the cell. The ring then contracts to furrow the overlaying plasma membrane until the furrow membrane comes into contact with the central spindle. At the end of cytokinesis, both the central spindle and the contractile ring disassemble, followed by the homotypic fusion of the two facing plasma membranes and then cell separation. The small GTPase RhoA cycles the GDP-bound inactive and the GTP-bound active forms and plays a central role in cytoskeletal rearrangement during cytokinesis (4Narumiya S. J.

A variety of membrane transactions appears important during cleavage, because mutations in proteins affecting endocytosis, secretions, lysosomal trafficking, or recycling endosomes cause cytokinesis or cellularization defects in various organisms (17Skop A.R.

Because efficient membrane fusion events require particular lipids as well as proteins for vesicle targeting and subsequent membrane merging (22Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), specific membrane lipids are likely recruited to the cleavage furrow membrane and play a role in the completion of cytokinesis. Indeed, previous studies suggest that a particular lipid domain is likely formed on the cleavage furrow membrane of dividing eggs (23deLaat S.W. van der Saag P.T. Elson E.L. Schlessinger J. Proc.

Treatment of the dividing cells by the PE-binding peptide immobilizes the cell surface PE and inhibits disassembly of the contractile ring, resulting in formation of a long cytoplasmic bridge between the daughter cells (27Emoto K. Umeda M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the redistribution of PE on the cleavage furrow membrane plays a critical role in controlling the disassembly of the contractile ring.

We also found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is localized on the inside of the furrow membrane, probably through specific recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) to the cleavage furrow. Furthermore, this local production of PI(4,5)P2 plays a crucial role in completion of cytokinesis during late stage of cytokinesis. These data provide a potential role of a unique lipid domain at the cleavage furrow membrane in coordinating the contractile rearrangement with the membrane remodeling during late cytokinesis. Materials—Ro09-0198 (Ro peptide) was biotinylated and then conjugated to streptavidin as described previously (26Emoto K. Kobayashi T. Yamaji A. Aizawa H. Yahara I. Inoue K. Umeda M. Proc. Natl.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL 61). R-41, a CHO-K1-derived mutant cell line, was established as a variant that is resistant to Ro peptide as described previously (28Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Incubation of Mitotic Cells with PE-binding Peptide—Mitotic cell populations were isolated from monolayer cultures grown in 850-cm2 plastic roller bottles (Falcon) as described previously (26Emoto K.

Briefly, each bottle was seeded with 8.8 × 106 cells in 100 ml of growth medium. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, the culture medium was replaced with growth medium containing 0.04 μg/ml nocodazole. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and prometaphase cells were isolated by shaking. Prometaphase cells (2 × 105 cells) were incubated with 100 μg/ml Ro peptide-streptavidin complex in 1 ml of 0.5% bovine serum albumin-Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% Neutridoma (Roche Applied Science) for various periods at 37 °C. To release the Ro peptidestreptavidin complex from the cell membranes, the peptide-treated cells were washed three times with Ham's F-12 medium containing 10 μm PE liposomes (PE/phosphatidylcholine = 1/1) and 1% Neutridoma and further incubated in the same medium at 37 °C. Pull-down Assay for GTP-RhoA—The pull-down assay was performed as described previously (10Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were lysed by buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture Complete™ (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then incubated with 30 μg of glutathione S-transferase/Rho-binding domain fusion conjugated with glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer A three times and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel. Bound RhoA was detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with either 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature or 10% (w/v) trichloroacetate in PBS for 15 min on ice, followed by a 10-min permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were then blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk for 30 min at 25 °C and reacted with the first antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Amersham Biosciences), Alexa Fluor™488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor™594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor™488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor™594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (all from Molecular Probes)) diluted to 1/500. For F-actin and DNA staining, cells were incubated with 40 ng/ml TRITC-phalloidin and 0.2 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 1 h at 25°C. Fluorescence images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal microscopy LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss). Plasmid Construction and Expression—PTB701-FLAG and pcDNA3-FLAG were used to construct a mammalian expression vector for N-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged PIP5Kβ and PIP5Kγ as described previously (29Honda A.

The expression vectors for GFP-PH and GFP-PH(PKB/Akt) were generous gifts of Dr. H. Yagisawa (Himeji Institute of Technology) and Dr. U. Kikkawa (Kobe University), respectively. CHO cells cultured on glass coverslips were transfected with each plasmid using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were fixed and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In some experiments, pcDNA3-FLAG-PIP5Kβ-KD was co-transfected with pGFP-PH into CHO cells (pcDNA3-FLAG-PIP5Kβ-KD:pGFP-PH = 5:1 (w/w)). For the plasma membrane labeling, the fixed cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml 1,1′-dilinoleyl-3,3,3′,3′ -tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (FAST DiI™) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 25 °C. Microinjection—CHO cells grown on CELLocate glass coverslips (Eppendorf) were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a double thymidine block method (10Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h at 37 °C, released from arrest, and then arrested at G1/S again with 2 mm thymidine. The cells were then placed under normal growth conditions (time 0). After 10 h (≈1 h before the initiation of mitosis), cells were co-injected with 10 mg/ml Oregon green-conjugated dextran (Moleculer Probe) and 2 mg/ml either control mouse IgG or either of the two distinct anti-PI(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibodies, 2C11 or AM212. Injections were performed with an Eppendorf transinjector (model 5242) and micromanipulator (model 5171) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. After 24 h, cells were fixed and incubated with 40 ng/ml TRITC-phalloidin and 0.2 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C for F-actin and DNA staining, respectively. Flow Cytometry—The pcDNA3 plasmids containing either FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant PIP5Kβ were transfected with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) into CHO cells by using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (FLAG-PIP5Kβ/pEGFP-N1 = 5/1 (w/w)). After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and fixed in cold 70% ethanol. Cell cycle parameters were determined by propidium iodide labeling of nuclear DNA. The GFP-positive cells were selected and analyzed for DNA contents on a flow cytometer, FACScan (BD Biosciences). Accumulation of GTP-bound RhoA at Cytoplasmic Bridge—We have previously shown that a membrane lipid PE is exposed on the cell surface of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis and that immobilization of the cell surface PE by a PE-binding peptide inhibits disassembly of the contractile ring, resulting in formation of an F-actin-rich cytoplasmic bridge between the daughter cells (26Emoto K. Kobayashi T. Yamaji A. Aizawa H. Yahara I. Inoue K. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12867-12872Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 27Emoto K. Umeda M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this cytokinesis blockade by the peptide, we investigated the distribution and the activity state of small GTPase RhoA, which plays a key role in the contractile ring organization during cytokinesis (4Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 5Prokopenko S.N. Saint R. Bellen H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In normal cell division of CHO cells, RhoA was localized 2 h after the initiation of mitosis only in the middle of the bridge, a region known as the midbody (Fig. 1A). In contrast, RhoA was highly accumulated in the cytoplasmic bridge of the peptide-treated cells and co-localized with F-actin (Fig. 1A). The peptide bound on the surface of the cleavage furrow can be removed by incubating the peptide-treated cells with PE-enriched liposome, resulting in disassembly of the contractile ring and formation of binucleated cells (27Emoto K. Umeda M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When the peptide-treated cells were incubated with the PE-enriched liposomes, RhoA relocated from the cytoplasmic bridge to the cytoplasm of the binucleated cells (Fig. 1A). These observations suggest that the PE-binding peptide affects the dissociation of RhoA from the cleavage furrow membrane. To examine whether the accumulated RhoA is the GTP-bound active form or the GDP-bound inactive form, we measured the amounts of cellular GTP-bound RhoA of the peptide-treated cells by a pull-down assay using glutathione S-transferase-fused Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (10Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As a control experiment, normally dividing CHO cells collected 0, 45, 90, and 180 min after the release from prometaphase arrest by nocodazole were subjected to the pull-down assay (Fig. 1B). The cellular level of GTP-bound RhoA transiently increased at 45 min in the telophase and then returned to the basal level at 90 min in G1 phase, which is essentially consistent with previous reports (10Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Likewise, the GTP-bound RhoA level of the mitotic cells incubated with the PE-binding peptide increased at 45 min; however, the maximum level was maintained up to 180 min after the release from the prometaphase arrest, suggesting that RhoA that accumulated at the cytoplasmic bridge was the GTP-bound active form. Furthermore, when the peptide-treated cells were incubated in the presence of PE-enriched liposomes, the cellular GTP-bound RhoA level gradually decreased and eventually reached the basal level at 180 min after the removal of the PE-binding peptide (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the trapping of the cell surface-exposed PE by the peptide impairs RhoA inactivation in the late stage of cytokinesis. PIP5K but Not Other Rho Effectors Colocalized with RhoA at Cytoplasmic Bridge—RhoA performs its cellular functions by binding to downstream effectors (4Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 5Prokopenko S.N. Saint R. Bellen H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Of the identified Rho-binding proteins, citron-kinase (6Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Hirsch E. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Migheli A. Atzori C. Turco E. Triolo R. Dotto G.P. Silengo L. Altruda F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), ROCK/Rho-associated kinase/Rho-kinase (8Yasui Y. Amano M. Nagata K. Inagaki N. Nakamura H. Saya H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (9Kato T. Watanabe N. Morishima Y. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 775-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to localize at the cytokinetic apparatus and to play essential roles in cytokinesis of mammalian cells. Analyses using specific antibodies revealed that neither citron-kinase (Fig. 2A), ROCK, nor mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (data not shown) was detected at the cytoplasmic bridge of the peptide-treated cells. Instead, punctate structures were observed in the cytoplasm. In addition, the cytoplasmic bridge formation was not significantly affected by the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (data not shown). These data suggest that RhoA stabilizes the contractile ring in the cytoplasmic bridge through a novel signaling pathway. We next investigated other RhoA effectors and found that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase β (PIP5Kβ) was co-localized with RhoA at the cytoplasmic bridge of the peptide-treated cells (Fig. 2A). To define the role of PE movements in PIP5Kβ translocation from the cleavage furrow, we analyzed its localization in a CHO mutant cell line (R-41) that is defective in PE biosynthesis and exhibits a defect in the contractile ring disassembly, resulting in cytokinesis arrest at late telophase (27Emoto K. Umeda M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In R-41 cells arrested in cytokinesis, a co-localization of PIP5Kβ with RhoA, but not other Rho effectors (including citron-kinase), was observed at the cleavage furrow (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that PE redistribution is also coupled to the translocation of PIP5Kβ from the cleavage furrow. PIP5K converts phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (30Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Takenawa T. Itoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 32Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the intracellular distribution of PI(4,5)P2 using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase Cδ1, which specifically binds to PI(4,5)P2 on biological membranes (33Fujii M. Ohtsubo M. Ogawa T. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein-fused PH (GFP-PH) domain displayed a robust accumulation at the bridge membrane in the peptide-treated cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that PI(4,5)P2 is locally produced on the inner leaflet of the bridge membrane. Interestingly, staining with a sphingomyelin-specific binding protein, lysenin (34Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), revealed that the plasma membrane sphingomyelin, which is distributed on the cell surface uniformly in interphase cells (34Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), was excluded from the surface of the cytoplasmic bridge (Fig. 2C). Together with our previous findings that the cell surface PE is specifically localized on the cytoplasmic bridge membrane (26Emoto K. Kobayashi T. Yamaji A. Aizawa H. Yahara I. Inoue K. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12867-12872Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that a particular lipid domain in which PE and PI(4,5)P2 are concentrated on the outer and inner leaflet of bilayer, respectively, is formed at the cytoplasmic bridge. Furthermore, this lipid domain may be involved in the stabilization of the contractile ring, leading to the cytoplasmic bridge formation. Local Production of PI(4,5)P2 at Cleavage Furrow Membrane—Because this study provides the first evidence suggesting a local accumulation of PIP5K and PI(4,5)P2 in the cleavage furrow of dividing cells, we further examined the role of PI(4,5)P2 in cytokinesis. In normally dividing cells, PI(4,5)P2 localized uniformly in the plasma membrane during metaphase and early anaphase (Fig. 3, A and B); whereas, in the late telophase, a marked accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 to the cleavage furrow was observed (Fig. 3, C and D, arrow). The intense signal at the cleavage furrow did not appear to reflect the concentration of the plasma membrane itself, because a membrane marker DiI was rather evenly distributed on the plasma membranes (Fig. 3E). In contrast, no significant accumulation of the GFP signal was detected either by a mutant PH domain, PH(K40A), which represents much lower binding affinity to PI(4,5)P2 compared with t"
https://openalex.org/W2078842115,"Mitotic catastrophe occurs as a result of the uncoupling of the onset of mitosis from the completion of DNA replication, but precisely how the ensuing lethality is regulated or what signals are involved is largely unknown. We demonstrate here the essential role of the ATM/ATR-p53 pathway in mitotic catastrophe from premature mitosis. Chk1 deficiency resulted in a premature onset of mitosis because of abnormal activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 and led to the activation of caspases 3 and 9 triggered by cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c. This deficiency was associated with foci formation by the phosphorylated histone, H2AX (γH2AX), specifically at S phase. Ectopic expression of Cdc2AF, a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at inhibitory sites, also induced premature mitosis and foci formation by γH2AX at S phase in both embryonic stem cells and HCT116 cells. Depletion of ATM and ATR protected against cell death from premature mitosis. p53-deficient cells were highly resistant to lethality from premature mitosis as well. Our results therefore suggest that ATM/ATR-p53 is required for mitotic catastrophe that eliminates cells escaping Chk1-dependent mitotic regulation. Loss of this function might be important in mammalian tumorigenesis.

Our results therefore suggest that ATM/ATR-p53 is required for mitotic catastrophe that eliminates cells escaping Chk1-dependent mitotic regulation. Loss of this function might be important in mammalian tumorigenesis. Initiation of mitosis in mammals is triggered by the abrupt activation of cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of Cdc2 is regulated by a complex process that includes the binding to its regulatory subunit, cyclin B, whose level rises at late S phase, and peaks in mitosis (1Nurse P.

Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Just before mitosis, most cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes exist in an inactive state because of the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Thr-14 and Tyr-15, whose phosphorylation is catalyzed by Wee1 and Myt1, and whose dephosphorylation is catalyzed by Cdc25 phosphatases. Mitotic catastrophe was first identified in certain mutant fission yeast strains as a lethal phenotype characterized by gross abnormalities in chromosome segregation during mitosis (5Molz L. Booher R. Young P. Beach D. Genetics. 1989; 122: 773-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ayscough K. Hayles J. MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A similar lethal phenotype was also observed in mammalian cells and found to result from premature mitosis (7Heald R. McLoughlin M. McKeon F. Cell. 1993; 74: 463-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 8Fotedar R. Flatt J. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fitzgerald P. Messier H. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, there is still no broadly accepted definition of the term “mitotic catastrophe,” presumably because the major processes involved have not been described in molecular and genetic terms. For example, some researchers have argued that mitotic catastrophe is fundamentally different from apoptosis (11Roninson I.B. Broude E.V. Chang B.D. Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) because overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes including Bcl-2 and MDR1 can actually enhance the frequency of catastrophic mitosis (12Lock R.B. Stribinskiene L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4006-4012PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ruth A.C. Roninson I.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2576-2578PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study demonstrated that mitotic catastrophe induced by DNA damage is dependent on caspase activation, suggesting that it constitutes a special case of apoptosis (14Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Valent A. Raslova H. Yakushijin K. Horne D. Feunteun J. Lenoir G. Medema R. Vainchenker W. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4362-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Yakushijin K. Horne D. Medema R. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4353-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In response to blocks to DNA replication, eukaryotes activate checkpoint pathways that prevent genomic instability. In yeast models, spontaneous chromosomal breaks and gross chromosomal rearrangements has been detected in mutant strains that cannot respond to stalled or incomplete DNA replication (16Chen C. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 81-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Myung K. Datta A. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, impaired DNA replication checkpoint function in mammals likely causes gross chromosomal rearrangements, leading to the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells unless the cells undergoing premature mitosis are eliminated by cell death. In mammals, incomplete DNA replication is detected by sensors and the signal is then relayed to kinases such as ATR, which phosphorylate and activate yet other kinases, such as Chk1. ATR- and Chk1-deficient mice die at an early embryonic stage of development with gross morphological abnormalities of their cell nuclei, suggesting the occurrence of mitotic catastrophe (18Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takai H. Tominaga K. Motoyama N. Minamishima Y.A. Nagahama H. Tsukiyama T. Ikeda K. Nakayama K. Nakanishi M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Very recently, a study using conditional Chk1 knock-out mice also revealed that Chk1 deficiency caused severe cell death in proliferating somatic cells (21Lam M.H. Liu Q. Elledge S.J. Rosen J.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 45-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which the cell death is triggered and regulated remains elusive. We report here the role of ATM/ATR-p53 in mitotic catastrophe induced by premature mitosis. Either Chk1 depletion or ectopic expression of Cdc2AF effectively caused DNA damage, specifically at S phase. The resulting DNA damage activated the ATM/ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint and subsequently stabilized p53 protein.

Microscopic Laser-scanning Cytometry—ES cells cultured in gelatin-coated six-well plates were infected with Ad-Cre at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 1 h and cultured for an additional 24 h. The cells were stained both with propidium iodide and with antibodies to pHH3 and Alexa488-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes). After exposure to RNase A, the stained cells were analyzed with an LSC system (Olympus). Kinase Activity Assays—Cyclin B1- and cyclin A1-dependent kinase activities were assayed as described (23Nakanishi M. Ando H. Watanabe N. Kitamura K. Ito K. Okayama H. Miyamoto T. Agui T. Sasaki M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, the kinase activity was measured by incubation of 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 185 kBq of [γ-P32]ATP (222TBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 200 nm histone H1 as a substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and substrate phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. TUNEL Staining and Analysis of Foci Formation—DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis was detected with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) (24Fujita F. Taniguchi Y. Kato T.

Production of Adenoviruses Expressing Mouse Cdc2AF—The entire mouse Cdc2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and then ligated into pBluescript SKII (Stratagene). The Cdc2AF mutant was produced by a two-step PCR using pBSCdc2 as a template and the sets of primers as follows, mCdc2-01RI (5′-GGAATTCGCCACCATGGAAGACTATATCAAAATAGAG-3′) and mCdc2–02RI (5′-GGAATTCCTACATCTTCTTAATCTGATTGTC-3′), and the inner primers mCdc2AF-04 (5′-ATACACCACACCGAAAGCACCTTC-3′) and mCdc2AF-03 (5′-GAAGGTGCTTTCGGTGTGGTGTAT-3′). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the pCAGGS vector at a site downstream of the CAG promoter. The construct containing the CAG promoter and Cdc2AF cDNA was subcloned into pENTER 1A (Invitrogen) and then into pAd/PL-DEST (Invitrogen). Adenoviruses expressing Cdc2AF were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol (ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System, Invitrogen). Knockdown Experiments by siRNA Transfection—HCT116 cells were transfected with a control siRNA (Silencer Negative Control number 1, Ambion 4611) or siRNAs for cyclin B1 (CAUGAGAGCCAUCCUAAUUtt), ATM (Silencer™ Validated siRNA, ATM (51323), Ambion), ATR (CCUCCGUGAUGUUGCUUGAtt), or Chk1 (GCGTGCCGTAGACTGTCCAtt) using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Chk1 Deficiency Results in Premature Mitosis through Premature Activation of Cyclin B-Cdc2—To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which mitotic catastrophe is regulated, we first generated a cell system in which premature mitosis is synchronously inducible. We generated conditional Chk1-deficient mouse ES cells by flanking the second exon of one Chk1 allele with loxP sites and disrupting the other allele by gene targeting (Fig. 1A). The lox-flanked (“floxed”) Chk1 allele could thus be converted to a null allele by excision of exon 2, which contains the translational initiation sequence and encodes the ATP binding site of the kinase, through the action of Cre recombinase. The construction of the floxed allele was confirmed by the appearance of an 11-kb NdeI fragment on Southern blot hybridization with a probe generated from a sequence 5′ of the targeted region (Fig. 1B). Infection of the Chk1lox/- ES cells with an adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of Chk1 protein within 12 h after infection and its almost complete disappearance after 24 h (Fig. 1C), indicating that the floxed fragment of the Chk1 allele was removed (yielding the Δ allele) in most cells within 24 h after infection. A similar infection of Chk1+/- cells had no effect on the abundance of Chk1. Infection with an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase verified that >95% of ES cells became infected under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Whereas Chk1+/- cells continued to increase in number during 96 h of culture, the Chk1Δ/- cells exhibited a pronounced growth defect (Fig. 1D), indicating that Chk1 is essential for ES cell proliferation. We next examined the DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoint functions in Chk1Δ/- cells. Chk1lox/- and Chk1Δ/- cells were treated with hydroxyurea (2.5 mm) or X radiation (10 gray), and their mitotic indices were measured. As expected, cell cycle arrest before mitosis induced by hydroxyurea (stalled replication forks) or X-radiation (DNA damage) was abolished in Chk1Δ/- cells (Fig. 1E). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that, in the case of Chk1+/- cells, >95% of those that were phosphohistone H3 on Ser-10 (pHH3)-positive, an M-phase marker, had a 4N DNA content. With Chk1Δ/- cells, however, 70% of the pHH3-positives had a DNA content of less than 4N (Fig. 2A). Microscopic laser-scanning cytometry revealed that chromosomal condensation was also observed in pHH3-positive Chk1Δ/- cells with a DNA content of less than 4N (Fig. 2B). Quantitation of chromosome condensation in individual cells revealed that >90% of Chk1+/- cells with condensed chromosomes had a DNA content of 4N, whereas 35% of Chk1Δ/- cells with condensed chromosomes had a DNA content of less than 4N (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results clearly indicated that Chk1 deficiency results in the onset of mitosis before completion of DNA replication. We next examined the effect of Chk1 depletion on mitotic inducers. The abundance of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 in Chk1Δ/- ES cells did not vary after Ad-Cre infection (Fig. 2D). Phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr-15, however, was markedly reduced at 36 h and undetectable at 48 h after Ad-Cre infection of Chk1Δ/- cells (Fig. 2D). Consistent with this observation, the activity of cyclin B1-Cdc2 was up-regulated. In contrast, cyclin A-dependent kinase activity was not affected by Chk1 depletion, although the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was slightly decreased (Fig. 2D). Cell Death Induced by Premature Mitosis Is a Form of Caspase-dependent Apoptosis Triggered by Cytochrome c Release—Premature mitosis induced by Chk1 depletion led to cell death as a result of mitotic catastrophe. We next examined whether this cell death was due to apoptosis. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was markedly greater among Chk1Δ/- cells than among Chk1+/- cells (Fig. 3A). The cell death was almost completely blocked by the addition of the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD (Fig. 3B). Z-VAD itself did not affect cell cycle progression (data not shown). These results suggested that cell death induced by Chk1 depletion is because of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Activated forms of caspases 3 and 9 were readily detected in Chk1Δ/- cells but not in Chk1+/- cells (Fig. 3C). We next asked whether Chk1 depletion caused cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c, which triggers Apaf-1/caspase 9 complex and initiates caspase 9 activation (25Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c was readily detected in the cytoplasmic fraction from Chk1Δ/- cells even in the presence of Z-VAD (Fig. 3D). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicated by a left shift in JC-1 fluorescence, was also observed in Chk1Δ/- cells (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results suggested that apoptosis induced by premature mitosis is dependent on mitochondrial events. Chk1 Deficiency Causes DNA Damage during S Phase in a Manner Dependent on Active Cyclin B-Cdc2—To determine whether apoptosis induced by premature mitosis is because of DNA damage, we examined the foci formation of phospho-H2AX (γH2AX), a robust marker for cellular DSBs (26Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). An increase in the amount and foci formation of γH2AX was observed after Chk1 depletion (Fig. 4A) as well as after IR irradiation used as a control. In addition, FACS analysis showed the increased population of cells with DNA content of less than 2N (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that premature mitosis induced by Chk1 depletion causes DNA damage, possibly DSBs. In yeast, DNA replication checkpoint kinases stabilize DNA replication fork progression during S phase (27Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 28Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the DNA damage caused by Chk1 depletion was because of a destabilized DNA replication fork and not the premature activation of cyclin B-Cdc2. To clarify this point, we first asked whether cell death induced by Chk1 depletion could be prevented by the inhibition of active cyclin B-Cdc2. Chk1-deficient cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary and released into S phase. The increase in the sub-G1 population during S phase was significantly reduced by treatment with Purvalanol A (29Gray N.S. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A.M. Norman T.C. Kwon S. Espinoza F.H. Morgan D.O. Barnes G. LeClerc S. Meijer L. Kim S.H. Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G. Science. 1998; 281: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of cyclin B-Cdc2, but was unaffected by nocodazole (Fig. 4C). Although Purvalanol A has also been reported to inhibit cyclin A-Cdk2 with lower efficiency when compared with cyclin B-Cdc2, 10 μm Purvalanol A in the culture medium inhibited the initiation of mitosis but did not affect the initiation and progression of DNA replication in wild-type ES cells, suggesting that this reduction of sub-G1 population is likely because of inhibition of cyclin B-Cdc2 activity. More importantly, reduction of cyclin B1 protein by a specific siRNA significantly suppressed cancer cell death induced by Chk1 reduction (Fig. 4D) or ectopic expression of Cdc2AF (see below) (Fig. 4E). Thus, the cell death appeared to require active cyclin B-Cdc2, suggesting that the DNA damage from premature mitosis was because of the premature activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 and not to the loss of Chk1 function per se. We then determined the phases of the cell cycle at which DNA damage is induced by active cyclin B-Cdc2. Chk1-depleted cells were synchronized at M phase and then released into G1 phase. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, and the cell cycle and foci formation by γH2AX were analyzed. Immunoblotting using anti-Chk1 antibody revealed that Chk1 protein was not detected in Chk1Δ/- ES cells during this experimental period (Fig. 4F). The level of Cdc2 remained almost unchanging in both Chk1+/- and Chk1Δ/- ES cells, whereas phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr-15 was detected on Chk1+/- cells but was hardly detectable in Chk1Δ/- cells (Fig. 4F). FACScan analysis showed that although Chk1+/- cells entered into S phase at 6 h after terminating nocodazole treatment and completed DNA replication at 12h, Chk1Δ/- cells failed to progress and complete S phase (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, PurA treatment reversed this failure (Fig. 4G). Foci formation by γH2AX was significantly increased beginning 9 h after termination of nocodazole treatment at which point cells entered into S phase (Fig. 4H). It is noteworthy that PurA treatment reduced foci formation by γH2AX. There results suggested that premature activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 at S phase but not at M to G1 phases caused DNA damage. Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in response to DNA damage has been shown to be dependent on ATM/ATR and subsequent stabilization of p53 protein (30Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Chk1-depletion would activate this response. The protein level of p53 was significantly increased in Chk1Δ/- cells (Fig. 4I), and modification of Chk2 was readily detected after Chk1 depletion (Fig. 4I). These results suggested that premature mitosis induced by Chk1 depletion activates the DNA damage checkpoint response. Ectopic Expression of Cdc2AF Mimics Chk1 Deficiency in ES Cells— Because DNA damage induced by Chk1 deficiency was almost completely suppressed by inhibition of cyclin B-Cdc2, we determined whether ectopic expression of Cdc2AF caused DNA damage during S phase progression. As expected, ectopic expression of Cdc2AF induced premature mitosis in ES cells (Fig. 5A). The level of Cdc2 protein expressed was increased almost 2-fold starting from 12 h after infection of the adenovirus expressing Cdc2AF (Fig. 5B), indicating that the expression level of Cdc2AF protein was almost the same as that of endogenous Cdc2. The ectopic expression of Cdc2AF effectively induced apoptosis that was inhibited by treatment with Z-VAD (Fig. 5C). As with Chk1 deficiency, immunoblotting revealed that ectopic expression of Cdc2AF caused the Chk2 band to shift upward and increased the level of p53 protein (Fig. 5D). Foci formation by γH2AX was also observed in ES cells expressing Cdc2AF as well as in cells exposed to IR (Fig. 5E). It is noteworthy that Cdc2AF caused DNA damage specifically at S phase and not at other phases of the cell cycle (data not shown) and thereby induced apoptosis (Fig. 5F), although the level of Cdc2AF was relatively constant (Fig. 5G). These results suggested that ectopic expression of Cdc2AF mimics a Chk1-deficiency in ES cells. Ectopic Expression of Cdc2AF Induces Premature Mitosis in HCT116 Cells—It has been previously reported that in HeLa cells nuclear localization of cyclin B as well as dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at inhibitory sites is also required for mitotic entry after DNA damage (31Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 32Morgan D.O. Fisher R.P. Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Nourse J. Chamberlin H. Jin P. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1998; 4: 77-83Google Scholar). During S phase and G2, cyclin B1 accumulates in the cytoplasm, and, just before mitosis, the majority of the cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes suddenly appear in the nucleus. However, in embryonic mouse cells, nuclear accumulation of cyclin B is also regulated by the activation of Cdc2 (33Ohashi A. Minami N. Imai H. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that ectopic expression of Cdc2AF triggers nuclear accumulation of cyclin B followed by induction of premature mitosis in somatic cells. The ectopic expression of Cdc2AF in human colon cancer HCT116 cells effectively increased the number of pHH3-positive cells with a DNA content of less than 4N, suggesting the induction of premature mitosis (Fig. 6A). In addition, foci formation by γH2AX was readily detected in wild-type, Chk2-/-, and p53-/- HCT116 cells expressing Cdc2AF (Fig. 6B), suggesting that foci formation occurs in a manner independent of functional Chk2 and p53 in mitotic catastrophe. These results demonstrated that the premature mitosis induced by Cdc2AF in HCT116 cells did not require either Chk2 or p53. Role of ATM/ATR-Chk2-p53 in Mitotic Catastrophe—Because focus formation by γH2AX after ionizing radiation is dependent on ATM and ATR (34Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar), the above data suggested that these kinases are active in cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe. We therefore determined the role of these kinases in apoptosis. Wild-type HCT116 cells expressing Cdc2AF were transfected with specific siRNAs for these kinases, and the change in population of the sub-G1 fraction was determined. Significant reductions of ATM and ATR proteins were detected after transfection of their specific siRNAs (Fig. 6C). A significant increase in this population was observed in wild-type HCT116 cells after expression of Cdc2AF. It is noteworthy that reduction of ATM and ATR proteins diminished this effect (Fig. 6D). Stabilization of p53 protein in HCT116 cells expressing Cdc2AF was also diminished by the reduction of ATM and ATR proteins, suggesting that ATM/ATR function upstream of p53 (Fig. 6E). The increase in the sub-G1 population was significantly diminished in p53-/- HCT116 cells, indicating that p53 plays an important role in apoptosis from premature mitosis (Fig. 6F). Although Chk2 appeared to be involved in the regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis because of DSBs in mouse (35Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6521-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), apoptosis induced by premature mitosis in Chk2-/- HCT116 was almost the same as that in wild-type cells (data not shown). In this regard, it has also been reported that Chk2 is not involved in p53 regulation in human cells (37Jallepalli P.V. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Bunz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20475-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for Chk2 in p53 regulation might be species-dependent. These results clearly indicate the critical role of the ATM/ATR-p53 pathway in cell death induced by mitotic catastrophe even though developmental defects in Chk1-null mice could not be prevented by p53 depletion, presumably because of a loss of an essential function of Chk1 in DNA replication independent of p53 (Fig. 3B). In conclusion, Chk1 deficiency resulted in a premature onset of mitosis because of abnormal activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 and led to the caspase-dependent apoptosis. This abnormal activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 was associated with DNA damage, showing foci formation of γH2AX, specifically at S phase. Although the mechanism by which DNA damage is induced by active cyclin B-Cdc2 remains elusive, our present results suggest that mitotic catastrophe induced by premature mitosis is, at least in part, dependent on the ATM/ATR-p53 pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2057742004,"When overexpressed, a short cytoplasmic domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), normally unmasked in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, activates caspase-3 and induces neuronal death. Death induction by this ""Jcasp"" domain is lost when tyrosine 653 is changed into an aspartate, suggesting specific interactions with unknown partners. To identify these putative partners and start to elucidate the mechanisms involved in Jcasp-induced cell death, we internalized a biotinylated version of the peptide into primary neurons and analyzed intracellular interacting proteins by pull-down and mass spectrometry. We find that SET protein, also called template-activating factor (TAF1beta) or phosphatase 2A inhibitor 2 (I2(PP2A)), specifically binds Jcasp early after internalization and that SET and Jcasp interact directly in vitro. Down-regulation of SET reduces Jcasp-induced cell death, confirming a role of this protein in Jcasp-induced apoptosis. Conversely, SET gain of function increases cell death, which suggests that SET level is crucial for neuronal survival/death. Taken together, these results suggest that SET is part of a neuronal apoptotic pathway related to Alzheimer's disease and provides a new entry in the analysis of this pathology."

Mfp-1 (Mytilus foot protein-1) is a conspicuous component of the protective outer cuticle of byssal threads given its high 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) content at 10-15 mol %. Amino acid analysis of mfp-1 extracted from successive foot sections of Mytilus galloprovincialis reveals a post-translationally mediated gradient with highest Dopa levels present in mfp-1 from the accessory gland near the tip of the foot decreasing gradually toward the base. The Dopa content of successive segments of byssal threads decreases from the distal to the proximal end and thus reflects the trend of mfp-1 in the foot. Inductively coupled plasma analysis indicates that certain metal ions including iron follow the trend in Dopa along the thread. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry showed that iron, when present, was concentrated in the cuticle of the threads but sparse in the core. The axial iron gradient appears most closely correlated with the Dopa gradient. The direct incubation of mussels and byssal threads in Fe3+ supplemented seawater showed that byssal threads are unable to sequester iron from the seawater. Instead, particulate/soluble iron is actively taken up by mussels during filter feeding and incorporated into byssal threads during their secretion.

Our results suggest that mussels may exploit the interplay between Dopa and metals to tailor the different parts of threads for specific mechanical properties. Organisms build a variety of load-bearing materials with unique mechanical properties chiefly by adjusting two parameters, composition and architecture. In principle, composition and architecture in tissues can be adjusted either abruptly or gradually, but it is becoming increasingly evident that nature prefers gradients (1Waite J.H. Vaccaro E. Sun C. Lucas J.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Suresh S. Science. 2001; 292: 2447-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Manufactured materials with graded mechanical properties show superior resistance to contact deformation and damage (2Suresh S. Science. 2001; 292: 2447-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and this would also have adaptive benefits in nature, but there are few studies of how natural gradients are made. Recent results with byssal threads are revealing how composition and microstructural gradients are combined into a functional material. Byssal threads in mussels (Mytilus sp.) collectively serve as a robust holdfast for attachment to hard substrates in the turbulent intertidal zone. In the case of Mytilus edulis, a typical byssus consists of 40-100 threads each ∼4-5-cm long (3Waite J.H. Case S.T. Biopolymers. 19. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 27-54Google Scholar). Each thread is rapidly manufactured by the foot of the mussel via an injection-molding-like process and becomes part of an extensive extraorganismic, extracellular connective tissue that enables strong substrate attachment for mussels in the intertidal zone (3Waite J.H. Case S.T. Biopolymers. 19. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 27-54Google Scholar). In turbulent flow, suspended sand commonly abrades all exposed parts of mussels, and organic structures such as the periostracum are particularly prone to wear. The wear of byssal threads has not been specifically examined, although the ultrastructure of a protective outer cuticle has been noted (4Vitellaro-Zucarrello L. Tissue Cell. 1981; 13: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Holten-Andersen N. Slack N. Zok F. Waite J.H. Viney C. Katti K. Ulm F. Hellmich C. Mechanical Properties of Bioinspired and Biological Materials. Materials Research Society, Warredale, PA2005: 155-160Google Scholar). Earlier studies have demonstrated that the thread core consists of an axially graded material in both mechanical and molecular properties. Three collagenous proteins, preCOL 2The abbreviation used are:preCOLprecollagenDopa3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanineNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumEDSenergy dispersive spectrometryICPinductively coupled plasma -P, -D, and -NG make up the bulk of the thread core with two of these, D and P, providing the building blocks for molecular gradients (6Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). The preCOLs are bent-core or banana-shaped structures because of the kinks in collagen triple helix (7Hassenkam T. Gutsmann T. Hansma P. Sagert J. Waite J.H. Biomacromolecules. 2004; 5: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mechanical consequences of the molecular gradients presumably arise from the flanking domains of preCOLs D and P, which resemble dragline silk and elastin, respectively (1Waite J.H. Vaccaro E. Sun C. Lucas J.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The core region of the thread is coated with a 4-5-μm thick layer of protective cuticle (thicker at the proximal end of thread), of which mfp-1 is a major component (3Waite J.H. Case S.T.

It is intriguing to materials research how this cuticle both protects the core and accommodates the strain of nearly 70% exhibited by the thread core (9Bell E.C. Gosline J.M. J. Exp.

It has a mass of ∼110 kDa and contains an average of 10-15 mol % Dopa (13Taylor S.W. Luther G.W. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 5819-5824Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mfp-1 from Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mfp-1) has not been characterized; however, its sequence has been deduced from cDNA to share a 78% identity with mfp-1 without the hexapeptide repeats (14Inoue K. Odo S. J. Biol. Bull. 1994; 186: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Besides being a structural component of the thread cuticle, mfp-1 has been used as a universal cell and tissue attachment factor, and the Dopa moiety is being developed as a biomimetic tether to attach polyethylene glycol to biomedical implant surfaces (15Dalsin J.L.

Langmuir. 2005; 21: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interest in Dopa initially came from its tendency to oxidize and cross-link in the process known as quinone tanning (17Waite J.H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the presence of metal ions such as Fe(III), Dopa can form catechol complexes with exceptional stability (18Taylor S.W. Chase D.B. Emptage M.H. Nelson M.J. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 7572-7577Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Dopa-containing proteins produced by certain marine invertebrates are believed to function in adhesion, sclerotization, and wound repair (18Taylor S.W. Chase D.B. Emptage M.H. Nelson M.J. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 7572-7577Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The function of mfp-1 in byssal thread cuticle is not known yet. It is believed that mfp-1 (from M. edulis) is deposited as a cuticular varnish layer over the entire thread (8Benedict C.V. Waite J.H. J. Morphol. 1986; 189: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of the extensive cross-linking of mfp-1 in the threads, there have been few reliable data on the localization and distribution of mfp-1 in the thread. Iron and other metals are known to be associated with byssal threads (19Coombs T.L. Keller P.J. Aquat. Toxicol. 1981; 1: 291-300Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Tateda Y. Koyanagi T. Bull.

To date, the function of metals in byssus is still debated. Taylor et al. (13Taylor S.W. Luther G.W. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 5819-5824Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Taylor S.W.

Stability constants of comparable magnitude are also known for catecholate complexes with Al(III) and Si(IV) (16Dalsin J.L. Lin L. Tosatti S. Voros J. Textor M. Messersmith P.B. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Mfp-1 and Fe3+ combine to form cross-links through the Dopa moiety (23Frank B.P. Belfort G. Biotechnol.

Messersmith P.B. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, how the metals react with proteins in the thread remains unknown. Information on this will greatly help to understand the structure and function of the byssus cuticle. The goal of this study was to investigate the nature of Dopa distribution along the distal-proximal axis of the foot and thread and to explore how this correlates to the inorganic composition of the thread. We detected a gradient in the post-translational modification of tyrosine to Dopa along the length of the foot, and this gradient is exploited to fabricate an analogous gradient in the byssal thread. This is the first report of a spatial gradient of post-translational modification in a biomaterial. Perhaps related to the tendency of Dopa for complexation with metal ions, the Dopa gradient is closely coupled to similar trends in the distribution of Al and Fe. Mfp-1 Extraction—Mussels used for this study were M. galloprovincialis. Excised mussel feet were frozen at -80 °C and depigmented by scraping the pigment off of the frozen tissue with a surgical blade. After depigmentation, each mussel foot was cut into seven equal sections as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Because each mussel foot has several glands in it including the phenol, accessory, collagen, and stem glands among others (3Waite J.H. Case S.T. Biopolymers. 19. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 27-54Google Scholar) and exhibits a gradient distribution of proteins along its length (25Qin X.X. Waite J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10517-10522Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Coyne K.J. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 203: 1425-1431Google Scholar, 27Waite J.H. Qin X.X. Coyne K.J.

Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 1240-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), feet selected for the experiments were almost the same size to minimize mixing of proteins from different parts of the foot. In the feet selected, section number 1 was usually the tip, and number 2 was usually the phenol gland or at least the majority of it. Mfp-1 was extracted based on previous studies (3Waite J.H. Case S.T. Biopolymers. 19. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 27-54Google Scholar). Briefly, same numbered sections were pooled and extracted with 1% perchloric acid. The samples were then microfuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatants were saved. Duplicated samples with roughly the same amount of proteins were run on 10% acid-urea gel at 10 mA constant current and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 for protein stain and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) for Dopa-containing protein stain, respectively. Mfp-1 Dopa Concentration Analysis—Proteins (mainly mfp-1) extracted from the seven foot sections were loaded and run on 10% acid-urea gel followed by transferring to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) at 200 mA constant current for 1 h. After transfer, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue G-250, and the bands corresponding to mfp-1 were excised and hydrolyzed in vacuo at 110 °C for 24 h in the presence of 6 m HCl and 10% phenol. Hydrolyzed samples were flash evaporated, resuspended and analyzed by a Beckman 6300 Autoanalyzer equipped with a dedicated HPLC according to Waite (29Waite J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, all amino acids including Dopa were separated by a Na-HPLC ion exchange column (Beckman Coulter number 338076) and detected by postcolumn ninhydrin derivatization. Elution signals were processed by HP ChemStation for LC. Thread Dopa Concentration Analysis—Wild M. galloprovincialis threads were normalized and sectioned into six pieces as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Same numbered sections were pooled and hydrolyzed at 158 °C in vacuo for 1 h. The hydrolysate was flash-evaporated and analyzed for amino acid composition as described above. Reported results were the average of three hydrolysates. Thread Metal Concentration Analysis—To measure the concentration of the elements of interest in the different sections of the threads, normalized thread sections were first weighed and then hydrolyzed as above at 158 °C in vacuo for 1 h, and the concentration of the elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The ICP used for this study was a TJA High Resolution IRIS model (Thermo Optik Inc., Franklin, MA). Standards used for analysis were purchased from High-Purity Standards, SC. Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) Line Scans—To detect the distribution pattern of the elements of interest across a section of the thread, Q-H2O-washed threads were cut open under a dissecting microscope and mounted onto conductive carbon tape on scanning electron microscope posts with the cut surface facing up and lyophilized. The analysis was done on a FEI Co. XL30 environmental scanning electron microscope equipped with a Princeton Gamma Tech EDS with a PRISM IG intrinsic germanium detector for x-ray microanalysis. IMIX microanalysis software was used for x-ray acquisition, line profiles and analysis. Because of the nature of environmental scanning electron microscope, the tested samples did not need to be gold-coated. Thread Iron Accumulation Study—Mussels maintained in circulating sea water tanks in the laboratory for at least 3 weeks after being collected from the wild were transferred to sea water adjusted to an equivalent iron concentration of 5 mm and maintained for 2 days with aeration. The high iron seawater was made by dissolving 5.406 g of FeCl3·6H2O in deionized water then adding this solution to 4 liters of sea water with aeration for 1 h before introducing the mussels. The mussels did not produce any threads for the first 2 days, so the solution was diluted 10 times. Newly produced threads from each mussel were harvested after 48 h and washed thoroughly with Q-H2O. Treated threads were then dried and mounted on scanning electron microscope posts. The samples were sputter-coated with gold for 20 s using a Denton Vacuum DESK II coater (Moorestown, NJ) and examined with a Tescan Vega TS 5130MM thermionic emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an IXRF energy dispersive spectrometer (Houston, TX). Detecting Mfp-1 and Dopa by PAGE—Previous work established that mfp-1s are selectively solubilized from acid-extracted mussel foot tissue by 1% perchloric acid. This convenient shortcut was exploited to extract mfp-1 from different sections of M. galloprovincialis foot. These extractions were run in parallel on acid-urea PAGE. One lot was stained for protein using Coomassie Blue R-250 (Fig. 2A) and the other for Dopa using a redox cycling stain (NBT) (Fig. 2B). We found that when loading roughly the same amount of protein in each lane based on the CBR stain intensity, there was a progressive decrease in NBT staining along the distal to proximal direction. Normally mfp-1 extracted from the section near the distal end stained most intensely with NBT. The gel results indicate that mfp-1 production by secretory cells along the foot appears to be coupled to an incrementally regulated post-translational modification of tyrosine to Dopa. Detecting Mfp-1 Dopa by Amino Acid Analysis—To confirm the results suggested by gel CBR-NBT staining, microanalysis of protein transferred from the gel to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, MA) was performed. TABLE ONE shows that the composition of transferred bands corresponding to mfp-1 are consistent with the composition of bulk-purified mfp-1. Dopa/Tyr ratios in mfp-1 extracted from successive foot sections are seen in Fig. 3 to decrease from the tip to the base. Mfp-1 extracted from section #2 was mainly from the phenol gland vicinity (∼3 mm from the tip) with a Dopa/Tyr of about 2.2, whereas the Dopa/Tyr in the mfp-1 extracted from the base of the foot was ∼0.5. Therefore, Dopa is four times more abundant in mfp-1 from the distal portion as it is from the base of the mussel foot. We also calculated the combined contents of Dopa and Tyr, and this value remained essentially constant along the foot. This result supports the idea that the Dopa gradient in mfp-1 is established in the accessory gland cells before the protein is released into the ventral groove where the threads are molded.TABLE ONEAmino acid composition of distal thread and mfp-1 in residues/100 residuesDistal threadMfp-1 purifiedMefp-1 reportedaWaite (11).Mfp-1 cDNADihydroxyproline0.94.13Hydroxyproline8.210.710.2Asx7.23.82.21.1Thr2.810.911.710.5Ser6.18.410.212.3Glx4.42.30.90.3Pro4.96.78.124.8Gly283.33.21.0Ala16.87.58.17.0Cys0.20.500Val3.31.70.80.5Met0.030.10.1Ile1.41.00.81.1Leu2.11.11.11.1Dopa1.510.511.0Tyr2.17.27.019.6Phe1.10.40.10.1His1.00.60.70.4Hydroxylysine1.30.7Lys3.917.420.219.6Arg2.81.20.60.5Total100100100100a Waite (11Waite J.H.

Open table in a new tab Detection of Dopa in Thread—To determine whether the mfp-1 Dopa gradient in the foot is reflected in the thread, amino acid analysis of hydrolysates from different thread sections was performed, and the results are as shown in Fig. 4. The content of Tyr in mol % showed very little variation along the thread, whereas the levels of Dopa steadily decreased along the distal to proximal axis. Because the Tyr concentration did not change much along the thread, the ratio of the two followed the same trend as the change of Dopa. The results indicate that distal thread portions contain higher levels of Dopa than the proximal thread but also that Tyr-containing proteins besides mfp-1 are present in the thread. Metal Analysis by ICP—Bulk concentrations of some metals and non-metallic elements of interest along the thread were analyzed by hydrolyzing thread sections (prepared in the same way as above) followed by ICP analysis. For better comparison, the concentrations of these elements in the plaque were also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5, for each element tested, the concentration was frequently slightly higher in the distal than the proximal region of the thread. There was very little variation among the sections that came from either the distal (Distal #1, #2, #3, and transition) or the proximal (proximal #1 and #2) region. Plaques always seemed to have the highest metal concentration in the samples tested. Elemental Analysis by EDS—The distributions of the elements across the thread were examined by EDS. Fig. 6 shows a line scan through longitudinal cross-sections of the distal and proximal thread, respectively. The major elements found included sulfur, silicon, aluminum, and iron. Many of the elements were evenly distributed across the thread especially in proximal threads. However, some, notably sulfur, aluminum, and iron in distal thread sections, were not. Of these, aluminum, was localized to the outer thread periphery, whereas sulfur was broadly localized to the inner periphery. Iron was prominent and sharply localized to the outer cuticle region in the distal thread portions. However, EDS detected iron in only 50% of the threads sampled from mussels maintained in tanks with circulating natural seawater for either short or long periods after their collection from the wild. Fe(III) Uptake Analysis—The mussels first transferred into seawater supplemented with high iron (5 mm) were viable but did not produce any threads. Thread production started after the seawater was diluted 10 times (0.5 mm). When FeCl3 is added to seawater it reacts to form the insoluble Fe(OH)3. It was reported the that the estimated concentration of hydroxocomplex species of Fe3+ in seawater is ∼0.01-1 nm (30Kuma K. Katsumoto A. Kawakami H. Takatori F. Matsunaga K. Deep Sea Res. Part I. 1998; 45: 91-113Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Liu X. Millero F.J. Mar. Chem. 2002; 77: 43-54Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Therefore, almost all of the iron we added was in particulate form. However, because we did not change anything besides the dilution of the iron supplement, we can assume that the iron particulates in the solution were ∼10% of the initial level. EDS line scan results as shown in Fig. 7 showed that iron was concentrated in the cuticle of the threads produced by mussels exposed to iron-supplemented seawater. On the other hand, threads made by mussels prior to the transfer from normal to iron-supplemented seawater did not show any enrichment of iron. Threads that were produced in normal seawater then incubated in iron-supplemented seawater without the attached mussels showed no sign of iron. Thus, iron incorporation into byssal threads is dependent on iron uptake by the live mussel and occurs only during the formation of a new thread. This is the first report of a spatial gradient involving a post-translational modification of any amino acid in a biological tissue. Previous studies of mussel byssus demonstrated protein gradients involving preCols and matrix proteins in byssal threads (6Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sun C. Lucas J.M. Waite J.H. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 1240-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as corresponding mRNA gradients in mussel foot (25Qin X.X. Waite J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10517-10522Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Coyne K.J. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 203: 1425-1431Google Scholar). From those studies, it was suggested that the gradients were established well before the proteins were released into the ventral groove and processed into a thread (25Qin X.X. Waite J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10517-10522Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Successive foot extractions of mfp-1 make it clear that the Dopa gradient is also fabricated co- or post-translationally prior to secretion, but how the enzymes involved are regulated remains completely unknown. It is not possible to extract mfp-1 from the thread and in situ localization is difficult because of rapid and extensive cross-linking (32Anderson K.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 3065-3076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Robinson M.W. Colhoun L.M. Fairweather I. Brennan G.P. Waite J.H. Parasitol. 2001; 123: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Dopa is therefore commonly used as a surrogate for the protein. There are three known proteins that contribute Dopa residues to the distal thread composition. These are preCOL-D and -NG with Dopa levels of <1 mol % each, and mfp-1 with a high of 15 mol % (11Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2911-2915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core represents the greater portion (∼85%) of thread volume and is dominated by the preCOLs in roughly equal parts, thus preCOLs could not contribute more than 0.5 mol % Dopa to thread composition. Mfp-1 is restricted to the cuticle, which is 4-μm thick in a typical thread with 100-μm diameter (5Holten-Andersen N. Slack N. Zok F. Waite J.H. Viney C. Katti K. Ulm F. Hellmich C. Mechanical Properties of Bioinspired and Biological Materials. Materials Research Society, Warredale, PA2005: 155-160Google Scholar, 8Benedict C.V. Waite J.H. J. Morphol. 1986; 189: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If mfp-1 is the only constituent in the cuticle, then the Dopa it contributes to the thread composition would be 2.1 mol %. In contrast, if mfp-1 fills only 0.5 of the volume of the cuticle then its Dopa contribution would be 1.05 mol %. The Dopa concentration actually measured from the distal thread was 2.2 mol %. Therefore, after subtracting the preCOL contribution, the highest Dopa from mfp-1 would be 2.2 mol %-0.68 mol % = 1.52 mol %, which is within the 1.05 mol % and 2.1 mol % boundaries defined above. Mfp-1 content of byssal threads can also be approached from another perspective. Purified mfp-1 contains ∼6 mol % of a unique amino acid known as trans 2,3,-cis 3,4,-dihydroxyproline (13Taylor S.W. Luther G.W. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 5819-5824Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This is a less attractive marker than Dopa for mfp-1, because it is more difficult to measure. If we are correct in assuming that mfp-1 is the only dihydroxyproline-containing protein in the thread and it is evenly distributed in the distal cuticle, the calculated dihydroxyproline mol % concentration in the distal thread would be 0.86 mol %. This number is very close to the mol % of dihydroxyproline (0.9 mol %) detected in the distal thread as shown in TABLE ONE and independently supports the assumptions made. The Dopa gradient in the thread is thus consistent with and results from a distal to proximal mfp-1 distribution that is uniform along the foot but with diminishing levels of Dopa. Metal association with byssus is well known (18Taylor S.W. Chase D.B. Emptage M.H. Nelson M.J. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 7572-7577Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the byssus is often used as an environmental indicator for heavy metal pollution (34Koide M. Lee D.S. Goldberg E.D. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. 1982; 15: 679-695Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ICP analysis of threads made in pristine seawater showed that the elements sampled, such as silicon, aluminum, and iron, all have higher concentrations in the distal than in the proximal portions. EDS line scans of threads were generally consistent with ICP data, with one notable anomaly. Iron was detected by EDS in only 50% of the threads, although ICP analysis consistently indicated moderate amounts. This is not necessarily contradictory given that ICP analysis requires many threads, whereas EDS samples a single thread at a time. When iron was detected by EDS, it was sharply localized to the cuticle of the thread. It is not known whether the threads were equally functional with and without iron, but their appearance was the same. Our studies show conclusively that exposure of mussels with iron-deficient threads to iron-supplemented seawater resulted in enhanced iron deposition in the cuticle of all the threads tested. This suggests that iron deposition in byssal threads is based not only on the availability of iron, but the availability of iron in any form. Because the solubility of iron is only 0.01-1 nm in seawater, even supplements of soluble iron will be transformed to colloidal iron hydroxide with a solubility product (Ksp) of only 10-39. This would require a very aggressive iron recovery strategy in the gut and/or gills of the mussel. Because catechols like Dopa have very high binding affinities for Fe(III) (logKs of 45) and are concentrated in the cuticle, it is very probable that at least some of the Dopa acts as a mordant for the iron in situ and that this association serves some biological function. The results suggest that thread formation in Mytilus may be more adaptable than previously thought. When particulate iron is abundant, as would be expected in a wave-swept seashore habitat, the thread cuticle becomes ironclad; when iron is limiting such as in the laboratory aquarium, a cuticle is made without iron. Threads appear to be fully functional in uniaxial tension with or without iron, and Dopa seems equally recoverable, at least in short term experiments, from iron-deficient and iron-enhanced threads following acid hydrolysis. We suspect that ironclading may in some way improve the wear resistance of the exposed distal portion of the byssus, and a mechanical analysis is underway.

https://openalex.org/W1996072264,"Opioid receptor pharmacology in vivo has predicted a greater number of receptor subtypes than explained by the profiles of the three cloned opioid receptors, and the functional dependence of the receptors on each other shown in gene-deleted animal models remains unexplained. One mechanism for such findings is the generation of novel signaling complexes by receptor hetero-oligomerization, which we previously showed results in significantly different pharmacology for μ and δ receptor hetero-oligomers compared with the individual receptors. In the present study, we show that deltorphin-II is a fully functional agonist of the μ-δ heteromer, which induced desensitization and inhibited adenylyl cyclase through a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein. Activation of the μ-δ receptor heteromer resulted in preferential activation of Gαz, illustrated by incorporation of GTPγ35S, whereas activation of the individually expressed μ and δ receptors preferentially activated Gαi. The unique pharmacology of the μ-δ heteromer was dependent on the reciprocal involvement of the distal carboxyl tails of both receptors, so that truncation of the distal μ receptor carboxyl tail modified the δ-selective ligand-binding pocket, and truncation of the δ receptor distal carboxyl tail modified the μ-selective binding pocket. The distal carboxyl tails of both receptors also had a significant role in receptor interaction, as evidenced by the reduced ability to co-immunoprecipitate when the carboxyl tails were truncated. The interaction between μ and δ receptors occurred constitutively when the receptors were co-expressed, but did not occur when receptor expression was temporally separated, indicating that the hetero-oligomers were generated by a co-translational mechanism.

The endogenous opioid systems mediate important physiological functions related to pain perception, locomotion, motivation, reward, autonomic function, immune modulation, and hormone secretion. Opioid receptors, mediating the actions of the opioid peptides, belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DAMGO, [d-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol5]enkephalin; DPDPE, [d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin, DSLET, [d-Ser2, Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6, PTX, pertussis toxin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. and have distinct pharmacological profiles with discrete but overlapping distributions in brain (reviewed Refs. 1.Lev ac B.A.R.

The pharmacology of the opioid receptors obtained in brain and other tissues has consistently predicted a greater number of receptor subtypes such as μ1, μ2, and δ1, δ2, which are not explained by the individual pharmacological profiles obtained for the three cloned opioid receptors, μ, δ, and κ, when expressed individually in heterologous systems. One possible mechanism for these findings, gaining increasing credence, has been that of direct receptor-receptor interactions creating novel signaling units and generating distinct post-receptor functional effects. The ability of GPCRs to form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers has been described by us and others (reviewed in Refs. 3.Milligan G. Mol.

We have provided evidence for the direct interaction of μ and δ opioid receptors to form hetero-oligomers, with generation of novel pharmacology and G protein coupling properties, distinct from that demonstrated when each receptor was expressed individually (6.George S.R.

Receptor homo-oligomerization appears to be a universal occurrence for GPCRs, with functional roles emerging in cellular processes such as receptor trafficking after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (9.Lee S.P.

The functional roles for hetero-oligomerization of GPCRs appear varied, ranging from chaperone-like aiding of cell surface localization to novel pharmacology and signal transduction properties, depending on the interacting receptors (4.George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Nat. Rev.

O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 8: 166-171Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the receptors expressed individually formed robust SDS-resistant homodimers and higher order homo-oligomers, whereas under identical conditions co-expressed μ and δ receptors did not form SDS-resistant heterodimers (6.George S.R.

Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 774-783Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to further characterize the differences in the pharmacology and signaling mechanisms arising from the formation of the μ-δ hetero-oligomeric complex and to identify a specific agonist for the heteromer. We also sought to define the structural basis for the receptor-receptor interaction, which has not been characterized. We demonstrated that deltorphin-II was an agonist of the μ-δ heteromer, capable of inducing desensitization and selectively activating the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gα protein Gz, whereas agonist activation of the individual μ and δ receptors activated the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi. We also determined that the distal carboxyl tails of both receptors participated in the structural basis for the generation of the unique pharmacology of the μ and δ heteromer and had a significant role in the interaction between the receptors. Construction of μ and δ Opioid Receptor Expression Vectors—cDNAs encoding the rat μ and δ opioid receptors were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 as previously described (5.Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies, the receptors were tagged with c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL) or FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope tags, using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech), also as described (5.Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The absence of sequence errors and the correct orientation of the polymerase chain reaction products in the expression vectors were verified by sequencing on both strands. Expression in Mammalian Cells—COS-7 monkey kidney cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained as monolayer cultures at 37 °C in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). An equal amount of pcDNA3 vector was co-transfected with each receptor construct so that the total amount of DNA used was consistent with studies involving transfections with two constructs. The receptor expression levels ranged between 600 and 1000 fmol/mg of protein after 24-48 h post-transfection. For the staggered expression, the δ receptor cDNA was transfected first, followed 24 h later by the μ receptor cDNA, and cells harvested 24 h later. In separate experiments, the receptors were also transfected in the reverse order. Membrane Preparation—Cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by Polytron disruption in ice-cold 5 mm Tris-HCl and 2 mm EDTA buffer containing 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml benzamidine, and 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor as described previously (11.Ng G.Y.

The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 100 × g to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei and to recover the supernatant, which was centrifuged at high speed (40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) to prepare the membrane fraction. Membrane protein was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Radioligand Binding Assays—Saturation binding experiments were performed with 25 μg of P2 membrane protein incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]naloxone or [3H]diprenorphine to determine receptor densities (Bmax) and ligand affinities (KD) as described previously (12.Pak Y.S. Kouvelas A. Schiedeler M. Rassmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). Each drug concentration was examined in duplicate or triplicate and incubated for 2 h at 22°C in a total volume of 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 120 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors. Nonspecific binding was defined as that not displaced by 10 μm naltrexone. Competition experiments were performed in triplicate with increasing concentrations of competing ligand. The concentration of radioligand used in the competition assays was approximately equivalent to its KD. Bound ligand was isolated by rapid filtration through a 48-well cell harvester (Brandel) using GF/C filters (Whatman). Filters were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and placed in glass vials with scintillation fluid (Universol) and counted for tritium. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using Prism (GraphPAD Software). A two-site fit was designated only when a statistically significant improvement of the fit over a one-site model was obtained by comparison of the coefficients of the goodness-of-fit by an F test. Agonist Treatment—Cells co-expressing μ and δ receptors were incubated with agonist (10 μm) or vehicle for 1 h at 22°C and then membranes were harvested. The membranes were washed three times by resuspension in binding buffer and recentrifugation to ensure that agonist did not remain bound to the receptors. Cells were also exposed to agonist for 1-4 h, and following three washes in binding buffer were analyzed by whole cell binding. Pertussis Toxin Treatment—Cells co-expressing μ and δ receptors were incubated with pertussis toxin (1 μg/ml) or vehicle for 24 h and then membranes were harvested. Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—Adenylyl cyclase assays were conducted essentially as described (11.Ng G.Y. George S.R. Zastawny R.L. Caron M. Bouvier M. Dennis M. O'Dowd B.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11727-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.02 ml of membrane suspension from cells (10-25 μg of protein), 0.012 mm ATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.053 mm GTP, 2.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 units of pyruvate kinase, 1 unit of myokinase, 1 mm forskolin, and 0.13 mCi of [32P]ATP in a final volume of 0.05 ml. The mixture was incubated with 10-3 to 10-12 m agonist at 22 °C for 20 min, and enzyme activities were determined. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 0.4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm cAMP, and [3H]cAMP (25,000 cpm). cAMP was isolated by sequential column chromatography using Dowex cation-exchange resin and aluminum oxide. Data were expressed as picomole of cAMP/pmol of receptor and analyzed by computer-fitted nonlinear least-squares regression. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The membrane samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions using 10 or 12% precast acrylamide gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (5.Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was revealed with antibodies raised against the c-Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the FLAG epitope (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), and with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Studies—The P2 membrane pellet was re-suspended and stirred at 4 °C overnight with protease inhibitors as previously described (5.Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged and the solubilized fraction was washed and concentrated. The washed fraction was precleared with agarose-fixed goat anti-mouse IgG overnight, and the solubilized receptors were immunoprecipitated with the mouse monoclonal anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibody and agarose-fixed goat anti-mouse IgG as previously described. The immunoprecipitate was washed, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Measurement of Gα-specific [35S]GTPγS Binding—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by Polytron disruption in ice-cold buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 100 × g to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to isolate the P2 membrane fraction, then suspended in assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitors). Tubes containing 2 nm [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 μm GDP, in the absence (basal) or presence of 1-10 μm drug were preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Membrane protein was determined by the Bradford assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 μg of crude P2 membrane were added and incubated at 30 °C for the time indicated. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer and centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of ice-cold solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Igepal Ca630, protease Inhibitors) and 0.18% SDS for 1 h at 4°C. Unsolubilized cellular debris was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of the selected Gα antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose 50:50 slurry (Sigma) was added and tubes were rotated at 4 °C for a further 4 h. Agarose beads were spun down at 2,500 rpm for 3 min, washed 4 times with solubilization buffer, and spun down each time. Beads were suspended in scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was detected by counting (Beckman LS 6500 counter). Western blots confirmed that the antibodies identified the specific Gα species in membranes and after immunoprecipitation by the epitope-tagged μ opioid receptor. Verification of the specific band was obtained by use of the antigenic peptide sequence to which the antibody was generated. Receptor Immunocytochemistry—Cells expressing epitope-tagged myc-μ and FLAG-δ receptors prepared by co-transfecting the cDNA for the two receptors or staggering them 24 h apart were examined by a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss) after incubation with the specific c-myc and FLAG antibodies, followed by the species-specific secondary antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC. Radioligand binding competition assays were conducted to identify high affinity agonists for the co-expressed μ and δ receptors. Membranes from cells co-expressing μ and δ receptors bound the nonselective antagonists [3H]naloxone and [3H]diprenorphine with high affinity. Competition by opioid agonists revealed highest affinity for the δ2 agonists deltorphin-II and DSLET compared with the δ agonist DPDPE or the μ agonist DAMGO. Therefore deltorphin-II was selected for detailed study. In the absence of drug treatment (n = 4), deltorphin-II-detected KH was 3.2 ± 0.9 nm and KL was 4.9 ± 1.0 μm with 57 ± 6% of receptors in the high affinity state. Pretreatment of cells with deltorphin-II induced a lowering of the affinity of the agonist-detected high affinity state, indicative of desensitization (Fig. 1A). Following deltorphin-II pretreatment for 60 min, the affinities shifted to KH 15.8 ± 1.9 nm and KL 25.8 ± 13.3 μm with a reduction of receptors in the high affinity state to 35 ± 1%. In contrast, similar treatments with the μ-selective DAMGO or the δ-selective DPDPE did not induce any change in the affinity constants or profiles in the μ-δ cells (Fig. 1, B and C) nor did it induce any receptor down-regulation. Because deltorphin-II appeared to function as an agonist of the heteromeric μ-δ receptors, cells expressing both receptors were exposed to the drug for 1-4 h (n = 3), and receptor density was evaluated on the cell surface by whole cell binding. The receptor heteromers exhibited desensitization, with a 10-fold shift in affinity of the KH state to the right and a reduction in the fraction of receptors in the high affinity state (by 33%) evident by 1 h (Fig. 1D). With deltorphin-II treatment for 2 h, there was evidence of significant down-regulation as well, with reduction both of the total density of receptors (by 32%) and further reduction in the fraction of receptors in the high affinity state (by 70%) (Fig. 1E). When agonist treatment was extended to 4 h, there was a further reduction in the total density of receptors, but no further change in the KH and KL values. Treatment of cells expressing μ or δ receptors singly showed desensitization and down-regulation of the receptors in response to treatment with DAMGO or DPDPE. Exposure of μ receptor-expressing cells to DAMGO for 1 h resulted in an increase of KH from 5 to 42 nm and a reduction in receptor density by 38% (Fig. 1F). Similarly, treatment of δ receptor-expressing cells by DPDPE for 1 h resulted in a shift of the KH from 2 to 42 nm and a reduction in receptor density by 37% (Fig. 1G). The nature of the deltorphin-II detected high affinity site in the heteromeric μ-δ receptor complex was further evaluated by determining its sensitivity to guanine nucleotides and pertussis toxin. Incubation of membranes co-expressing μ and δ opioid receptors with GTPγS (500 μm) resulted in a rightward shift of the deltorphin-II detected affinity states, indicating uncoupling of the complex from G protein (Fig. 2A). This was in contrast to the effects seen with DAMGO, for which there was no shift in affinity by GTPγS (Fig. 2B). We have previously shown that the G protein involved in the generation of the agonist-detected high affinity state in cells expressing the μ-δ opioid receptor complex was pertussis toxin-insensitive and different from the pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins coupling of μ and δ opioid receptors expressed individually (6.George S.R.

Pertussis toxin treatment (1 μg/ml for 24 h) did not abolish the ability of deltorphin-II to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity but reduced the potency (Fig. 3). This is in marked contrast to the complete abolition of adenylyl cyclase activity inhibition by deltorphin-II when μ or δ opioid receptors were expressed individually and treated with pertussis toxin (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cells co-expressing μ and δ opioid receptors by deltorphin-II following treatment with pertussis toxin (μ-δ PTX) or vehicle (μ-δ). Shown also are the effects of pertussis toxin on cells expressing the δ opioid receptor (δ PTX) or the μ opioid receptor (μ PTX). Cells were treated with PTX (1 μg/ml) or vehicle for 24 h and then membranes were assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity. Results shown are representative of n = 3 experiments for co-expressed μ and δ receptors and n = 2 for cells expressing μ or δ receptors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The affinity profiles of several opioid agonists were tested before and after pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment, to evaluate the pharmacological rank order of these compounds at the μ-δ-PTX-insensitive G protein complex (Fig. 4). Agonist-detected high and low affinity sites were evident after PTX treatment for all agonists tested (Fig. 4, A-D). The relative rank order of agonist potencies following PTX treatment was DSLET > deltorphin-II > DAMGO > DPDPE. The affinities for deltorphin-II were KH 3.1 nm and KL 4.6 μm following vehicle treatment, and KH 35.5 nm and KL 72.7 μm following PTX treatment (n = 3). Shown in contrast are the effects of PTX to shift the agonist affinity of DAMGO for the μ receptor (Fig. 4E) and DPDPE for the δ receptor (Fig. 4F) to a single low affinity site. To identify the nature of the G protein involved, we examined for a PTX-insensitive G protein capable of coupling negatively to adenylyl cyclase. Western blots of HEK and COS cells identified Gz in the membrane fraction, although present in much lower concentrations than Gi (data not shown). To determine whether the concentration of Gz in the cells had a limiting role, Gz was co-expressed with μ and δ receptors. This had no effect on the affinity profile of deltorphin-II for the co-expressed μ-δ heteromeric receptors (Fig. 5A), but significantly enhanced the affinity of DAMGO for the μ-δ heteromers (Fig. 5B). In sharp contrast, co-expression of Gz did not affect the affinities of DAMGO for the μ receptor (Fig. 5C) or DPDPE for the δ receptor (Fig. 5D) when each was expressed individually. The relative levels of endogenous Gi3 (Fig. 5F, lanes 4-6) and levels of endogenous Gz (Fig. 5E, lane 7) and following its transfection are shown (Fig. 5E, lanes 4-6) as well as the ability to immunoprecipitate the G proteins using the c-myc epitope-tagged μ receptor (Fig. 5, E, lanes 1-3 and F, lanes 1-3). The specificity of the antibody-detected band was confirmed by its displacement by blocking peptide representing the antigen against which the antibody was directed, as shown for Gz (Fig. 5G).FIGURE 5Effect of co-expression of Gz on the pharmacology of co-expressed or individually expressed μ and δ opioid receptors and ability of G proteins to immunoprecipitate (IP) with the opioid receptors.

The detection of Gz endogenous levels and following transfection (E) and the endogenous levels of Gi3 in COS cell membranes (F) and their ability to be immunoprecipitated by c-myc-tagged μ opioid receptor under various conditions is shown.

In membranes from cells expressing μ opioid receptors, DAMGO induced a robust increase in GTPγ35S binding to Gi3 within 1 min of agonist treatment, which waned by 15 min (Fig. 6A). In contrast, DAMGO had no effect on GTPγ35S binding to Gz when μ receptors were exclusively activated (Fig. 6B). In cells expressing δ receptors individually, both deltorphin-II and DPDPE induced GTPγ35S binding to Gi3 (Fig. 6C), but only very minor increases in GTPγ35S binding to Gz (Fig. 6D) were seen. In membranes from cells co-expressing μ and δ receptors along with Gz, deltorphin-II induced a 75% increase in GTPγ35S binding to Gz at 1 min, which persisted at 5 min of agonist activation (Fig. 7A) showing the time course of G protein activation. In this preparation, DAMGO and DPDPE had much smaller effects on incorporation of GTPγ35S into Gz (Fig. 7A) or Gi3 (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Incorporation of GTPγ35S into Gα proteins by selective agonist activation of the μ-δ heteromeric opioid receptors. Membranes from cells co-expressing μ and δ receptors were treated with vehicle (C, control), DAMGO (DM), deltorphin II (DL), or DPDPE (DP) for the times specified in the presence of GTPγ35S, and the Gα protein was immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies. The Gi3 assayed was endogenous, whereas Gz was transfected. Data are expressed as a percentage of the basal value and are the means of four to six experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that μ and δ receptors formed SDS-resistant homodimers and oligomers, whereas the μ-δ hetero-oligomer was easily disrupted under similar experimental conditions (6.George S.R.

Moreover, because agonist-induced internalization of the δ receptor was prevented by complexing with the μ opioid receptor (6.George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and the internalization of the δ receptor has been proposed to involve the distal carboxyl tail (13.Cvejic S. Devi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the interaction between μ and δ opioid receptors may involve the carboxyl tail of the δ receptor. The μ-agonist DAMGO had distinctly different affinities for the individually expressed and co-expressed μ and δ receptors as shown (Fig. 8A). The terminal 15 amino acid residues of the carboxyl tail of the δ opioid receptor from Val357 to Ala372 were deleted and this construct was termed δT1. Expression of the μ opioid receptor with the"

Despite its major role in arginine methylation of nuclear proteins, surprisingly little is known about the subcellular localization and dynamics of PRMT1. We show here that only a fraction of PRMT1 is located in the nucleus, but the protein is predominantly cytoplasmic. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments reveal that PRMT1 is highly mobile both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, inhibition of methylation leads to a significant nuclear accumulation of PRMT1, concomitant with the appearance of an immobile fraction of the protein in the nucleus, but not the cytoplasm. Both the accumulation and immobility of PRMT1 is reversed when re-methylation is allowed, suggesting a mechanism where PRMT1 is trapped by unmethylated substrates such as core histones and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein proteins until it has executed the methylation reaction.

Methylation of arginine residues is a widespread posttranslational modification that increases the structural diversity of proteins and may modulate their function in the living cell. The modification is catalyzed by a family of specific enzymes, the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) 2The abbreviations used are: PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase; Adox, periodate-oxidized adenosine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. , of which eight members have been described up to now (1Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Enzymes of the PRMT family differ in activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization, but the precise roles of individual members of the family for the living cell remain to be elucidated. All PRMTs methylate guanidino nitrogens of arginine residues in their substrates to form monomethylarginine, a transient modification that can be converted to citrulline by deimination and presumably reverted to unmodified arginine (2Wang Y. Wysocka J. Sayegh J. Lee Y.H. Perlin J.R. Leonelli L. Sonbuchner L.S. McDonald C.H. Cook R.G. Dou Y. Roeder R.G. Clarke S. Stallcup M.R. Allis C.D. Coonrod S.A.

In a second step, PRMTs catalyze the dimethylation of affected arginines, which is currently believed to be irreversible and to label the modified proteins for their entire lives. Except for PRMT5 and PRMT7, which appear to catalyze the symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (4Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z.H. Mirochnitchenko O. Gunderson S.I. Felix A.M. Herth N. Hoffmann R. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3656-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), all other characterized PRMTs lead to asymmetric dimethylation of their specific targets. Presently, the functional consequences of arginine (di-)methylation are much less understood than those of other posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation or acetylation (for review, see Refs. 6McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar and 7Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). As methylation of characterized substrates occurs on residues in an RG (R, arginine; G, glycine) or RGG sequence context, a common feature of RNA-binding proteins, methylation might modulate protein-RNA or protein-protein interactions (8Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is likely, and examples have been reported, that this affects processes of signal transduction, subcellular protein trafficking, or gene expression. In particular, PRMT1 and -4 were implicated in transcriptional co-activation of nuclear hormone receptors, most probably because they methylate histones H3 and H4 and thereby facilitate histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling (9Chen D.

Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In addition, arginine methylation of Sam68 and RNA helicase A affects the subcellular localization of these proteins, which in turn may modulate their activity (14Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22795-22798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of these results in terms of dynamic processes is complicated by the fact PRMTs are constitutively active, and there is only little evidence for regulation that could restrict methylation to specific cellular conditions such as the cell cycle or response to extracellular stimuli (16Pawlak M.R. Banik-Maiti S. Pietenpol J.A. Ruley H.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Rouault J.P. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a result, most known target proteins are entirely methylated at any given time, and it is unlikely that methylation conveys a “signal” in the classical sense. A more detailed and comparative characterization of individual PRMTs will therefore be crucial to appreciate their specific roles in the living cell and the role of protein arginine methylation in general. The predominant arginine methyltransferase in human cells, PRMT1, is responsible for at least 85% of all arginine methylation reactions (19Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

PRMT1 is an essential enzyme, because embryos from Prmt1-/- knock-out mice die shortly after implantation; however, it is dispensable for basic cellular reactions such as gene expression and DNA replication, because embryonic stem cells from such embryos are viable under cell culture conditions (19Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The major targets of PRMT1 were identified as nuclear proteins that interact with nucleic acids, such as the core histones H3 and H4, components of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particle involved in pre-mRNA processing and transport, or nucleolar components such as fibrillarin and nucleolin that are involved in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (8Liu Q.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that PRMT1 is physically associated with hnRNP particles, which contain the predominant substrates of the enzyme, and is able to methylate its target proteins in situ (24Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The interaction of PRMT1 with hnRNP complexes occurs via SAF-A, a well known constituent of hnRNP complexes and the nuclear scaffold, and is strongly enhanced when methylation is blocked by periodate-oxidized adenosine (Adox). Physical interaction of PRMT1 with its major substrates, the components of hnRNP particles, might therefore provide a means to ensure a high level of methylation of the preferred target proteins and might also contribute to substrate specificity. PRMT1 had previously been reported to interact with other proteins as well (25Altschuler L. Wook J.O. Gurari D. Chebath J. Revel M. J.

This result, which was obtained by immunoprecipitation and gradient centrifugation experiments in vitro, motivated us to investigate PRMT1 by non-invasive methods in vivo. Here, we report our results from in vivo mobility assays, which, for the first time, shed light on the dynamics of PRMT1 in live cells. We show that when methylation is inhibited PRMT1 reversibly relocates to the nucleus where it, but not the closely related enzyme PRMT6, becomes trapped by unmethylated substrates until the methylation reaction is successfully executed. Findings presented in this report show that PRMT1 is a highly dynamic enzyme with variable subcellular localization and mobility and provide insight into the mechanism of enzyme activity in vivo. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment with Periodate-oxidized Adenosine—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultivated on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were split 1:5 every second day. Cells were transfected by polyethylenimine (29Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar) with expression vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusions of PRMT1 or PRMT6 (30Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and stably expressing cell lines were created by selection with G418 for 4 weeks. For inhibition of methylation and for preparation of hypomethylated cell extracts, the medium of human embryonic kidney 293 cells was supplemented with 15 μm periodate-oxidized adenosine (adenosine-2′-3′-dialdehyde, A7154; Sigma), and cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before they were analyzed or harvested. Live Cell Microscopy—For live cell microscopy, cells were split onto 35-mm culture dishes with a glass bottom (Mattek) and analyzed 2 days after splitting, either untreated or treated with Adox as described above. For the analysis, cells were placed on the heated stage of a Zeiss Meta 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed by bleaching a narrow strip across the cells by 50 iterations at 488 nm and 75% laser output. The prebleaching status, bleaching, and fluorescence recovery were recorded by the “time series” module of the Zeiss software (version 3.2), using 1% laser output to minimize further bleaching, 128 × 128 pixel resolution at Zoom factor 3-5, and a 4 Airy pinhole. For quantitative analysis, a minimum of 25 individual cells was measured, and mean pixel intensities in specified regions of interest were determined with the freeware image analysis software ImageJ by Wayne Rasband (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Non-bleached reference regions were analyzed in each cell for data normalization. Preparation of Total Cell Extract—Semiconfluent to confluent cells were harvested by scraping off the culture dishes with a rubber police-man after two washes with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation (200 × g, 5 min). For the preparation of hypomethylated extract, cells were resuspended in water and disrupted by sonication. Extract for immunoprecipitation was prepared by resuspending cells in lysis buffer (1.5× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture “Complete, EDTA-free” (Roche Applied Science)), incubating on ice for 5 min, and clearing by centrifugation for 15 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at full speed. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, cell extract from 1-5 × 106 cells was supplemented with 5 μg of antibodies against GFP (Roche Applied Science) or PRMT1 (07-404; Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for an additional hour. Immune complexes were washed thoroughly six times before bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western blotting was performed as described previously using a methylation-sensitive antibody against SAF-A (24Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or commercially available antibodies against GFP (Roche Applied Science), the protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and -6 (07-404, Upstate, and IMG-506, Imgenex, respectively), Sam68 (sc-1238; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), histone H3 (ab1791; Abcam), or asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (ASYM24; Upstate). For detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and ECL chemiluminiscent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) were used. For the experiment in Fig. 7, immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by silver staining as described previously (31Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Vitro Methylation Assay—GFP fusion proteins of PRMT1 or PRMT6 were immunoprecipitated from ∼1 × 106 cells with anti-GFP antibodies as described above. After washing thoroughly six times, bound PRMTs were checked for activity by radioactive methylation assays exactly as described earlier (24Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated PRMT (on 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads) was combined with heat-inactivated extract from hypomethylated cells and 5 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (TRK865, specific activity 2.96 TBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography with enHance reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). We recently reported that PRMT1 associates with its preferred substrate proteins in hnRNP particles, depending on the methylation status of the substrates. In particular, immunoprecipitation and glycerol gradient centrifugation experiments revealed that PRMT1 was enriched in hnRNP particles from cells in which methylation was inhibited. Although very clear in their results, these experiments were performed in vitro and did not allow us to formally rule out fortuitous binding during extraction from cells. We were therefore motivated to utilize non-invasive methods to investigate the localization, mobility, and interactions of PRMT1 in living cells. To this end, we created stable cells lines expressing fusion proteins of PRMT1 and, as a control, PRMT6 with EGFP. Cell lines were selected that express approximately physiological amounts of the PRMTs, and the proteins from these cells were characterized by a variety of different means to ensure that they behave like their endogenous counterparts (Fig. 1A). These experiments demonstrate that both PRMTs can be co-immunoprecipitated in complex with their respective endogenous equivalent. This strongly suggests that both GFP fusion proteins are properly folded and faithfully incorporated into oligomeric complexes, which is a prerequisite for enzymatic activity (32Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure (Camb). 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 33Lim Y. Kwon Y.H. Won N.H. Min B.H. Park I.S. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1723: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, the immunoprecipitated complexes exhibit enzymatic activity with distinct substrate specificities. Thus, GFP fusion proteins are suitable to analyze the mobility of the catalytically active PRMT oligomers in vivo. While PRMT6 was exclusively located in the cell nucleus as described previously (30Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), PRMT1 was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (also compare supplemental Fig. S1). This has also been reported before, but individual reports on the localization of PRMT1 were quite variable, ranging from a predominant cytoplasmic to a predominant nuclear localization (14Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In our hands, quantifications of PRMT1 in microscopic investigations and in biochemical fractionation experiments reveal that endogenous PRMT1 and PRMT1: EGFP are ∼6-fold more abundant in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9, Fig. 1B, upper panel, and Fig. 2). Thus, although most known substrate proteins for PRMT1 are nuclear (see the Introduction), the enzyme is not preferentially located in the nucleus, compatible with the lack of a functional nuclear localization signal on the PRMT1 amino acid sequence. Importantly, however, conditions that lead to the presence of unmethylated substrates (supplemental Fig. S2) concomitantly lead to an accumulation of PRMT1 in the nucleus by a 2.5-fold factor in comparison to untreated cells (Fig. 2). In vivo mobility measurements by FRAP experiments reveal that nuclear PRMT1 not only increases in its amount but also changes its mobility (Figs. 3 and 4). Under normal cell culture conditions, which allow a complete methylation of substrate proteins, PRMT1 behaves as a completely soluble protein with diffusion characteristics of an oligomeric complex both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This changes upon inhibition of methylation by Adox, which leads to the appearance of an immobile (or very slow diffusing) fraction of PRMT1 exclusively in the nucleus, but not the cytoplasm. The alteration of mobility affects ∼25% of the nuclear PRMT1 and is specific for PRMT1 because neither the closely related enzyme PRMT6 (Fig. 4C) nor unrelated proteins such as an artificial soluble construct of β-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal (Fig. 5) is affected by Adox treatment. Identical mobility before and after inhibition of methylation is also observed for hnRNP-C, a component of the hnRNP particles to which PRMT1 binds upon inhibition of methylation but which is not a substrate of the enzyme itself. Our FRAP analysis shows that hnRNP-C diffuses slowly, consistent with the megadalton size of hnRNP particles to which it is bound (24Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and has a recovery curve similar to that of nuclear PRMT1 after Adox treatment. Importantly, the nuclear accumulation and mobility change of PRMT1 is maintained only under persistent inhibition but is fully reversible when re-methylation of substrates is allowed (Fig. 6). Complete re-establishment of rapid diffusion characteristics of nuclear PRMT1 is observed ∼6 h after removal of Adox, in parallel with the disappearance of unmethylated substrate protein SAF-A, which is responsible for attachment of PRMT1 to hnRNP particles (24Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine whether the immobility of PRMT1 is a result solely of interaction with the megadalton hnRNP complex, we used immunoprecipitation and silver staining to identify proteins that change their interaction with PRMT1 dependent on the methylation status of the cell. Fig. 7 shows that, indeed, the pattern of co-immunoprecipitated protein changes in the absence of methylation. Most prominent is the strong increase of co-precipitated core histones. However, there are several other proteins where a methylation-dependent change of interaction is evident; for example, three proteins with apparent molecular masses of 50, 97, and 120 kDa are enriched in the +Adox precipitates, whereas a 70-kDa protein is reduced (denoted by dots in Fig. 7). These results provide the first in vivo evidence for a mechanism by which PRMT1 associates with its unmethylated substrates, corroborating our earlier results obtained in vitro, and is released only after it has executed its methylation reaction.FIGURE 2PRMT1 accumulates in the nucleus when methylation is inhibited. Cells stably expressing PRMT1 were treated for 2 days with periodate-oxidized adenosine (Adox), a general inhibitor of cellular methylation reactions. Microscopic fields of typical untreated and treated cells (confocal slices) are shown, together with a quantification of the accumulation. For the quantification, mean intensities in several regions of interest in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of more than 100 individual cells were measured and expressed as a ratio of nuclear versus cytoplasmic fluorescence. Note that PRMT1 accumulates ∼2.5-fold in the presence of unmethylated substrates in the nucleus.

Upper panel, Western blot with an antibody recognizing SAF-A irrespective of its methylation status. Lower panel, blot with an antibody recognizing only unmethylated SAF-A.

It is possible that many of the functions ascribed to PRMT1 will eventually be explainable as the consequence of a single underlying mechanism, but currently more information about the enzyme and its activity must be gathered to decide on its physiological role. In this report, we have demonstrated that PRMT1 accumulates in the nucleus when methylation is inhibited and is tethered to unmethylated substrate proteins such as the core histones and components of the hnRNP particle unless the methylation reaction is accomplished. Results reported here answer several open questions regarding the localization, dynamics, and activity of PRMT1 in living cells. First, we found that PRMT1 is localized preferentially in the cytoplasm of human embryonic kidney cells, spatially separated from its major substrate proteins that reside in the cell nucleus (7Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This result could have been predicted from the lack of a nuclear localization signal in the PRMT1 sequence. However, previous work by others gave conflicting results, ranging from predominantly nuclear to predominantly cytoplasmic localization (14Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These differences in the localization of PRMT1 may reflect a variability of different cell lines with regard to the expression of substrate proteins that need to be methylated and, as shown here, lead to an accumulation of PRMT1 in the nucleus. On the other hand, some of the discrepancies can possibly be explained by a problem inherent in immunofluorescence studies of soluble proteins, inefficient fixation. In fact, our own experiments to localize PRMT1 by immunofluorescence were also biased toward a more nuclear localization, together with a granular appearance in the cytoplasm (data not shown). However, a similar effect was also evident in cells that express other soluble proteins such as EGFP, which allows for a direct comparison of protein localization in vivo and after processing cells for immunofluorescence. This let us to conclude that different efficiency of fixation in different organelles is a source of potential artifacts in the localization of soluble proteins. We therefore exclusively used non-disruptive in vivo experiments to clarify the localization of PRMT1. Quantification of fluorescence intensity in different organelles of living cells demonstrates that PRMT1 is ∼6-fold more abundant in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus under normal cell culture conditions. Intriguingly, this ratio is not fixed but changes significantly when cells are treated with Adox, which results in an increase in type I methyl acceptors by inhibiting the breakdown of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, the product inhibitor of AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions (24Herrmann F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, accumulation of unmethylated substrates leads to an accumulation of the enzyme in the nucleus, which is maintained only as long as the inhibition of methylation persists. This speaks against an alternative interpretation for the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of PRMT1, namely that the enzyme methylates its nuclear substrate co-translationally, or at least shortly after translation while they are still cytoplasmic. We do not currently know how PRMT1 enters the nucleus and how it is re-exported from the nucleus when re-methylation of substrates is allowed. Most probably, PRMT1 is piggybacked on unmethylated substrates such as newly synthesized hnRNP proteins and cotransported through the nuclear pore. In contrast, the related PRMT6 enzyme that we investigated in parallel contains a functional nuclear localization signal close to the amino terminus of the protein and appears to be transported on its own. We were surprised to find that PRMT1 gains an immobile (or at least very slow moving) fraction exclusively in the nucleus, but not the cytoplasm, of the same cell when methylation is inhibited. This is compatible with the notion that the major site of PRMT1 activity is the cell nucleus and a mechanism where PRMT1 gets trapped on unmethylated substrates during its reaction cycle. In fact, PRMT1 preferentially associates with the low mobility nuclear scaffold protein SAF-A (24Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. for histone mobility) when methylation is inhibited. Thus, at least two low mobility entities in the nucleus are involved in immobilizing PRMT1 under these conditions. Interestingly, the related enzyme PRMT6, the substrate spectrum of which significantly overlaps with that of PRMT1 (30Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), changes neither its subcellular localization nor its mobility in the presence of unmethylated substrates (Fig. 1A). This supports the idea that PRMT6 does not form complexes with other polypeptides (30Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) in contrast to PRMT1, which has been reported to associate with a large variety of proteins (24Herrmann F.

It could be that the enzymatic mechanism of PRMT6 is different from that of PRMT1 and does not include a step where the enzyme forms a stable intermediate with the substrate. This hypothesis can now be tested in structure/function experiments by switching regions of PRMT1 and -6. It will be interesting for future experiments to also characterize the dynamics and distinct interactions of other members of the growing PRMT family. These investigations will shape our understanding of PRMT enzymatic function, will help to determine the physiological role of the individual family members, and hopefully will elucidate novel pathways involving arginine methylation.

The substrates for the plant enzymes are generally linoleic and linolenic acids, whereas the animal enzymes catalyze the peroxidation of arachidonic acid in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and hydroxy fatty acids.

The fold of the β-barrel domain resembles that of a “C2” module, calcium-dependent membrane-targeting domains found in many protein kinases and phospholipases (3Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

In mammalian 15S-LOX1, an exposed Arg is proposed to tether the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate at the surface. Regio- and stereospecificities of the various isozymes are thought to be governed by the shape and depth of the pocket, which must both position the substrate for attack and allow the approach of O2, as well as the orientation (head versus tail first) of the substrate in the cavity (9Hornung E.

Although the overall fold and geometry of the non-heme iron-binding site are conserved with respect to the plant and animal enzymes, there are significant differences in size, sequence, and specificity determinants between these LOX classes (11Skrzypczak-Jankun E.

The structures of rabbit 15S-LOX1 and the plant LOXs L1 and L3 have been described (8Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct.

Proteins. 1997; 29: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but no structure of a LOX that catalyzes dioxygenation with R stereochemistry has been reported. Recently, Coffa and Brash (16Coffa G. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) observed that product stereochemistry is strongly influenced by a single amino acid: an Ala in the binding site of S-LOXs is a Gly in the corresponding position of R-LOXs. Single-site mutant LOXs in which Ala is exchanged with Gly and vice versa yield products opposite in stereochemistry to those of the parent wild-type proteins. Oxylipin biosynthesis studies have led to the identification of an 8R-LOX as part of a fusion protein with an allene-oxide synthase in the soft coral Plexaura homomalla (17Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The C-terminal LOX domain shares significant sequence identity (41%) with the Ca2+-regulated mammalian 5-LOX, an asthma drug target due to its pivotal role in the biosynthesis of the potent bronchoconstrictor leukotrienes. In contrast to mammalian 5-LOX (18Zhang Y.Y. Hamberg M. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 8R-LOX is remarkably stable and thus amenable to crystallographic studies. An important aim of our structural analysis of 8R-LOX is to explore the mechanistic basis of stereo control in LOXs. We report here the 3.2-Å resolution structure of Ca2+-activated 8R-LOX and demonstrate its calcium-dependent membrane targeting with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Construction of mutants was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The desired mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Expression and Purification—Recombinant 8R-LOX and associated mutants were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Following isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction at A600 nm = 0.7, cells were grown in 2× Yeast Tryptone medium for 24 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested (5000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), frozen at -80 °C, and subsequently lysed with BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) with DNase I added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 46,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl. After elution with 200 mm imidazole, the protein was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using DE52 (Whatman) and Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) resins to yield the purified product. Calcium was removed by dialysis of the concentrated protein samples in the presence of neutralized Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) prior to dropwise flash-freezing in liquid N2 and storage at -80 °C. Crystallization—Plate-like crystals were grown in hanging-drop vapor diffusion plates in 6.25% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Fluka), 100 mm imidazole acetate (pH 8.0), 100 mm CaCl2, and 5% sucrose at 22 °C. The crystals belong to space group P21 (a = 69.6, b = 78.0, and c = 176.5 Å and β = 96.7°) and diffract to ∼3.2 Å. There are two molecules/asymmetric unit. Data Collection and Phasing—Data were collected at 100 K on a Nonius FR591 rotating anode fitted with a Mar345 detector. Crystals were flash-frozen after transfer to mother liquor solutions in which the concentration of ethylene glycol was incrementally increased to 40%. Data processing and scaling were performed with Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The structure of 8R-LOX was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (CCP4) (20Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) with a polyserine model of rabbit 15S-LOX1 (with which it shares 30% sequence identity) as the search model. Two molecules were positioned to give a correlation coefficient of 36.9 and an R-factor of 53.1. The first map was calculated with a polyalanine model based on the molecular replacement results and 2Fo - Fc amplitudes and revealed clear electron density for the non-heme iron and chelating side chains. After multiple cycles of map interpretation with program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refinement with strict non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in CNS (22Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the final model has Rwork and Rfree values of 25.5 and 29.9, respectively. Liposome Preparation—Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared from a mixture of 75 mol of phosphatidylcholine and 25 mol of phosphatidylserine with 11 passes in a mini-extruder assembly (Avanti Polar Lipids). Liposomes used in FRET studies also contained N-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (dansyl-DHPE; triethylammonium salt; Molecular Probes) at 5% (w/w). FRET Studies of Ca2+-regulated Tryptophan Membrane Insertion—The affinity of 8R-LOX for large unilamellar vesicles was determined by monitoring the decrease in Trp fluorescence upon the addition of Ca2+ to solutions of large unilamellar vesicles in which dansyl-DHPE was incorporated at 5% (w/w). The concentration of the enzyme was 0.4 μm, and the liposome concentration varied from 10 to 80 μm in a sample size of 3.4 ml. Fresh protein/dansyl-DHPE liposome solutions were prepared for each data point; emission spectra were scanned (excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission wavelength of 320-400 nm) after the addition of 2 mm EDTA; and the spectra were rescanned after the addition of 4 mm CaCl2. A plot of the fractional loss of Trp fluorescence signal (ΔF±calcium/F-calcium) versus liposome concentration yielded a hyperbolic binding curve when fitted by nonlinear regression analysis with SigmaPlot. Membrane insertion of wild-type and mutant 8R-LOXs was monitored by a loss in Trp fluorescence (excitation wavelength of 295 nm) and a gain in dansyl fluorescence upon the addition of Ca2+ to solutions of 8R-LOX and large unilamellar vesicles in which dansyl-DHPE was incorporated at 5% (w/w). LOX and phospholipid concentrations were 1.2 and 260 μm, respectively (in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 500 mm NaCl), in a sample size of 185 μl. Initial fluorescence spectra were taken in the presence of 4 mm EDTA; CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 6 mm prior to the second trace. All emission spectra were recorded on a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer with the bandwidth and band pass both set to 5 nm. The data in Fig. 5 are reported as the normalized difference in fluorescence at 517 nm in the absence and presence of CaCl2 relative to that for the wild-type enzyme. Experiments were performed in triplicate and are reported as the mean ± S.D. of three independent observations. Stopped-flow Data Acquisition and Analysis—The effect of Ca2+ on 8R-LOX catalysis was examined in an Applied Photophysics Model SX17MV stopped-flow spectrometer operating in the absorbance mode at 25 °C. Product (8R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid) formation was monitored at 235 nm with a cell path length of 0.2 cm. The enzyme concentration was 10 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. Assays were performed with 25 μm arachidonic acid (Cayman Chemical) in the absence and presence of large unilamellar vesicles (260 μm phospholipid) and in the presence of 4 mm CaCl2 and large unilamellar vesicles. The reported concentrations of reagents are those in the observation cell. Each kinetic trace was the average of at least three individual measurements. The Structure of 8R-LOX—The structure of 8R-LOX in the presence of calcium was solved to 3.2 Å and refined to Rwork and Rfree values of 25.5 and 29.9, respectively (TABLE ONE). The overall fold is similar to that of rabbit 15S-LOX1 (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.54 Å for 576 of 662 C-α atoms), yet significant differences are found in the loops on one side of the β-barrel, in accessibility to the active site, and in the substrate-binding pocket of the catalytic domain. 8R-LOX encompasses amino acids 374-1066 of the natural fusion protein with alleneoxide synthase; but to simplify the discussion with respect to LOXs in general, we have renumbered 8R-LOX to amino acids 2-694.TABLE ONEData collection and refinement statisticsData collection Space groupP21 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)69.6, 78.0, 176.5α, β, γ90.0°, 96.7°, 90.0° Resolution (Å)29.9 to 3.2 RmergeaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.bRmerge=∑|Ii−〈I〉/∑Ii, where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection.10.1 (38.4) I/σI9.7 (2.3) Completeness (%)98.5 (82.3) Redundancy3.3 (2.8)Refinement Resolution (Å)29.9 to 3.2 No. reflections28,928 Rwork/RfreecR=∑||Fo|−|Fc||/∑|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

Rfree was calculated using 5% of the total reflections. Open table in a new tab 8R-LOX is shaped roughly like a cylinder ∼100 Å in length and 60 Å in diameter. The molecule is composed of two domains: an N-terminal C2-like eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel domain (residues 2-114) that constitutes the first third of the cylinder and a larger catalytic domain (residues 115-694) that contains ∼23 helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1). The catalytic iron is centrally located in the α-helical domain, but slightly displaced toward one surface. The iron is chelated by His385, His390, His571, Asn575, and Ile694 via its C terminus. A large elongated pocket passes by the iron, but this pocket does not have clear access to the surface. The shortest route to gain access to the cavity is by the movement of Tyr179 on a helix that forms the outermost wall of the internal cavity. The C2-like β-Barrel Domain Contains Calcium Sites and Exposed Tryptophans—Structural features in the N-terminal β-barrel domain unique to the 8R-LOX structure were apparent in the initial electron density map. The presence of 5σ electron density peaks, an absolute requirement for calcium in the crystallization, and the presence and configuration of calcium-chelating amino acids led to the identification of three calcium-binding sites. Ca2+ is a crucial regulator of human leukocyte 5-LOX activation (6Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and its nuclear membrane localization (23Chen X.S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); but no crystal structure is available for this key enzyme, and these calcium and membrane binding features are lacking in the previously solved 15S-LOX1 structure. If the N-terminal domain is viewed as two layers of β-sheet, three interwoven calcium-binding sites formed by five side chains (site 1: Asp39 and Asp45; and site 2: Asp19, Asn44, and Glu47) and eight carbonyl groups (Fig. 2) are located at one edge of the structure. The three calcium-binding sites, which form a ridge between the two layers of sheet, seem to brace the structure by stabilizing loops that emanate from strands β3 and β5. These loops, which traverse the ridge from one layer to the other, contain surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acids (β3: Trp41 and Phe42; and β5: Trp77). The loop that contains Trp77 is not well defined in the electron density map, whereas the loop that contains Trp41 is found nestled in a hydrophobic pocket of a symmetry mate in the context of the crystal packing. These tryptophans lie at either end of the line of the three Ca2+ ions, with one near the “top” layer of the β-structure and the other at the “bottom” layer. As is evident from the sequence alignment provided in Fig. 2, as well as the superposition of the β-barrel domains of 8R-LOX and 15S-LOX1 (r.m.s.d. of 1.506 Å for 97 of 109 C-α atoms) (8Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and gangrene α-toxin (r.m.s.d. of 1.460 Å for 93 of 113 C-α atoms) (24Naylor C.E. Jepson M. Crane D.T. Titball R.W. Miller J. Basak A.K. Bolgiano B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the calcium-binding residues found in 8R-LOX correspond to those observed in the gangrene α-toxin domain and proposed for human 5-LOX (5Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), indicating the direct relevance of the 8R-LOX structure to elucidating aspects of calcium activation. Notably, the calcium-binding ridge and putative membrane insertion loops are on the same side of the molecule as the likely entrance to the cavity that holds the catalytic iron. Thus, a two-pronged grip of the β-barrel on the membrane could serve to orient the catalytic domain to facilitate the acquisition of substrate from the membrane phase. Membrane Binding Affinity-The striking similarity of the structures of the β-barrel domains of 8R-LOX and gangrene α-toxin (24Naylor C.E. Jepson M. Crane D.T. Titball R.W. Miller J. Basak A.K. Bolgiano B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in the presence of Ca2+ led us to investigate the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of 8R-LOX. We employed a FRET assay in which tryptophan served as the donor and dansyl-phospholipids incorporated into liposomes served as the acceptor. Membrane binding was indicated by a reduction in Trp fluorescence (330 nm) accompanied by an increase in dansyl fluorescence (517 nm). A binding isotherm based on the FRET data was constructed to determine the affinity of 8R-LOX for liposomes. The plot of the fraction of Trp fluorescence quenched in the presence of CaCl2 as a function of dansyl-liposome concentration is shown in Fig. 3. The data could be fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to yield a hyperbolic binding curve with a value of 11.4 ± 2.7 μm for the 8R-LOX/liposome dissociation constant. In control experiments in the absence of Ca2+, no quenching of Trp fluorescence by dansyl-liposomes was observed, an indication that, in the absence of Ca2+, 8R-LOX does not bind membranes to an appreciable extent. To evaluate the effects of the mutation of putative Ca2+-ligating amino acids on Ca2+-mediated membrane insertion, the increase in fluorescence at 517 nm upon the addition of CaCl2 to enzyme/dansylliposome mixtures was monitored (excitation wavelength of 295 nm) for wild-type and mutant 8R-LOXs at liposome concentrations of 260 μm. As shown in Fig. 4, a distinct increase in fluorescence at 517 nm was observed for the wild-type enzyme with the addition of calcium to the assay. Mutants in which a single Ca2+-binding residue had been replaced with Ala (D39A and E47A) exhibited diminished FRET properties, consistent with a role for calcium in membrane binding. Adouble mutant (D39A/E47A) with calcium-binding residues from two of the three sites mutated exhibited no FRET signal at all. As mentioned above, the calcium-binding residues appear to anchor the β-barrel loops that contain Trp41 and Trp77 (Fig. 2). These two loops emanate from the same edge of the β-sheet stack, one on each of the top and bottom layers. Thus, the loops could simultaneously insert to mediate a two-pronged attachment to the membrane. In the context of the crystal packing, the loop that contains Trp41 is found nestled in a hydrophobic cavity in a neighboring symmetry mate, whereas the loop that contains Trp77 is not fully ordered. W41A exhibited <2% of the increase in fluorescence at 517 nm upon the addition of CaCl2. Similarly, W77A exhibited only 4% of the wild-type signal. The loss of signal is consistent with either the loss of membrane binding affinity and/or simply the loss of a source of donor fluorescence for the FRET signal. The fact that both mutations (W41A and W77A) individually led to a loss of signal suggests that both loops are important for membrane binding or the FRET signal. Effect of Calcium on Enzyme Activity in the Presence of Liposomes—Given the effect of calcium on membrane binding and the fact that the substrate arachidonic acid partitions into the membrane phase, we asked whether impaired membrane binding might result in a reduction in enzyme activity in the presence of membranes. In a liposome-based assay, wild-type activity was clearly stimulated upon the addition of Ca2+. However, a plot of the change in absorbance at 235 nm versus time appears to suggest that the reaction reached completion at a concentration of 1 μm substrate (Fig. 5a), whereas the concentration of arachidonic acid in the reaction mixture was 25 μm. However, not all substrate is available to the membrane-bound enzyme, as the solubility of arachidonic acid under similar conditions is appreciable (with a critical micellar concentration of >50 μm (25Glick J. Santoyo G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2949-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), and substrate in the aqueous phase is unavailable to the membrane-bound enzyme. Although arachidonic acid on the outer leaflet is accessible and rapidly consumed, subsequent turnovers depend on the re-equilibration of substrate between the aqueous and membrane phases. We monitored the activity of 8R-LOX mutants in which the calciumbinding residues and putative membrane insertion residues were mutated. The results of these experiments support the FRET data, as mutations that abrogated binding of 8R-LOX to membranes also eliminated Ca2+ stimulation of enzyme activity in the presence of liposomes (Fig. 5). Specifically, the double mutant D39A/E47A, which did not induce an increase in dansyl fluorescence upon the addition of calcium, did not have enhanced activity in the presence of Ca2+. Similarly, the D39A and E47A single mutants showed partial stimulation of activity by calcium and a reduced membrane-bound acceptor fluorescence emission in the FRET assay. The Ca2+ stimulation of the enzyme activity of the W41A mutant was also diminished. This observation supports a role for Trp41 in membrane insertion. However, this mutant showed intermediate stimulation of activity by Ca2+, and this observation may indicate that the enzyme could still weakly associate with the membrane. The results of the activity assay with the W77A mutant are not easily interpreted, as this form of the enzyme had reduced activity in a membrane-free assay, yet significantly enhanced activity in the presence of liposomes with and without Ca2+. These anomalous results, along with a low yield from the protein expression and purification protocol that proved to be successful with other forms of the prepared enzyme, suggest that this substitution may have destabilized the native conformation. The Catalytic Domain—8R-LOX has 30% sequence identity to rabbit 15S-LOX1, for which a crystal structure has been reported (8Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The structural determination of 15S-LOX1 required the presence of an aryl carboxylate competitive inhibitor (RS75091) (8Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This compound was crucial in the preparation of diffraction quality crystals of the rabbit enzyme and further allowed for the identification of the substrate-binding site. However, the competitive inhibitor does not appear to be a true substrate mimic, as its carboxylate is positioned proximal to the nonheme iron, blocking approach to the open position in the coordination sphere of the metal. In contrast, the surface-exposed Arg403 is thought to tether the substrate by interaction with the arachidonic acid carboxylate group. Thus, a clear interpretation of conformational differences between the substrate cavities of the two enzymes is complex, as these differences may reflect not only specificity and product differences, but also the fact that one of the models is of an inhibited enzyme. Nevertheless, obvious differences can be described. In Fig. 6a, the structures of the rabbit and coral LOXs are superimposed, with the models oriented such that the postulated site of entry to the active site is from above (r.m.s.d. of 1.54 Å for 576 of 662 C-α atoms). The placement of the elements of secondary structure is strikingly conserved at the “lower” half of the catalytic domain, where the long α-helices clearly overlay. Two of these helices contribute four of the iron-ligating side chains (His385, His390, His571, and Asn575). At the entrance side of the catalytic domain, there is more deviation in the positions of the shorter helices. The most notable difference here is a helical segment in 8R-LOX that covers access to the catalytic iron. The corresponding region is not ordered in the rabbit structure, and inspection of the 15S-LOX1 crystal packing context indicates that a helical region here is not compatible with the crystal packing. This observation further complicates our interpretation of structural differences, as one cannot rule out the possibility that crystal packing has selected for the observed rabbit LOX conformation. The substrate-binding pocket of 8R-LOX is illustrated in Fig. 6b. In this rendering of a slab through the active site, internal voids appear as clouds outlining two well resolved inner cavities (for the sake of discussion, denoted Cavity A and Cavity B); the catalytic iron is located in the larger of these cavities (Cavity A). Both cavities are concealed from bulk solvent. We have modeled in the 20-carbon positioned for C-10 substrate such that is H+ abstraction by Fe3+ and C-8 is positioned for attack by O2 in a pouch flanked by Gly428, the position that determines product stereochemistry (16Coffa G. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that, in comparison with S-LOX(s), the structural consequence of the presence of the Gly (versus Ala) on helix 13 (the second helix following the long helix contributing His385 and His390 to the Fe3+ coordination sphere) appears to be primarily one of freeing up space."
https://openalex.org/W2031465355,"Accurate selection of amino acids is essential for faithful translation of the genetic code. Errors during amino acid selection are usually corrected by the editing activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS), which edit misactivated tyrosine. Comparison of cytosolic and mitochondrial PheRS from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested that the organellar protein might lack the editing activity. Yeast cytosolic PheRS was found to contain an editing site, which upon disruption abolished both cis and trans editing of Tyr-tRNAPhe. Wild-type mitochondrial PheRS lacked cis and trans editing and could synthesize Tyr-tRNAPhe, an activity enhanced in active site variants with improved tyrosine recognition. Possible trans editing was investigated in isolated mitochondrial extracts, but no such activity was detected. These data indicate that the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery lacks the tyrosine proofreading activity characteristic of cytosolic translation. This difference between the mitochondria and the cytosol suggests that either organellar protein synthesis quality control is focused on another step or that translation in this compartment is inherently less accurate than in the cytosol.

Structurally and functionally the aaRSs are divided into two unrelated but biochemically analogous groups, class I and class II (4.Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 5.Cusack S. Hartlein M. Leberman R.

Cell. 2001; 104: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The aaRSs attach amino acids to the 3′-ends of tRNA containing the corresponding anticodon sequence, and the resulting aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are used as substrates for ribosomal translation of mRNA. The accuracy of aa-tRNA synthesis is generally assured by the existence of aaRSs specific for each particular amino acid-tRNA pair. Cognate tRNA recognition and discrimination of non-cognate RNAs are achieved by sequence-specific direct and indirect readout of the numerous combinations of bases present in tRNAs (7.McClain W.H. Schneider J. Bhattacharya S. Gabriel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8.Giege R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 9.Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Abelson J.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The relative structural simplicity and inherent similarity between the amino acid substrates makes their accurate recognition and discrimination more challenging. Although some amino acids such as cysteine and tyrosine are different enough to allow their specific recognition by a particular aaRS (11.Fersht A.R. Shindler J.S. Tsui W.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5520-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12.Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), others such as valine and isoleucine are less easily distinguished. For example the class I aaRS isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) is only able to poorly discriminate against valine, which has a misactivation rate of about 1:200 compared with the cognate substrate isoleucine. Despite this significant rate of misactivation and misaminoacylation, the accuracy of translation is not compromised because of the existence of an intrinsic proofreading and editing mechanism in IleRS that specifically hydrolyzes both misactivated Val-AMP and misaminoacylated Val-tRNAIle (13.Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition to IleRS, many other class I and class II aaRSs also employ editing to prevent release of non-cognate aa-tRNA and subsequent loss of translational accuracy (reviewed in Refs. 15.Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gingras L. Translation Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2003: 34-64Google Scholar and 16.Jakubowski H. Ibba M. Francklyn C.S. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 384-396Google Scholar). With a few notable exceptions (17.Jakubowski H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), editing generally occurs in specialized domains distal from the active site such as the class I-specific CP1 region of IleRS and leucyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases. The editing domains of class II aaRSs are more diverse than their class I counterparts and include the “HXXXH” domain found in both alanyl- (18.Beebe K. Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and threonyl-tRNA synthetases (ThrRS) (19.Dock-Bregeon A. Sankaranarayanan R. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B.

A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the B3/B4 domain of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) (25.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The editing domains of aaRSs are normally found in the same subunit as the active site, the only known exceptions being PheRS and certain examples of ProRS and ThrRS. PheRS is normally an (αβ)2 heterotetramer, with the active site located in the α-subunit and tRNA binding sites in both subunits. Recent studies in bacteria revealed that hydrolysis of misaminoacylated Tyr-tRNAPhe occurs at an editing site in the β-subunit ∼40 Å from the active site (25.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This editing site, at the boundary of the B3 and B4 subdomains, is highly conserved in bacterial PheRSs and aligns with a divergent domain conserved in eukaryotic and archaeal sequences that is believed to participate in proofreading. It is less clear whether mitochondrial PheRSs also have the potential to edit misacylated tRNAs, as they are monomers and thus lack the conventional (αβ)2 oligomeric form (26.Sanni A. Walter P. Boulanger Y. Ebel J.P. Fasiolo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8387-8391Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27.Bullard J.M. Cai Y.C. Demeler B. Spremulli L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial PheRS sequences are most closely related to the bacterial type, being chimeras of the α-subunit (with an insertion between motifs 2 and 3) and the C-terminal tRNA anticodon binding domain (B8) of the β-subunit (26.Sanni A. Walter P. Boulanger Y. Ebel J.P. Fasiolo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8387-8391Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite their similarity to bacterial PheRSs, the mitochondrial versions do not contain regions analogous to the known editing domain (25.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although it was originally suggested that mitochondrial PheRSs were active in editing (28.Gabius H.J. Engelhardt R. Schroder F.R. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5306-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), later studies questioned the purity of the enzymes used for these studies (26.Sanni A. Walter P. Boulanger Y. Ebel J.P. Fasiolo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8387-8391Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we describe an investigation of amino acid specificity and editing by mitochondrial and cytosolic PheRSs from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both enzymes display a lack of specificity toward Phe and are able to bind Tyr. The cytosolic enzyme is shown to be less specific than its mitochondrial counterpart but contains an editing site in the β-subunit that specifically edits misacylated Tyr-tRNAPhe. The mitochondrial enzyme is deprived of such an activity and is also able to synthesize the misaminoacylated species Tyr-tRNAPhe. Editing activity toward Tyr-tRNAPhe is also absent from mitochondrial extracts, indicating the lack of this quality control step in vivo. These findings are discussed in the context of other recent studies, which together with the data presented here, raise the possibility that mitochondrial protein synthesis may be less accurate than its cytosolic counterpart. Strains, Plasmids, and General Methods—Plasmids carrying cytosolic or mitochondrial yeast tRNAPhe genes for T7 runoff transcription were gifts from O. Uhlenbeck (Northwestern University). The strains Escherichia coli XL1-Blue/pQE31-FRS-ec (producing His6-tagged E. coli PheRS) and E. coli BL21/pQE32-FRS-sc (producing His6-tagged cytosolic S. cerevisiae PheRS) were gifts from D. A. Tirrell (California Institute of Technology). E. coli BL21-RIL/pET16b producing His6-tagged mitochondrial S. cerevisiae PheRS was a gift from R. A. Zimmermann (University of Massachusetts). All His6-tagged proteins were purified to >99% purity on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) by standard procedures. The specific activities of the purified proteins (nmol of Phe attached/mg/min) were: wild-type cytoplasmic PheRS, 22; D243A cytoplasmic PheRS, 12; wild-type mitochondrial PheRS, 89; and A333G mitochondrial PheRS, 73. Point mutations were introduced into the pheST genes (encoding the PheRS α- and β-subunits, respectively) by PCR with two self-complementary 33-mer oligonucleotides that carried the appropriate mutations. Reactions were performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Introduction of the desired mutations was monitored by sequencing of the resulting genes. Commercial l-Tyr (Sigma) was shown to be free of phenylalanine (Phe) contamination by pyrophosphate exchange before and after recrystallization of the amino acid as described previously (29.Lin S.X. Baltzinger M. Remy P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LB and M9 media were prepared as described previously (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All buffers were adjusted to the correct pH with NaOH unless otherwise indicated. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (31.Ataide S.F. Jester B.C. Devine K.M. Ibba M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against yeast cytosolic PheRS (AnimalPharm, Healdsburg, CA). tRNATrp and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase were prepared as described previously (31.Ataide S.F. Jester B.C. Devine K.M. Ibba M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Preparation of in Vitro Transcribed tRNAPhe—In vitro T7 RNA polymerase runoff transcription reactions were conducted according to standard procedures (32.Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). After ethanol precipitation, tRNA transcripts were resuspended by heating in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 7 m urea, loaded on a Resource Q 6 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in the loading buffer. Fractions containing tRNA were pooled and desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). The transcripts were ethanol precipitated, washed with 80% ethanol, dried, resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 2 mm MgCl2, and finally refolded by incubation for 1 min at 75 °C followed by slow cooling down to room temperature. ATP-PPi Exchange Reaction—The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in a medium containing 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm [32P]PPi (1 cpm/pmol), various amounts of Phe (1.5–300 μm) and Tyr (0.2 to 7 mm), and 13 nm cytosolic PheRS or 10–70 nm mitochondrial enzyme. After 1–5 min, 25 μlofthe reaction were removed and added to a solution containing 1% charcoal, 5.6% HClO4, and 75 mm PPi. The radiolabeled ATP bound to the charcoal was filtered through a 3MM Whatman filter disc under vacuum and washed three times with 5 ml of water and once with 5 ml of ethanol. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation counting (Ultima Gold, Packard Instrument Co.). Aminoacylation Assay with Radiolabeled Amino Acids—Aminoacylation was performed in 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm l-[14C]Phe (280 cpm/pmol), 5 μm tRNA transcript, and 10–100 nm yeast PheRS. 15-μl aliquots were spotted on 3MM filter disks (Whatman), washed three times in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and dried. The amount of radioactivity retained was determined by liquid scintillation counting. One unit of PheRS corresponded to the amount of enzyme necessary to catalyze the formation of 1 nmol of Phe-tRNAPhe min–1 mg–1 protein at 37 °C. Aminoacylation Assay with Radiolabeled tRNA—Synthesis of tRNA 32P-labeled pA76 transcripts were performed essentially as described previously (33.Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) except that the CCA-3′-end was removed prior to labeling. Briefly, the CCA-3′-terminal nucleotides of the tRNA were first removed by treatment of 20 μm tRNA transcript with 73 μg/ml Crotalus atrox venom (Sigma) in a buffer containing 40 mm sodium Gly (pH 9.0) and 10 mm magnesium acetate. The mix was incubated for 2 h at 21 °C and phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated and finally desalted by gel filtration through a Sephadex G 25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The CCA-3′-end of the tRNA was reconstituted and radiolabeled by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μm snake venom-treated tRNA in 50 mm Na-Gly (pH 9.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm CTP, 9 μm ATP, 1 μm [α-32P]ATP with 3 μg/ml E. coli tRNA-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (34.Seth M. Thurlow D.L. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4521-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of phenol, and the resulting mixture was gel filtered twice through a G25 column. As described previously (33.Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the aminoacylation reaction was performed in a 10-μl aminoacylation medium (see above) containing 5 mm cold amino acids or Phe analogues, 5 μm transcript, and a trace of radiolabeled tRNA. After 15 min of incubation an aliquot was removed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with P1 RNase. The liberated [α-32P]AMP and aminoacyl-[α-32P]AMP were separated by TLC on polyethyleneimine cellulose and visualized as described previously (33.Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Post-transfer Editing Assay—The cytosolic or mitochondrial Tyr-tRNAPhe and Phe-tRNAPhe (S. cerevisiae transcripts) were prepared as described previously (25.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in an aminoacylation reaction containing 30 μm [3H]Tyr (180 cpm/pmol), 0.5 μm mitochondrial PheRS A333G, and 5 μm corresponding in vitro transcribed tRNAPhe. Comparison to the total tRNA concentration then allowed us to estimate that purified Phe-tRNAPhe yields were about 20% (i.e. these preparations also contained 80% uncharged tRNA), whereas Tyr-tRNAPhe yields were 15% (85% uncharged), within the typical range expected for aminoacyl-tRNA preparations. Post-transfer editing reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm [3H]Tyr-tRNAPhe, and a catalytic amount of PheRS (5 nm cytosolic or 5 nm to 2 μm mitochondrial yeast PheRS). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the post-transfer editing reaction was followed by measuring the remaining radiolabeled aa-tRNA in aliquots of 15 μl after 0–12 min of incubation as described for the aminoacylation assay (see above). The amount of cytosolic or mitochondrial crude extract from S. cerevisiae used in the editing assay was determined according to the PheRS specific activity measured for the extracts, 0.78 nmol/min/mg of protein and 0.19 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Preparation of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Fractions of S. cerevisiae— S. cerevisiae strain W303 was grown in rich medium containing 2% galactose, and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (35.Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared by Zymolyase-20T (ICN) treatment and broken by three passes through an EmulsiFlex®-C5 (AVESTIN) in 0.6 m sorbitol (Fluka), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondria were purified by centrifugation and extensive washing in the same buffer as described previously (36.Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic fraction obtained during this procedure was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Highly purified organelles were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (Beckman SW41) in a Percoll™ step gradient (Amersham Biosciences) (40% Percoll™ in 0.6 m sorbitol (Fluka), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), overlaid with 20% Percoll™ in the same buffer). These procedures yielded cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions with less than 0.5% cross-contamination as judged by Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for proteins in the different compartments as described elsewhere (37.Rinehart J. Krett B. Rubio M.A. Alfonzo J.D. Söll D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were suspended in aminoacylation buffer (see above) followed by sonication for 1 min at 50% output with a Sonifier 450 (Branson) equipped with a microprobe. The resulting extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (S100) to precipitate the membrane fractions. The resulting soluble extracts were used for aminoacylation assays. Phylogenetic Analyses—179 PheRS α-subunit sequences (92 from eubacteria, 23 from archaea, and 35 and 29 cytosolic and mitochondrial eukaryotic sequences, respectively) were aligned with the ClustalX program version 1.83 (38.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). The alignment process was guided with the known three-dimensional structure of PheRS of Thermus thermophilus and refined manually. The trees were generated by applying the neighbor-joining method with the program ClustalX or the Phylip package version 6.63 (39.Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to a set of 100 bootstrap replicates of the ungapped alignment. Maximum likelihood analysis was also applied to the same alignment with the program Puzzle version 5.2 (40.Schmidt H.A. Strimmer K. Vingron M. von Haeseler A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar) where more than 50 × 106 quartets were analyzed. The trees were rooted using the nine known sequences of o-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase found in methanogenic archaea that were previously identified as paralogues of the α-subunit of PheRS (41.Sauerwald A. Zhu W. Major T.A. Roy H. Palioura S. Jahn D. Whitman W.B. Yates III, J.R. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2005; 307: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The β-Subunit of Cytosolic PheRS Contains a Post-transfer Editing Site—Previous studies (42.Lin S.X. Baltzinger M. Remy P. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4109-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43.Igloi G.L. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3459-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggested that yeast cytosolic PheRS could hydrolyze Tyr-tRNAPhe, as recently directly demonstrated for the E. coli enzyme (25.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tyr-tRNAPhe was synthesized and added to a deacylation reaction containing yeast cytosolic PheRS. Cytosolic PheRS was able to specifically deacylate Tyr-tRNAPhe derived from both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs, indicating the presence of trans editing activity (Fig. 1). Amino acid sequences from 179 PheRSs were aligned to investigate whether this activity in the yeast enzyme could be attributed to a catalytic site in the β-subunit, as is the case in E. coli. Examination of the PheRS β-subunit sequence alignment allowed identification of domains B1, B3, and B4 (B2 is absent from eukaryotes), but B3/B4 residues which are involved in bacterial editing were not well conserved in their eukaryotic counterparts (Fig. 2). The average percentage amino acid identities observed within eubacterial and eukaryotic B3/B4 ungapped domain alignments were 42 and 57%, respectively, whereas there was far less similarity when eukaryotic and eubacterial B3/B4 domains were compared with each other (15% identity). No conservation was seen at the small residues Thr354 and Ala356, changes in which ablated editing by E. coli PheRS. Moderate conservation was observed at His265 and Glu334 (His158 and Asp243, respectively, in yeast PheRS) suggesting that those residues might contribute to the editing activity of the cytosolic enzyme. Based on this analysis, cytosolic PheRS variants were produced containing the replacements βH158A and βD243A. Although the βH158A replacement had no effect (data not shown), introduction of βD243A led to a loss in Tyr-tRNAPhe deacylation activity (Fig. 3A) similar to that observed for E. coli variants defective in editing (25.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The loss of editing but not synthetic activity resulting from the βD243A replacement was confirmed by the ability of this PheRS variant to synthesize Tyr-tRNAPhe (Fig. 3B). The misaminoacylation activity of PheRS βD243A was specific for yeast cytosolic tRNAPhe, as mitochondrial tRNAPhe was not a substrate for tyrosylation. This confirms previous indications that mitochondrial tRNAPhe could not be phenylalanylated by cytosolic PheRS (Fig. 3C). This discrepancy between the aminoacylation and editing capacities of mitochondrial tRNAPhe, together with the absence of an obvious editing domain, prompted us to investigate the organellar PheRS in more detail.FIGURE 2Comparison of the β-subunits of eubacterial and eukaryotic PheRSs.

The mitochondrial PheRS was four times more efficient than the cytosolic PheRS with respect to Phe activation. This was mostly because of the 7-fold weaker apparent affinity of the cytosolic enzyme for its substrate compared with the mitochondrial enzyme. This tendency was reversed when Tyr was the substrate. Because Tyr exhibits poor solubility we were unable to saturate the mitochondrial enzyme. Instead, the kcat/Km was estimated at sub-saturating concentrations of Tyr. Although the cytosolic enzyme was twice as efficient for Tyr activation as its mitochondrial counterpart, for both enzymes the relative efficiency of activation of Phe was only 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than for Tyr. To determine whether such a poor apparent selectivity was because of the contamination of Tyr by a trace of Phe we assessed the purity of the Tyr substrate by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Even after several cycles of heating and cooling, the Tyr used for our experiments was found to be stable and free of any trace of Phe.TABLE ONESteady-state kinetic constants for ATP-[32P]PPi exchange for cytosolic and mitochondrial PheRS from yeastPheRSPheTyrSelectivity (kcat/KM)Phe/(kcat/KM)TyrKMkcatkcat/KMKMkcatkcat/KMμms-1s-1 μm-1μms-1s-1 μm-1Cytosol30 ± 2240 ± 408 ± 2860 ± 300160 ± 400.2 ± 0.140 ± 30Mitochondria4.2 ± 0.1150 ± 540 ± 2(1700)aLower limits based on the assumption that the mitochondrial enzyme, like the cytoplasmic enzyme, has similar kcat values for Tyr and Phe.(150)aLower limits based on the assumption that the mitochondrial enzyme, like the cytoplasmic enzyme, has similar kcat values for Tyr and Phe.0.09 ± 0.01bDue to the high KM compared to practical Tyr concentrations ([S]<<KM), kcat/KM was directly estimated from the equation v = kcat/KM ([E] [S]).400 ± 80a Lower limits based on the assumption that the mitochondrial enzyme, like the cytoplasmic enzyme, has similar kcat values for Tyr and Phe.b Due to the high KM compared to practical Tyr concentrations ([S]<<KM), kcat/KM was directly estimated from t"
https://openalex.org/W2009632953,"Fluorescence is an unusual means of communication in the living world: it can be an important signal in mate choice for budgerigars and mantis shrimps, but little else. Work on the plant Mirabilis jalapa (also called ‘four o'clock’ or ‘marvel of Peru’), which has brightly coloured flowers that open at night, suggests that some pollinators can be added to that list. Fluorescence emitted by one pigment, a yellow betaxanthin, is absorbed by a violet betacyanin to create a contrasting fluorescent pattern on the flower's petals. The way flowers appear to insects is crucial for pollination1,2,3. Here we describe an internal light-filtering effect in the flowers of Mirabilis jalapa, in which the visible fluorescence emitted by one pigment, a yellow betaxanthin, is absorbed by another, a violet betacyanin, to create a contrasting fluorescent pattern on the flower's petals. This finding opens up new possibilities for pollinator perception as fluorescence has not previously been considered as a potential signal in flowers."
https://openalex.org/W2162771723,"α-Synuclein is one of the causative proteins of familial Parkinson disease, which is characterized by neuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies include not only α-synuclein but also aggregates of other proteins. This fact raises a question as to whether the formation of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils in Lewy bodies may occur via interaction with fibrils derived from different proteins. To probe this hypothesis, we investigated in vitro fibril formation of human α-synuclein in the presence of preformed fibril seeds of various different proteins. We used three proteins, Escherichia coli chaperonin GroES, hen lysozyme, and bovine insulin, all of which have been shown to form amyloid fibrils. Very surprisingly, the formation of α-synuclein amyloid fibril was accelerated markedly in the presence of preformed seeds of GroES, lysozyme, and insulin fibrils. The structural characteristics of the natively unfolded state of α-synuclein may allow binding to various protein particles, which in turn triggers the formation (extension) of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils. This finding is very important for understanding the molecular mechanism of Parkinson disease and also provides interesting implications into the mechanism of transmissible conformational diseases. α-Synuclein is one of the causative proteins of familial Parkinson disease, which is characterized by neuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies.

Alzheimer disease, and some forms of spongiform encephalopathy, are associated with the formation of abnormally aggregated proteins (1.Shastry B.S. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The aggregates, known as amyloid fibrils, are formed from proteins and peptides and are characterized by their unique fibrous appearance and β-rich structure (2.Tan S.Y. Pepys M.B.

To date, amyloid fibrils have been isolated from a number of pathological specimens, and it is becoming apparent that the ability to form fibrous aggregates is not merely a characteristic of a specific set of proteins but may be a common characteristic of proteins in general (5.Dobson C.M.

PD forms neuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites, the major component of which is the protein, α-synuclein. Although its physiological role is not well known in neuronal cells, it has been observed that most of the α-synuclein accumulated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is in fibril form in PD.

Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). The primary structure of α-synuclein possesses several unique characteristics; that is, seven imperfect repeats of KTKEGV at the N-terminal and middle regions and a region rich in acidic amino acids at the C-terminal region (12.Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). In general, amyloid fibril formation proceeds according to two processes; the first is a nucleus formation step followed by an extension of fibrils from the nucleus. Usually, the nucleation process is very slow and rate-determining, and the nucleus-dependent extension process is much faster. The mechanism of amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein in vitro has been studied extensively by Fink and Uversky (14.Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and Uversky (13.Uversky V.N. J. Biomol. Struct.

From the studies it was revealed that the hydrophobic repeat region between 65 and 95 and the negative charges at the C-terminal region play a key role in forming fibril structures. A molecular species that is relatively compact but still unfolded was found to be involved in the fibril formation. Furthermore, α-synuclein was shown to undergo significantly enhanced fibril formation under numerous conditions where this species was abundant, e.g. in the presence of metal ions (18.Uversky V.N.

In contrast, fibril formation was slowed or inhibited under conditions favoring either more folded conformations (20.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L.

Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). However, the actual in vivo mechanism of α-synuclein fibril formation in PD is still unclear because of the existence of a diverse population of proteins in the cell. Lewy bodies contain aggregates of not only α-synuclein protein but also various other proteins, such as Tau protein and Aβ peptide, which are also related to neurodegenerative disorders (26.Lucking C.B. Brice A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27.Forman M.S. Schmidt M.L. Kasturi S. Perl D.P. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J.

This fact prompted an idea that perhaps various amyloid-like fibrils formed in the cell might act as a “nucleus” and that α-synuclein protein may be attracted to this nucleus to then form α-synuclein amyloid fibrils. In support of this, cell culture experiments showed that the presence of abnormal Tau protein leads to α-synuclein amyloid fibril formation (30.Giasson B.I. Forman M.S. Higuchi M. Golbe L.I. Graves C.L. Kotzbauer P.T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2003; 300: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein in the presence of other different amyloid fibril seeds in vitro. We used fibrils of Escherichia coli chaperonin GroES (31.Higurashi T. Yagi H. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), hen lysozyme (32.Krebs M.R. Wilkins D.K. Chung E.W. Pitkeathly M.C. Chamberlain A.K. Zurdo J. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and bovine insulin (33.Jimenez J.L. Nettleton E.J. Bouchard M. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Saibil H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) as seeds for α-synuclein fibril formation. Interestingly, the formation of α-synuclein amyloid fibril was accelerated markedly in the presence of preformed amyloid seeds of these different proteins. However, a lag time before extension phase still remained, in contrast to experiments using α-synuclein as seed, indicating that there were variances in the ability to promote fibrillation between these protein fibrils. Furthermore, from fluorescence microscopy experiments using fluorescent dyes and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments using gold-attached immunoglobulins, we demonstrate that the preformed seeds of different proteins were incorporated into the completed α-synuclein amyloid fibrils. These findings indicated that the natively unfolded structure of α-synuclein may allow binding to a variety of protein particles, which in turn triggers the formation (extension) of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils. The present results are quite important for understanding the molecular mechanism of not only PD but also other transmissible amyloidogenic diseases. Expression and Purification of α-Synuclein—Human α-synuclein gene was amplified from cDNA of human brain (Cap site cDNA dT: Nippon gene) by PCR, subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI multicloning site of the expression vector pET23a(+) (Novagen), and expressed in E. coli BLR(DE3) (Novagen). Cells were suspended in purification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), disrupted using sonication, and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 30 min). Streptomycin sulfate (final 2.5%) was added to the supernatant to remove nucleic acids. After removal of nucleic acids by centrifugation, the supernatant was heated to 90 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged. In this step α-synuclein remained in the supernatant. The supernatant was precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation, centrifuged, and dialyzed overnight and then applied onto a Resource-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as running buffer. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Protein concentration of α-synuclein was determined by using a molar absorption coefficient of ϵ280nm0.1%=0.354 (34.Narhi L. Wood S.J.

Amyloid Fibril Formation and Thioflavin-T Binding Assay— α-Synuclein (15 mg/ml) was incubated in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl at 37 °C without agitation, and fibril formation was monitored by thioflavin-T (ThioT, Wako) binding assay (35.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) using a HITACHI F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Aliquots were mixed with 25 μm ThioT in PBS buffer, and fluorescence intensities were monitored at 480 nm with excitation at 450 nm. Fibrils of GroES were formed by incubation at 15 mg/ml protein concentration in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.6 m Gdn-HCl at 37 °C for 20 days (31.Higurashi T. Yagi H. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fibrils of hen lysozyme (Nacalai Tesque) were formed by incubation at 15 mg/ml protein concentration in HCl solution, pH 2.0, at 65 °C for 7 days (32.Krebs M.R. Wilkins D.K. Chung E.W. Pitkeathly M.C. Chamberlain A.K. Zurdo J. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Fibrils of bovine insulin (Sigma) were formed by incubation at 10 mg/ml protein concentration in 25 mm Gly-HCl buffer, pH 2.0, at 37 °C for 10 days (33.Jimenez J.L. Nettleton E.J. Bouchard M. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Saibil H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Mixed amyloid fibrils of α-synuclein and GroES were formed by incubation of 8.0 mg/ml α-synuclein and 6.0 mg/ml GroES in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.9 m Gdn-HCl at 37 °C for 15 days. Samples of fibril seed were prepared as follows. Fibrils prepared as above were ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were resuspended in a 1.5-ml plastic tube with Milli-Q water and sonicated for 30 s (0.5-s pulse; Sonics & Materials Inc.). The concentrations of seed samples (1.4–2.5 mg/ml) were adjusted to give the same fluorescence intensities in ThioT assays before the addition to α-synuclein solutions (1 ml). α-Synuclein amyloid fibrils were added as seed in 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8% (v/v) concentrations. GroES fibrils, lysozyme fibrils, and insulin fibrils were seeded in 1, 5, and 10% (v/v) concentrations. The concentration of seed protein was determined after solubilization in 6 n NaOH using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with each native protein as a standard. CD Measurements—CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter equipped with a constant temperature cell holder at 25 °C. Water-washed pellets of amyloid fibril (0.6 mg/ml) were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and far-UV spectra were recorded using a 1-mm light path length cell. For comparison, native α-synuclein (0.2 mg/ml) was also measured. Microscopy Measurements of α-Synuclein Fibrils—TEM measurements were performed on a JEOL-100CX transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Samples were diluted 40-fold with water and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution on copper grids (400-mesh) covered by carbon-coated collodion film (Nisshin EM). Observation magnification was ×27,000∼34,000. Fluorescence microscopy measurements were performed using a Nikon ECLIPSE E-600 microscope equipped with Y-FL fluorescence instrument and super high pressure mercury lamp power supply HB-10103AF (Nikon). Amyloid fibrils were diluted 40-fold with distilled water and stained overnight in the presence of 25 μm ThioT before measurements. The observation was done using a Plan Fluor series objective lens (Nikon) and B-2A filter block (Nikon) whose excitation and observation wavelengths were 450–490 nm and >520 nm, respectively. Atomic force microscopy measurements were performed using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IV scanning microscope (model MMAFM-2) at 25 °C. Measurements were performed using air tapping and fluid tapping modes. For the air tapping mode measurements, 20 ml of 40-fold diluted fibril solution was put onto freshly cleaved mica, incubated for 20 min, and then washed with 100 μl of water and dried. For the fluid tapping mode measurements, fibril preparations were diluted 7.5-fold with distilled water, and 15 μl of the solution was placed on the mica cell, incubated for 20 min, and then washed with 15 μl of water, and finally 100 μl water was reapplied. Visualization of Amyloid Fibrils Formed by α-Synuclein and Various Protein Seeds—α-Synuclein and proteins used for amyloid seeds (α-synuclein, GroES, lysozyme) were each labeled before the experiments with Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols. The degree of Cy5 incorporation to α-synuclein was determined to be 0.1 mol of Cy5/mol of protein by UV absorption, and the degrees of FITC labeling for α-synuclein, GroES, and lysozyme were 0.8, 0.6, and 0.3 mol of FITC/mol of protein, respectively. Seed fibrils were then prepared from the FITC-labeled proteins and collected by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 1 h. Pellet samples were resuspended in Milli-Q water, sonicated for 30 s, and used as seeds. Fifteen μl of Cy5-labeled α-synuclein (5 mg/ml) was placed on non-fluorescent glass slides (Matsunami Glass Industry Ltd., Japan), and 0.3–1 μl of FITC-labeled preformed amyloid samples (α-synuclein, GroES, and lysozyme) were added as a seed fibril and then covered with a glass coverslip. Fibril formation of Cy5-labeled α-synuclein was observed on these sealed glass plates during incubation at 4 or 25 °C for several days using fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, immuno-TEM measurements using gold-conjugated antibodies were performed. First, the mixed amyloid fibrils prepared according to the protocol described above were incubated with 1000-fold diluted anti-GroES antibody (from rabbit) (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp.) and 100-fold diluted anti-α-synuclein (116–131) antibody (from goat) (Biogenesis, Ltd.) at 25 °C overnight. After ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 1 h, the pellet samples were resuspended in 300 ml of PBS buffer, pH 8.2, containing two secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG antibody (from goat) conjugated with 40-nm colloidal gold and anti-goat IgG antibody (from rabbit) conjugated with 10-nm colloidal gold (British BioCell International, Inc.). After incubation at 25 °C for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged and washed with phosphate-buffered saline throughout and then negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The location of GroES and α-synuclein were visualized by attachment of 40- and 10-nm colloidal gold particles, respectively. No localization was observed using only the secondary antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold particles in control experiments under these conditions. Small Angle X-ray Scattering Measurements—Small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed with the optics and detector system installed at Beamline BL-40B2 of the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan. The wavelength of incident x-ray beam was 1.5 Å. An imaging plate area detector R-AXIS IV (Rigaku, Japan) was used to detect the scattered x-ray signal. The distance between the sample and the detector was 1000 mm. Protein solutions of 10–20 mg/ml were placed in a mica cell of 1-mm path length. Irradiation time of the sample to X-rays was typically 5–10 min according to the beam intensity. A concentric image of scattered x-ray radiation was digitized with 0.1-mm resolution. Signals from points equidistant from the center of the concentric image were integrated and averaged as a signal of the corresponding scattering angle. Data from scattering angles of up to 12.1° were collected. The radius of gyration, Rg, was determined using Guinier's approximation (36.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Ltd., New York1982Google Scholar), I(Q)=I(0)exp(-Q2Rg2/3)eq 1 where I(Q) is the scattering intensity, and Q is the momentum of transfer (Q = 4πsin θ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the incident x-ray wavelength). Fitting of the above equation was performed in QRg regions from 0.8 to 1.3. Amyloid Fibril Formation of α-Synuclein—It has been shown that α-synuclein forms amyloid fibrils in vitro that closely resemble those found in Lewy bodies (37.Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This is attributed to the preferential binding of cations that neutralize negative charges localized in the C-terminal region of α-synuclein, which allows formation of a compact conformation that is presumably favorable for fibrillation (23.Uversky V.N.

In small-angle x-ray scattering experiments, we observed a gradual decrease of the Rg value (corrected for variances in protein concentrations) from 39.0 to 35.4 Å upon the addition of increasing NaCl concentrations (0–1 m) (data not shown). This value (39.0 Å) in the absence of NaCl was consistent with the previously reported value (40 Å) at pH 7.5 and 100 mm NaCl (23.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 40.Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 553-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, no changes in CD and fluorescence spectra were observed under similar conditions, indicating that the conformation of α-synuclein was still unfolded (data not shown). Also, we detected an accelerated fibrillation of α-synuclein in the presence of NaCl (data not shown). Additionally, under conditions of constant agitation in the presence of NaCl, fibrillation was greatly accelerated (essentially completed within 40 h) (data not shown). In this study, we ultimately performed all of the fibril formation experiments of this protein in the presence of 1 m NaCl at 37 °C without agitation because this condition allowed more reproducible and reliable results to be obtained. As shown in Fig. 1a, fibril formation of α-synuclein showed a lag time of about 370 h, after which fibril extension was observed, and plateaus in ThioT fluorescence increase were seen after another 40 h. As shown in Fig. 1b, although native α-synuclein existed in a largely unfolded form under physiological conditions (11.Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 13.Uversky V.N. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2003; 21: 211-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), a typical β-structure was observed in CD spectra of amyloid fibrils. The amyloid fibrils were also examined by using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1c), TEM (Fig. 1d), and atomic force microscopy (Fig. 1, e and f). All these observations demonstrated that the sample was a typical amyloid fibril whose morphology was the same as that of other studies reported previously (16.Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T.

From the TEM and atomic force microscopy measurements in the present study, the fibrils were determined to be 1000–5000 Å in length and 170 Å in diameter, with a twisted structure resembling a left-handed spiral. The helical pitch (periodicity) of this twist was about 570 Å. Although they vary somewhat depending upon the method of measurements and the conditions of fibrils formation, these values were similar to the reported values for amyloid fibrils of human (41.Conway K.A.

Biol. 2005; 351: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Seeding Effects on α-Synuclein Amyloid Fibril Formation—In many cases it has been well established that amyloid fibril formation proceeds in a biphasic manner; that is, nucleation followed by nucleation-dependent extension. In this mechanism the rate-determining step is the nucleation reaction. If preformed seeds of the same protein are added, the seed acts as a nucleus (starting material) for fibril extension, and the extension occurs immediately with no lag time in typical amyloidogenic proteins (46.Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). We first confirmed this seed-dependent amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein. As shown in Fig. 2a, when seeds of preformed α-synuclein amyloid fibril were present, fibrillation of α-synuclein was accelerated greatly; the 370-h lag time observed in the absence of seeds was abolished in the presence of 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1% (v/v) seeds, reflecting a typical seed (nucleus)-dependent fibril formation mechanism. Although a slightly increased extension rate was seen with increasing amounts of seeds added (0.05–0.07 h-1), the fibril extension rate was almost the same as that of spontaneous fibril formation (0.05 h-1). Next, we examined whether α-synuclein fibril formation was accelerated by seeds of different proteins. We used three proteins, co-chaperonin GroES (31.Higurashi T. Yagi H. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), hen-egg lysozyme (32.Krebs M.R. Wilkins D.K. Chung E.W. Pitkeathly M.C. Chamberlain A.K. Zurdo J. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M.

Folates consist of a pteridine, p-aminobenzoate (pABA) and one or more glutamate residues (Fig. 1A). All these moieties are synthesized and assembled into folates in the cytosol of bacteria, but in plants the pathway is split among three subcellular compartments. The pteridine is made in the cytosol, and the pABA is made in plastids; both then enter mitochondria, where they are coupled together and glutamylated to yield folate (5.Rébeillé F. Douce R.

This compartmentation of the synthesis pathway and its end products entails various transmembrane fluxes of folates and their precursors (Fig. 1B).

Multiple transporters that act on folates as well as antifolates such as methotrexate or aminopterin have been characterized in mammals. These transporters include the reduced folate carrier, which catalyzes exchange with organic anions, folate receptors, which mediate folate entry via endocytosis, folate efflux pumps of the ATP binding cassette family, and a protein from the mitochondrial carrier family (19.Brzezinska A. Winska P. Balinska M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2000; 47: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20.Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev.

High affinity folate and pteridine transporters are also known from the trypanosomatid Leishmania, a parasitic protist that is auxotrophic for folate and pteridine (26.Beck J.T. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These carriers are a biopterin transporter (BT1) and 2 folate transporters (FT1, FT5), all 3 being similar proteins with about 12 putative transmembrane helices (27.Lemley C. Yan S. Dole V.S.

Together, they define a small family (the FBT family) that is a distant member of the major facilitator superfamily (30.Chang A.B. Lin R. Studley W.K. Tran C.V. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2004; 21: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). BT1 is the only carrier yet known to act on pteridines; it also has low affinity folate transport activity (22.Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J. El-Fadili A. Kundig C. Richard D. Roy G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Besides proteins from trypanosomatids, the FBT family (also known as the BT1 family, Pfam03092) includes a highly conserved protein from Cyanobacteria and nine Arabidopsis proteins. In this study we used heterologous expression in Escherichia coli mutants to probe the functions of a representative cyanobacterial FBT protein and its closest Arabidopsis homolog. Having demonstrated that both have folate and antifolate transport activity, we investigated the subcellular location of the Arabidopsis protein, the expression of its gene, and the effect of ablating this gene. Chemicals and Reagents—Folates and pteridines were from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). p-Aminobenzoylglutamate (pABA-Glu) was HPLC-purified before use. Percoll and [5,6-3H]UTP (35 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]Leucine (59 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. E. coli Strains—Strain BN1163 (pabA1, pabB::Kan, rpsL704, ilvG-, rfb-50, rph-1) was supplied by B. Nichols (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), and strain NM1200 was supplied by N. Majdalani (NCBI, Bethesda, MD). The NM1200 strain was constructed by P1 transduction of the Mini-λ CmR prophage carrying the Red gam, beta, and exo genes under the PL promoter (31.Court D.L. Swaminathan S. Yu D. Wilson H. Baker T. Bubunenko M. Sawitzke J. Sharan S.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in MG1655 (E. coli K12, E. coli Genetic Stock Center). The folE gene was deleted by targeted homologous recombination using electroporated linear DNA and strain NM1200 as described (32.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kanamycin cassette was amplified from plasmid pUC4K with primers FolE-5′ and FolE-3′ (see Supplemental Table I), which respectively included the start and stop codon of folE and 47-bp 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. After inducing the recombination system at 42 °C for 15 min, strain NM1200 was transformed with the PCR product. Clones with the desired replacement of the folE gene were selected on LB plates containing 300 μm thymidine and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The kanamycin resistance locus was then transferred by P1 transduction to strain K12, to give strain P1-7B. Deletion of the folE gene was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. P1-7B was maintained on LB medium containing 300 μm thymidine and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Plants and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown at 23-28 °C in 12-h days (photosynthetic photon flux density 80 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) in potting soil irrigated with water. When roots were required, plants were grown hydroponically (33.Gibeaut D.M. Hulett J. Cramer G.R. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Expression Constructs—Synechocystis slr0642 and Arabidopsis At2g32040 amplicons preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence were cloned between the NotI and SstI sites of pLOI707HE (34.Arfman N. Worrell V. Ingram L.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7370-7378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the tac promoter, the lacIq repressor gene, and the tet marker. Templates were Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genomic DNA (from W. Vermaas, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ) and an At2g32040 cDNA (GenBank™ BT003363, from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center). The following PCR primers were used (see Supplemental Table I): for Synechocystis slr0642, Slr1-5′ and Slr1-3′; for the mature At2g32040 construct, At-t1-5′ and At-t1-3′; for the chimeric At2g32040 construct (with codons 1-128 replaced by codons 1-37 of slr0642), Slr1-5′ and Slr-c1-3′ to amplify the slr0642 fragment, At-c1-5′ and At-t1-3′ to amplify the At2g32040 fragment, and Slr1-5′ and At-t1-3′ to splice the fragments. The complete slr0642 amplicon was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega), excised with NotI and SstI, and then cloned into pLOI707HE; other amplicons were cut with NotI and SstI and cloned straight into pLOI707HE. For the vector minus insert control, pLOI707HE was digested with NotI and SstI, end-polished with T4 polymerase, and religated. Constructs were made in E. coli strain DH5α, sequence-verified, then introduced into E. coli strains BN1163 and P1-7B, both harboring pACYC-RIL (Stratagene), which contains three rare E. coli tRNA genes and the cat marker. Transformants were grown on LB plates containing tetracycline 10 μg/ml, kanamycin 30-50 μg/ml, chloramphenicol 20 μg/ml and (for P1-7B only) thymidine 300 μm. Folate Uptake Tests—BN1163 cells harboring pACYC-RIL and a pLOI707HE construct were streaked on minimal medium plates containing M9 salts (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.3Google Scholar), 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, trace elements (36.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), and 0.4% (w/v) glucose supplemented with antibiotics as above and 0.5 mm IPTG. To this medium was added 3.6 μm pABA or 11 μm (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF (5-CHO-THF), folic acid, or (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF triglutamate. P1-7B cells harboring pACYC-RIL and a pLOI707HE construct were streaked on LB medium containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium ascorbate and 1 mm dithiothreitol, appropriate antibiotics and IPTG minus or plus 11 μm 5-CHO-THF, dihydropteroate, hydroxymethyldihydropterin, or dihydropterin-6-aldehyde. Tests with the two latter compounds were made in a 10-l vessel flushed with N2 at 25 ml/h. Antifolate Uptake Tests—Solid or liquid minimal media were supplemented with antibiotics, IPTG, and pABA as described above. For tests on solid medium, cells were streaked on plates containing a central 1-cm disk of Whatman No. 1 paper soaked with 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide alone or containing 100 mm methotrexate or 80 mm aminopterin. For tests in liquid medium, cells from an overnight culture were inoculated to give an A600 reading of 0.05 in 1.5 ml of fresh medium supplemented with various amounts of methotrexate or aminopterin. Growth was evaluated by measuring A600 after incubating at 37 °C for 9.5 h with shaking at 220 rpm. Transient Expression of Green Fluorescent Fusion Protein in Arabidopsis Protoplasts—The entire At2g32040 sequence was amplified using primers At-gfp-5′ and At-gfp-3′, digested with SalI and NcoI, and cloned in-frame upstream of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in pTH2 (37.Niwa Y.

Plant J. 1994; 5: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Transformation efficiencies were typically 5-20%. Samples were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy as described (11.Basset G.J. Ravanel S. Quinlivan E.P. White R. Giovannoni J.J. Rébeillé F. Nichols B.P. Shinozaki K. Seki M. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 2004; 40: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Chloroplast Import Assays—The full-length At2g32040 sequence and a version lacking the first 88 residues were, respectively, amplified using forward primer At-ifl-5′ or At-it-5′ and reverse primer At-i-3′. The amplicons were cloned as EcoRI-HindIII fragments into pGEM®-4Z (Promega). Coupled in vitro transcription-translation was performed using a wheat germ TnT® kit (Promega) and [3H]leucine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Translation product import into pea chloroplasts was assayed as described (39.Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, translation product (50 μl) was added to 50 μl of 2× import buffer (39.Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm unlabeled leucine; 100 μl of 1× import buffer containing 30 mm Mg2+-ATP and 200 μl of purified chloroplasts (0.2 mg chlorophyll) were added, and samples were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the light. Chloroplasts were re-purified as described (39.Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), resuspended in SDS loading buffer containing 4 m urea, and held for 10 min at 37 °C before loading. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kits (Qiagen) and treated with DNase (DNA-free™ kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). RT-PCR was performed on 250 ng of RNA in 25-μl reactions using Taq-Man One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix reagents and a GeneAmp 5700 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers (At-rt-5′, At-rt-3′) and Taq-Man probe (At-rt-probe) were designed with Applied Biosystems Primer Express software. The amplicon length was 74 bp. Primer At-rt-5′ spanned two exons to avoid amplifying contaminating genomic DNA, and controls without reverse transcriptase were run to verify that no such amplification occurred. RT-PCR conditions were 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. An At2g32040 RNA standard was synthesized from a cDNA template using primers At-SP6std-5′ and At-std-3′ and labeled using [5,6-3H]UTP as described (10.Goyer A. Illarionova V. Roje S. Fischer M. Bacher A. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An internal standard RNA was added to each sample before RT-PCR to estimate recoveries, which were 34-100%. Data were corrected for recovery. Insertional Mutant—An At2g32040 mutant (Salk 109024) was identified in the Salk Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) T-DNA insertion collection (40.Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N. Deen H. Geralt M. Hazari N. Hom E. Karnes M.

Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4091) Google Scholar). Wild type or homozygous mutant segregants were identified by PCR using gene-specific primers located 5′ or 3′ of the T-DNA insertion (At-s-5′ and At-s-3′, respectively) and the T-DNA-specific primer SalkLBb1. Genomic DNA was extracted as described (41.Goyer A. Collakova E. Díaz de la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Williamson J. Gregory III, J.F. Shachar-Hill Y. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26137-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The insertion site was confirmed by sequencing the amplicon from mutant homozygotes. Homozygous mutant and wild type segregants were selfed, and their progeny were used for experiments. Kanamycin resistance was shown to co-segregate with the At2g32040 mutation, indicating the absence of T-DNA insertions at other loci. Chloroplast Folate Analyses—Chloroplasts were prepared from the leaves of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants as described (42.Brock I.W. Hazell L. Michl D. Nielsen V.S. Moller B.L. Herrmann R.G.

Cytochem. 2004; 52: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Folates were extracted from samples (∼1 mg of chlorophyll), deglutamylated, affinity-purified, and determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection as described (41.Goyer A. Collakova E. Díaz de la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Williamson J. Gregory III, J.F. Shachar-Hill Y. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26137-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FBT Family Genes in Cyanobacteria and Plants—Blast searches of GenBank™ confirmed and extended the delineation of the FBT family given in the Pfam data base. Homologs of the Leishmania FT and BT1 transporters were found only in trypanosomatids, apicomplexans, Cyanobacteria, and plants. Cyanobacterial genomes have a single FBT gene specifying a highly conserved (≥56% identity) protein. In contrast, plant genomes encode several diverse FBT proteins, there being nine in Arabidopsis. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that one of these, At2g32040, clustered with Cyanobacteria, whereas the others fell into two groups of four each (see Supplemental Fig. 1, A and C). The At2g32040 protein shares 52-54% identity with the cyanobacterial proteins but differs in having an ∼90-residue N-terminal extension with the features of a plastid targeting peptide (44.Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Fig. 1C). The cyanobacterial and plant proteins have 12 predicted transmembrane α-helices, as illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1B for the Synechocystis slr0642 protein. Because trypanosomatids and apicomplexans have apparently acquired numerous genes from photosynthetic organisms (45.Hannaert V. Saavedra E. Duffieux F. Szikora J.P. Rigden D.J. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 46.Waller R.F. McConville M.J. McFadden G.I. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and plants acquired many genes from Cyanobacteria (47.Martin W. Rujan T. Richly E. Hansen A. Cornelsen S. Lins T. Leister D. Stoebe B. Hasegawa M. Penny D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12246-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), the cyanobacterial protein is potentially the archetype of the FBT family. We accordingly chose a representative cyanobacterial FBT protein, Synechocystis slr0642 (henceforth slr0642) for further study along with its close plant relative, Arabidopsis At2g32040 (henceforth At2g32040). Folate Uptake by E. coli Expressing slr0642 or At2g32040—Folates cannot normally cross the inner membrane of E. coli cells, preventing rescue of folate synthesis mutants by supplied folates (48.Green J.C. Nichols B.P. Matthews R.G. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 665-673Google Scholar). We, therefore, evaluated folate transport activity by expressing FBT constructs in a pabA pabB mutant, which is auxotrophic for pABA, and testing for growth on minimal medium with or without 5-CHO-THF or folic acid (the two most stable folates) in place of pABA. The mutant also harbored a plasmid bearing genes for three rare E. coli tRNAs (argU, ileY, leuW, corresponding to AT-rich codons); this plasmid was found to be needed to express At2g32040 constructs. The N-terminal extension that contains the predicted targeting peptide was removed from At2g32040 constructs, basing the truncation point (after residue 88) on alignments with slr0642 (see Supplemental Fig. 1C) and with orthologous plant sequences derived from ESTs (not shown). Because the truncated At2g32040 protein had a more hydrophilic N-terminal region than slr0642 and this region may affect membrane targeting or translation in E. coli (49.Facey S.J. Kuhn A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we also constructed a chimeric version in which residues 1-40 of the truncated protein were replaced by residues 1-37 of slr0642. After two passages on minimal medium plus or minus folate, the growth of mutant cells harboring the empty pLOI707HE vector ceased (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells expressing slr0642 continued to grow when given folates (Fig. 2A), showing that the latter are transported. The truncated At2g32040 did not confer the ability to grow on folates, but the chimeric version was effective (Fig. 2A). Cells expressing slr0642 or chimeric At2g32040 did not grow when 5-CHO-THF triglutamate replaced the monoglutamyl form (not shown), indicating that both transporters, like most other folate carriers, prefer monoglutamates (note, however, that the triglutamate approaches in size the exclusion limit of the outer membrane porins of E. coli, which may also have impeded uptake). Cells cured of their plasmids were not rescued by folates, confirming that the transport trait is plasmid-encoded. Although 5-CHO-THF and folic acid are relatively stable, some spontaneous breakdown is inevitable, releasing pABA-Glu. To rule out the possibility that the growth seen on folates was due to such release, we confirmed that pABA-Glu did not support growth of mutant cells expressing slr0642 or chimeric At2g32040 (not shown). Because E. coli cannot normally take up pABA-Glu but can utilize it once absorbed (50.Hussein M.J. Green J.M. Nichols B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this result further shows that neither protein is able to transport pABA-Glu. The results from the pabA pabB mutant were corroborated using a second mutant, a folE deletant, which lacks the first enzyme of the pteridine branch of folate synthesis (GTP cyclohydrolase I). This deletant could grow on rich medium supplemented with 5-CHO-THF when expressing slr0642 or chimeric At2g32040 but not when harboring the empty vector (Fig. 2B). The folE deletant could not be used to test slr0642 or At2g32040 for transport of dihydropteroate or dihydropterins (hydroxymethyldihydropterin, dihydropterin-6-aldehyde) as these compounds supported growth of deletant cells harboring the empty vector (not shown). Antifolate Uptake—The antifolates aminopterin and methotrexate are close structural analogs of folic acid, differing only in one and two groups, respectively (Fig. 1A). E. coli normally has little capacity to take up these compounds, and they are inhibitory only at high concentrations (50.Hussein M.J. Green J.M. Nichols B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Green J.M. Nichols B.P. Milstien S. Kapatos G. Levine R.A. Shane B. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines and Folates.

Among the proteins solubilized from the sperm mitochondrial capsule, we confirmed, by using a proteomic approach, the presence of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) as a major component, and we also identified the sperm mitochondrion-associated cysteine-rich protein (SMCP) and fragments/aggregates of specific keratins that previously escaped detection (Ursini, F., Heim, S., Kiess, M., Maiorino, M., Roveri, A., Wissing, J., and Flohé, L. (1999) Science 285, 1393-1396). The evidence for a functional association between PHGPx, SMCP, and keratins is further supported by the identification of a sequence motif of regularly spaced Cys-Cys doublets common to SMCP and high sulfur keratin-associated proteins, involved in bundling hair shaft keratin by disulfide cross-linking. Following the oxidative polymerization of mitochondrial capsule proteins, catalyzed by PHGPx, two-dimensional redox electrophoresis analysis showed homo- and heteropolymers of SMCP and PHGPx, together with other minor components. Adjacent cysteine residues in SMCP peptides are oxidized to cystine by PHGPx. This unusual disulfide is known to drive, by reshuffling oxidative protein folding. On this basis we propose that oxidative polymerization of the mitochondrial capsule is primed by the formation of cystine on SMCP, followed by reshuffling. Occurrence of reshuffling is further supported by the calculated thermodynamic gain of the process. This study suggests a new mechanism where selenium catalysis drives the cross-linking of structural elements of the cytoskeleton via the oxidation of a keratin-associated protein.

Occurrence of reshuffling is further supported by the calculated thermodynamic gain of the process. This study suggests a new mechanism where selenium catalysis drives the cross-linking of structural elements of the cytoskeleton via the oxidation of a keratin-associated protein. More than 3 decades ago, evidence that radioactive selenium is concentrated in rat sperm mid-piece (1.Brown D.G. Burk R.F. J. Nutr. 1973; 103: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and that severe selenium deficiency leads to male infertility (2.Wu S.H. Oldfield J.E. Whanger P.D. Weswig P.H. Biol. Reprod. 1973; 8: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) brought into focus the crucial role of this oligo-element in spermatogenesis. The pioneering studies of Calvin (3.Calvin H.I. J. Exp. Zool. 1978; 204: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Pallini and Bacci (4.Pallini V. Bacci E. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1979; 11: 165-170Google Scholar) show that selenium bound to a 15-21-kDa disulfide cross-linked protein is involved in the stabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane of mammalian sperm. The protein was identified as a major component of the keratinous external layer of sperm mitochondrion, the so-called mitochondrial capsule (MC) 3The abbreviations used are: MC, mitochondrial capsule; KAPs, keratin-associated proteins; MS, mass spectrometry; PHGPx, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; RSCP, reduced-solubilized capsule proteins; SMCP, sperm mitochondrion-associated cysteine-rich protein; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.3The abbreviations used are: MC, mitochondrial capsule; KAPs, keratin-associated proteins; MS, mass spectrometry; PHGPx, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; RSCP, reduced-solubilized capsule proteins; SMCP, sperm mitochondrion-associated cysteine-rich protein; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. in rat (5.Calvin H.I. Cooper G.W. Fawcett D.W. Bedford J.M. The Spermatozoon. Urban & Schwarzenberg, Inc., Baltimore1979: 135-140Google Scholar) and in bull (4.Pallini V. Bacci E. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1979; 11: 165-170Google Scholar), further confirming the structural role of selenium in spermatozoa (6.Calvin H.I. Cooper G.W. Wallace E. Gamete Res. 1981; 4: 139-149Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic overlapping of a cysteine-rich protein of the MC and radioactivity after in vivo 75Se labeling supported the identification of the cysteine-rich protein as a selenoprotein (4.Pallini V. Bacci E. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1979; 11: 165-170Google Scholar, 6.Calvin H.I. Cooper G.W. Wallace E. Gamete Res. 1981; 4: 139-149Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The protein was therefore first named “MC protein” and then “MC selenoprotein” when Karimpour et al. (7.Karimpour I. Cutler M. Shih D. Smith J. Kleene K.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), after the discovery that the co-translational selenocysteine insertion into protein requires an in-frame UGA codon (8.Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), described three in-frame UGA codons at the 5′ end of some mouse cDNA clones of the MC protein. It was later found that the open reading frame for the human protein does not contain any UGA codons, although the deduced protein shows a striking homology with the mouse protein, lying in repeated adjacent cysteine motif (9.Aho H. Schwemmer M. Tessman D. Murphy D. Mattei G. Engel W. Adham I.M. Genomics. 1996; 32: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was eventually clarified that the mouse protein as well does not contain any selenocysteine and that the previously described three UGAs are actually located in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA. The MC protein was then renamed “sperm mitochondrion-associated cysteine-rich protein” (SMCP) (10.Cataldo L. Baig K. Oko R. Mastrangelo M.A. Kleene K.C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 45: 320-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SMCP is expressed as a single gene product, mainly in the round spermatids of the testis seminiferous tubules (11.Adham I.M. Tessmann D. Soliman K.A. Murphy D. Kremling H. Szpirer C. Engel W. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The rat protein sequence contains 12 Cys-Cys doublets and an additional 10 single Cys residues. The issue of selenium content in the MC of spermatozoa was later clarified when a substantial amount of the selenoenzyme phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx; EC 1.11.1.12) was detected, in a cross-linked form, in rat sperm MC (12.Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohé L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). PHGPx is an active peroxidase in spermatids, and it becomes cross-linked and catalytically inactive in sperm MC. A thorough reduction of MC rescues active PHGPx, which catalyzes in vitro, in the presence of H2O2, the formation of aggregates, including all the MC proteins (12.Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohé L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 13.Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Maiorino M. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Among these, the polymerization of PHGPx has been positively detected (14.Mauri P. Benazzi L. Flohé L. Maiorino M. Pietta P.G. Pilawa S. Roveri A. Ursini F. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It takes place through the formation of a bond between selenium at the active site and cys 148 on the surface of the enzyme. This selena-disulfide bond is formed when the limited availability of reducing substrate prevents the completion of the catalytic cycle, and thus represents a dead end of the reaction. This “suicidal” activity of PHGPx, accounting for both protein thiol oxidation and selenoperoxidase moonlighting as a structural protein, was proposed as the mechanism of oxidative MC stabilization during spermatogenesis (12.Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohé L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 13.Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Maiorino M.

Although PHGPx-/- mice are lethal and could not be analyzed for fertility (16.Imai H. Hirao F. Sakamoto T. Sekine K. Mizukura Y. Saito M. Kitamoto T. Hayasaka M. Hanaoka K. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), some insight about physiological role of PHGPx has been obtained from silencing of the nuclear form of PHGPx, which contains and N-terminal nuclear addressing sequence, produced by an alternative transcription mechanism (17.Maiorino M. Scapin M. Ursini F. Biasolo M. Bosello V. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34286-34290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This model showed a higher sperm -SH content and transient head instability in the caudal and caput portion of the epididymis, respectively, thus proving PHGPx protein thiol peroxidase activity and structural role (18.Conrad M. Moreno S.G. Sinowatz F. Ursini F. Kolle S. Roveri A. Brielmeier M. Wurst W. Maiorino M. Bornkamm G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7637-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization in rat testis showed maximal PHGPx expression in the round spermatid layer (19.Maiorino M. Wissing J.B. Brigelius-Flohé R. Calabrese F. Roveri A. Steinert P. Ursini F. Flohé L. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). SMCP is also expressed in human and mouse haploid spermatid cells (9.Aho H. Schwemmer M. Tessman D. Murphy D. Mattei G. Engel W. Adham I.M. Genomics. 1996; 32: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mouse spermatozoa, a subcellular co-localization of PHGPx and SMCP in the mid-piece was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (20.Nayernia K. Diaconu M. Aumuller G. Wennemuth G. Schwandt I. Kleene K. Kuehn H. Engel W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2004; 67: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the specific function of the capsule remains unclear, a “protective” role seems realistic. Accordingly, silencing the gene coding for SMCP leads to infertility and asthenozoospermia in mice, although the phenotype is genetically background-sensitive and is observed only in some strains (21.Nayernia K. Adham I.M. Burkhardt-Gottges E. Neesen J. Rieche M. Wolf S. Sancken U. Kleene K. Engel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3046-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the deletion of a gene homologue of SMCP produces malformations of the axoneme and a drastic reduction in sperm motility (22.Kuhn R. Kuhn C. Borsch D. Glatzer K.H. Schafer U. Schafer M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 35: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar defects in the assembly of mid-piece and tail have been observed in mice where the expression of selenoprotein P, which delivers selenium to cells, was abolished (23.Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Nagdas S.K. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The co-localization of SMCP and PHGPx and the cysteine-rich nature of SMCP suggest a functional relationship, but in a previous proteomic approach, SMCP was not detected in MC (12.Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohé L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Therefore, by using different approaches, we decided to re-investigate the MC preparation and to clarify further the role of different proteins in the formation of the cross-linked network. Preparation of Rat Spermatozoa MC—Rat spermatozoa, obtained by squeezing the cauda epididymis and the vas deferens into phosphate-buffered saline, were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Sperm MC were prepared from spermatozoa as described by Calvin et al. (6.Calvin H.I. Cooper G.W. Wallace E. Gamete Res. 1981; 4: 139-149Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Preparation of Reduced-solubilized Capsule Proteins (RSCP)—The MCs were dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.7 μg/ml leupeptin hemisulfate, 6 m guanidine-HCl, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. Before use, small molecular weight reagents were eliminated by gel permeation chromatography repeated twice, on NAP-5 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and equilibrated with 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA. The sample was concentrated using an ultrafiltration cell equipped with a cut-off membrane of 10 kDa (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). SDS-PAGE—An MC preparation was thoroughly dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer at a concentration of 4 mg/ml, and 0.1 mg was loaded on each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (T = 14%). At the end of the run, the gel was stained in colloidal Coomassie Blue, and bands were cut and digested as reported below. In Vitro Polymerization—To 50 μg of RSCP, prepared as above, 50 μm hydrogen peroxide was added for 3 min, a time carefully calibrated in order to prevent formation of aggregates too large to be analyzed by two-dimensional redox electrophoresis. The reaction was stopped by adding sodium deoxycholate and trichloroacetic acid (0.012 and 6% (w/v), respectively). Proteins were precipitated at 4,500 × g for 15 min and washed with cold ethanol. Two-dimensional Redox Electrophoresis—The protein pellet obtained from RSCP was solubilized in 0.01 m ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8.1, and then diluted 1:1 with Laemmli sample buffer, where 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide was substituted for 2-mercaptoethanol (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205506) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional redox electrophoresis was performed according to Ref. 25.Traut R.R. Casiano C. Zecherle N. Creichton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 101-133Google Scholar. Enzymatic Fragmentation, Chromatographic and Mass Spectrometric Conditions, and Data Analysis—Bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, digested, and analyzed as reported previously (26.Maiorino M. Mauri P. Roveri A. Benazzi L. Toppo S. Bosello V. Ursini F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The same analytical procedure was used for detecting the redox transition in synthetic peptides used as reducing substrates for the PHGPx reaction. Before injection, the assay mixture (see below) was diluted 1:10 with 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Similarity Searches—A bioinformatics approach, using sequence and domain data base searches, was employed. The proteins were extracted from the NCBI nonredundant data base (27.Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Maglott D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 34-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the domain data bases Pfam (28.Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S.

Bioinformatics. 2002; 1: 107-108PubMed Google Scholar) tools with default E-value cut-offs. Putative true positive hits were extracted by taking into account the adjacent cysteine repeat motif to construct a multiple alignment centered in this region using T-COFFEE (35.Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). Proteins with a similar adjacent cysteine pattern repeat, which were annotated as hypothetical and/or lacked experimental evidence, were not considered. Manual editing was performed to keep differently spaced adjacent cysteine patterns in-frame, thus improving the alignment quality. The multiple alignment was prepared using CHROMA (www.lg.ndirect.co.uk/chroma/) (36.Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 845-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic Calculation—A structural model of the SMCP peptide PPKPCCPQKPP was built, and its energy was minimized in different oxidation states for the Cys residues. The initial model was built by assigning the (ϕ, Ψ) torsion angle combination with the highest propensity to each residue. These propensities were calculated from a data base of high resolution x-ray structures (37.Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B.R. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar). Two Ala-Cys-Ala peptides were added to simulate the various disulfide-bonding patterns, which were manually imposed and minimized in various combinations. The minimization protocol consisted of 2000 conjugate gradient local minimization steps using the CHARMM package (38.MacKerell J.A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J.C. Stote R. Straub J. Watanabe M. Wiorkiewicz-Kuczera J. Yin D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11417) Google Scholar). PHGPx Activity on SMCP-derived Peptides—Synthetic peptides were purchased from GenScript Corp. (www.genscript.com; Piscataway, NJ), HPLC-purified, and used as substrate for PHGPx. They were designed based on the rat/mouse SMCP sequence and contained one adjacent cysteine motif and no other cysteine residue. Before use, pig heart PHGPx (39.Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was treated for 30 min with 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol on ice and then equilibrated with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA, by a desalting column repeated twice (Micro Bio-Spin, Bio-Rad). The assay mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 100 μm peptide -SH groups, 1 mm EDTA, 0.8 μg/ml PHGPx as above, in a total volume of 1 ml. Reactions were started with 50 μm H2O2. The thiol and H2O2 content were measured in 100-μl aliquots, withdrawn every 15 s. For thiol quantification, aliquots were added to 0.9 ml of 0.14 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.15 m KCl. The 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-reactive material was quantified spectrophotometrically at 412 nm (ϵ = 13.6 cm-1 mm-1). For H2O2 quantification, the scopoletin/horseradish peroxidase method was used (13.Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Maiorino M. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated on the initial linear phase of the reaction. Role of Cys-Cys Flanking Residues—Five peptides were designed based on the frequency of the Cys-Cys flanking residues in each of the corresponding positions of the rat/mouse/human SMCP sequence (see Fig. 6). The reference peptide, -PKPPCCPPKP-, contained the most frequent Cys-Cys flanking residues. In the second peptide, -PPPPCCPPPP-, the second most frequent amino acid of rat/mouse/human SMCP replaced corresponding positions for each Lys residue. The third peptide, -KKSQCCQQKT-, was designed by substituting each Pro residue with the second most frequent residue. In this peptide, the C-terminal Cys was substituted with the third most represented, in order to avoid the bias of introducing another Cys. The effect of the sequence length on PHGPx activity was evaluated by deleting one or two N- and C-terminal residues from the reference peptide. Peptides were purchased and tested as donor substrates for PHGPx, as described above. Composition of Rat Sperm MC—The SEQUEST analysis of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS data of the tryptic digest of major SDS-PAGE separated bands of sperm MC nonambiguously identified the peptides reported in Fig. 1. Bands 6, 4, and 2 contained PHGPx, SMCP, and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 2, respectively. This pattern of major bands was highly reproducible, and the presence of minor components/contaminants could only be detected by a non-gel two-dimensional proteomics approach (see below). The identification of bands containing intact PHGPx and SMCP was further corroborated by Western blotting and migration of recombinant SMCP. 4M. Maiorino, A. Roveri, L. Benazzi, V. Bosello, P. Mauri, S. Toppo, S. C. E. Tosatto, and F. Ursini, unpublished results. As known from previous experience, in the case of SMCP the molecular weight calculated from electrophoretic mobility results higher than the actual molecular size (15.1 kDa), apparently because of the nonglobular structure. The electrophoretic migration of VDAC 2 roughly corresponded to the expected molecular size. The coverage of the sequence by mass spectrometry (MS) of the tryptic fragments exceeded 70% for all the proteins except SMCP, which in this case was restricted to the C terminus (amino acids 111-143). Band number 1 at the top of the gel contained peptides of keratin complex 1, acidic. For this protein of 44 kDa, there was no correspondence between electrophoretic migration and molecular size. A lack of correspondence was also observed in the following: (i) smeared band number 5, which contained peptides of both SMCP and PHGPx; and (ii) band number 7, which contained peptides of keratin kb1, type II (65 kDa), keratin k5 (94 kDa), and SMCP. Peptide composition of band number 3, containing sequences of the nonannotated open reading frame, did not allow the identification of any known protein. An exhaustive treatment of MC by 2-mercaptoethanol and guanidine released a series of soluble proteins here referred to as RSCP. The SDS-PAGE pattern of this material is similar to the above pattern of intact MC. The notable differences were the absence of aggregated keratin complex 1, acidic (band number 1), heterogeneous band number 5, and a less intense band number 7, containing fragments of keratins and SMCP (not shown). A non-gel two-dimensional HPLC-MS/MS (40.Mauri P.L. Scarpa A. Nascimbeni A.C. Benazzi L. Parmagnani E. Mafficini A. Della Peruta M. Bassi C. Miyazaki K. Sorio C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1125-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) analysis was also carried out on tryptic peptides released from RSCP. The above protein composition pattern was fully confirmed by this approach, although additional fragments were also detected, indicating the presence of variable minor amounts of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, testis fatty acid-binding protein, and carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase I (not shown). Similarity between SMCP and the KAP Superfamily—A bioinformatics search against the nonredundant protein data base using SMCP of rat (GenBank™ accession number Q64298), mouse (GenBank™ accession number P15265), and human (GenBank™ accession number P49901) as queries, by disabling the low complexity filters in a simple BLAST search, yielded a consistent amount of hits. These hits showed a peculiar conservation of regularly spaced adjacent cysteine patterns. The observed interval among the Cys-Cys motifs ranges from 3 to 8 residues, and most of the hits came from the superfamily of KAPs, especially from ultra-high sulfur KAP4, KAP5, and KAP9 (Fig. 2). Analysis of the adjacent cysteine flanking residues in both KAP and SMCP revealed the prevalence of Pro, charged and hydrophilic residues. Oxidative Cross-linking of PHGPx and SMCP—RSCPs are polymerized in the presence of H2O2, and this reaction, catalyzed by the PHGPx activity within the sample, results in aggregates of a molecular weight high enough to prevent electrophoretic analysis and separation (13.Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Maiorino M. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To address the issue of the intermediates of this oxidative polymerization, we planned an experiment where the presence of inter- and intra-chain disulfides was searched by two-dimensional redox electrophoresis (25.Traut R.R. Casiano C. Zecherle N. Creichton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 101-133Google Scholar) on RSCP only partially polymerized (Fig. 3). The spots on the left side of the corresponding monomeric proteins indicated the presence of polymers of PHGPx and SMCP, whereas vertically aligned spots indicated heterogeneous polymers of PHGPx, SMCP, and other proteins. PHGPx Catalyzes the Formation of Cystine Residues from SMCP Adjacent Cysteine Motifs—The observed disulfide-dependent polymers of SMCP and PHGPx, the presence of adjacent cysteine repeats in SMCP together with the notion that disulfides between adjacent cysteine residues are prone to reshuffling (41.Park C. Raines R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 42.Cemazar M. Zahariev S. Lopez J.J. Carugo O. Jones J.A. Hore P.J. Pongor S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5754-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), brought to focus the hypothesis that the selenoperoxidase could be the catalyst for the formation of a cystine between SMCP adjacent cysteine residues. To verify this hypothesis, synthetic peptides from rat and mouse sequences bearing one adjacent cysteine motif were tested, as reducing substrates of PHGPx. Data reported in TABLE ONE demonstrate that adjacent cysteine residues of the different SMCP peptides are actually substrates for PHGPx, specific activity ranging from 13 to 42 μmol of thiol oxidized per min/mg of protein. Remarkably, under the same experimental conditions, the activity on peptides was higher than on glutathione for all peptides. The expected stoichiometry of 2 eq of thiol/mol of hydroperoxide was observed. Fig. 4 reports the actual time course of the reaction for the peptide PPKPCCPQKPP, among the longest SMCP peptides containing one Cys-Cys doublet and no other Cys residue in the mouse sequence. In this case, as for some other peptides, the reaction did not reach completeness. This aspect, related to the final equilibrium of the reaction and the possible formation of dead-end intermediates, was not further investigated.TABLE ONEPHGPx activity on adjacent cysteine residues SMCP peptides from rat and mouse have been selected as those not presenting any Cys in the four Cys-Cys motif-flanking residues. PHGPx specific activity with glutathione, used at the peptide -SH concentration, was 13.1 μmol/min/mg protein. Results were reproducible with a variability of less than 5%.

https://openalex.org/W2116944379,"The beneficial effects of statins are usually assumed to stem from their ability to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis. However, because statins are potent inhibitors of the mevalonate, which governs diverse cell signaling pathways, inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase may also result in pleiotropic effects. The present study describes a novel pleiotropic effect of statins on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) hyperpermeability. Using live cell imaging with green fluorescent protein-tagged myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) and correlative biochemical analyses, we investigated 1) VEGF signaling pathway leading to GEnC hyperpermeability and 2) the modulatory effects of statins on VEGF signaling. Our findings indicate that VEGF stimulation elicits a robust increase in GEnC permeability. The signaling pathway that mediates VEGF-induced GEnC hyperpermeability involves RhoA activation leading to actin cytoskeletal remodeling, MLC diphosphorylation, and enhanced paracellular gap formation. Remarkably, cotreatment of endothelial cells with simvastatin, a hydrophobic statin, reversed VEGF-induced GEnC hyperpermeability by preventing MLC diphosphorylation, and cytoskeletal remodeling. In summary, this study identifies RhoA and MLC phosphorylation as key mediators of VEGF-induced endothelial cell hyperpermeability and demonstrates the modulatory effects of statins on VEGF signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1982821163,"Quasars are thought to be powered by the infall of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the centre of massive galaxies. As the optical luminosity of quasars exceeds that of their host galaxy, disentangling the two components can be difficult. This led in the 1990's to the controversial claim of the discovery of 'naked' quasars. Since then, the connection between quasars and galaxies has been well established. Here we report on the observation of a quasar lying at the edge of a gas cloud, whose size is comparable to that of a small galaxy, but whose spectrum shows no evidence for stars. The gas cloud is excited by the quasar itself. If a host galaxy is present, it is at least six times fainter than would normally be expected for such a bright quasar. The quasar is interacting dynamically with a neighbouring galaxy - which matter might be feeding the black hole."
https://openalex.org/W1988928606,"We have previously shown that Phe120, Glu216, and Asp301 in the active site of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) play a key role in substrate recognition by this important drug-metabolizing enzyme (Paine, M. J., McLaughlin, L. A., Flanagan, J. U., Kemp, C. A., Sutcliffe, M. J., Roberts, G. C., and Wolf, C. R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 4021–4027 and Flanagan, J. U., Maréchal, J.-D., Ward, R., Kemp, C.

We have now examined the effect of mutations of these residues on interactions of the enzyme with the prototypical CYP2D6 inhibitor, quinidine. Abolition of the negative charge at either or both residues 216 and 301 decreased quinidine inhibition of bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation by at least 100-fold. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for quinidine binding to the wild-type enzyme and the E216D and D301E mutants were 0.25–0.50 μm. The amide substitution of Glu216 or Asp301 resulted in 30–64-fold increases in the Kd for quinidine. The double mutant E216Q/D301Q showed the largest decrease in quinidine affinity, with a Kd of 65 μm. Alanine substitution of Phe120, Phe481,or Phe483 had only a minor effect on the inhibition of bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation and on binding. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, a number of the mutants studied were found to be able to metabolize quinidine. E216F produced O-demethylated quinidine, and F120A and E216Q/D301Q produced both O-demethylated quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine metabolites. Homology modeling and molecular docking were used to predict the modes of quinidine binding to the wild-type and mutant enzymes; these were able to rationalize the experimental observations.

Human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) 4The abbreviations used are: CYP2D6, cytochrome P450 2D6; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.4The abbreviations used are: CYP2D6, cytochrome P450 2D6; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. plays a central role in drug metabolism, metabolizing >30% of the most commonly prescribed drugs (1.Jones B.C. Tyman C.A. Smith D.A. Xenobiotica. 1997; 27: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, leading to wide interindividual and ethnic differences in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism (2.Mahgoub A. Idle J.R. Dring L.G. Lancaster R. Smith R.L. Lancet. 1977; 2: 584-586Abstract PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 3.Eichelbaum M. Spannbrucker N. Steincke B. Dengler H.J. Eur. J. Clin.

Cytochrome P450-drug and drug-drug interactions involving CYP2D6 ligands are thus a prime consideration in the development of new drugs, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the factors that govern the substrate specificity of this enzyme. Quinidine is not metabolized by CYP2D6 and has long been established as a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (5.von Bahr C. Spina E. Birgersson C. Ericsson O. Goransson M. Henthorn T.

The fact that quinidine is an inhibitor rather than a substrate is intriguing because it produces a classical type I binding spectrum with CYP2D6 (10.Hayhurst G.P. Harlow J. Chowdry J. Gross E. Hilton E. Lennard M.S. Tucker G.T. Ellis S.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that is usually associated with the binding of substrate molecules (11.Schenkman J.B. Sligar S.G. Cinti D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1981; 12: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, quinidine possesses a number of features normally associated with CYP2D6 substrates, including a basic nitrogen atom, a flat hydrophobic region, and a negative molecular electrostatic potential (12.Strobl G.R. von Kruedener S. Stockigt J. Guengerich F.P. Wolff T. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Studies of the relationship between structure and inhibitory activity for quinidine and its (less potent) stereoisomer quinine have been reported (13.Hutzler J.M. Walker G.S. Wienkers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the protein-ligand interactions that are responsible for the fact that quinidine can bind tightly, but not in an orientation favorable for catalysis, have not hitherto been established. Recent models of the active site of CYP2D6 (e.g. Ref. 14.Kirton S.B. Kemp C.A. Tomkinson N.P. St. Gallay S. Sutcliffe M.J. Proteins. 2002; 49: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggest that two carboxylate groups (at Glu216 and Asp301) may play key roles in the recognition of substrates containing a basic nitrogen atom, and support for this has come from mutagenesis experiments (15.Ellis S.W.

Here, we describe studies of a series of mutants of these five residues aimed at investigating their role in quinidine binding and in determining whether quinidine is a substrate or an inhibitor of this important drug-metabolizing enzyme. Materials—Terrific broth, chloramphenicol, dithiothreitol, glucose 6-phosphate, NADP+, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium dithionite, cytochrome c, and quinidine were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). Ampicillin was obtained from Beecham Research (Welwyn Garden City, UK), isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and δ-aminolevulinic acid from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, UK), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (type VII) from Roche Applied Science (Lewes, UK). HPLC-grade solvents were from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, UK), and Agilent HPLC columns were from Crawford Scientific (Lanarkshire, Scotland, UK). DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK) and Promega Corp. (Southampton, UK). Bufuralol, 1′-hydroxybufuralol, and (3S)-3′-hydroxyquinidine were purchased from Ultrafine Chemicals (Manchester, UK). Quinidine N-oxide was a kind gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme (Harlow, UK). All other chemicals were from BDH (Poole). Library efficient competent Escherichia coli strain JM109 was purchased from Promega Corp. Mutagenesis and Expression in E. coli—The Glu216 and Asp301 mutants of CYP2D6 used in this study were constructed and expressed in E. coli along with human cytochrome P450 reductase as described previously (17.Paine M.J. McLaughlin L.A. Flanagan J.U. Kemp C.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Roberts G.C. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4021-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To obtain the remaining mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was performed following the single-stranded DNA template method (20.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) using pB81 as a template and the dut- ung- E. coli strain CJ236 along with an appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotide: F120A, 3′-ata gcg cgc cag agc cac ccc ttg gga-5′; F481A, 3′-cac cag gaa agc agc gac acc atg gtg-5′; and F483A, 3′-cac cag gaa agc agc gac acc atg gtg-5′. Note that the oligonucleotide sequences are reverse-complemented. Once the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing, the mutants were coexpressed with human cytochrome P450 reductase as described above. Varying quantities of cytochrome P420, reflecting different degrees of stability in the presence of dithionite, were observed for the different mutants. E216Q, D301E, D301Q, F481A, and F483A had P450:P420 peak area ratios of ∼9:1; E216N, E216Q/D301Q, and F120A had ratios of ∼1:1; and E216F, E216A, and D301N had ratios of ∼1:5. Quinidine Inhibition of Bufuralol 1′-Hydroxylation and Dextromethorphan O-Demethylation—Incubations were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C with shaking in 300 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing E. coli membranes equivalent to 10 pmol of CYP2D6 (wild-type or mutant), quinidine (0, 1, 10, or 100 μm), an NADPH-generating system (comprising 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 1 mm NADP+), and bufuralol or dextromethorphan at concentrations equivalent to the Km of each sample. The specific substrate concentrations used were as follows: CYP2D6, 1.1 μm bufuralol and 2.6 μm dextromethorphan; E216Q, 188 μm bufuralol and 51 μm dextromethorphan; E216D, 6 μm bufuralol and 13 μm dextromethorphan; E216F, 117 μm bufuralol and 30 μm dextromethorphan; E216A, 162 μm bufuralol and 63 μm dextromethorphan; E216K, 187 μm bufuralol and 312 μm dextromethorphan; D301E, 2 μm bufuralol and 11 μm dextromethorphan; D301Q, 142 μm bufuralol and 200 μm dextromethorphan; D301N, 160 μm bufuralol and 3598 μm dextromethorphan; E216Q/D301Q, 522 μm bufuralol and 438 μm dextromethorphan; F120A, 2.7 μm bufuralol and 1 μm dextromethorphan; F481A, 10 μm bufuralol and 11 μm dextromethorphan; F483A, 7.1 μm bufuralol and 9.5 μm dextromethorphan. After a 3-min preincubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and were allowed to proceed for 6 min before being stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 60% perchloric acid. 100-μl aliquots of the reaction supernatant were used for HPLC, separating the bufuralol and dextromethorphan metabolites as described previously (17.Paine M.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4021-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 HPLC system and ChemStation software. As reported previously (17.Paine M.J. McLaughlin L.A. Flanagan J.U. Kemp C.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Roberts G.C. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4021-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21.Flanagan J.U. Maréchal J.-D. Ward R. Kemp C.A. McLaughlin L.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Roberts G.C. Paine M.J. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 353-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the only significant decrease in activity for the mutants relative to the wild-type enzyme in the absence of inhibitor was for dextromethorphan O-demethylation by E216Q (∼4-fold) and E216K (∼10-fold). Quinidine Metabolism—To investigate quinidine metabolism, reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm quinidine, E. coli membranes equivalent to 10 pmol of CYP2D6 (wild-type or mutant) and an NADPH-generating system (as described above) in a total volume of 200 μl. After a 3-min preincubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and incubated for an additional 15 min before being stopped with 100 μl of ice-cold methanol. Samples were left on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using a Hypersil BDS-C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Mobile phases of acetonitrile (solvent A) and sodium perchlorate/perchloric acid (14.05 g of sodium perchlorate and 1.6 ml of 60% perchloric acid dissolved in 5 liters of distilled H2O; solvent B) were mixed at a constant ratio of 15% solvent A to 85% solvent B (v/v) for the first 5 min, and then a linear gradient was applied over 4 min, ending at 31% solvent A to 69% solvent B (v/v), which was maintained for an additional 7 min. The retention times of (3S)-3′-hydroxyquinidine and quinidine N-oxide were established using authentic metabolite standards, with fluorescence detection at λex = 252 nm and λem = 302 nm. Identification of the Novel Quinidine Metabolite—Further analysis of the novel quinidine metabolite was undertaken by HPLC with mass spectrometric detection. 25 μl of the stopped incubation mixture was separated on a Luna C18 column (3 μm, 150 × 2 mm; Phenomenex, Cheshire, UK) with a linear gradient of 5 mm ammonium formate (pH 3.5) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) delivered by a Waters 2795 separations module. The gradient ran from 5 to 30% solvent A over 20 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min before returning to the starting conditions. The eluent was introduced into the source of a Quattro micro mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) and was ionized by electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The main parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.3 kV; cone voltage, 30 V; source and desolvation temperatures, 100 and 300 °C, respectively; and cone and desolvation nitrogen gas flows, 90 and 300 liters/h-1, respectively. In collision-induced dissociation experiments, argon was used as the collision gas with a collision energy of 30 eV. Data were acquired and analyzed by MassLynx software. Quinidine Binding—Quinidine binding was measured by optical difference spectroscopy of E. coli membranes containing CYP2D6 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) using a Cary 4000 UV-visible spectrophotometer. E. coli membranes containing wild-type or mutant CYP2D6 enzymes were diluted in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 0.5 μm cytochrome P450 and split into two matched black-walled quartz cuvettes. After running a base line, 1-μl aliquots of quinidine dissolved in deionized water were added to the sample cuvette, and equal volumes of water were added to the reference cuvette. The samples were left for 2 min between additions to equilibrate, and the difference spectrum was then run between 360 and 460 nm. The final volume of additions was kept to <2.5% of the total volume. Changes in absorbance as a function of quinidine concentration, at wavelengths selected on the basis of the spectral characteristics of the individual sample, were used to calculate binding constants using nonlinear regression analysis (Prism). Spectral determinations were performed at least twice for each mutant and found to be reproducible with respect to the spectral profile and the position of λmax and λmin. Modeling and Molecular Docking—Homology modeling and molecular docking were used to predict the modes of quinidine binding to wild-type and mutant enzymes. The homology model of CYP2D6 was produced as described previously (14.Kirton S.B. Kemp C.A. Tomkinson N.P. St. Gallay S. Sutcliffe M.J. Proteins. 2002; 49: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, the model was produced using the comparative modeling program Modeler (22.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) with five structural templates: cytochromes P450cam (23.Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol.

Biochem. 2000; 81: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Model structures for mutants E216F, E216Q/D301Q, and F120A were generated by replacing residues within SYBYL (28.Clark M. Cramer Spaceiiiqq R.D. Van Opdenbosch N. J. Comp. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) and optimizing the positions of the new side chains with the rest of the protein held fixed. (Minimizations of atoms in a 10-Å sphere around the mutated residue produced no noticeable changes; these results were therefore discarded.) Docking studies were performed using the program GOLD (version 2.2) (29.Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar) with the ChemScore fitness function (30.Eldridge M.D. Murray C.W. Auton T.R. Paolini G.V. Mee R.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

The orientations were ranked according to the value of the ChemScore fitness function. In addition “tethered” dockings were performed by applying constraints to the distances between the O-methyl group and 3-carbon atom of quinidine and the heme iron and between the basic nitrogen atom of quinidine and the carboxyl group of Glu216 (see TABLE TWO for details of the tethered dockings used). The docked energy of a solution that positioned the tethered groups farther than 4.5 Å apart was penalized, the size of the penalty being determined using a harmonic force constant of 5.0 kJ·mol-1·Å-2.TABLE TWOChemScore values of the best solutions for quinidine docking into wild-type and mutant CYP2D6 modelsModel and docking typeChemScore value of best ranked docked quinidine solutionConstraint energy of tetherFe–X distanceaDistance from the heme iron to the nearest non-hydrogen atom in quinidineCorresponding metabolismbBased on an Fe–X distance of up to 5 ÅkJ·mol–1kJ·mol–1ÅWild-type CYP2D6OxygenatedcDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–39.0None6.5NoneDeoxygenateddDocking into protein containing deoxygenated (i.e. type I-like) heme iron–39.0None5.3None3-Carbon tethercDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–36.30.84.83-HydroxylationO-Methyl tethercDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–31.70.04.3O-DemethylationNH+–Glu216 tethercDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–30.00.37.8NoneF120A–37.1eBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueNoneeBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore value6.5eBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueNoneeBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore value (3-hydroxylationfA solution in this cluster with a lower ChemScore value (–33.0 kJ·mol–1) is compatible with 3-hydroxylation)OxygenatedcDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–37.0gBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore valueNonegBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore value4.6gBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore valueO-DemethylationgBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore valueE216F–37.8eBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueNoneeBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore value4.3eBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore value1′-HydroxylationeBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueOxygenatedcDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–37.2gBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore valueNonegBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore value4.8gBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore valueO-DemethylationgBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore value3-Carbon tethercDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–33.01.35.03-HydroxylationE216Q/D301QOxygenatedcDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–34.6eBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueNoneeBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore value5.5eBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueNoneeBest ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valueO-Methyl tethercDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–27.80.14.7O-Demethylation3-Carbon tethercDocking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme iron–30.21.15.03-Hydroxylationa Distance from the heme iron to the nearest non-hydrogen atom in quinidineb Based on an Fe–X distance of up to 5 Åc Docking into protein containing oxygenated (i.e. compound I-like) heme irond Docking into protein containing deoxygenated (i.e. type I-like) heme irone Best ranked quinidine in the cluster with the lowest ChemScore valuef A solution in this cluster with a lower ChemScore value (–33.0 kJ·mol–1) is compatible with 3-hydroxylationg Best ranked quinidine in the cluster with the second lowest ChemScore value Open table in a new tab Inhibition of CYP2D6 Mutants by Quinidine—We investigated the effects of mutations of the active-site residues Phe120, Glu216, Asp301, Phe481, and Phe483 on the inhibition of CYP2D6 activity by quinidine. The inhibition profile of a panel of 12 mutants was examined by measuring bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation in the presence of 1, 10, or 100 μm quinidine (Fig. 1). Many of these mutants affect substrate binding; so, to isolate the effects of the mutations on quinidine inhibition, the substrate concentrations used were chosen to be equal to the measured Km for each specific mutant (17.Paine M.J.

(The concentrations used are given under “Experimental Procedures.”) For the wild-type enzyme under the conditions of this assay, the lowest concentration of quinidine used (1 μm) led to >95% inhibition of both bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation. It is clear that the negative charges at Glu216 and Asp301 are important for the inhibitory effect of quinidine. The conservative substitutions E216D and D301E showed behavior similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, with >90% inhibition by 1 μm quinidine, whereas enzymes with non-conservative replacements were at least 50% active at 10 μm quinidine. The double mutant E216Q/D301Q, with complete removal of the charge but not the polarity, was found to be strikingly insensitive to inhibition by quinidine, retaining 80% of its bufuralol 1′-hydroxylase activity and 85% of its dextromethorphan O-demethylase activity in the presence of 100 μm quinidine. By contrast, alanine substitution of the aromatic side chain of Phe120, Phe481, or Phe483 had only a minor effect on the inhibition of catalytic activity by quinidine. The effects of the mutations were generally similar for quinidine inhibition of both bufuralol 1′-hydroxylase and dextromethorphan O-demethylase activities, although for most of the mutants, quinidine was found to be a somewhat better inhibitor with respect to dextromethorphan compared with bufuralol. These observations suggest that the negative charges at Glu216 and Asp301, but not the aromatic rings of the three phenylalanine residues, are important for the binding of quinidine; this is broadly consistent with the effects of mutation of these residues on the Km values of substrates containing a basic nitrogen atom (10.Hayhurst G.P.

Quinidine Binding to the Glu216 and Asp301 Mutants—The effects of the mutations on quinidine binding were determined directly by measuring optical difference spectra upon addition of quinidine to bacterial membranes expressing cytochrome P450. Wild-type CYP2D6 showed a type I binding spectrum upon quinidine addition, with λmax and λmin of ∼420 and ∼390 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A), characteristic of the change from a low to high spin state of the ferric iron that is usually associated with the binding of substrate molecules (11.Schenkman J.B. Sligar S.G. Cinti D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1981; 12: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). None of the mutants showed evidence of a type II spectrum, characteristic of direct coordination to the heme iron. The majority showed type I difference spectra (Fig. 2A) or variations thereof (Fig. 2C), but three showed a different form of spectrum with an increase in absorbance at shorter wavelengths (Fig. 2B), suggesting either a change in the heme environment or light scattering from membrane or protein aggregation. 5The difference spectra reported here for quinidine binding to the E216Q and E216A mutants appear to be different from those reported by Guengerich et al.

https://openalex.org/W1993628564,"The MAPK signal-integrating kinases Mnk1 and Mnk2 are closely related but show marked differences in their basal activities and regulation. Both possess, within their C termini, motifs for binding to MAPKs, although these differ between Mnk1 and Mnk2. Mnk2 shows much higher activity in unstimulated cells than Mnk1, whose activity is greatly increased, e.g. by stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Such increases are sensitive to blockade of that pathway, whereas the activation state of Mnk2 is relatively insensitive to inhibition of upstream signaling. Here we have studied the roles of features in their catalytic domains and C termini in determining their regulatory properties and basal activities. Mnk2 can bind to phosphorylated, active ERK, whereas Mnk1 cannot. Such binding apparently protects ERK against dephosphorylation and inactivation. The high basal activity of Mnk2 and its binding to (phospho)ERK requires features both of the catalytic domain and of the C terminus. For example, within the catalytic region an aspartate in Mnk2 plays a key role. Mutation to alanine inactivates Mnk2. In the C terminus, features within the MAPK-binding motif and to either side of it, including potential phosphorylation sites, affect MAPK binding and activity. The association of Mnks with the scaffold protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4G is negatively modulated by Mnk activity.

This protein binds the 5′-terminal cap structure found on cytoplasmic mRNA and recruits other translation factors, and the 40 S ribosomal subunit, to the mRNA. Phosphorylation of eIF4E alters its affinity for capped mRNA (7Scheper G.C. van Kollenburg B. Hu J. Luo Y. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

In human, each gives rise to at least two distinct proteins, with different C termini, as a consequence of alternative splicing (4Scheper G.C. Parra J.-L. Wilson M.L. van Kollenburg B.

The longer forms of human Mnk1 and Mnk2, referred to as Mnk1a and Mnk2a, possess a MAPK-binding motif that is absent from the shorter isoforms Mnk1b and Mnk2b. The longer forms correspond to those first discovered by Fukunaga and Hunter and by Waskiewicz et al. (1Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The corresponding murine proteins are simply termed Mnk1 and Mnk2, as no short forms have yet been identified in mice. Mnk1 has a low basal activity but in mammalian cells is highly activated following cellular stimulation. Its MAPK-binding motif can bind either ERK or p38 MAPK. Mnk1a is activated by treatments that stimulate either pathway and its activation is eliminated by compounds that block ERK or p38 MAPK signaling (3Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Scheper G.C. Parra J.-L. Wilson M.L. van Kollenburg B. Vertegaal A.C.O. Han Z.-G. Proud C.G. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mnk2 shows a very high basal activity in serum-starved cells that does not significantly increase upon activation of ERK by phorbol esters. Furthermore, the compounds PD98059 and SB203580 (which inhibit MEK and p38 MAPK, respectively) had little effect on Mnk2 activity (3Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Scheper G.C. Parra J.-L. Wilson M.L. van Kollenburg B. Vertegaal A.C.O. Han Z.-G. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5692-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mnk1 possesses a MAPK-binding domain that allows it to bind ERK and p38 MAPK, but not JNK (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Mnk2a is reported to bind preferentially to ERK, rather than to p38 MAPK, and not to JNK (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In vitro Mnk2a is much more effectively activated by ERK than p38 MAPK (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 3Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31588-31593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, Mnk2/2a has high basal activity, whereas Mnk1/1a has low basal activity that is stimulated by the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways. MAPKs such as ERK possess a common binding site through which they interact with their activators (e.g. MEK) and substrates (such as RSK and the Mnks) (14Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). It is also through this region that they bind the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) that dephosphorylate and inactivate MAPKs (14Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The MAPKs phosphorylate Thr-Pro sites in the T-loop of Mnk1. Phosphorylation of residues within the T-loop (between subdomains VII and VIII) of protein kinases generally leads to their activation (15Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the mutation of these residues to Ala abolishes the activation of the Mnks by ERK or p38 MAPK (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 3Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, there are potentially important differences in the amino acid sequences within the T-loop regions of Mnk1 and Mnk2. To phosphorylate eIF4E the Mnks must bind eIF4G (16Parra-Palau J.L. Scheper G.C. Wilson M.L. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44197-44204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that phosphorylation of Mnk1 by caspase-activated Pak2/γ-PAK inhibits the phosphorylation of Mnk1 and its interaction with eIF4G (18Orton K.C. Ling J. Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Merrick W.C. Korneeva N.L. Rhoads R.E. Sonenberg N. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38649-38657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the basis of this effect was not clear. Also, previous data showed that the Mnks dissociate from eIF4G after TPA stimulation (3Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, in vivo, the mechanisms that regulate the interaction with the scaffolding protein eIF4G may regulate the ability of the Mnks to phosphorylate their best-known substrate, eIF4E. It is clearly important to understand what features explain the marked differences in activity between Mnk1 and Mnk2, and what underlies the modulation of their association with eIF4G. Here, we have studied features in the C termini and catalytic domains of Mnk1 and Mnk2 that may explain differences in their activity and regulation, and affect their binding to eIF4G. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation of the DNA in N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES)-buffered saline, pH 6.96, with cells at a density of ∼6 × 105 to 8 × 105 per 6-cm plate or 1.5 × 106 to 2 × 106 per 10-cm plate. PD98059 and SB203580 (both from Calbiochem) were used at final concentrations of 50 and 10 μm, respectively. Cell Harvesting—After treatments, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 400 μl of harvesting buffer (20 mm HEPES·KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). Cell debris and nuclei were spun down for 1 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Immunoprecipitation—For anti-Myc immunoprecipitations, 2 μl of antibody was added to cell extracts, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein G beads (20 μl of packed beads per immunoprecipitation) in wash buffer (harvesting buffer without Triton X-100) were added and allowed to bind the antibody for an additional hour at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of wash buffer and finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For detection of Mnk-bound eIF4G, cells were harvested in 10 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and proteinase inhibitors as above. The incubations with the antibody and protein G and the subsequent wash steps were carried out with the same buffer. Kinase Assays—Five-microliter aliquots of the beads with bound Myc fusion proteins, obtained as described above, were incubated in a total volume of 30 μl in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 ng of recombinant eIF4E for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating the sample for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Isoelectric Focusing—Endogenous eIF4E was purified by m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography, separated into phosphorylated and dephosphorylated species by isoelectric focusing, and detected by Western blotting as described previously (12Slentz-Kesler K. Moore J.T. Lombard M. Zhang J. Hollingsworth R. Weiner M.P. Genomics. 2000; 69: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Plasmids—pCS3MT Mnk1 has been described previously (22Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Mutations in pCS3MT Mnk1 or pCS3MT Mnk2 that change residues Ser191 to Ala or Asp; Asp191 to Ala or Asn; Ser384 to Ala, Glu, Gln, or Lys; Ser387 to Ala or Asp; LARRR to LAQRR; LAQRR to LARRR; and the Gln397 → Ala, Ala397 → Gln, Leu398 → Arg, Arg398 → Leu, Ser399 → Ala, and Ser401 → Ala mutations were created using the QuikChange® kit from Stratagene. The Mnk1-C2 and Mnk2-C1 mutations were created by introducing a SacI restriction site at position Glu364 in pCS3MT Mnk1 and pCS3MT Mnk2 using the QuikChange® kit from Stratagene. Then double digestion with SacI-HindIII was performed, and the sequences corresponding to the C terminus were swapped between both plasmids. DNA sequencing was performed by the Sequencing Service (School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland (available at www.dnaseq.co.uk)) using a DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Amersham Biosciences) on Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers. Antibodies—Total protein and phosphospecific antibodies for Mnk, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody was raised against recombinant human eIF4E (in collaboration with Dr. Borek Vojtesek, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic), and the tissue culture supernatant was used for Western blotting following isoelectric focusing. Dr. Simon Morley (University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom) kindly provided the eIF4G antibody. In Vitro Labeling and Peptide Mapping—These procedures were performed as described previously (12Slentz-Kesler K. Moore J.T. Lombard M. Zhang J. Hollingsworth R. Weiner M.P. Genomics. 2000; 69: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The C Termini of Mnk1 and Mnk2 Partially Explain the Differences in Their Activity—The mouse proteins Mnk1 and Mnk2, which correspond to the human Mnk1a and Mnk2a, were used in this study. Previous work (3Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) using the mouse Mnks showed that, in HEK 293 cells, Mnk2 exhibit higher basal activity than Mnk1. Unlike Mnk2, Mnk1 activity is greatly enhanced by treating cells with agents that activate upstream signaling pathways ERK and p38 MAPK (5Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L.J. Vries R.G. Baines I.A. Cooper J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A major objective of this study was to identify the features of Mnk2 that explain its higher basal activity compared with Mnk1 and, in particular, of the high basal activity of the former enzyme (which can be seen in Fig. 1C, top section). Although Mnk1 and Mnk2 possess similar catalytic domains, there are some differences between them, e.g. in the amino acid sequences around the T-loop. The main differences between Mnk1 and Mnk2 lie in their C termini (Fig. 1A), which contain distinct MAPK-binding motifs and also differ in several other respects. Indeed, apart from the MAPK-binding motif, the only point of similarity between these regions of mouse Mnk1 and Mnk2 is the Leu-Ser-Pro-Pro-Ser sequence that lies N-terminal to the former motif (Fig. 1A). The MAPK binding site in human Mnk1a reportedly gives it a better ability to bind p38 MAPK in comparison to Mnk2a (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To study the roles of the C termini in determining the properties of Mnk1 and Mnk2, chimeric proteins were made in which the C-terminal region was swapped between both proteins (schematic representation in Fig. 1B). The resulting chimera Mnk1-C2 consists of the C-terminal region of Mnk2 linked to the N terminus and catalytic domain of Mnk1, and vice versa for Mnk2-C1. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Mnk1, Mnk2 or the chimeric proteins, Mnk1-C2 and Mnk2-C1. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 14 h. In experiments where (P)ERK binding was analyzed, cells were pre-treated with TPA for 30 min (Fig. 1C). Otherwise, cells were left untreated. Association with the upstream kinases ERK and p38 was analyzed by immunoprecipitating the Mnks with anti-myc followed by SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitates and Western blotting using anti-MAPK antibodies (Fig. 1C). Mnk activity was assayed in vitro using recombinant eIF4E as substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, Mnk2 showed markedly higher basal activity than Mnk1 (Fig. 1C). Strikingly, the variant containing the N terminus and catalytic domain of Mnk2 with the C terminus of Mnk1 (Mnk2-C1) showed a much lower activity than Mnk2, its activity being only slightly higher than that of Mnk1. This suggested that the C terminus of Mnk2 plays a key role in the high basal activity of this enzyme. However, the converse Mnk1-C2 chimera showed an activity very similar to that of Mnk1, indicating that the C terminus of Mnk2 is insufficient by itself to confer the high activity that is characteristic of Mnk2. This therefore suggests that one or more features outside the C-terminal region are also important. This idea is studied further in subsequent experiments. It was previously shown by Waskiewicz et al. (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) that the phosphorylation of ERK reduces its ability to bind to Mnk1. In contrast, this study reveals that a marked feature of Mnk2 is its ability to bind phosphorylated ERK (Fig. 1C), which persists even after prolonged serum starvation of the cells (Fig. 1D). Indeed, although Mnk1, Mnk1-C2, Mnk2-C1, and Mnk2 all bound to ERK, only Mnk2 and, to a lesser extent, Mnk1-C2 bound to (P)ERK (Fig. 1C). These data imply that features within the C terminus of Mnk2 are important for (P)ERK binding. Interestingly, Mnk2 does co-immunoprecipitate with p38 MAPK, although previous reports had suggested that it binds primarily to ERK (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). However, the amount of p38 MAPK present in the Mnk2 immunoprecipitate was consistently lower than the amount associated with Mnk1. Mnk1-C2 showed lower p38 binding than Mnk1, and conversely, Mnk2-C1 bound better to p38 than Mnk2. This likely reflects the differences between their MAPK-binding motifs (13Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Zoltoski A.J. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31588-31593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Effects on ERK binding were generally the converse of those for p38, presumably because p38 and ERK compete for binding to this motif. Thus the level of association with p38 MAPK correlates entirely with the presence or absence of the C-terminal region of Mnk1. Mnk2 or the chimeric protein that contains the C terminus of Mnk2 (Mnk1-C2) showed better ERK binding than Mnk1 or Mnk2-C1 (Fig. 1C). Previous studies did not compare the relative maximal activities of Mnk1 and Mnk2a under conditions where cells had been stimulated to activate Mnk1. Nor did the earlier studies examine their Km values for the substrate, eIF4E. To study their kinetic parameters, HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding myc-tagged Mnk1 and Mnk2 (pCS3MT Mnk1 and pCS3MT Mnk2). 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated with TPA for 30 min. The proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-myc and their activities assayed in vitro against recombinant eIF4E, across a range of substrate concentrations. Even after stimulation of cells with TPA, Mnk2 was more active than Mnk1 at all substrate concentrations tested (Fig. 1E). Analysis of the data obtained across a range of concentrations of eIF4E revealed that Mnk2 has a higher Km (5.6 nm) than Mnk1 (3.0 nm) for eIF4E, and that the relative Vmax of Mnk2 (100 arbitrary units) is seven times higher than that of Mnk1 (14.24 arbitrary units). Binding to (P)ERK May Explain the Lack of Inhibition of Mnk2 by PD98059—ERK has a conserved common docking site for its inactivators (the MKPs) and substrates such as the Mnks (2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 18Orton K.C. Ling J. Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Merrick W.C. Korneeva N.L. Rhoads R.E. Sonenberg N. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38649-38657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One would expect that the stable binding of (P)ERK to Mnk2 could protect it from dephosphorylation, by preventing it from binding to MKPs. To test this idea, HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding myc-tagged Mnk1 or Mnk2 or with the empty vector (negative control). After 24 h, cells were starved of serum for 16 h, and then either treated with TPA for 30 min (to activate ERK) or treated with TPA followed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 1 h (to elicit inactivation of ERK). Cell lysates were then analyzed for the levels of (P)ERK (Fig. 2A). As anticipated, TPA activated ERK, as seen by the increased signal with the phosphospecific anti-ERK antibody. Treatment with PD98059 reversed this effect in cells transfected with empty vector or Mnk1. However, in cells expressing Mnk2, the levels of (P)ERK remained markedly higher than in control cells or in those expressing Mnk1. The simplest interpretation of this finding is the one depicted in Fig. 2C, where the overexpressed Mnk2 binds a portion of the (P)ERK sufficiently stably to protect it from dephosphorylation by MKPs, even when MEK activation is blocked. In cells overexpressing Mnk1, (P)ERK is not protected against dephosphorylation, because it does not interact with Mnk1. Consequently (P)ERK is accessible to phosphatases and is dephosphorylated and inactivated. This may explain the persistent high activity of overexpressed Mnk2 after serum starvation or treatment of cells with the signaling inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580, because Mnk2 both binds its activated upstream kinase, (P)ERK, and also protects it from dephosphorylation. As described below (see Fig. 5), we conducted further experiments to test this idea. Even after treatment of cells with PD98059 to block MEK and activation of ERK, some (P)ERK remained associated with Mnk2 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 5Importance of the amino acid sequence N-terminal to the MAPK binding site in Mnk1 and Mnk2.

Cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Where (P)ERK binding was studied, cells were then treated with 1 μm TPA for 30 min prior preparing lysates. The Mnk proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-myc antibody and their ability to bind ERK, p38, or (P)ERK and their T-loop phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Note that the lower parts of this panel (T-loop phosphorylation) are taken from separate blots, and cannot be compared directly. D, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the indicated Mnk constructs. 24 h later, cells were starved of serum for 16 h. Where indicated, cells were then treated with 1 μm TPA for 30 min or SB205380 and PD98059 for 45 min prior preparing lysates. The Mnk proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-myc and kinase assays were performed using recombinant eIF4E. The lower part of this panel shows an autoradiograph of the resulting gel.

https://openalex.org/W2077206278,"The influence of negative superhelical density on the genetic instabilities of long GAA·TTC, CGG·CCG, and CTG·CAG repeat sequences was studied in vivo in topologically constrained plasmids in Escherichia coli. These repeat tracts are involved in the etiologies of Friedreich ataxia, fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, respectively. The capacity of these DNA tracts to undergo deletions-expansions was explored with three genetic-biochemical approaches including first, the utilization of topoisomerase I and/or DNA gyrase mutants, second, the specific inhibition of DNA gyrase by novobiocin, and third, the genetic removal of the HU protein, thus lowering the negative supercoil density (–σ). All three strategies revealed that higher –σ in vivo enhanced the formation of deleted repeat sequences. The effects were most pronounced for the Friedreich ataxia and the fragile X triplet repeat sequences. Higher levels of –σ stabilize non-B DNA conformations (i.e. triplexes, sticky DNA, flexible and writhed DNA, slipped structures) at appropriate repeat tracts; also, numerous prior genetic instability investigations invoke a role for these structures in promoting the slippage of the DNA complementary strands. Thus, we propose that the in vivo modulation of the DNA structure, localized to the repeat tracts, is responsible for these behaviors. Presuming that these interrelationships are also found in humans, dynamic alterations in the chromosomal nuclear matrix may modulate the –σ of certain DNA regions and, thus, stabilize/destabilize certain non-B conformations which regulate the genetic expansions-deletions responsible for the diseases.

The capacity of these DNA tracts to undergo deletions-expansions was explored with three genetic-biochemical approaches including first, the utilization of topoisomerase I and/or DNA gyrase mutants, second, the specific inhibition of DNA gyrase by novobiocin, and third, the genetic removal of the HU protein, thus lowering the negative supercoil density (–σ). All three strategies revealed that higher –σ in vivo enhanced the formation of deleted repeat sequences. The effects were most pronounced for the Friedreich ataxia and the fragile X triplet repeat sequences. Higher levels of –σ stabilize non-B DNA conformations (i.e. triplexes, sticky DNA, flexible and writhed DNA, slipped structures) at appropriate repeat tracts; also, numerous prior genetic instability investigations invoke a role for these structures in promoting the slippage of the DNA complementary strands. Thus, we propose that the in vivo modulation of the DNA structure, localized to the repeat tracts, is responsible for these behaviors. Presuming that these interrelationships are also found in humans, dynamic alterations in the chromosomal nuclear matrix may modulate the –σ of certain DNA regions and, thus, stabilize/destabilize certain non-B conformations which regulate the genetic expansions-deletions responsible for the diseases. Genetic instability of microsatellite sequences have been widely observed throughout genomes of all organisms studied (1Wells R.D. Warren S.T.

In the majority of cases this phenomenon occurs without phenotypical consequences, but in some circumstances instability (mostly expansions of the repeat tracts) results in the development of disease (1Wells R.D.

Expansions of tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide microsatellites are related to the etiology of more than 20 neurological diseases including myotonic dystrophy types I and II, fragile X syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, and spinocerebellar ataxias (1Wells R.D.

Studies conducted in different prokaryotic and eukaryotic model systems support these observations, implicating the importance of DNA itself in the repeat mutagenesis processes. Despite the progress in understanding mechanisms of genetic instability, several aspects of microsatellite expansions in human diseases, such as the exact timing of the expansion event or the tissue specificity of the somatic instabilities, remain to be elucidated. Virtually all models of TRS instability emphasize the capacity of the sequences to adopt non-B DNA structures (1Wells R.D. Warren S.T.

Hairpins, slipped structures, triplexes, sticky DNA, tetraplexes, and unwound DNA conformations formed by repetitive sequences can influence various processes of DNA metabolism (5Wells R.D.

Biosci. 2002; 27: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Negative superhelical density (–σ) is a dominant factor in the stabilization of most non-B DNA structures, including those adopted by tandem repeated tracts (28Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang W.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY. 1990Google Scholar, 29Sinden R.R.

A. 1997; 94: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both global (overall) intracellular negative superhelical density as well as the transient waves of supercoiling associated with transcription influence the formation and stability of non-B DNA structures in vivo (28Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang W.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY. 1990Google Scholar, 29Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA. 1994; Google Scholar). Moreover, –σ facilitates structural transitions observed specifically for TRS associated with expansion diseases (30Potaman V.N. Oussatcheva E.A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Bidichandani S.I. Ashizawa T. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Thus, these associations suggest a close relationship between the intracellular level of –σ and the instability of non-B DNA structure-forming repeats. Herein, we used Escherichia coli strains harboring mutations in topoisomerase I and/or DNA gyrase genes to analyze the influence of –σ in vivo on the instability of GAA·TTC, CGG·CCG and CTG·CAG repeats. The modulation of the transcription rate through the repeat tracts enabled the analysis of the cumulative effect of the global –σ combined with local supercoiling. Both the global intracellular –σ alone as well as the effect of transcription on localized –σ had a profound destabilizing influence on the TRS tracts. Hence, these studies provide further, strong evidence for the role of non-B DNA structures in the genetic instability of these repetitive sequences.

The bands corresponding to the full-length monomer plasmids (no TRS deletions) were excised without ethidium bromide staining, and DNA was recovered by electroelution (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar) and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The size of the TRS insert and the extent of instability was determined using restriction digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by quantitative phosphorimaging analyses as described below.

Determination of the Plasmid Superhelical Density in Vivo—pUC19 was isolated from different E. coli strains grown to an A600 of 0.9, and the topoisomer distributions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% w/v) in 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in the presence of 3.5 μm chloroquine. The plasmids were separated on 30-cm-long gels (2–3 V/cm) for 36 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were rinsed with distilled water, and DNA was stained with ethidium bromide. The quantitation of the results was performed using FluorChem version 3.04 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The average negative superhelical density was obtained as described earlier (38Bacolla A.

Determination of the Plasmid Copy Number—To evaluate the possible influence of the supercoil-dependent replicative potential of different E. coli strains, the copy number of pUC19 was determined for each strain as described earlier (36Napierala M.

The quantitative analyses of the plasmid and genomic DNAs separated by agarose gels were performed using FluorChem version 3.04 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Preparation of Bacterial Lysates and Fluorometric Quantitation of GFP Expression—pGFPuv (Clontech) was used as a reporter plasmid to characterize the lacZ promoter expression levels in different E. coli strains and under varying transcription and supercoiling conditions. The preparation of the bacterial lysates and quantitation of the GFP levels were performed precisely as described (41Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Larson J.E. Jakupciak J.P. Chuzhanova N. Abeysinghe S.S. O'Connell C.D. Cooper D.N. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were conducted on a Turner Quantech fluorometer using an NB405 excitation filter and a SC500 emission filter. A standard curve was made by supplementing GFP-free lysates with known amounts of recombinant GFPuv (Clontech), which gave the expected linear relationship. Analyses of the GFPuv expression were performed in E. coli JTT1, RS2, SD7, and KD112 for cells grown in LB medium and in LB supplemented with 2 mm IPTG. The amount of GFPuv expressed in E. coli grown in the presence of pIQ-kan (encoding the lacIQ repressor) was undetectable in all strains. In the typical conditions for our recultivation studies (LB medium), the GFP expression level was ∼10-, 6-, and 3-fold higher in the KD112, RS2, and SD7 strains, respectively, than in the parental E. coli JTT1. Hence, we found no direct correlation between the in vivo superhelical density in these four strains and the GFP expression level from the lacZ promoter. Assay for Genetic Instability—The plasmids containing various TRS were transformed into the appropriate E. coli strains and were grown in 10 ml of LB cultures for a number of generations, as described (16Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 33Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transformation was determined in every experiment by plating an aliquot of the transformation mixture onto the agar plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml); the cultures were always initiated with the equivalent of 1000–3000 colony forming units. Importantly, to avoid the growth advantage effect of the cells harboring plasmids with shorter TRSs (33Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the cells were always subcultured into the fresh media at the logarithmic phase (A600 of 0.75–0.9, 10–16 h of growth). Cells were recultivated 3 times in 20-generation intervals, starting each subculture with 103–104 cells as an inoculum. An initial population of this size allowed the detection of several individual instability events while preventing a potential “bottleneck” effect if the inoculum was too small (1–100 cells). The cultures were grown at 37 °C at a shaking rate of 250 rpm in LB media supplemented with an appropriate antibiotic (ampicillin at 100 μg/ml, kanamycin at 50 μg/ml). The cells from each culture were harvested and stored at –20 °C to the end of the experiment, and then all plasmid isolations and analyses were performed simultaneously. In the experiments with inhibited transcription, the plasmid pIQ-kan was first transformed into the appropriate E. coli strain, and the pIQ-kan-containing competent cells were prepared. When required, 2 mm IPTG was included in the growth medium to induce transcription from the lacZ promoter. In the case of studies performed in the presence of novobiocin (Sigma) the drug was added, during all stages of the experiment beginning with the preparation of competent cells, at the concentrations equal to the strain-specific inhibitory concentration of 5% (IC05 = 4 and 16 μm for SD7 and HB101 E. coli, respectively). Novobiocin inhibits the assembly of the active DNA gyrase (42Lewis R.J. Singh O.M. Smith C.V. Skarzynski T. Maxwell A. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B.

IC05 values were determined experimentally for each E. coli strain used. In contrast to the quinolones, novobiocin (as well as other coumarins) does not lead to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks that may influence the results of the TRS instability studies (44Chen C.R.

Simultaneous Analyses of the Plasmid Superhelical Density and TRS Instability from Single Colonies—Studies were conducted with E. coli JRY880, which is a deletion mutant of the hupA gene encoding the α subunit of the HU protein, to evaluate its potential role in modulating the in vivo supercoil density of pRW3546 and thereby influencing the TRS genetic instability. The supercoil density and the GAA·TTC instability were monitored in single colonies since E. coli JRY880 is known to rapidly acquire suppressor mutations resulting in an increase of the intracellular –σ (48Malik M. Bensaid A. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Drlica K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Competent bacterial cells were co-transformed with pRW3546 which contained (GAA·TTC)150 and with pACYC184. pACYC184 was used as a reference plasmid to monitor the –σ. Thus, harboring both plasmids in the same cells allowed the simultaneous analysis of the repeat instability at a precisely determined –σ. After transformation cells were plated on an agar plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for selection for pRW3546, tetracycline (20 μg/ml) for selection for pACYC184, and chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml) for selection for E. coli JRY880. Single colonies were subsequently grown in liquid LB medium supplemented with the same concentrations of the antibiotics until the cultures reached an A600 of 0.9. Plasmids were isolated using standard techniques (Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA Purification System, Promega) and were subjected to restriction digestion. A portion of the isolated DNA (containing a mixture of both pRW3546 and pACYC184) was cleaved by a combination of five restriction endonucleases (AatII, AflIII, DraIII, PvuI, and NdeI) to completely remove any supercoiled pRW3546 while leaving pACYC184 intact. This step was necessary since the presence of undigested pRW3546 could interfere with the analyses of the pACYC184 topoisomer distributions on the chloroquine-containing agarose gels. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the topoisomer distributions of pACYC184 were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% w/v) in 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in the presence of 3.5 μm chloroquine as described above. In parallel, the remaining fraction of the plasmid preparation was cleaved using BssHII/HindIII restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs) to analyze the stability of the (GAA·TTC)150 tract in pRW3546. The repeat-containing inserts were separated on 5.5% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed as described below. Analysis of Lengths of Genetic Instability Products—Plasmids were isolated as described above and were subjected to restriction digestion. BssHII/HindIII restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs) were utilized to analyze the stability of the (GAA·TTC)150 tract in pRW3546, and EcoRI/BamHI were used in the case of pRW3691 and pRW3246. The repeat-containing inserts were radioactively labeled using with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP and separated on 5.5–7% polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Results were analyzed using Storm 820 and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat Version 2.03. Increased Negative Superhelical Density Enhances the Instability of GAA·TTC and CGG·CCG Repeats but Not CTG·CAG—Four isogenic E. coli strains (parental (JTT1) as well as cells harboring mutations in the topoisomerase I and/or DNA gyrase genes (RS2, SD7, and KD112)) were transformed with plasmids containing (GAA·TTC)150, (CGG·CCG)73, or (CTG·CAG)98 (TABLE ONE) and were subjected to recultivation experiments. The recultivation assay is a powerful method for analyzing the genetic instability of repetitive sequences and has been widely used previously (12Sakamoto N. Larson J.E. Iyer R.R. Montermini L.

https://openalex.org/W2124029523,"ld-Carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.17.13) are named for their ability to cleave amide bonds between l- and d-amino acids, which occur naturally in bacterial peptidoglycan. They are specific for the link between meso-diaminopimelic acid and d-alanine and therefore degrade GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptides to the corresponding tripeptides. As only the tripeptides can be reused as peptidoglycan building blocks, ld-carboxypeptidases are thought to play a role in peptidoglycan recycling. Despite the pharmaceutical interest in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, the fold and catalytic type of ld-carboxypeptidases are unknown. Here, we show that a previously uncharacterized open reading frame in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has ld-carboxypeptidase activity and present the crystal structure of this enzyme. The structure shows that the enzyme consists of an N-terminal β-sheet and a C-terminal β-barrel domain. At the interface of the two domains, Ser115 adopts a highly strained conformation in the context of a strand-turn-helix motif that is similar to the “nucleophilic elbow” in αβ-hydrolases. Ser115 is hydrogen-bonded to a histidine residue, which is oriented by a glutamate residue. All three residues, which occur in the order Ser-Glu-His in the amino acid sequence, are strictly conserved in naturally occurring ld-carboxypeptidases and cannot be mutated to alanines without loss of activity. We conclude that ld-carboxypeptidases are serine peptidases with Ser-His-Glu catalytic triads. ld-Carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.17.13) are named for their ability to cleave amide bonds between l- and d-amino acids, which occur naturally in bacterial peptidoglycan.

We conclude that ld-carboxypeptidases are serine peptidases with Ser-His-Glu catalytic triads. ld-Carboxypeptidases have been named for their unusual ability to cleave amide bonds that link an l-amino acid to a C-terminal d-amino acid. The physiological substrates are tetrapeptide peptidoglycan fragments that contain an l-configured residue (l-lysine or a suitably oriented meso-diaminopimelic acid residue) as the penultimate residue and d-alanine as the ultimate residue. ld-Carboxypeptidase substrates are produced when cell walls are degraded. It is thought that these fragments cannot be reincorporated into murein in the absence of ld-carboxypeptidase activity. In the presence of ld-carboxypeptidase activity, the tetrapeptides are truncated to tripeptides, which can then be reconverted into peptidoglycan building blocks by the attachment of preformed d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptides. Therefore, the physiological role of ld-carboxypeptidases may be in peptidoglycan recycling (1Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Holtje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although other physiological roles have also been discussed (1Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Holtje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Ursinus A. Steinhaus H. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Beck B.D. Park J.T. J.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6697-6703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ld-Carboxypeptidase activity can be detected in many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, but is absent in Caulobacter crescentus (5Markiewicz Z. Glauner B. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 649-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is still not clear whether all ld-carboxypeptidase activity is due to a single enzyme. Metz et al. (6Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported that they could distinguish two ld-carboxypeptidase activities in Escherichia coli (termed I and II) by their sensitivity to d-amino acids and to the β-lactam antibiotic thienamycin. Activity I was purified and attributed to a 12-kDa norcardicin A-sensitive enzyme (7Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There are no reports on purification of activity II. In later independent work, Ursinus et al. (2Ursinus A. Steinhaus H. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the purification of a norcardicin A-sensitive and thienamycin-insensitive activity, which was originally ascribed to a 43-kDa dimer-forming protein in the periplasm. When this activity was cloned, the gene was found to code for a 33.6-kDa protein without leader sequence, and a reassessment of its localization suggested that the enzyme is cytosolic (1Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Holtje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Deletion of the cloned ld-carboxypeptidase gene has little effect on the phenotype during logarithmic growth, but makes the strain prone to lysis in the stationary phase, unless a compensating mutation in AmpD, another peptidoglycan amidase, is present. In contrast to the results of Metz et al. (6Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Templin et al. (1Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Holtje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) found a complete loss of all soluble ld-carboxypeptidase activity in the deletion strain. In this study, we therefore use the term ld-carboxypeptidase for the cloned enzyme, even though unrelated ld-carboxypeptidases may remain to be discovered. The substrate specificity of the E. coli ld-carboxypeptidase has been well characterized (8Leguina J.I. Quintela J.C. de Pedro M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The enzyme is specific for tetrapeptides and discriminates against pentapeptides, but is permissive with regard to the attached sugar moieties: free peptides and peptides linked to MurNAc, GlcNAc-MurNAc, and UDP-MurNAc are substrates. High molecular mass murein sacculi or cross-linked muropeptides are not cleaved (see Fig. 1) (1Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Holtje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Leguina J.I. Quintela J.C. de Pedro M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The inhibitor sensitivity of ld-carboxypeptidases is less clear, in part because many studies have been done with poorly characterized enzyme preparations that may not have been homogeneous (6Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Hammes W.P. Seidel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Hammes W.P. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1978; 91: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ld-Carboxypeptidase is sensitive to norcardicin A, but biochemical results suggest that the interaction is noncovalent and does not involve an opening of the lactam ring of the antibiotic (2Ursinus A. Steinhaus H. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of ld-carboxypeptidase to other lactam antibiotics varies widely between antibiotics of the same class, but correlates with the chirality of the amino acid substituent of the antibiotic, again suggesting that lactam ring opening is not essential (2Ursinus A. Steinhaus H. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Metz R. Henning S. Hammes W.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). EDTA, which was used for standard periplasm extractions when the enzyme was thought to reside in the periplasm, does not inactivate the enzyme (1Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Holtje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Beck B.D. Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extractions with other stronger metal chelators have not been reported. Therefore, the catalytic class of ld-carboxypeptidase remains unknown, although the pH optimum of ∼8.4 suggests that the enzyme is probably not an aspartic protease (2Ursinus A. Steinhaus H. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As peptidases of unknown fold and catalytic class, ld-carboxypeptidases are currently classified as family U61 (U for “unknown”) in the MEROPS Database (13Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here, we (a) show that the U61 enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has ld-carboxypeptidase activity, (b) present the crystal structure of the enzyme at 1.5-Å resolution, (c) demonstrate that the enzyme is a serine peptidase with a Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad, and (d) highlight an unexpected similarity of the region around the active-site serine residue to the “nucleophilic elbow” in αβ-hydrolases. Cloning—The gene for ld-carboxypeptidase from P. aeruginosa strain PA01 was amplified by standard PCR methods from genomic DNA, adding EcoRI and BamHI sites for cloning. The fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the digestion product was ligated with T4 ligase into a derivative of pET15b (Novagen) that lacks the original EcoRI site of the vector and carries six histidine residues and an EcoRI site downstream of the original NcoI site. Thus, the N-terminal sequence of our construct was MGHHHHHHEFMTS..., where MTS comprises the first residues of the native ld-carboxypeptidase sequence. Restriction analysis and automated DNA sequencing confirmed that the expression construct harbored the full ld-carboxypeptidase gene. The conceptually translated sequence differed from the Swiss-Prot sequence (accession number Q9HTZ1) at two positions. Asp30 and Gln104 were both mutated to glutamate. As the recombinant protein is active (see below), it is likely that the point mutations are due to strain differences, but this was not rigorously checked. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the expression construct by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol, but with Pfu polymerase (EURx Ltd.) instead of PfuTurbo polymerase. Expression—For recombinant protein expression, plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Bacteria were grown in 37 °C to A600 = 0.5, cooled to 22 °C, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.7, and grown in LB medium for 4 h prior to cell harvesting. To produce selenomethionine-containing protein, the expression construct was transformed into the methionine-auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3). Cells were grownin37 °C to A600 = 0.8, shifted to 28 °C, induced at A600 = 1.0 with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cultured for an additional 8 h in minimal medium containing 0.3 mm l-selenomethionine (14Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Cells were harvested; resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 200 mm NaCl); and treated with lysozyme, DNase I, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication and centrifugation at 145,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed first with buffer A and then with buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole and developed with 300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The eluate was dialyzed for 4 h against 200 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 6 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM-30 filters). All purification and concentration steps were done at 7 °C. Substrate Preparation—Pseudomonas putida peptidoglycan was isolated essentially as described by Glauner (15Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were grown in 1 liter of LB medium to A600 ∼ 2.0, harvested, resuspended in 10 ml of cold water, and added dropwise with vigorous mixing to 10 ml of boiling 8% SDS. Samples were boiled for an additional 30 min and incubated overnight at room temperature. Peptidoglycan was recovered by centrifugation at 145,000 × g for 1 h at room temperature and washed several times to remove traces of SDS. The polymer was resuspended in 1.2 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0) and treated first with 120 μg of α-amylase (Fluka) for 2 h at 37°C to degrade high molecular mass glycogen and then incubated with 240 μg of Pronase (Fluka) for 1.5 h at 60 °C to release covalently bound lipoprotein. After another wash with boiling 8% SDS, the pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 7) and treated overnight with 200-300 μg of lysozyme at 37 °C. Material that remained insoluble after the lysozyme treatment was pelleted and discarded. The supernatant was filtered through a 5-kDa cutoff filter (Vivascience) and subjected to time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis. For the most prominent peak, a molecular mass of 940.4 ± 0.1 Da was found, consistent with the molecular mass of the GlcNAc-MurNAc disaccharide with a tetrapeptide side chain (see Fig. 1). A priori, the glycosidic linkage in the disaccharide could connect either C-1 of GlcNAc and C-4 of MurNAc or, alternatively, C-1 of MurNAc and C-4 of GlcNAc. The assignment in Fig. 1 is based on the known specificity of lysozyme (16Sharon N. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1967; 167: 402-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was not checked experimentally. To estimate the amount of GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide, several methods were tried. Derivatization of the free amino group in meso-diaminopimelic acid with Sanger reagent (fluorodinitrobenzene) failed; thus, reduction of the muramic acid to muramitol was used to titrate the amount of disaccharide. The calculations assumed that 4 mol of disaccharide can be reduced per mol of NaBH4 with 100% reaction efficiency and are therefore likely to overestimate the true amount of GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide. Activity Assay—2 μg of GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide (∼2 nmol) was incubated with 20 ng of ld-carboxypeptidase (0.57 pmol of protomer) or control for 20 min at 37 °C in either 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0) or crystallization buffer (50 mm citric acid/citrate (pH 4.5)). The wild-type enzyme was active in both buffers. The activity of mutants with altered triad residues was undetectable under these conditions. To establish the limits of their activity, 2 μg of mutant enzyme (57 pmol of protomer) was incubated with 2 μg of substrate (∼2 nmol) for 20 min or overnight at 37 °C. The reaction was monitored by HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMADmultiwavelength anomalous diffraction. (Waters) using a C18 column (CC250/3 Nucleosil 100-5-C18, Macherey Nagel). The column was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm phosphoric acid/sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 4.3)), washed for 5 min with buffer B after injection, and ramped to buffer C (75 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate/disodium hydrogen phosphate (pH 4.95) and 15% methanol) for 40 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min throughout. Retention times are relative to the appearance of the injection peak. high performance liquid chromatography multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. Crystallization—The wild-type protein could be concentrated only to 6 mg/ml. Needle-shaped crystals were grown at room temperature (21 °C) by vapor diffusion of 4 μl of sitting drops with 0.5 ml of reservoir buffer from a 6 mg/ml protein solution mixed in 1:1 ratio with reservoir buffer containing 0.02 m calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.1 sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6), and 30% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals could be flash-cryocooled from mother liquor and diffracted in-house to ∼2.9 Å and showed clear signs of high anisotropic mosaicity and disorder. Much better, plate-like crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at room temperature (21 °C) when a 6 mg/ml protein solution was mixed in 1:1 ratio with reservoir buffer containing 50 mm citric acid (pH 4.5). Unlike the wild-type protein, the selenomethionine variant of ld-carboxypeptidase could be concentrated to 27 mg/ml. Crystallization of the selenomethionine variant was successful with this protein concentration and the same crystallization buffer. For cryoprotection, crystals were soaked in a mixture containing 75% reservoir buffer and 25% (2R,3R)-(-)-2,3-butanediol. Crystals belonged to space group P21 with cell constants a = 52.2, b = 78.3, and c = 71.3 Å and β = 104.3°. The presence of a strong signal for a local 2-fold axis in the self-rotation function and the solvent content indicated that the crystals contained two subunits of ld-carboxypeptidase in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—A native data set to 1.5-Å resolution and a three-wavelength selenomethionine MAD data set to 2.4-Å resolution were collected at beamline BW6 (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany). As each protomer could contain up to four selenomethionine residues (the initiator methionine of the N-terminal His tag, the native initiator methionine, and two methionine residues in the sequence), up to eight selenomethionine sites were expected, but only four sites were identified by SHELXD (17Schneider T.A. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Phasing and solvent flattening suggested a clear preference for one hand over its enantiomeric alternative, but the resulting map was clearly of insufficient quality for model building. Nevertheless, it was good enough for the program GETAX (18Vonrhein C. Schulz G.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to define the location of the dimer axis, which turned out to be consistent with the positions of four selenium atoms. To further improve phases, we screened heavy atom soaks for the possible generation of derivatives in-house. A tungstate soak showed a clear peak in the y = 0.5 Harker section. Its location, originally identified with the Patterson search program RSPS (19Knight S.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was consistent (except for the floating y coordinate) with the location derived from the difference Fourier maps that were phased with the selenomethionine phases. The reverse cross-phasing step, starting from the phases of the tungstate soak and interpreting anomalous selenomethionine difference Fourier maps, was successful as well. Joint MLPHARE phasing (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) of the single isomorphous replacement and MAD data sets followed by auto-masked 2-fold averaging and solvent flattening with the program DM at 2.5-Å resolution yielded improved phases (TABLE ONE). The map that was calculated with these phases and the amplitudes of the native data set could in part be interpreted manually. Sequence assignment was greatly aided by the information on the locations of the methionine seleniums in the selenomethionine variant. A manually built model of the two protomers that covered ∼50% of the sequence was sufficient for ARP/wARP to deliver a nearly complete and almost fully refined model (21Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The ld-carboxypeptidase variants were analyzed by mapping the model of the wild-type enzyme into the nearly identical unit cells of the mutants, followed by rigid body refinement and omit map calculations. The model was manually corrected in the vicinity of the active site, but otherwise left untouched. Further refinement lowered the R-factor, but introduced undesirable distortions and was therefore not used.TABLE ONEData collection and phasing statistics for the selenomethionine crystals and the tungstate soakDerivativeSelenomethionineTungstateUnit cell dimensionsa (Å)52.4152.29b (Å)78.0877.77c (Å)71.2471.18β104.18°104.42°Wavelength (Å)0.95000.97920.97971.54Total no. of reflections172,955158,313158,15525,646Unique no. of reflections47.55943,21543,24912,396Resolution (Å)2.32.42.42.8Completeness (%)99.0 (80.1)99.3 (88.4)99.1 (81.6)89.5 (77.1)I/σ17.7 (4.1)19.7 (6.0)19.0 (5.4)21.1Rsym (last shell) (%)8.3 (28.7)7.4 (21.2)7.8 (22.6)8.3 (12.6)No. of sites41FOM0.43 (20 to 2.5 Å)0.32 (15 to 2.8 Å)Combined FOM0.48 (20 to 2.5 Å)FOM after DM0.74 (20 to 2.5 Å) Open table in a new tab Choice of Enzyme—The best characterized ld-carboxypeptidase is the enzyme from E. coli, which is very unstable (2Ursinus A. Steinhaus H. Holtje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to concentrate on homologs from other bacterial species. The conserved hypothetical protein from P. aeruginosa (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9HTZ1) could be expressed in E. coli, was stable enough for purification, and could be crystallized. As the open reading frame had never been characterized, a substrate was required to test its activity. Substrate Preparation—If the P. aeruginosa hypothetical protein (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9HTZ1) were an ld-carboxypeptidase, it should be able to cleave the GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide, an abundant fragment in lysozyme digests of many Gram-negative bacteria. As P. aeruginosa is a human pathogen and subject to handling restrictions, we purified and digested the peptidoglycan from the closely related P. putida instead. Mass spectrometry showed that the monoisotopic mass of the dominant fragment in the lysozyme digests matched the expected mass of the disaccharide tetrapeptide fragment. Most preparations were significantly contaminated with a second species, which was identified as the disaccharide tripeptide according to its mass. Based on prior data on the murein structure in Gram-negative bacteria and on the specificity of lysozyme, which splits between C-1 of MurNAc and C-4 of GlcNAc (16Sharon N. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1967; 167: 402-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the structures in Fig. 1 were assigned to the disaccharide tri- and tetrapeptides in the peptidoglycan digests. When murein lysozyme digests were chromatographed on a C18 reverse phase column, four peaks instead of the expected two peaks were found (Fig. 2A). Such peak splitting was reported previously for lysozyme digests of E. coli peptidoglycan and was attributed to the equilibrium between the anomeric forms of muramic acid with the C-1 OH in the α- and β-positions (15Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The behavior of P. putida peptidoglycan digests is consistent with this interpretation. When material from a single chromatography peak was re-injected, a peak doublet was again observed (data not shown). When the mixture was pretreated with the reducing agent sodium borohydride, only two instead of the usual four peaks were observed. The altered positions of the new peaks indicated that reduction of muramic acid to muramitol had indeed taken place (Fig. 2D). The P. aeruginosa Hypothetical Protein Has ld-Carboxypeptidase Activity—The recombinant P. aeruginosa hypothetical protein (Swiss-Prot Accession Number Q9HTZ1) converted the GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide efficiently to the tripeptide. As both substrate peaks disappeared, we concluded that both anomeric forms of the GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide are substrates. The GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide with muramitol instead of muramic acid, which resulted from the sodium borohydride treatment, was still a substrate (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that the region around the anomeric carbon of the GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide is not important for substrate recognition. As the ld-carboxypeptidase substrate preparations were contaminated with the product, the reaction was best monitored by subtracting the HPLC trace prior to the reaction from the trace after the reaction. In this mode of presentation, the destruction of substrates gives rise to negative (“downward”) peaks, and the emergence of products manifests itself as positive (“upward”) peaks (Fig. 2, C and F). Structure Determination—To identify candidate active-site residues of ld-carboxypeptidase, the crystallographic approach was taken. P21 crystals of ld-carboxypeptidase from P. aeruginosa with two protomers in the asymmetric unit could be grown and diffracted to a resolution of 1.5 Å on beamline BW6 (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron). The selenomethionine variant of the protein was produced and crystallized, but because it contained only two internal well ordered selenomethionine residues/protomer, the MAD phases were not sufficient for model building and had to be combined with the single isomorphous replacement phases for a tungstate derivative. The combined phases were improved and extended by 2-fold averaging and solvent flattening as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A partial, manually built model served as the starting point for automatic density interpretation by the ARP/wARP procedure (21Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics appeared satisfactory (TABLE TWO).

The interface buries a total of 2800 Å2 and extends over 1400 Å2 and is therefore sufficiently large to be potentially relevant in solution. We therefore scored this contact region with the DCOMPLEX server, which applies statistical potentials to distinguish biologically relevant from purely crystallographic protein-protein contacts (22Liu S. Zhang C. Zhou H. Zhou Y. Proteins. 2004; 56: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The server suggested a value of ∼25 kcal/mol for the affinity between the protomers and classified the interface as a “true interface.” To confirm this conclusion experimentally, we performed size chromatography runs in two different salt concentrations. P. aeruginosa ld-carboxypeptidase migrated with apparent molecular masses of 56 and 51 kDa in low salt (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl) and high salt (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 200 mm NaCl) buffers, respectively. These values are in between the calculated protomer mass of 34.6 kDa and the calculated dimer mass of 69.2 kDa (Fig. 4, A and B) and favor the dimer, at least for the high protein concentrations that were used for size chromatography. As the E. coli ld-carboxypeptidase is known to dimerize as well, we suspected that dimerization may be a general feature of ld-carboxypeptidases. To assess the conservation of the dimerization interface, we used the ConSurf server"

The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism of the apoCI-mediated blockade of CETP activity. Kinetic analyses revealed that the inhibitory property of apoCI is independent of the amount of active CETP, but it is tightly dependent on the amount of high density lipoproteins (HDL) in the incubation mixtures. The electrostatic charge of HDL, i.e. the main carrier of apoCI in human plasma, is gradually modified with increasing amounts of apoCI, and the neutralization of apoCI lysine residues by acetylation produces a marked reduction in its inhibitory potential. The inhibitory property of full-length apoCI is shared by its C-terminal α-helix with significant electrostratic properties, whereas its N-terminal α-helix with no CETP inhibitory property has no effect on HDL electronegativity. Finally, binding experiments demonstrated that apoCI and to a lower extent its C-terminal α-helix are able to disrupt CETP-lipoprotein complexes in a concentration-dependent manner. It was concluded that the inhibition of CETP activity by apoCI is in direct link with its specific electrostatic properties, and the apoCI-mediated reduction in the binding properties of lipoproteins results in weaker CETP-HDL interactions and fewer cholesteryl ester transfers.

Recently, apolipoprotein CI, i.e. a 6.6-kDa HDL apolipoprotein, was identified as a potent CETP inhibitor (20Gautier T. Masson M. Pais de Barros J.P. Athias A. Gambert P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Lagrost L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37504-37509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast to other putative apolipoprotein candidates that were identified only through in vitro experiments, the ability of apoCI to decrease specific CETP activity was documented in vivo through studies in CETPTg/apoCI-KO and CETPTg/HuapoCITg (transgenic mouse to both human CETP and human apolipoprotein CI) mice (21Gautier T. Masson D. Jong M.C. Duverneuil L. Le Guern N. Deckert V. Pais de Barros J.P. Dumont L. Bataille A. Zak Z. Jiang X.C. Tall A.R. Havekes L.M. Lagrost L. J. Biol.

Although it was concluded that apoCI constitutes the major physiological inhibitor of CETP in the plasma compartment, the molecular mechanism of the blockade of the cholesteryl ester transfer reaction by apoCI remained to be identified. The CETP-mediated lipid transfer reaction is a complex process, with at least two rate-limiting steps. In the first step, CETP binds to lipoproteins through electrostatic interactions with negative charges localized at the lipoprotein surface (23Nishida H.I. Arai H. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16352-16360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sammett D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6687-6697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Masson D. Athias A. Lagrost L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1579-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second step, and after a conformational change of CETP, one neutral lipid molecule binds to an hydrophobic site in the C terminus of the protein prior to be transferred to the lipoprotein acceptor (26Swenson T.L. Brocia R.W. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5150-5157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Swenson T.L. Hesler C.B. Brown M.L. Quinet E. Trotta P.P. Haslanger M.F. Gaeta F.C. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14318-14326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In concordance with the two steps of the CETP-mediated transfer reaction, at least two distinct ways of CETP blockade were reported in previous studies. First, CETP inhibition may result from either insufficient or excessive binding of CETP at the lipoprotein surface in step 1 of the lipid transfer process, and both weak CETP-lipoprotein interaction (25Masson D. Athias A. Lagrost L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1579-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tall A.R. J.

Second, CETP inhibition may result from the blockade of the neutral lipid binding site in step 2 of the lipid transfer process, resulting in an abnormal production of irreversibly associated CETP-lipoprotein complexes in this case (8de Grooth G.J.

Concordant in vitro observations indicate that the inhibitory property of apoCI is in a direct link with its electrostatic charge properties and its ability to produce significant changes in CETP-lipoprotein interactions.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasma Samples—Fresh citrated plasmas from normolipidemic subjects were provided by the Etablissement Français du Sang (Hôpital du Bocage, Dijon, France).Isolation of HDL Particles—Total HDL were ultracentrifugally isolated from normolipidemic human plasmas as the 1.070 < d < 1.210 g/ml fraction, with one 24-h, 45,000 rpm spin at the lowest density and one 24-h, 50,000 rpm spin at the highest density in a 70.Ti rotor in an L90-K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). HDL2 and HDL3 were isolated as the 1.070 < d < 1.125 g/ml and the 1.125 < d < 1.210 g/ml fractions, respectively. Isolation of HDL2 and HDL3 was conducted in an NVT-90 rotor in an L90-K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments), with a 2.5-h, 90,000 rpm spin at density 1.070 g/ml, a 3-h, 90,000 rpm spin at density 1.125 g/ml, and a 3.5-h, 90,000 rpm spin at density 1.210 g/ml. Densities were adjusted by the addition of solid KBr. Isolated HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 were dialyzed overnight against 10 mmol/liter Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 3 mmol/liter NaN3 (TBS buffer).Purification of Apolipoprotein CI and CETP—ApoCI was purified from delipidated HDL apolipoproteins by using the chromatofocusing method of Tournier et al. (31Tournier J-F. Bayard F. Tauber J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 804: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This method takes advantage of the high isoelectric point of apoCI as compared with other HDL apolipoprotein components. Purified apoCI, which appeared as a homogeneous band on polyacrylamide gel, was dialyzed against TBS buffer. CETP was purified from human plasma by using a sequential chromatography procedure as described previously, and CETP preparation was deprived of both lecithin/cholesterol acyltransferase and phospholipid transfer protein activities (32Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Guyard-Dangremont V. Lagrost L. Gambert P. Lallemant C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 231: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Anti-apoCI Immunoaffinity Chromatography—ApoCI was removed from total human HDL by passage through an anti-apoCI immunoaffinity column as described previously (20Gautier T. Masson M. Pais de Barros J.P. Athias A. Gambert P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Lagrost L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37504-37509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ApoCI-poor HDL that did not bind to the immunosorbent column were washed off with TBS buffer, and their ability to exchange cholesteryl esters was compared with total HDL.Apolipoprotein CI Acetylation—ApoCI was acetylated as described previously (34Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of purified apoCI was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a saturated solution of sodium acetate in the presence of increasing amounts of acetic anhydride (range, 0-21 μmol). At the end of the treatment, acetylated preparations were dialyzed overnight against TBS buffer containing 1 mmol/liter EDTA.Isoelectrophoretic Analysis—Native apoCI (5 μg) and apoCI treated with acetic anhydride (5 μg) or protein pI standards (two-dimensional SDS-PAGE; Bio-Rad) (10 μl) were diluted in 300 μl of hydration buffer (8 mol/liter urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3-10). After an overnight hydration of 17-cm-long ReadyStrip, pH 3-10 (Bio-Rad), at 50 V in a Protean IEF cell (Bio-Rad), isoelectrofocalization was conducted for 40 kV-h. Strips were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and analyzed on a GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad).Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry of Native and Acetylated ApoCI—Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, native and acetylated apoCI were desalted on ZipTip microcolumns (ZipTip μC18, Millipore) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 μg of protein in 10 μl was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). ZipTips were pre-wetted with 10 μl of 50% acetonitrile in MilliQ grade water and equilibrated with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Bound proteins were washed twice with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and they were finally eluted with 4 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile in MilliQ grade water. One microliter of eluted protein was mixed with 4 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonique S.A., Wissembourg, France) in a 0.1% acetonitrile/trifluoro-acetic acid (1:2, v/v) solution. Finally, 1 μl of the mixture was spotted on a MTP 384 ground steel target plate (Bruker Daltonique S.A.).The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a Ultraflex II TOF/TOF spectrometer (Bruker Daltonique S.A.) in positive 25-kV linear mode. Insulin (Mr = 5734.56), ubiquitin I (Mr = 88565.89), cytochrome c (Mr = 12361.09), and myoglobin (Mr = 16952.55) were used as external calibration standards (protein calibration standard I, Bruker Daltonique S.A.).Measurement of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Activity—CETP activity was determined in microplates by a fluorescent method using donor liposomes enriched with nitrobenzoxadiazol (NBD)-labeled cholesteryl esters (phospholipid/cholesterol/NBD-cholesteryl ester molar ratio, 1:1:1) (Roar Biomedical). For measurements of cholesteryl ester transfer activity with isolated CETP, donor liposomes (phospholipids, 5 μmol/liter) and purified CETP (range, 2-16 μg) were incubated in the presence of HDL (range, 0.5-4.0 μmol/liter) or LDL (7 μg of cholesterol), as indicated. For measurement of cholesteryl ester transfer activity in total plasma, incubation media contained donor liposomes (phospholipids, 5 μmol/liter) and 10 μl of plasma. Final volumes were adjusted to 250 μl with TBS (unless specified), and incubations were conducted in triplicate for 3 h at 37 °C in a Victor2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The CETP-mediated transfer of NBD-cholesteryl esters from self-quenched donors to acceptor lipoproteins was monitored by the increase in fluorescence intensity (excitation, 465 nm; emission, 535 nm), and results were expressed in fluorescence arbitrary units after deduction of blank values that were obtained with control mixtures without CETP.SDS-PAGE—HDL apolipoproteins were delipidated with ethanol/ether (3:2), diluted in the sample buffer, and applied on 4-12% NuPAGE® BisTris Novex SDS-polyacrylamide gels as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, and the apparent molecular weights of individual protein bands were determined by reference to protein standards (Mark12, Invitrogen).Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—The electrophoretic mobility (U in the following equations) of HDL was determined by electrophoresis on 0.5% agarose gels (Paragon Lipo kit, Beckman Instruments) according to the method of Sparks and Phillips (35Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were cast in a Sebia Tank K20 system, and electrophoresis was performed for 45 min at 100 V in barbital buffer, pH 8.6. After electrophoresis, the gels were successively fixed for 5 min in an ethanol/acetic acid/water 60:10:30 solution, dried, stained for 5 min in a 0.07% solution of Sudan Black B in ethanol/water 55:45, and destained for 10 min with a solution of ethanol/water 45:55. In parallel, gel portions containing purified bovine serum albumin, which was used as an internal standard, were stained with a 0.8 g/liter solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in a methanol/acetic acid/water 10:1:10 solution and destained in a solution of methanol/acetic acid/water 2:3:40. Mean migration distances were obtained by using the GelDoc analysis software (Bio-Rad).Calculation of Electrophoretic Mobility and Surface Potential of HDL Particles—Surface charges of HDL were determined as described previously (35Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, electrophoretic mobilities (U) were calculated by dividing the electrophoretic velocity (mean migration distance (mm) per time in seconds) by the electrophoretic potential (voltage per gel distance in centimeters). To correct the pI-dependent retardation effects, the Equation 1 was applied (35Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), U{\\ }corrected=(U{\\ }agarose)/1.211 The surface potentials of HDL were calculated by using the Henry's Equation 2 (see Ref. 35Sparks D.L.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), S=U×6πn/D where n is the coefficient of viscosity (0.0089 poise), and D is the solvent dielectric constant.Formation of CETP-Lipoprotein Complexes—Ultracentrifugally isolated HDL were covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at a ratio of 10 mg of HDL proteins per g of gel as recommended by the manufacturer. The HDL-Sepharose phase was resuspended in PBS containing 3 mmol/liter NaN3. Each incubation mixture contained 100 μl of the HDL-Sepharose suspension in PBS, corresponding to 70 μg of HDL cholesterol. In a first step, purified CETP (final concentration, 3.75 mg/liter) was bound to the HDL-Sepharose suspension during a 1-h incubation at room temperature under mild agitation. At the end of the incubation period, the HDL-Sepharose phase with bound CETP was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, which contained increasing amounts of either purified apoCI, amino acids 4-25 N-terminal apoCI fragment, or amino acids 34-54, C-terminal apoCI fragment (concentration range, 0-2 μmol/liter). Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature under mild agitation, and supernatants containing unbound CETP that was released from the HDL-Sepharose phase were finally recovered after a gentle, 1-min low speed centrifugation. The amount of CETP released in the supernatant was determined by a specific immunoassay with TP1 anti-CETP monoclonal antibodies. Briefly, proteins in the incubation supernatants were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) by using a dot blot vacuum system (Bio-Rad). The resulting blots were blocked for 30 min at 37 °C in 3% low fat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween, and they were washed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween. CETP was revealed by successive incubations with TP1 anti-CETP antibodies (Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibodies as described previously (36Masson D. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Lagrost L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24287-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Blots were finally developed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were measured by using the GelDoc analysis software (Bio-Rad). The amount of CETP in each supernatant was determined by comparison with a calibration curve that was obtained with known amounts of purified CETP that were applied to the membrane together with the samples.Lipid and Protein Analyses—All assays were performed on a Victor2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total cholesterol was measured by the enzymatic method using the Cholesterol 100 reagent (ABX Diagnostics). Phospholipids and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic methods, as described previously (21Gautier T. Masson D. Jong M.C. Duverneuil L. Le Guern N. Deckert V. Pais de Barros J.P. Dumont L.

Protein concentration was measured by using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce).Statistical Analyses—Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the statistical significance between data means.RESULTSComparative Effects of Increasing Levels of Human HDL Versus Human CETP on the ApoCI-mediated Inhibition of the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Reaction—When the amount of fluorescent liposome donors and HDL acceptors were kept constant in the CETP activity assay, the cholesteryl ester transfer rate measured over a 3-h incubation period increased gradually with the amount of purified CETP added (from 2 μg in Fig. 1A to 16 μg in Fig. 1D). In all cases, and in accordance with previous in vitro and in vivo studies (20Gautier T. Masson M. Pais de Barros J.P. Athias A. Gambert P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Lagrost L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37504-37509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Gautier T. Masson D. Jong M.C. Duverneuil L. Le Guern N. Deckert V. Pais de Barros J.P. Dumont L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31354-31363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the addition of apoCI was accompanied by a marked inhibition of the lipid transfer reaction. The inhibitory potential of a given amount of apoCI appeared to be independent of the amount of CETP added, in all cases with a constant ∼70% reduction in cholesteryl ester transfer rate as compared with control mixtures with no apoCI added. Conversely, the inhibitory potential of purified human apoCI was markedly affected by the amount of HDL acceptors that were added to the incubation mixture, with CETP kept constant. In the latter case, the capacity of human apoCI to block the lipid transfer process, approximating 80% of inhibition in incubation mixtures with the lowest HDL levels, was completely abolished with the highest HDL concentration studied (Fig. 2). CETP inhibition by HDL is the consequence of a direct and specific property of apoCI, because apoCI-poor HDL displayed a much weaker ability to block the lipid transfer reaction in the HDL concentration range studied (Fig. 3). The apolipoprotein profiles of apoCI-poor HDL as prepared by anti-apoCI immunoaffinity chromatography and of native HDL differed only by their apoCI content (Fig. 3). Percent composition of the lipid moiety did not differ significantly between total and apoCI-poor HDL from three distinct preparations (total cholesterol %, 35.9 ± 2.3 versus 31.9 ± 1.6, respectively; triglyceride %, 8.2 ± 0.5 versus 9.9 ± 1.1, respectively; and phospholipid %, 55.9 ± 2.4 versus 58.1 ± 0.9, respectively). Overall, the results showed that the capacity of apoCI to block the lipid transfer reaction was independent of the amount of active CETP, but it was tightly dependent on the amount of HDL acceptors in the incubation mixtures.FIGURE 2Effect of HDL concentrations on the inhibitory potential of apoCI. Top panel, cholesteryl ester transfer activity was determined as the rate of transfer of fluorescent NBD-cholesteryl esters from labeled liposome donors (phospholipids, 5 μmol/liter) to HDL acceptors (range, 0.5-4.0 μmol/liter) (A-D) in the presence of purified CETP (8 μg) in a final volume of 200 μl. Incubations were conducted for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence or in the presence of purified apoCI (concentration, 0.5 μmol/liter). Bottom panel, percentage of CETP inhibition (vertical bars A-D) was calculated by comparing the initial transfer rate in the presence of apoCI to the initial transfer rate with no apoCI added (A-D in top panel). Initial transfer rates were determined from the linear, initial portion of the time course curves. Plotted values and vertical bars are the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. *, significantly different from mixtures containing 0.5 μmol/liter of HDL cholesterol, p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effect of apoCI depletion of HDL on the concentration-dependent inhibition of CETP activity.

https://openalex.org/W2018032976,"A large number of post-transcriptional base modifications in transfer RNAs have been described (Sprinzl, M., Horn, C., Brown, M., Ioudovitch, A., and Steinberg, S. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26, 148-153). These modifications enhance and expand tRNA function to increase cell viability. The intermediates and genes essential for base modifications in many instances remain unclear. An example is wyebutosine (yW), a fluorescent tricyclic modification of an invariant guanosine situated on the 3′-side of the tRNAPhe anticodon. Although biosynthesis of yW involves several reaction steps, only a single pathway-specific enzyme has been identified (Kalhor, H. R., Penjwini, M., and Clarke, S. (2005) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 334, 433-440). We used comparative genomics analysis to identify a cluster of orthologous groups (COG0731) of wyosine family biosynthetic proteins. Gene knock-out and complementation studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae established a role for YPL207w, a COG0731 ortholog that encodes an 810-amino acid polypeptide. Further analysis showed the accumulation of N1-methylguanosine (m1G37) in tRNA from cells bearing a YPL207w deletion. A similar lack of wyosine base and build-up of m1G37 is seen in certain mammalian tumor cell lines. We proposed that the 810-amino acid COG0731 polypeptide participates in converting tRNAPhe-m1G37 to tRNAPhe-yW.

All wyosine bases (Ybs) are characterized by a 1H-imidazo[1,2-α]purine core structure and a strict occurrence in archaeal and eukaryal tRNAPhe (Figs. 1 and 2). Wyosine bases, isolated from different organisms, show variations in ring methylation and side chain structure (15McCloskey J.A. Liu X.H. Crain P.F. Bruenger E. Guymon R. Hashizume T. Stetter K.O.

Although it is unclear if hypomodified tRNAs contribute to tumor-specific properties, these tRNAs support the high levels of translation required by rapidly dividing cells. Thus, despite a good understanding of its role in maintaining anticodon structure, the function of yW in translation is unclear.Although the biosynthesis of wyebutosine has been partially characterized, the genes involved are largely unknown. Several structural components of yW were identified by metabolic labeling experiments. The purine substructure was shown as being derived from the coded guanosine (33Li H.J. Nakanishi K.

In this study, our methodology produced a single “hit” that allowed us to identify a pathway-specific polypeptide-encoding gene that acts downstream from the initial modification event (m1G37). Deletion of the gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces tRNAPhe in a modification state similar to that in certain mammalian cell types, including some tumor cell lines.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Chemicals—Wild-type and deletion strains (ΔYPL207w) of S. cerevisiae were purchased from Open Biosystems (www.openbiosystems.com). Both strains were of the MATα leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 genotype. The YPL207w ORF was replaced with a KanR cassette in the null strain. All chemicals were obtained in high purity from Sigma unless otherwise noted.Plasmids—YPL207w was cloned from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR (30 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 6 min at 68 °C) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctatggatccaataatggatggttttcgtgtagctgg-3′ and 5′-ctccctcctattcctgcttaagctttacccagctttcttgtacaaagtggtcccc-3′. The gene was incorporated into pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen) between the att1 and att2 sites by site-specific recombination using manufacturer-suggested protocols. The vector carried the URA3 marker for auxotrophic selection and a PGAL1 for protein expression. The expression vector for yeast phenyalanyl-tRNA synthetase was a gift from Dr. David Tirrell, California Institute of Technology.Phylogenetic Queries—The occurrence of wyosine in tRNAPhe from several organisms was determined from a data base of annotated tRNA sequences. The genomes of organisms containing (Methanococcus jannaschi, Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Arabidopsis thaliana) or lacking (Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis) the wyosine modification were analyzed using the comparative genomics platform, Protein Link Explorer (PLEX) (43Date S.V. Marcotte E.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2558-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A BLAST E-value of 10-10 was set as a threshold for gene identification.Bulk tRNA Purification—Bulk tRNA was isolated from yeast cells grown in synthetic complete medium (± uracil) containing 2% galactose. Cultures (2 liters) were grown at 30 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.6-1.2. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and rinsed with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5). The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 10 mm EDTA before the addition of 100 ml of water-saturated phenol. After 30 min of vigorous shaking, the phases were separated by centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 20 min). Nucleic acids were precipitated from the aqueous phase with 0.4 volumes of isopropyl alcohol. Precipitate was collected as a pellet (30 min at 10,000 rpm) and dissolved in 10 ml of NB1 buffer (100 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.3), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.75 m KCl). Reconstituted nucleic acids were loaded onto a Nucleobond AX-500 column equilibrated in NB2 buffer (100 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.3), 15% ethanol, and 400 mm KCl). The column was then washed with 30 ml of the same buffer before elution with 12 ml of NB3 buffer (100 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.3), 15% ethanol, and 650 mm KCl). The eluted RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 70% ethanol, and lyophilized.Expression and Purification of Yeast Phenylalanyl-tRNA Synthetase— Yeast His6-PheRS was overexpressed in E. coli as described previously (44Datta D. Wang P. Carrico I.S. Mayo S.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5652-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells pelleted from 2 liters of culture were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (18,000 rpm for 30 min). Yeast His6-PheRS was purified by batch affinity chromatography using nickelnitrilotriacetic-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) (45Schmidt J. Wang R.

Purified protein was dialyzed into HPLC buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded on to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. Yeast His6-PheRS was eluted from the column using linear gradient of NaCl (0-1 m, HPLC buffer A) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing yeast tRNAPhe amino acylation activity were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Purified yeast His6-PheRS was finally concentrated to >3 mg/ml and snap-frozen in liquid N2 for storage at -80 °C.Aminoacylation of tRNAPhe with Yeast PheRS—Aminoacylation of tRNAPhe was performed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 160 μm [3H]phenylalanine (800-5,000 cpm/pmol). The total concentration of tRNAPhe per reaction was limited to 10 μm. Reactions were initiated with enzyme (100 nm yeast His6-PheRS) and incubated for 45 min at 27 °C. [3H]Phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe was quantified as described previously (46Shepard A. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9964-9968Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Identical reaction conditions were used for large scale phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe production. However, reactions were quenched with 3 m sodium acetate (0.3 m final (pH 4.5)). Yeast PheRS was then removed by phenol/chloroform extraction before the tRNAPhe was precipitated from the aqueous layer with ethanol. Phe-tRNAPhe was resuspended in RP1 buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.5), 1 m sodium formate, and 8 mm MgCl2) prior to reverse-phase chromatography.Thin Layer Chromatography Analysis of Acid-hydrolyzed Wyebutosine—Pure, lyophilized tRNA (100 μg) was reconstituted in 500 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 3.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h to hydrolyze wyebutosine from tRNAPhe. The base was then extracted with ethyl acetate (500 μl). Ethyl acetate was removed under reduced pressure to produce a white residue. The residue was redissolved in a small volume of ethyl acetate and spotted on a Silica Gel 60 F254 TLC plate (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). The sample was then chromatographed using the upper layer of a 1-propyl alcohol/ethyl acetate/water (1:4:2) mixture as the mobile phase (19Nakanishi K. Blobstein S. Funamizu M. Furutachi N. Van Lear G. Grunberger D. Lanks K.W. Weinstein I.B. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 234: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fluorescent material was visualized by excitation at 300 nm.Fractionation of tRNA by Reverse-phase HPLC—Purified bulk tRNA (1-2 mg) was loaded onto a Vydac C4 semi-preparative HPLC column (catalog number 214TP1010) equilibrated in buffer RP1 (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.5), 1 m sodium formate, and 8 mm MgCl2). A linear gradient to 100% buffer RP2 (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.5) and 15% methanol) was established over 70 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions were collected every 0.5 min and analyzed for phenylalanine acceptance as described above.MALDI—Mass measurements were made using an Applied Biosystems DE system. A salt-tolerant matrix, 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone containing diammonium citrate was used to analyze purified tRNA. Ions were monitored in positive mode. Masses were calculated from an average of 300 scans.Enzymatic Digestion of tRNAPhe—HPLC-purified tRNA (100 μg) was resuspended in 0.1 ml of 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.3). The tRNA was incubated with nuclease P1 (8 units, Sigma) at 45 °C for 2 h. Fresh ammonium bicarbonate was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m before the addition of snake venom phosphodiesterase (0.008 units, Sigma). The mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 37°C. Nucleosides were dephosphorylated by incubation with alkaline phosphatase (4 units, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 37°C. Digested tRNA was lyophilized prior to LC-MS analysis.Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry of tRNAPhe Hydrolysates— LC electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on an Agilent MSD 1100. The system was equipped with a Supelcosil LC-18-S HPLC column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Prior to chromatography the column was equilibrated in LC-MS buffer A (250 ammonium acetate (pH 6.0)). Nucleosides were eluted using a segmented, linear gradient of LC-MS buffer B (40% acetonitrile). The gradient profile was as follows: 0 min, 0% B; 6 min, 0% B; 8.8 min, 0.2% B; 11.6 min, 0.8% B; 14.4 min, 1.8% B; 17.2 min, 3.2% B; 20 min, 5% B; 50 min, 25% B; 60 min, 50% B; 68 min, 75% B; 74 min, 75% B; 90 min, 100% B; and 96 min, 100% B. A flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was maintained during each run/ and the eluate was analyzed in positive ion mode.RESULTSIdentification of COG0731 as a Probable Wyebutosine Synthesis Gene— For the purpose of guiding comparative genomics queries, a compilation of tRNA sequence and modification data were analyzed for the occurrence of wyosine family compounds in organisms with sequenced genomes (1Sprinzl M.

Significantly, D. melanogaster tRNAPhe harbors N1-methylguanosine at position 37 instead of Yb (53Altwegg M. Kubli E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By using this information and a Protein Link Explorer (PLEX) algorithm (43Date S.V. Marcotte E.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2558-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a phylogenetic occurrence query identified genes present in M. jannaschi, H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and A. thaliana but not in D. melanogaster, E. coli, or B. subtilis. A single gene family COG0731 fit the desired criteria and belongs to PACE (proteins in Archaea conserved in eukaryotes) Group 22 (54Matte-Tailliez O. Zivanovic Y. Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Although the biological role of COG0731 is generally unknown, many characterized PACE-encoding genes are implicated in the organization and processing of genetic material, including rRNA/tRNA maturation and modification (54Matte-Tailliez O.

Consequently, these genes show correlated expression with genes sharing related biological functions. Analysis of gene expression in yeast (www.yeastgenome.org) revealed that during the cell cycle and in response to DNA-damaging agents, COG0731 family members co-express with genes for ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, and RNA metabolism (p > 10-5).Yeast Strains Lacking the COG0731 Ortholog Do Not Produce Acilabile Wyebutosine—YPL207w is the S. cerevisiae COG0731 ortholog. To assess the significance of COG0731 to Yb biosynthesis, wild-type and the ΔYPL207w deletion strain of S. cerevisiae were assayed for wyebutosine production. Bulk tRNA from each strain was incubated at pH 3.5 and at 37 °C for several hours (under these conditions the wyebutosine base (yW) is hydrolyzed from tRNAPhe by cleavage of the N-C bond (56Golankiewicz B. Zielonacka-Lis E. Folkman W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2443-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). The liberated base was then isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate, and the extracts were concentrated and spotted on silica gel plates. After thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3), a single fluorescent spot (RF = 0.47) 5A similar RF (0.48) value was reported for yeast yW by Nakanishi et al. (19Nakanishi K. Blobstein S. Funamizu M. Furutachi N. Van Lear G. Grunberger D. Lanks K.W. Weinstein I.B. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 234: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). was detected in extracts prepared from the wild-type strain, and mass spectrometric analysis of this fluorescent material gave a mass of 377.1 Da corresponding to that of yW (57Zhou S. Sitaramaiah D. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2004; 23: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Extracts from the ΔYPL207w deletion strain lacked the fluorescent material. Thus, the ΔYPL207w deletion blocks Yb biosynthesis.FIGURE 3Thin layer chromatography analysis of acid hydrolyzed wyebutosine. Bulk tRNA (100 μg) was purified from wild-type (WT) and YPL207w-deleted (ΔYPL207w) strains of S. cerevisiae. yW was hydrolyzed from tRNA with acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. Concentrated samples were spotted and developed using the upper layer of an ethyl acetate/propyl alcohol/H2O (4:2:1) mixture. Compounds were excited with UV irradiation (300 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RP-HPLC Analysis of tRNAPhe from Wild-type and Gene Deletion Strains of S. cerevisiae—To confirm that the absence of Yb from acid-treated tRNA from the ΔYPL207w deletion strain correlated with an alteration of the tRNA itself, the chromatographic properties of tRNAPhe from wild-type (tRNAPhewt and null (tRNAPheΔypl207w) strains were compared. Bulk tRNA from each strain was fractionated using RP-HPLC (Vydac C-4 column), and the presence of tRNAPhe was analyzed by testing each fraction for [3H]phenylalanine acceptance (Fig. 4, A-C) (58Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although viable tRNAPhe from each strain eluted as a single peak, 6The high specific activity of [3H]phenylalanine (5,000 cpm/pmol) used during labeling would have enabled detection of rare tRNAPhe species present at less than 0.5% the quantity of the major tRNAPhe peak. they had markedly different retention times (tRNAPhewt = 49.5 min, tRNAPheΔypl207w = 18.0 min). The early elution time of tRNAPheΔypl207w fits with a more hydrophilic, hypomodified state for that tRNA. Similar shifts have been reported for yeast tRNAPhe after removal of yW by acid treatment, as well as for mammalian tRNAPhe isolated from rat hepatomas that were hypomodified (m1G) at position 37 (59Grunberger D. Weinstein I.B. Mushinski J.F. Nature. 1975; 253: 66-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because all tRNAPheΔypl207w occurs in a single rapidly eluting peak, the ΔYPL207w deletion appears to block completely the synthesis of yW in S. cerevisiae. These results confirm that the absence of yW from acid-treated tRNA from ΔYPL207w deletion strain is due to a deficiency in tRNAPhe modification.FIGURE 4Reverse-phase liquid chromatography of bulk tRNA. Bulk tRNA (1 mg) was loaded onto a Vydac C4 semipreparative HPLC column equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.5), 1 m sodium formate, and 8 mm MgCl2. A linear gradient to 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.5) and 15% methanol was established over 70 min at 4 ml/min.

It interacts with protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1) and with the polyglutamine-tract-binding protein 1 (PQBP1), which contributes to the pathogenesis of X-linked mental retardation and neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine tract expansions. We show here that SIPP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. Under basal circumstances SIPP1 was largely nuclear, but it accumulated in the cytoplasm following UV- or X-radiation. Nuclear import was mediated by two nuclear localization signals. In addition, SIPP1 could be piggy-back transported to the nucleus with its ligand PQBP1. In the nucleus SIPP1 and PQBP1 formed inclusion bodies similar to those detected in polyglutamine diseases. SIPP1 did not function as a nuclear targeting subunit of PP1 but re-localized nuclear PP1 to storage sites for splicing factors. The C-terminal residues of SIPP1, which do not conform to a classic nuclear export signal, were required for its nuclear export via the CMR-1 pathway. Finally, SIPP1 activated pre-mRNA splicing in intact cells, and the extent of splicing activation correlated with the nuclear concentration of SIPP1. We conclude that SIPP1 is a positive regulator of pre-mRNA splicing that is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. These findings also have potential implications for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of X-linked mental retardation and polyglutamine-linked neurodegenerative disorders.

Anti-EGFP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-rabbit TRITC-labeled secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-Histone H3 antibodies were obtained from Abcam. Anti-FLAG antibodies were purchases from Stratagene. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The indicated SIPP1 mutants and fragments were introduced between the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-N1 plasmids (Clontech), yielding expression vectors for fusions with an N- and C-terminal EGFP tag, respectively. FLAG-SIPP1 was obtained by replacement of the EGFP tag of EGFP-SIPP1 by a FLAG adaptor. All constructs and mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors for 6xHA-PQBP1 (17.Zhang Y.-Z.

Genet. 2004; 13: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the TN24 reporter construct (19.Nasim M.T. Chowdhury H.M. Eperon I.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Dr. E. Golemis, Dr. S. Stamm, and Dr. I. Eperon, respectively. Cell Culture, Microscopy, and Immunocytochemistry—COS1 cells, HEK293 cells, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. SaOS-2 was grown in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH-3T3 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter of glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed with the indicated plasmids and FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For immunocytochemistry, 24 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 2% formaldehyde. Cell permeabilization was performed by a 10-min incubation in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100. The permeabilized cells were washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS, preincubated for 20 min with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated for 90 min with polyclonal antibodies against SIPP1, PQBP1, or the FLAG tag. After 3 washes of 10 min with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary anti-rabbit antibodies that were labeled with TRITC (Sigma). Finally, the cells were washed three times for 10 min in PBS. Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Jena, Germany), equipped with the Zeiss Axiovert 100M (plan Apochromat 40 × 1.30 numerical aperture oil immersion objective) and using the standard fluorescein isothiocyanate-TRITC filter set. For the heterokaryon experiments, HeLa cells were used as donor cells and NIH-3T3 cells as acceptor cells. 24 h after transfection of the HeLa cells with EGFP-SIPP1 or NLSSV40-β-galactosidase-EGFP the cells were seeded with the same amount of NIH-3T3 cells on a sterile Lab-Tek™ Chambered Coverglass (Nunc) and allowed to adhere for 3 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 100 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to block translation. After 3 h cell fusion was induced by the addition of 45% polyethylene glycol 3350 (Sigma) for 2 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and further incubated in culture medium for 3 more hours. Finally, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 5 min and stained with Hoechst for 10 min. After washing for 5 min, the EGFP fusions were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus Biosystems CELL®). In Vitro Nuclear Export Assay—The adopted protocol was based on that of Pearson et al. (20.Pearson A. Knipe D.M. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) for 5 min in transport buffer containing 20 mm Hepes at pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold transport buffer to wash out all the cytoplasmic factors. Subsequently, an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate) was added as well as 10% (v/v) of a cytoplasmic S100 fraction (Cil-Biotech), and aliquots of the soluble and nuclear fractions were taken at the indicated times during incubation at 30 °C in a humidified chamber. The aliquots were analyzed for SIPP1 and Histone H3 by immunoblotting. In Vivo Splicing Assays—These were performed essentially as described by Nasim et al. (19.Nasim M.T. Chowdhury H.M. Eperon I.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with the reporter gene TN24 and the indicated plasmids. 48 h after transfection the cells were lysed using the passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). An aliquot of the lysate was used to measure luciferase activity using the assay system from Promega. The β-galactosidase activity was measured with o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. The expression of the constructs in the lysates was verified by Western blot analysis with anti-EGFP antibodies. Determinants of the Nuclear Translocation of SIPP1—Under basal conditions endogenous SIPP1 was nearly completely nuclear in all tested cell types, including HeLa (Fig. 1B), SaOS-2, U2OS, COS1, and 293 cells (not shown). SIPP1 with an N-terminal EGFP tag (EGFP-SIPP1) was also exclusively nuclear, but, surprisingly, SIPP1 with a C-terminal EGFP tag (SIPP1-EGFP) was largely cytoplasmic (Fig. 1B). Thus, endogenous SIPP1 and EGFP-SIPP1 are both nuclear. The size of the latter fusion protein (∼95 kDa) precludes a passive nuclear transport. Consistent with an active nuclear transport, SIPP1 has been found to harbor four consensus polybasic nuclear localization signals (1.Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36513-36519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), termed NLS1-4 in Fig. 2A, one of which (NLS1) has previously already been identified as a functional NLS (3.Llorian M. Beullens M. Andrés I. Ortiz J.-M. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutation of NLS1 (K31A/K32A/K34A/K35A) or NLS2 (K81A/R82A) clearly resulted in a cytoplasmic accumulation of EGFP-SIPP1, but mutation of NLS3 (R228A/R230A) or NLS4 (K319A/K320A) did not have such an effect (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, the combined mutation of all four predicted NLSs only partially abolished the nuclear accumulation of SIPP1 (Fig. 2B), indicating that SIPP1 also contains non-canonical NLSs or can also be transported to the nucleus by association with an NLS-containing polypeptide. To test whether SIPP1 and its ligand PQBP1 can be co-transported to the nucleus, we made use of the observation that SIPP1-EGFP is cytoplasmic (Fig. 1B) and that EGFP-SIPP1-mNLS1/2/3/4 is partially cytoplasmic (Fig. 2B). Both EGFP-SIPP1-mNLS1/2/3/4 (Fig. 3A) and SIPP1-EGFP (Fig. 3B) could be re-targeted to the nucleus by the co-expression of PQBP1. This re-targeting was not seen following the co-expression of PQBP1-W75A/P78G, which is mutated in its WW-domain and does not interact with SIPP1 (Fig. 3C). These data are consistent with the view that SIPP1 and PQBP1 are co-transported and/or that SIPP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and is retained in the nucleus by binding to PQBP1. Interestingly, SIPP1 and PQBP1 co-localized in nuclear inclusion bodies and within these inclusion bodies SIPP1-EGFP was enriched in the core, whereas PQBP1 accumulated preferentially at the edges (Fig. 3D). A similar distribution within nuclear inclusion bodies has previously been noted after the co-expression of PQBP1 and its ligands ataxin-1 or U5-15 kDa (10.Okazawa H. Rich T. Chang A. Lin X. Waragai M. Kajikawa M. Enokido Y. Komuro A. Kato S. Shibata M. Hatanaka H. Mouradian M.M. Sudol M. Kanazawa I.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SIPP1 cannot be piggy-back transported to the nucleus by association with PP1, because the latter does not contain a functional NLS (21.Lesage B. Beullens M. Nuytten M. Van Eynde A. Keppens S. Himpens B. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55978-55984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PP1 itself is transported to the nucleus by association with proteins that contain an NLS as well as a PP1-binding motif of the RVXF-type, which conforms to the consensus sequence [RK]-X0-1-[VI]-{P}-[FW], where X denotes any residue and {P} any residue except proline (21.Lesage B.

Because SIPP1 contains two RVXF motifs (3.Llorian M. Beullens M. Andrés I. Ortiz J.-M. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we have examined whether SIPP1 also functions as a nuclear targeting protein of PP1. For that purpose we made use of an EGFP fusion of a variant of the PP1γ isoform, EGFP-PP1γ-F257A, that is mutated in its RVXF-binding channel and, because of its decreased affinity for interactors with an RVXF-motif, accumulates in the cytoplasm (21.Lesage B.

However, this mutant can be retargeted to the nucleus by overexpression of nuclear interactors of PP1 such as NIPP1 (21.Lesage B. Beullens M. Nuytten M. Van Eynde A. Keppens S. Himpens B. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55978-55984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), PNUTS (21.Lesage B. Beullens M. Nuytten M. Van Eynde A. Keppens S. Himpens B. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55978-55984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and Inhibitor-3 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, SIPP1 was not able to re-target EGFP-PP1γ-F257A to the nucleus (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, SIPP1 caused a redistribution of wild-type EGFP-PP1γ from the nucleoli to the speckles, the storage/assembly sites of splicing factors (Fig. 4C). Importantly, a subnuclear redistribution of EGFP-PP1γ was not seen when SIPP1 was mutated in its RVXF-motifs (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data show that SIPP1 does not function as a nuclear targeting subunit of PP1 but is capable of re-targeting nuclear PP1 to the speckles. SIPP1 Shuttles between the Nucleus and the Cytoplasm—SIPP1 is largely nuclear but can occasionally also be detected in the cytoplasm (2.Craggs G. Finan P.M. Lawson D. Wingfield J. Perera T. Gadher S. Totty N.F. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30552-30560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3.Llorian M. Beullens M. Andrés I. Ortiz J.-M. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine whether the subcellular distribution of SIPP1 is subject to regulation. We found that an exposure of SaOS-2 cells (Fig. 5) or HeLa cells (not shown) to X-radiation (5 Gy and 2.9 Gy/min) or UV-radiation (30 mJ/cm2) consistently resulted in a cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous SIPP1 after 16 and 24 h, respectively, pointing to the existence of a nuclear export mechanism for SIPP1. In contrast, the localization of NIPP1, another nuclear interactor of PP1, was not affected by UV- or X-irradiation (not shown). Various lines of experimental evidence subsequently indicated that SIPP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. Firstly, SIPP1-EGFP, which is nearly exclusively cytoplasmic, accumulated in the nucleus after the addition of 20 nm leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export via the CMR1 receptor (Fig. 6A). EGFP-SIPP1-mNLS1/2/3/4, which is partially cytoplasmic (Fig. 2B), was also nearly completely nuclear after the addition of leptomycin B (Fig. 6A). Secondly, in interspecies heterokaryon assays we found that EGFP-SIPP1, expressed in HeLa donor cells, migrated to the nuclei of NIH-3T3 receptor cells within 3 h after the cell fusion with polyethylene glycol and, in the presence of cycloheximide, to block new protein synthesis (Fig. 6B). The murine NIH-3T3 cells can be easily differentiated from the human HeLa cells by the presence of heterochromatin clumps in the nucleoplasm stained by Hoechst 33258. No such migration was seen for β-galactosidase that was targeted to the nucleus by fusion with the NLS of the SV40 antigen. Thirdly, SIPP1 was exported from the nucleus using an in vitro nuclear export assay (Fig. 6C). In this assay, digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were supplemented with the cytoplasmic S100 fraction and an ATP-regenerating system. At the indicated times, the release of SIPP1 to the cytoplasmic fraction was detected by immunoblotting. Under these circumstances SIPP1 was released from the nuclei in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6C, right panel). However, SIPP1 was not released in the absence of ATP and the S100 fraction (Fig. 6C, left panel). Moreover, Histone H3, which does not shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, was not released from the nuclei, whether or not the S100 fraction and ATP were present.FIGURE 6SIPP1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. A, 24 h after transfection of COS1 cells with either SIPP1-EGFP or EGFP-SIPP1-mNLS1/2/3/4, vehicle or 20 nm leptomycin B (LB) were added. 3 h later the subcellular distribution of the EGFP fusions was analyzed by confocal microscopy. B, heterokaryon experiments. HeLa cells (donor cells) transfected with EGFP-SIPP1 or NLSSV40-β-galactosidase-EGFP (NLSSV40-βgal) were seeded with non-transfected NIH-3T3 cells (acceptor cells). The cells were fused with polyethylene glycol and incubated for 3 h with 100 μm cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation. The EGFP-tagged fusions were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. The murine NIH-3T3 cells can be easily differentiated from the human HeLa cells by the presence of heterochromatin clumps in the nucleoplasm (arrows). C, in vitro export assay. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were supplemented with either an S-100 cytoplasmic fraction plus an ATP regeneration system or transport buffer alone. At the indicated times, aliquots of the soluble and nuclear fraction were taken for immunoblotting with anti-SIPP1 and anti-Histone H3 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determinants of the Nuclear Export of SIPP1—The inhibition of the nuclear export of SIPP1 by leptomycin B (Fig. 6A) strongly suggests an involvement of the CRM1-export pathway and also indicates that SIPP1 may contain a nuclear export signal (NES). SIPP1 contains three sequences, termed NES1-3 in Fig. 2A, that could qualify as hydrophobic NES motifs (22.Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, these predicted NESs do not appear to function as such because the mutation of NES1 (L110A/L112A), NES2 (I156A/L158A), or NES3 (L330A/M333A/L335A) did not result in a nuclear accumulation of SIPP1-EGFP (Fig. 7A). Further investigations revealed, however, that the deletion of C-terminal sequences of SIPP1, as in SIPP1-(Δ559-641)-EGFP (not shown), SIPP1-(Δ601-641)-EGFP (not shown), and SIPP1-(Δ633-641)-EGFP (Fig. 7B), re-targeted this fusion to the nucleus, suggesting that the C-terminal 9 residues of SIPP1 are essential for its nuclear export. The sequence of the C-terminal 9 residues of SIPP1 is conserved in metazoa (Fig. 7D) and shows some similarities with classic, hydrophobic NESs, including the C-terminal two leucines. Mutation of the latter leucines into an alanine was indeed sufficient to retarget SIPP1-EGFP to the nucleus (Fig. 7B). In further agreement with the notion that the C terminus of SIPP1 contains a NES we found that EGFP, which accumulates to a similar concentration in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, was largely cytoplasmic when EGFP was C-terminally fused to the last 82 residues of SIPP1 (Fig. 7C). However, fusion of the last 9 residues of SIPP1 to EGFP did not affect its subcellular distribution, indicating that sequences N-terminal to these 9 residues are also important for nuclear export and/or that the fusion with EGFP hampers the interaction of the NES with the CRM1 receptor. The Nuclear Concentration of SIPP1 Is Rate-limiting for pre-mRNA Splicing—Consistent with a role for SIPP1 in pre-mRNA splicing (see the introduction), we found that immunoprecipitates of SIPP1 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts contain all the small nuclear RNAs involved in splicing, i.e. U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 as well as a large number of established splicing factors (not shown). To examine whether SIPP1 also plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing in vivo, we have used the dual-reporter system described by Nasim et al. (19.Nasim M.T. Chowdhury H.M. Eperon I.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reporter construct contains sequences encoding β-galactosidase as well as luciferase, and these sequences are separated by an intronic sequence derived from the adenovirus and human αs-tropomyosin genes (Fig. 8A). Importantly, the intron contains three translation stop signals. As a consequence, when the transcript is not spliced, it gives rise to β-galactosidase, whereas a fusion of β-galactosidase and"

Hemostasis, a complex system responsible for maintaining the fluidity of blood under physiological conditions, is primed to react rapidly to vascular injury, stemming blood loss by locally sealing the injured vessel wall (1Colman R.W.

The highly regulated hemostatic system functions in equilibrium between two extremes: coagulation and fibrinolysis (2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). On one hand by initiating the coagulation cascade, which comprises a network of highly, correlated and controlled reactions and is triggered either by the extrinsic (tissue factor) or the intrinsic pathways (Factor XIa), activating thrombin to generate cross-linked fibrin polymers (1Colman R.W.

The PC activator from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix venom, commercially referred to as Protac®, specifically converts PC to activated PC by hydrolyzing the Arg169-Leu170 bond, functioning independently of plasmatic factors in comparison to the physiological activation of PC by thrombin which is dependent on the participation of thrombomodulin (13Kisiel.

We present the first crystal structures of the PC activator from the venom of the copperhead snake A. contortrix contortrix (ACC-C), a single-chain glycosylated serine proteinase that is a fast-acting PC activator, both in the native and inhibited states at 1.65 and 1.54 Å resolutions, respectively. These results provide information at the molecular level concerning the alternative PC activation pathway that is independent of thrombomodulin, the central physiological barrier against thrombosis and could serve as a basis for the structure-based design of clinically useful molecules and in the treatment of thromboembolism. ACC-C, provided by Pentapharm (Basel, Switzerland), was dissolved to a concentration of 10 mg/ml in a 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) buffer that also contained 10 mm sodium chloride and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals were obtained at 18 °C by equilibration of the protein solution (1 μl) against a reservoir solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) utilizing the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The benzamidine-inhibited ACC-C complex was obtained by soaking crystals for 45 s in a cryo-protectant solution (20% (v/v) glycerol) that additionally contained 50 mm benzamidine. Dose-dependent x-ray diffraction data were collected from cryo-protected crystals at 100 K at a synchrotron radiation source (CPr Beamline-Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron, Campinas, Brazil) where the wavelength was fixed at 1.438 Å, diffraction intensities were measured utilizing a Mar CCD165 detector (Mar Inc.), and the diffraction intensities were reduced and scaled using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite of programs (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Both the native and benzamidine-inhibited crystals are isomorphous, belong to the monoclinic space group C2, and contain one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of ACC-C was solved by molecular replacement (AMoRe) (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) initially using the atomic coordinates of T. stejnegeri venom plasminogen activator (Protein Data Bank entry: 1BQY) (11Parry M.A. Jacob U.

Positional and restrained isotropic B-factor refinements were performed using REF-MAC5 (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structures of both native and benzamidine-inhibited ACC-C have been refined at 1.65 and 1.54 Å resolutions to crystallographic residuals of 16.7% (Rfree = 19.6%) and 16.7% (Rfree = 19.1%), respectively. An analysis of the stereochemistry of the final models indicates that the main-chain dihedral angles for all residues are located in the permitted regions of the Ramachandran diagram and that the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from ideal values are distributed within the expected ranges for well refined structures (TABLE ONE). In analogy to the structures of trypsin-like serine proteinases, the structure of ACC-C consists of two domains (S and S′) each containing a six-stranded β-barrel and two short α-helices (residues: 165-173 and 235-244, sequence numbering is based on chymotrypsinogen) (20Harley B.S. Shotton D.M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 1st Ed. Academic Press, New York1971: 323-373Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser195) is located at the junction of both barrels and is surrounded by the conserved 70-, 148-, and 218-loops, and the non-conserved 37-, 60-, 99-, and 174-loops (Fig. 1, A and B). ACC-C contains 16% carbohydrate, including glucosamine, neuraminic acid, and neutral hexose (13Kisiel. W. Kondo S. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Smith L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21McMullen B.A. Fujikawa. J. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1988; 28: 674-679Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the consensus signal sequence for the attachment of carbohydrate moieties to asparagines (Asn-X-Thr/Ser, where X represents any amino acid) was identified at positions 38, 96A, and 148. In both the structures, clear electron density was observed for the N-acetyl-d-glucosamine monosaccharide, which is N-linked to Asn96a and Asn148; however, the moiety linked to Asn38 was inserted based on the presence of diffuse electron density (Fig. 1B). The three carbohydrate moieties are strategically positioned at the tips of the 37-, 99-, and 148-loops, which form the entrance to the active-site pocket (Fig. 1B) and modulate the selectivity toward macromolecular substrates (discussed below). Two snake venom serine proteinase isoforms, AaV-SP-I and AaV-SP-II, from Agkistrodon acutus, also posses an N-linked carbohydrate group (Asn35) that is considered to interfere with the binding of macromolecular inhibitors (22Zhu Z. Liang Z. Zhang T. Zhu Z. Xu W. Teng M. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10524-10529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, T. stejnegeri venom plasminogen activator (TSV-PA) has a unique glycosylation site at Asn178 located on the opposite face (23Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and apparently does not play a role in the binding macromolecular substrates at the interfacial site. The electron density (2 σ level) for the benzamidine molecule bound to the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp189 is clearly defined (Fig. 2A) and indicates a mode of interaction similar to that observed in the structures of benzamidine-inhibited trypsin-like enzymes (24Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 693-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). A sulfate ion is coordinated by His57, Arg60, Gly193, Ser195, and two water molecules both in the native state and benzamidine-inhibited states (Fig. 2B), which suggests that the catalytic triad is unaffected by benzamidine binding and could account for the residual amidolytic activity observed in benzamidine-inhibited ACC-C toward small substrates (25Sturzebecher J. Neumann U. Meier J. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The binding of benzamidine at the S1 subsite results in significant, structural modifications in the extension C-terminal (244-245e), 99-loop (Cys91, Leu92, and Asn93), 174-loop, and in the 37-loop (r.m.s. deviations up 2.97 Å) (Figs. 1B and 3). The anion-binding pocket formed between the highly conserved C-terminal extension and the 99-loop, stabilized by a disulfide bridge (Cys91-Cys245e) and a salt bridge (between Pro245g and Lys101), binds either SO42− or Cl1- ions depending on the presence or absence of a benzamidine molecule at the active site (Figs. 1B and 3). In native ACC-C, Arg82# (# indicates amino acids from a symmetry equivalent molecule) also participates in the coordination of the sulfate ion by forming a hydrophilic pocket (between Arg82#, Arg83#, and Phe84#, Fig. 3) and binds a water molecule. In benzamidine-inhibited ACC-C, Arg82# also coordinates the Cl1- ion but adopts a different conformation thereby modifying the Arg82#, Arg83#, Phe84# loop. The phenyl ring of Phe84# functioning as a lid moves inwards creating a local hydrophobic environment that prevents the binding of the fore mentioned water molecule. These structural changes suggest the possible existence of an allosteric mechanism functioning between the active-site pocket and the C-terminal extension that preferentially binds Cl1- instead of SO42− in response to substrate or inhibitor binding at the S1 subsite. Superpositioning of the structure of ACC-C with TSV-PA results in 179 topologically equivalent Cα positions with r.m.s. deviations of 0.54 Å, indicating a high degree of structural similarity in agreement with the observed sequence identity of 75% (Fig. 1A). The S domain is highly conserved and the notable structural differences are in the surface loops surrounding the active-site pocket, mainly, the 37-, 60-, and 99-loops which form the S′ domain (Fig. 4). The 37-loop located at southeast corner of the S′ domain, is stabilized by a disulfide bridge (Cys42-Cys58), presents a single deletion at position 37 and a N-linked Asn at position 38, which results in the formation of a truncated loop when compared with TSV-PA (r.m.s. deviation up 5.5 Å). The 60-loop is positively charged in ACC-C due to Arg60 and Arg64, whereas in TSV-PA it is negatively charged (Fig. 4). The positioning of Arg60 and Asp189 creates a polar environment between the S and S′ domains (Fig. 5). Thus, zwitterzonic inhibitors, such as 4-(4-amidinephenyl)butanoic acid, that contain a guanidine head group and a carboxylic tail could bind simultaneously to Asp189 and Arg60 blocking the S1 subsite and restricting access to the catalytic triad.FIGURE 5Stereo view of the active-site pocket for the superimposed structures of ACC-C (white, carbon) and TSV-PA (yellow, carbon).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (dansyl-EGR-cmk) and d-Phe-Pro-Arg-cmk rapidly inhibit both the amidolytic and anticoagulant activities of ACC-C (13Kisiel. W. Kondo S. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Smith L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of ACC-C was superimposed on the structure of the human single-chain tissue plasminogen complexed with dansyl-EGR-cmk (Protein Data Bank entry: 1BDA) (26Renatus M. Engh R.A. Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the relative position of dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-cmk was subjected to energy minimization. This indicates that the interaction between Arg4 from dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-cmk and Asp189 at the S1 subsite is maintained by hydrogen bonds formed between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly3, Lys192Ne, and the carboxylate group of Glu2 and Asn218Nδ. The dansyl naphthalene ring forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Trp99, Leu172, and Val215. These interactions could account for the efficient inactivation of ACC-C by Arg-chloromethyl ketone derivatives. Binding of natural macromolecular inhibitors (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor) would be prevented by the steric clash caused by the indole ring of Trp99 in ACC-C and by the phenyl ring of Phe193 in TSV-PA (Fig. 5). Interactions of these inhibitors would also be restricted by the carbohydrate moieties present on the interfacial surface of ACC-C (Fig. 1B) and AaV-SP-I/II from Agkistrodon acutus venom (22Zhu Z. Liang Z. Zhang T. Zhu Z. Xu W. Teng M. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10524-10529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Another significant feature of ACC-C, apart from the three carbohydrate moieties distributed strategically around the active-site pocket, is the significant positive charge present on the interfacial surface (Fig. 6A) due to the presence of several arginine residues exposed to the bulk solvent that could bind polyanionic compounds. The amidolytic activity of ACC-C is almost completely (98%) inhibited by heparin (13Kisiel. W. Kondo S. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Smith L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) probably as a result of binding at this site. This site is negatively charged in TSV-PA (Fig. 6B) and may account for the role of electrostatic interactions in the selectivity of snake venom serine proteinases. Under physiological conditions, the primary binding site of the 37- and 70-loops of PC zymogen in the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex is formed by a number of polar and charged side chains, which form an extended solvent-exposed region on thrombomodulin epidermal growth factor-like domains 4 and 5 (TME45) (27Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The negatively charged activation peptide (sequence QVDPRLIDGK) of PC was modeled based on the crystal structure of Gla-domainless activated PC (Protein Data Bank entry: 1AUT) (28Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and the interactions formed by nematode anticoagulant protein 5 from Ancylostoma caninium (NAP5) with factor Xa. In this model, electrostatic interactions formed between the positively charged surface of ACC-C created by the eight arginine residues (at positions 56, 60, 65, 82, 83, 107, 110, and 113) and the acidic residues of the activation peptide and the interaction of Arg60 (discussed above) that forms the P3′ subsite with Asp172 (P3′) are crucial (Fig. 6, C and D). Additionally, the three carbohydrate moieties that form prongs on the interfacial surface of ACC-C are probably important in the recognition and orientation of PC zymogen during activation. In physiological PC activation, the carbohydrate moieties are not considered to be important and are not required either for thrombin binding or for cofactor activity as indicated by the activity of thrombomodulin expressed in Escherichia coli (29Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Adler M. Seto M.H. Nitecki D.E. Lin J.H. Light D.R. Morser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23366-23372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The vitamin K-dependent enzyme PC (31Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 355-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is physiologically activated by cleavage of the Arg169-Leu170 bond by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex and functions as an anticoagulant enzyme by deactivating factors Va and VIIIa (32Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional assays of PC activation are complicated either by incomplete activation by thrombin or by the interference of thrombin in chromogenic assays. The ACC-C commercialized by Pentapharm as Protac® does not rely on other plasmatic factors and is clinically used for PC assays by the direct chromogenic method, by the indirect chromogenic method based on activated partial thromboplastin time, or by a functional clotting assay (13Kisiel. W. Kondo S. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Smith L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gempeler-Messina P.M. Volz K. Bühler B. Muller C. Haemostasis. 2001; 31: 266-272PubMed Google Scholar). Since the activation product of ACC-C is not influenced by the inhibitory effect of PC inhibitors, time-consuming adsorption steps to separate PC are not required (14Gempeler-Messina P.M. Volz K. Bühler B. Muller C. Haemostasis. 2001; 31: 266-272PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structures of native and inhibited ACC-C indicates that binding of benzamidine does not involve the residues of the catalytic triad, which could account for the residual amidolytic activity observed when benzamidine and benzamidine derivatives are used as inhibitors (25Sturzebecher J. Neumann U. Meier J. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, benzamidine binding induces significant structural changes: (i) the 37-loop adopts a different conformation, (ii) the anion-binding site located at the extended C terminus formed by Cys91, Leu92, Asn93, Cys245e, Thr245d, and Arg82# (from a symmetry equivalent molecule) preferentially binds Cl1- instead of SO42−, and (iii) when the Nϵ and Nη2 atoms of Arg82# coordinate the SO42− ion, the phenyl ring of Phe84# shields the hydrophobic micro-environment formed between Arg82# and Phe84#. However, when the Nη1 and Nη2 atoms of Arg82# coordinate the Cl1- ion, the phenyl ring of Phe84# flips out and the resulting altered geometry at this site creates a hydrophilic microenvironment, which permits the binding of a water molecule. These structural changes indicate the possible existence of an allosteric mechanism. The polar character of the ends of the active site observed in the crystal structure of ACC-C indicates that zwitterzonic inhibitors such as 4-(4-amidinephenyl)butanoic acid would bind optimally with the guanidine and carboxylic sections interacting with Asp189 and Arg60, respectively, thus contributing to substrate specificity. The potent inhibitory effects on both amidolytic and anticoagulant activities induced by d-Phe-Pro-Arg-cmk and derivatives such as dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-cmk and dansyl-Gly-Gly-Arg-cmk are mainly due to the hydrogen bonds formed to Lys192 and Asn218 and hydrophobic interactions with Trp99, Leu172, and Val215, which simultaneously occupy the S1 subsite and modulate access to the catalytic site. The two significant differences between ACC-C and TSV-PA are: (i) the positively charged surface surrounding the catalytic site and (ii) the three carbohydrate moieties that protrude on the surface of ACC-C, which probably play a pivotal role in macromolecular substrate recognition or specificity. Both ACC-C and TSV-PA share a long circulating half-life and demonstrate high resistance to protein-type macromolecular inhibitors, making them interesting targets for drug design. Macromolecular substrates such as bovine pancreatic trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitors are unable to bind to TSV-PA due the positioning of the phenyl ring of Phe193 and in AaV-SP-I/II due to the presence of extended N-linked carbohydrate groups in the 37-loop. In ACC-C, both these strategies are utilized simultaneously, whereas position 193 is occupied by a glycine, the indole of Trp99 and the N-linked oligosaccharides are positioned to prevent interaction with these macromolecular inhibitors. Under physiological conditions, thrombin depends on thrombomodulin to switch between functioning as a coagulant or anticoagulant enzyme and the TME45 domains form the primary binding site of the PC zymogen, permitting the hydrolysis of the scissile bond between Arg169 and Leu170. In the thrombomodulin-independent activation of PC by ACC-C the positive charge present on the interfacial surface and carbohydrate moieties are important features that could play crucial roles in PC recognition/binding/activation. We are grateful to Dr. T. Schreier (Pentapharm, Basel) for providing the samples of ACC-C (Protac®)."
https://openalex.org/W2064523919,"Protein-RNA interaction plays a critical role in regulating RNA synthesis by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RNAs of 7 nucleotides (nt) or longer had affinities 5-fold better than an RNA of 5 nt, suggesting a minimal length required for binding. To identify RNA contact sites on the HCV RdRp, a biotinylated 7-nt RNA capable of directing de novo initiation was used in a process that coupled reversible formaldehyde cross-linking, RNA affinity chromatography, and mass spectrometry. By this process, we identified 18 peptides cross-linked to the 7-nt RNA. When these identified peptides were overlaid on the three-dimensional structures of NS5B, most mapped to the fingers subdomain, connecting loops between fingers and thumb subdomains and in the putative RNA binding channel. Two of the identified peptides resided in the active site cavity of the RdRp. Recombinant HCV RdRp with single residue changes in likely RNA contact sites were generated and characterized for effects on HCV RdRp activity. Mutant proteins had significant effects on cross-linking to 7-nt RNA and reduced RNA synthesis in vitro by 2- to 20-fold compared with wild type protein. When the mutations were tested for the replication of HCV RNA in the context of the cells transfected with the HCV subgenomic replicon, all except one prevented colony formation, indicating a defect in HCV RNA replication. These biochemical and functional analyses identified a number of residues in the HCV RdRp that are important for HCV RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2129521313,"Identification of cis-regulatory elements and their binding proteins constitutes an important part of understanding gene function and regulation. It is well accepted that co-expressed genes tend to share transcriptional elements. However, recent findings indicate that co-expression data show poor correlation with co-regulation data even in unicellular yeast. This motivates us to experimentally explore whether it is possible that co-expressed genes are subject to differential regulatory control using the excretory cell of Caenorhabditis elegans as an example. Excretory cell is a functional equivalent of human kidney. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression in the cell is largely unknown. We isolated a 10-bp excretory cell-specific cis-element, Ex-1, from a pgp-12 promoter. The significance of the element has been demonstrated by its capacity of converting an intestine-specific promoter into an excretory cell-specific one. We also isolated a cDNA encoding an Ex-1 binding transcription factor, DCP-66, using a yeast one-hybrid screen. Role of the factor in regulation of pgp-12 expression has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Search for occurrence of Ex-1 reveals that only a small portion of excretory cell-specific promoters contain Ex-1. Two other distinct cis-elements isolated from two different promoters can also dictate the excretory cell-specific expression but are independent of regulation by DCP-66.

The results indicate that distinct regulatory elements are able to mediate the similar expression patterns. Given the increasing number of genome sequences, a major challenge is to understand the non-coding sequences of the genomes. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of genes is controlled by a variety of short cis-acting DNA elements (cis-elements) that act as binding sites for transcription factors. These cis-elements have frequently been identified within the non-coding sequences of different genomes (1.Guha Thakurta D. Schriefer L.A. Waterston R.H. Stormo G.D. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2.Elgar G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 715-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Vilaboa N. Bermejo R. Martinez P.

Therefore, identification of cis-regulatory elements and their binding proteins constitute an important part of deciphering the role of noncoding sequences. Investigation of the regulation of tissue-specific expression began over a dozen years ago in Caenorhabditis elegans (5.Spieth J. MacMorris M. Broverman S. Greenspoon S. Blumenthal T. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and has been greatly facilitated by the use of reporter genes such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescence protein; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay. (6.Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5506) Google Scholar), but progress is limited because of the complexity and labor intensity of the analysis. In C. elegans, cis- and trans-regulation of tissue-specific gene expression is known only for a few tissues such as intestine (7.Gilleard J.S. Shafi Y. Barry J.D. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), excretory duct cell (8.Wang X. Chamberlin H.M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), another cell of excretory system along with the excretory cell, and muscle (1.Guha Thakurta D. Schriefer L.A. Waterston R.H. Stormo G.D. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Many of such investigations usually have been done by searching for over-represented sequences within a subset of promoters of co-expressed genes. However, recent investigations in yeast demonstrated poor correlation between co-expression and co-regulation (9.Yeung K.Y. Medvedovic M. Bumgarner R.E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Snel B. van Noort V. Huynen M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4725-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting a substantial number of co-expressed genes might not be co-regulated. To test this hypothesis, we use C. elegans excretory cell as an example. Excretory cell, also called the excretory canal cell, is the largest mononucleate tubular cell in C. elegans, making it an excellent model for investigating the morphogenesis of biological tube. It functions in part as a kidney, excreting saline fluid via the duct and pore to maintain the salt balance of the animal and probably to remove metabolites (11.Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12.Buechner M. Hall D.H. Bhatt H. Hedgecock E.M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Its unique morphology makes it straightforward and unambiguous to identify the cell in vivo. Mutation of several genes has previously been reported to affect morphogenesis of the excretory cell. For example, disruption of the POU homeobox gene, ceh-6, leads to inappropriate canal structures in C. elegans (13.Bürglin T.R. Ruvkun G. Development. 2001; 128: 779-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of function for unc-53 blocks the progression of canal development (14.Stringham E. Pujol N. Vandekerckhove J. Bogaert T. Development. 2002; 129: 3367-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in a mucin encoding gene, let-653, result in an extremely large canal lumen (15.Jones S.J. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several other mutants have also been isolated, which show enlarged canal lumens termed cysts (12.Buechner M. Hall D.H. Bhatt H. Hedgecock E.M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, regulatory mechanisms that control tissue-specific expression in the excretory cell have not been reported. Here, we have chosen the C. elegans excretory cell as a model to address two questions: what is the regulatory mechanism, i.e. cis-element and its binding protein, which controls the tissue-specific expressions in the cell; and whether the excretory cell-specific genes share the same regulatory mechanisms. Strains—All strains were maintained and cultured using standard techniques. The following strains were used: N2 (Bristol); KR3532, dpy-5(e907); VC26 pgp-12(gk19) X; VC924 dcp-66(gk370) I/hT2[bli-4(e937)let-?(q782)qIs48] (I;III); BC06405, dpy-5(e907), sEX970[dpy-5(+)+rCes-pgp-12-260-GFP + pCes361]; BC06392, dpy-5(e907), sEX-958[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pgp-12::DsRed (a red fluorescence protein derived from coral) + pCeh361]; BC10210, dpy-5(e907), sIs10089[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pgp-12-GFP+pCes361]; BC06288, dpy-5(e907), sEX906-[dpy-5(+) + rCes-Cb-pgp-12-GFP+pCes361]; BC06293, dpy-5(e907), sEX911[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pgp-12-228-GFP+pCes361]; BC6418, dpy-5(e907), sEX982[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pgp-4-DsRed+pCes361]; BC10036, dpy-5(e907), sEX870[dpy-5(+) + rCes-haf-4-GFP+pCes361]; BC12036, dpy-5(e907), sEX12036[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pgp-14-DsRed+p-Ces361]; BC10364, dpy-5(e907), sEX10364[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pmp-1-DsRed+pCes361]; BC06295, dpy-5(e907), sEX913[dpy-5(+) + rCesZ-K470.5-GFP+pCes361]; BC06417, dpy-5(e907), sEX981[dpy-5(+) + rCesC18C4.2-DsRed+pCes361]; BC12778, dpy-5(e907), sEX12778[d- py-5(+) + rCes-dcp-66-GFP+pCes361]; BC12781, dpy-5(e907), sEX-12781[dpy-5(+) + rCesR05D11.3-GFP+pCes361]; BC10257, dpy-5(e907), sEX10257[dpy-5(+) + rCes-pgp-3-GFP+pCes361]; BC13573, dpy-5(e907), sEX13573[dpy-5(+) + rCes-nas-31-GFP+pCes361]. Construction of Reporter Genes and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Promoter::reporter fusion constructs were built by the fusion PCR technique as previously described (16.Zhao Z. Fang L. Johnsen R.C. Baillie D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Site-directed deletions were performed by similar fusion techniques. The two primer sets were designed to amplify fragments upstream and downstream of the sequence to be deleted. The reverse primer used to amplify the upstream region contains an overhang that is complementary to the forward primer used to amplify the downstream region. The two fragments were fused together by PCR using the forward primer to amplify the upstream fragment and reverse primers to amplify the downstream fragment. The resulting PCR products were sequenced to confirm the correctness of the deletions. DNA Transformation and Microscopy—DNA transformation and microscopy were performed as described (17.Zhao Z. Sheps J.A. Ling V. Fang L. Baillie D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The DNA concentrations for the GFP construct and dpy-5 rescuing plasmid in the injection mixture were 10 and 100 ng/μl. Pictures were taken for 20 worms each for at least 3 independent lines using the same exposure time (1.05 s). GFP intensity was measured for at least three independent strains using public domain NIH Image program version 1.60. 3Scion (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Only cell bodies were measured. Chromosomal integration of the pgp-12 transgenic strain was performed as described (19.McKay S.J. McKay S.J. Johnsen R. Khattra J. Asano J. Baillie D.L. Chan S. Dube N. Fang L. Goszczynski B. Ha E. Halfnight E. Hollebakken R. Huang P. Hung K. Jensen V. Jones S.J. Kai H. Li D. Mah A. Marra M. McGhee J. Newbury R. Pouzyrev A. Riddle D.L. Sonnhammer E. Tian H. Tu D. Tyson J.R. Vatcher G. Warner A. Wong K. Zhao Z. Moerman D.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. 2003; 68: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The transgenic worms for pgp-12::GFP were exposed to low dose x-ray irradiation (1500 R) to induce double-stranded breaks in chromosomes. The resulting F2 worms were screened for integrants. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—Yeast one-hybrid screen was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System; Clontech). Briefly, three tandem copies of the Ex-1 element were synthesized as two reverse complementary strands with EcoRI and XbaI overhangs at the ends. Annealing of the two reverse complementary single-stranded DNAs yielded an EcoRI and XbaI adaptor. The resulting adaptor was cloned upstream of the HIS3 reporter plasmid pHISi digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The reporter plasmid was then integrated into yeast strain YM4271 to generate the reporter strain. Background growth of this reporter strain was ablated by titrating with 30 mm 3-aminotrizole (Sigma). Screening was carried out by transforming worm cDNA library RB2 (A gift from Dr. Robert Barstead) into the Ex-1-integrated pHISi-1 reporter strain using the LiOAc strategy. Around 2 million clones were screened. Plasmids were retrieved from the yeast colonies growing in His-Leu-agar plates with 30 mm 3-aminotrizole. The cDNA inserts were sequenced and then compared against Wormbase records. To confirm yeast one-hybrid screening results, the resulting positive clones were transformed back into the Ex-1-integrated YM4721 strain. The yeast colonies from each transformation were then streaked onto His-Leu-agar plates with 30 mm 3-aminotrizole. The growth of the streaked yeast colonies was compared with control (YM7271 with Ex-1 reporter integrated within) after 3 days incubation at 30 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Primers were designed so that the dcp-66 cDNA sequence isolated from the one-hybrid screen was amplified as template for protein production. dcp-66 cDNA encoding 122 amino acids that contains the predicted zinc finger domain was used as template to produce protein using the TnT QuikChange Transcription/Translation System from Promega. The resulting protein was quantified using the Pierce Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (catalog number 23227) with Test Tube Procedure and SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis. The three tandem Ex-1 or a single copy of Ex-2 or Ex-3 were labeled by the Pierce Biotin 3′ End DNA Labeling Kit (catalog number 89818). The labeling efficiency was determined as described by the manufacturer. The labeled Ex-1, Ex-2, or Ex-3 were annealed with its reverse complementary strand to form a double-stranded oligo. EMSA was performed using the Pierce LightShift™ Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (catalog number 20148X) following manufacturer's specifications. RNA Interference—RNA interference by feeding was done using feeding library provided by Ahringer laboratory (20.Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11794) Google Scholar) as described. Five GFP expressing L4 worms were transferred onto plates seeded with RNA interference bacteria or control bacteria (containing empty RNA interference vector) at room temperature. After 2 days, 30 GFP expressing L2 or L3 worms were transferred onto three replica plates seeded with the same bacteria as mentioned above and checked for GFP expression after incubation for another day. Loss of GFP expression was calculated as average percentage from the three plates. Genetic Analysis of the dcp-66 Deletion Mutant—The deletion allele dcp-66(gk370) was isolated by the C. elegans Reverse Genetics Core Facility, which is part of the International C. elegans Gene Knock-out Consortium, using a PCR screen of a mutant collection of TMP/UV-mutagenized animals. Homozygous dcp-66(gk370) worm are inviable and most of them die as small, disintegrated adults. Allele gk370 was balanced by pharyngeal GFP marked translocation hT2 in the strain VC924. Outcrossing was performed as follows: Four VC924 worms were crossed with four N2 male at 20 °C. Four F1 self-progeny without GFP (gk370 heterozygote) were mated with six F1 male progeny with GFP. GFP marked F2 crossing progeny were transferred into individual plates. The presence of gk370 in the F2 crossing progeny was followed by segregation of inviable small and disintegrated adults. The process was repeated another three times and the resulting outcrossed strains were used for subsequent analysis. The outcrossed VC924 worms were mated with N2 male. 40 cross progeny without GFP were transferred onto one fresh plate and allowed to lay eggs for 3 h at 20°C and then picked off the plate. The laid eggs were scored and phenotypes were examined every 12 h. BC10210 worms carrying the integrated transgene pgp-12::GFP were crossed to N2 male and the resulting F1 GFP male progeny were crossed into the outcrossed VC924 hermaphrodites. The progeny with GFP in the excretory cell but not in the pharynx were picked up for phenotypic analysis. Similar crossings were done between the outcrossed VC924 and BC6148, BC10257, or BC13573, which carries transgenes pgp-4::DsRed, pgp-3::GFP, or nas-31::GFP, respectively. Rescue analysis to verify the genetic deletion was performed by the generation of transgenic strains carrying both the 9307-bp genomic regions of the dcp-66 and pgp-12::GFP construct. The region was amplified from N2 genomic DNA containing 3188 bp upstream of the translation start and 1882 bp downstream of the translation stop codon using forward primer, gaatggttttcaagagaaaggcta, and reverse primer, tggagagagtatgttcactcaattaca. The resulting transgenic worms were crossed to N2 male, and F1 GFP male progeny were crossed to the outcrossed VC924 worms. The progeny with GFP in the excretory cell but not pharynx were plated and the presence of the gk370 allele was followed as mentioned above. Bioinformatic Analysis—Promoters of eight genes that are exclusively expressed in the excretory cell were scanned for 10-mers that show over 80% identity to the Ex-1 sequence. The resulting hits were used to formulate the Ex-1 profile and generated a sequence logo by WebLogo (21.Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8316) Google Scholar). The resulting profile was used to scan 82 excretory nonexclusive and 223 non-excretory cell gene promoters (19.McKay S.J. McKay S.J. Johnsen R. Khattra J. Asano J. Baillie D.L. Chan S. Dube N. Fang L. Goszczynski B. Ha E. Halfnight E. Hollebakken R. Huang P. Hung K. Jensen V. Jones S.J. Kai H. Li D. Mah A. Marra M. McGhee J. Newbury R. Pouzyrev A. Riddle D.L. Sonnhammer E. Tian H. Tu D. Tyson J.R. Vatcher G. Warner A. Wong K. Zhao Z. Moerman D.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. 2003; 68: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) for hits with over 80% identity to Ex-1 sequence. Promoters of pgp-12 and its Caenorhabditis briggsae Ortholog Drive GFP/DsRed Expression in the Excretory Cell—To identify cis-regulatory elements that direct specific expressions in the excretory cell, we chose Ce-pgp-12, a 3410-bp excretory cell exclusive promoter from pgp-12 (17.Zhao Z. Sheps J.A. Ling V. Fang L. Baillie D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and fused it to GFP and DsRed to generate transgenic animals. As expected, the promoter drove both GFP and DsRed expression exclusively in the excretory cell at all developmental stages (Fig. 1). The dual reporter genes were used to exclude the possibility that the resulting expression was the artifact of reporter rather than the result of the promoter used. To determine whether the observed pattern is conserved between C. elegans and its sister species, C. briggsae, which has been diverged from the former around 100 million years (22.Stein L.D. Bao Z. Blasiar D. Blumenthal T. Brent M.R. Chen N. Chinwalla A. Clarke L. Clee C. Coghlan A. Coulson A. D'Eustachio P. Fitch D.H. Fulton L.A. Fulton R.E. Griffiths-Jones S. Harris T.W. Hillier L.W. Kamath R. Kuwabara P.E. Mardis E.R. Marra M.A. Miner T.L. Minx P. Mullikin J.C. Plumb R.W. Rogers J. Schein J.E. Sohrmann M. Spieth J. Stajich J.E. Wei C. Willey D. Wilson R.K. Durbin R. Waterston R.H. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E45Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), we generated the fusion construct between GFP and a 1160-bp C. briggsae orthologous region of Ce-pgp-12, Cb-pgp-12. The resulting construct was introduced into C. briggsae AF16 strain. The same expression pattern was observed as that of Ce-pgp-12 (data not shown). To further confirm the conserved regulatory mechanisms between the two species, we reciprocally introduced fusion constructs from one species into the other, and observed the indistinguishable expression patterns in either species, indicating the conserved regulatory mechanisms for the expression of the two orthologous genes. A 10-bp Element, Ex-1, Is Critical for Driving Excretory Cell-specific Expression—To locate the cis-element that drives the excretory cell-specific expression, we performed a series of truncations on the 3410-bp Ce-pgp-12 to determine definitive regions responsible for excretory cell-specific expression. As a result, we were able to identify a 10-bp element, termed hereafter as Ex-1 with the sequence ccatacatta, deletion of which caused complete loss of the expression driven by the promoter (Fig. 2A). A search of the TransFac data base (23.Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) indicates that Ex-1 is a novel cis-element. Alignment of Ce-pgp-12 and its C. briggsae orthologous region, Cb-pgp-12, showed perfect conservation of Ex-1. The flanking sequences, however, are not well conserved (Fig. 2B). Site-directed removal of Ex-1 but not Ex-L or Ex-R could completely abolish GFP expression. Therefore, Ex-1 is the most critical element for the observable expressions. Ex-L and Ex-R also contribute to the expression because removal of them caused decreased expression (Fig. 2A). For further confirmation that Ex-1 drives tissue-specific expression in the excretory cell, we examined whether Ex-1 could confer excretory cell expression on a promoter not usually expressed in this cell, i.e. ectopic expression. A 286-bp intestine-specific promoter, Ce-haf-4, drives moderate GFP expression in the intestine (TABLE ONE). A single copy of Ex-1 fused to the 5′ end of the promoter does not cause any changes in its expression pattern. However, Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R joined at the 5′ end of 286-bp Ce-haf-4 successfully change expression patterns of the promoter, i.e. from intestine-specific expression to expression in both intestine and excretory cell (TABLE ONE and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, the reversed complementary sequence for Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R joined on the 5′ end of Ce-haf-4 did not cause any changes in the expression patterns, indicating that Ex-1 and its flanking sequences work in an orientation dependent manner. In addition, the Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R joined at the 5′ end of the 498-bp Ce-haf-4 cannot change expression patterns of the promoter, suggesting the three elements work in a distance-dependent manner (TABLE ONE). Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R are the minimum sequences that can cause ectopic expressions in the excretory cell. Strikingly, the three elements together with its upstream 48-bp sequence from Ce-pgp-12 were able to make the 286-bp Ce-haf-4 drive GFP expression only in the excretory cell but not in the intestine when they were joined at the 5′ end the promoter. The Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R sequence was also tested on the 5′ end of two other promoters: a 1724-bp pharynx-specific promoter Ce-pgp-14 and a 1193-bp intestine-specific promoter Ce-pmp-1. No changes were observed in expression patterns of the two promoters (TABLE ONE), again implying that there is a requirement for distance to the start codon for Ex-1 and its flanking sequences to function properly.TABLE ONEExamination of ectopic expression in the excretory cell mediated by Ex-1ConstructsFluorescence intensity (%)aFluorescence of transgenic animals containing Ce-haf-4 and its derivatives was normalized against that of strains BC10036 and BC10210 for intestine and excretory cell, respectively; fluorescence of transgenic animals containing Ce-pgp-14 and its derivatives was normalized against that of the strain BC06392 and BC12306 for excretory cell and pharynx, respectively; fluorescence of transgenic animals containing Ce-pmp-1 and its derivatives was normalized against that of the strain BC06392 and BC10364 for excretory cell and intestine, respectively.IntestineExcretory cellPharynxCe-haf-4b286-, 1724-, and 1193-bp promoters were used for Ce-haf-4, Ce-pgp-4, and Ce-pmp-1, respectively, except otherwise indicated within the parentheses.100 (37)cNumbers shown are % of fluorescence intensity with the sample size in parentheses.0 (28)NDdND, not determined.Ex-1 + Ce-haf-4100 (54)0 (41)NDEx-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-haf-467 (52)65 (55)ND48eA 48-bp sequence upstream of Ex-L in Ce-pgp-12. + Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-haf-40 (18)89 (63)ND48 + Ce-haf-42 (63)0 (26)ND24-LfA 24-bp sequence of 5′ end of the 48-bp sequence. + Ce-haf-494 (43)0 (18)ND24-RgA 24-bp sequence of 3′ end of the 48-bp sequence. + Ce-haf-497 (32)0(21)ND24-ChA 24-bp sequence of central part of the 48-bp sequence. + Ce-haf-472 (28)0 (17)NDCb-48iA 48-bp sequence upstream of Ex-1 in Cb-pgp-12. + Ce-haf-496 (37)0 (23)NDEx-R-Ex-1-Ex-LjIt is a reverse complementary sequence for Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R. + Ce-haf-489 (26)0 (15)NDEx-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-haf-4 (498)94 (30)0 (27)ND48 + Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-haf-4 (498)91 (52)0 (17)ND48 + Ce-haf-4 (498)93 (53)0 (24)NDCe-pgp-14b286-, 1724-, and 1193-bp promoters were used for Ce-haf-4, Ce-pgp-4, and Ce-pmp-1, respectively, except otherwise indicated within the parentheses.ND0 (10)100 (52)Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-pgp-14ND0 (19)95 (41)48 + Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-pgp-14ND0 (27)99 (33)Ce-pmp-1b286-, 1724-, and 1193-bp promoters were used for Ce-haf-4, Ce-pgp-4, and Ce-pmp-1, respectively, except otherwise indicated within the parentheses.100 (20)0 (19)NDEx-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-pmp-189 (33)0 (12)ND48 + Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R + Ce-pmp-192 (37)0 (21)NDa Fluorescence of transgenic animals containing Ce-haf-4 and its derivatives was normalized against that of strains BC10036 and BC10210 for intestine and excretory cell, respectively; fluorescence of transgenic animals containing Ce-pgp-14 and its derivatives was normalized against that of the strain BC06392 and BC12306 for excretory cell and pharynx, respectively; fluorescence of transgenic animals containing Ce-pmp-1 and its derivatives was normalized against that of the strain BC06392 and BC10364 for excretory cell and intestine, respectively.b 286-, 1724-, and 1193-bp promoters were used for Ce-haf-4, Ce-pgp-4, and Ce-pmp-1, respectively, except otherwise indicated within the parentheses.c Numbers shown are % of fluorescence intensity with the sample size in parentheses.d ND, not determined.e A 48-bp sequence upstream of Ex-L in Ce-pgp-12.f A 24-bp sequence of 5′ end of the 48-bp sequence.g A 24-bp sequence of 3′ end of the 48-bp sequence.h A 24-bp sequence of central part of the 48-bp sequence.i A 48-bp sequence upstream of Ex-1 in Cb-pgp-12.j It is a reverse complementary sequence for Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R. Open table in a new tab Given the significance of the 48-bp sequence in directing excretory cell-specific expression, we asked whether it can cause ectopic expression in the excretory cell by itself. Interestingly, the 286-bp Ce-haf-4 promoter did not give observable expression in both the excretory cell and the intestine when the 48-bp sequence was placed at its 5′ end (TABLE ONE), indicating that the 48-bp sequence function as a suppressor for the Ce-haf-4-mediated intestine expression. However, inclusion of the 48-bp sequence at the 5′ end of the 498-bp Ce-haf-4 did not affect the expression. To map the essential part of the 48-bp sequence responsible for the observed inhibition, we split the sequence into two 24-bp fragments and fused each of them at the 5′ end of the Ce-haf-4, neither of them can significantly inhibit Ce-haf-4-mediated intestine expression. The central 24 bp of the 48-bp sequence fused at the 5′ end of Ce-haf-4 only caused modest suppression, indicating that most parts of the 48-bp sequence are involved in such inhibition. Scanning the 48-bp sequence against TransFac (23.Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) did not give any hits. Alignment of C. elegans and C. briggsae pgp-12 promoters showed little conservation within the region. Joining the 48-bp C. briggsae sequence upstream of Ex-L within Cb-pgp-12 at the 5′ end of Ce-haf-4 did not alter Ce-haf-4-mediated expression (TABLE ONE). We fused the 48-bp sequence along with Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R to the 5′ end of two other promoters, i.e. pharynx-specific Ce-pgp-14 and intestine-specific promoter Ce-pmp-1. No obvious expression changes were observed as opposed to expression without the grafted sequence. The results show that the 48-bp sequence work as a suppressor for Ce-haf-4 at a certain distance to the start codon. It is unknown whether the 48-bp sequence serves as a binding site for suppressors or interferes with the binding of intestine-specific transcription factors to the Ce-haf-4. Identification of Transcription Factor That Binds Ex-1 Using One-hybrid Screening—To identify the Ex-1 binding transcription factors, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screen (Clontech) using three tandem Ex-1s as a bait. Two positive clones were isolated from the screen. One of the inserts contained an in-frame cDNA sequence for R05D11.3. However, no substantial DNA binding domain was found within the protein. A fusion construct of the R05D11.3 promoter with a GFP gave exclusive expression in the intestine but not in the excretory cell (data not shown), suggesting that it may be a false positive cDNA clone. The other insert matches a cDNA sequence of dcp-66. It shows protein similarity to the deacetylase complex protein (24.Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar).

Although CEL is synthesized predominantly in the pancreas, a low level of CEL expression was reported in human macrophages. This study used transgenic mice with macrophage CEL expression at levels comparable with that observed in human macrophages to explore the functional role and physiological significance of macrophage CEL expression. Peritoneal macrophages from CEL transgenic mice displayed a 4-fold increase in [3H]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]oleate compared with CEL-negative macrophages when the cells were incubated under basal conditions in vitro. When challenged with acetylated low density lipoprotein, cholesteryl ester accumulation was 2.5-fold higher in macrophages expressing the CEL transgene. The differences in cholesteryl ester accumulation were attributed to the lower levels of ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine in CEL-expressing cells than in CEL-negative cells. CEL transgenic mice bred to an atherosclerosis susceptible apoE-/- background displayed an approximate 4-fold higher atherosclerotic lesion area than apoE-/- mice without the CEL transgene when both were fed a high fat/cholesterol diet. Plasma level of the atherogenic lysophosphatidylcholine was lower in the CEL transgenic mice, but plasma cholesterol level and lipoprotein profile were similar between the two groups. These studies documented that CEL expression in macrophages is pro-atherogenic and that the mechanism is because of its hydrolysis of ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine in promoting cholesterol esterification and decreasing cholesterol efflux.

The pancreatic type carboxyl ester lipase (CEL),2 also called cholesterol esterase or bile salt-dependent lipase, is a 74-kDa molecular mass lipolytic enzyme capable of liberating fatty acyl chains from cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and lysophospholipids through a serine esterase mechanism (1.Wang C.S. Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2.Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, CEL is also a lipoamidase, capable of releasing fatty acyl groups from amide linkages such as those present in ceramides (3.Hui D.Y. Hayakawa K. Oizumi J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4.Nyberg L. Farooqi A. Blackberg L. Duan R.D. Nilsson A. Hernell O. J. Ped. Gastroenterol. Nutrit. 1998; 27: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conformation of CEL stipulates that its hydrolytic activity on cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols, and phospholipids is dependent on the presence of bile salt (1.Wang C.S. Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2.Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5.Rudd E.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, CEL hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramide does not have an absolute requirement for bile salt (2.Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3.Hui D.Y. Hayakawa K. Oizumi J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The CEL is synthesized predominantly in the pancreas, and is also found to be present in abundance in human milk. Accordingly, early investigations on its physiological functions have focused primarily in the digestive tract, where CEL is postulated to play a role in lipid nutrient absorption. Our recently completed study revealed that CEL plays a significant role in catalyzing cholesteryl ester absorption from the intestinal lumen (7.Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and promoting large chylomicron assembly and secretion from enterocytes in the digestive tract (8.Kirby R.J. Zheng S. Tso P. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4104-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CEL-mediated cholesteryl ester absorption is dependent on its cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity, whereas its modulation of large chylomicron production is unrelated to its cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity but dependent on its hydrolysis of ceramide generated during the lipid absorption process (8.Kirby R.J. Zheng S. Tso P. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4104-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to its presence in the digestive tract and its participation in the intestinal lipid absorption and transport pathway, CEL is also found to be present in human plasma and in the vessel wall (9.Shamir R. Johnson E.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lambardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that CEL is synthesized by human macrophages and endothelial cells (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11.Li F. Hui D.Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The presence of CEL in the vasculature, and its increased synthesis by vascular cells after incubation with oxidized LDL (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11.Li F. Hui D.Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggested a potential role of CEL in modulation of atherosclerosis. Cell culture studies have shown that CEL induces vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (12.Auge N. Rebai O. Lepetit-Thevenin J. Bruneau N. Thiers J.-C. Mas E. Lombardo D. Negre-Salvayre A. Verine A. Circulation. 2003; 108: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting its contributory role toward atherosclerosis. In contrast, other in vitro studies showed that CEL reduces lysophospholipid content in oxidized LDL (9.Shamir R. Johnson E.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lambardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The latter studies suggested that CEL expression in the vessel wall may be protective against atherosclerosis. Whether the presence of CEL in the vessel wall is protective or contributory to the atherosclerotic lesion development has not been clarified. The paucity of information regarding the physiological role of the vascular CEL in atherosclerosis is because of species-specific differences in macrophage CEL expression. Unlike the human macrophages, mouse macrophages do not synthesize CEL (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we have produced transgenic mice expressing CEL in the vessel wall to evaluate its role in atherosclerosis. Results of this study showed that CEL expression in macrophages promotes cholesteryl ester synthesis and accumulation in response to modified LDL and increases atherosclerosis lesions in apoE-null mice. Production and Screening of Transgenic Mice—The sheep visna virus long terminal repeat (LTR) was used as promoter to drive macrophage CEL expression in transgenic mice. The LTR-apoE gene construct containing the visna virus LTR upstream of the human apoE3 gene was obtained from Dr. John Taylor (Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA) (13.Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M. Pitas R.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A 2-kb cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of rat CEL without the polyadenylation signal was obtained by SmaI digestion of the plasmid pSVL-CEL (14.DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the unique BalI site located in the beginning of exon 2 of apoE to replace the coding exons and subsequent introns in the LTR-apoE chimeric gene. The resulting chimeric construct contains from the 5′ to 3′ direction: the visna virus LTR, the noncoding exon 1 sequence and intron 1 sequence of the human apoE gene, and the entire coding sequence of rat CEL. A schematic depicting the approach for construction of the LTR-CEL chimeric gene is presented in Fig. 1. The sequence of the chimeric gene was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequence analysis. The sequence predicts that the entire native rat CEL protein, with no additional residue from apoE, will be produced from the LTR promoter. The LTR-CEL chimeric gene was separated from vector sequence by digestion with ScaI and SalI, and then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Four thousand copies of the chimeric gene were microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs obtained from superovulated female C57BL/6 mice. The injected eggs were surgically transferred to oviducts of surrogate females. Offspring were screened for integration of the transgene by PCR amplification of tail DNA with the upstream primer sequence: 5′-GTGGTGACTCTGTTGACATCTTC-3′ and the downstream primer sequence: 5′-TGGCTTGTAGACATCGTTTCTTG-3′ to yield a 131-bp product that overlaps the nucleotide sequence between residues 148 and 279 of rat CEL cDNA. Transgenic founder lines were maintained and propagated. The expression profile of the CEL transgene in the transgenic mice was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of RNA isolated from various tissues using the above CEL primers, with GAPDH primers (forward: 5′-CATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC-3′ and reverse: 5′GAGCTTGACAAAGTTGTC-3′) for amplification of GAPDH mRNA as control. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the progeny and used to determine CEL expression. Two lines were shown to display macrophage CEL expression levels similar to that observed in human monocyte-derived macrophages (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolytic Activity in Mouse Macrophages—Wild type C57BL/6 and CEL transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally with a 4% thioglycolate solution, and macrophages were harvested 3 days later by lavage of the peritoneal cavity with phosphate-buffered saline. The mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Nonadherent cells were removed after an overnight culture and the adhering cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Conditioned media from the macrophages after 1 day of culture in the absence of serum were collected and concentrated to 300 μl by centrifugation through an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter. An aliquot of each sample, usually 140 μl, was used to measure cholesterol esterase activity, based on the hydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate in the presence of 33 mm sodium cholate or sodium deoxycholate (15.Camulli E.A. Linke M.J. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1005: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein Degradation and Lipid Accumulation by Macrophages—Human LDL was isolated from fresh plasma by preparative ultracentrifugal flotation in KBr solutions between the densities of 1.02 and 1.063 g/ml. Acetylated LDL was prepared by acetylation of LDL with acetic anhydride and radiolabeled with 125I using the iodine monochloride method as described (16.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing acLDL was prepared by incubating 2 mg of human LDL with liposomes containing 2.5 μg of cholesteryl oleate, 0.75 mg of phosphatidylcholine, and 32 μCi of [3H]cholesteryl oleate for 24 h at 37 °C prior to acetylation. The 125I-labeled or [3H]cholesteryl ester-labeled acLDL was incubated with peritoneal macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 wild type and CEL-transgenic mice for 5 h or 30 min at 37 °C to determine lipoprotein uptake and degradation as well as [3H]cholesteryl ester hydrolysis as detailed by Goldstein et al. (17.Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Cholesterol esterification was assessed by incubating macrophages in serum-free medium containing 200 μg/ml acLDL and 0.2 mm [3H]oleate-albumin complex for 3 or 48 h at 37 °C (16.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed, and lipids were extracted for thin layer chromatography separation in petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (300:60:1, v/v/v). The cholesteryl ester spots were scraped from the plates and subjected to liquid scintillation counting to determine the amount of [3H]oleate incorporated into cholesteryl [3H]oleate. In parallel experiments, lipids were extracted from macrophages after their incubation with unlabeled acLDL for 48 h. The mass of free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester was analyzed by gas chromatography using stigmastanol as the internal standard (16.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ceramide content in macrophages after incubation with acLDL was determined based on the amount of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP incorporated into ceramide in the presence of diacylglycerol kinase (18.Schneider E. Kennedy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3739-3748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol Efflux from Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—Mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained after 3 days of thioglycolate activation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and plated in 12-well dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Non-adhering cells were removed after 2 h by exhaustive washing and macrophages attached to the dishes were then incubated with 200 μg/ml [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing acLDL overnight at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then equilibrated in serum-free media for 6 h. One set of wells was used to measure the total amount of [3H]cholesterol loaded into the macrophages. Equivalent wells were incubated with or without apoA-I in serum-free media for 6 h to induce cholesterol efflux. The amount of [3H]cholesterol transferred from the cells to apoA-I in the incubation media was quantified by determining the radioactivity level in the media. Each treatment was performed in triplicates and the data are presented as percentage of total radiolabel loaded into the macrophages. Effects of CEL Transgenic Expression on Plasma Lipids—The impact of macrophage CEL expression on plasma lipid levels and atherosclerosis was evaluated by cross-breeding the CEL-transgenic mice with the atherosclerosis-susceptible apoE-null mice. Female apoE-/- mice with or without macrophage-specific CEL transgenic expression were fed the Western-type high fat/cholesterol diet (TD88137, Harlan Teklad), which contains 21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol, and 19.5% casein by weight with no sodium cholate (19.Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). After 8 weeks, fasting plasma was collected from the animals. Cholesterol distribution among the various classes of lipoproteins was analyzed by subjecting 150 μl of plasma to fast phase liquid chromatography gel filtration on two Superose 6 HR columns in tandem (20.deSilva H.V. Mas-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (21.Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G.A. Hui D.Y. Witte D.P. Misra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each fraction (0.5 ml) was collected for cholesterol determination by colorimetric assay (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Total lysophosphatidylcholine concentration in plasma was assayed enzymatically as described previously by Kishimoto et al. (22.Kishimoto T. Soda Y. Matsuyama Y. Mizuno K. Clin. Biochem. 2002; 35: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μl of each plasma sample was preincubated for 5 min in 240 μl of reagent A (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3-methylaniline sodium dihydrate; 10 kilounits/liter peroxidase, 0.1 kilounits/liter glycerophosphorylcholine phosphodiesterase, 1 kilounits/liter choline oxidase) in 96-well plates. The initial absorbance at 600 nm was recorded prior to starting the reaction with the addition of 80 μl of reagent B (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, and 1 kilounits/liter phospholipase B). The incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C and the final absorbance at 600 nm was recorded. Total LPC concentration in each sample was calculated by comparing the change in absorbance between the standard and samples after subtraction of the background absorbance recorded prior to initiation of the reaction. The accuracy of this method was confirmed by comparing concentrations determined by this enzymatic assay with high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the pooled sample. Atherosclerosis Studies—Female apoE-/- mice with or without the CEL transgene were maintained on the Western-type high fat/cholesterol diet for 8 weeks and then sacrificed. The heart and aorta were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and then formalin fixed with a 4% neutral formalin solution. Fat tissues were carefully trimmed. The upper heart section was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 30% sucrose for 18 h, embedded in OCT medium, frozen, and sectioned with a cryostat at 10-μm intervals throughout the aortic sinus and the aortic arch as described (19.Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 23.Schreyer S.A. Lystig T.C. Vick C.M. Leboeuf R.C. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 171: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The sections were stained with oil red O and lesions were quantified according to the procedure of Paigen et al. (24.Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Human monocyte-derived macrophages but not mouse macrophages express low level of CEL, detectable by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of cellular RNA and trihydroxy bile salt-specific enhancement of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity in the conditioned media (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the macrophage-derived CEL is unknown. Therefore, this study generated transgenic mouse lines with macrophage expression of a rat CEL cDNA to address this issue. The visna virus LTR, which has previously been shown to promote low levels of human apoE expression in transgenic mouse macrophages (13.Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M. Pitas R.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), was used to direct CEL expression in macrophages. The insertion of the rat CEL cDNA into the 5′-untranslated region located in exon 2 of the human apoE disrupts apoE coding and effectively replaces expression of the apoE gene with a chimeric gene that encodes the rat CEL protein (Fig. 1A). Polymerase chain termination reaction amplification of tail DNA identified CEL transgenic mice (Fig. 1B), and reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of RNA obtained from various tissues of these transgenic animals showed CEL expression in brain, heart, kidney, lung, and peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1C). The expression profile of the CEL transgene is consistent with visna virus LTR-directed transgenic expression reported previously (25.Hopkins P.C.R. Huang Y. McGuire J.G. Pitas R.E. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1881-1889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages isolated from CEL transgenic mice showed elevated levels of cholate-induced cholesteryl [3H]oleate hydrolytic activity in comparison with macrophages isolated from their nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 2A). When the assays were performed with deoxycholate instead of sodium cholate, only low levels of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity were detected in macrophages from either control or CEL transgenic mice (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the increase in cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity in the CEL transgenic macrophages was not observed when the assays were performed with deoxycholate instead of cholate (Fig. 2). The specific induction of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity with the trihydroxy bile salt cholate but not the dihydroxy bile salt deoxycholate confirmed the expression of the pancreatic type bile salt-stimulated CEL in macrophages of the transgenic mice. A transgenic mouse line in which their peritoneal macrophages displayed similar levels of cholate-specific cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity as that observed previously in human macrophages (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was selected for expansion and additional experimentation. Initial experiments to examine the impact of CEL expression on macrophage lipid metabolism compared cholesterol esterification activity between wild type and CEL transgenic mice. As expected, significantly higher levels of [3H]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]oleate was observed with both wild type and CEL transgenic mouse macrophages when the cells were incubated for 3 h with acLDL in comparison to cells incubated without added lipoproteins. However, no difference in cholesterol esterification activity was observed between wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages under these experimental conditions, with both types of cells displaying similar levels of cholesteryl [3H]oleate formation after a 3-h incubation period (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, when the cells were cultured with [3H]oleate in basal media for 48 h, an approximate 4-fold higher level of cholesteryl [3H]oleate was found to be accumulated in CEL transgenic macrophages than in wild type macrophages (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the level of cholesteryl [3H]oleate accumulated in CEL transgenic macrophages after 48 h incubation with acLDL was only marginally higher than that observed in macrophages from nontransgenic wild type littermates (Fig. 3D). Importantly, when the total amount of cholesteryl ester accumulation was measured, incubation with 200 μg/ml of acLDL for 48 h resulted in a 2.5-fold higher cholesteryl ester mass in the CEL transgenic macrophages compared with that observed in the wild type macrophages (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from wild type and CEL transgenic (CEL tg) mice and incubated with 200 μg/ml acLDL for 48 h at 37 °C. Intracellular lipids were extracted after the incubation period and cholesteryl ester content was measured by gas chromatography in the presence of standards. * denotes difference at p < 0.05 (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The difference in cholesteryl ester accumulation between wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages was not related to uptake and degradation of acLDL because incubation with various concentrations of 125I-acLDL at 37 °C revealed no difference in the amount of 125I-acLDL internalized and degraded by macrophages isolated from wild type and CEL transgenic mice (data not shown). Additionally, the ACAT-specific inhibitor PD138142-0000 (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI), which has no effect on CEL activity in vitro (data not shown), was capable of inhibiting cholesteryl ester accumulation in both wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The latter observation indicated that ACAT was primarily responsible for cholesterol esterification in both wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages, and CEL expressed in macrophages does not participate directly in intracellular cholesterol esterification. We also considered the possibility that CEL transgenic macrophages accumulated more cholesteryl esters than wild type cells in response to acLDL challenge because of their failure to hydrolyze cholesteryl esters associated with the incoming acLDL. To test this possibility, wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages were incubated with [3h]cholesteryl oleate-containing acLDL. The amounts of non-esterified and esterified [3H]cholesterol accumulated in the cells were determined after 30 min. Results showed the presence of higher levels of both non-esterified and esterified [3H]cholesterol in CEL transgenic macrophages than in wild type macrophages (Fig. 6). The increased levels of both free and esterified [3H]cholesterol in CEL transgenic macrophages, despite similar levels of acLDL uptake and degradation, suggested a more active futile cycle for cholesterol esterification and de-esterification in macrophages expressing CEL. These observations also implied reduced cholesterol efflux capability in CEL transgenic macrophages. This possibility was examined directly by pre-loading the cells with [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing acLDL and then measured cholesterol efflux to apoA-I added to the incubation media. The results clearly demonstrated that significantly less [3H]cholesterol was transferred to the extracellular acceptor from CEL transgenic macrophages than from wild type cells (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from wild type (closed symbols) and CEL transgenic (open symbols) mice were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 200 μg/ml [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing acLDL followed by a 6-h equilibration period with serum-free media. Cholesterol efflux was initiated by the addition of apoA-I at the concentrations as indicated. The amount of [3H]cholesterol excreted to the acceptor apoA-I in the incubation media was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The results represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate determinations. * indicates significant difference from the wild type group at p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One mechanism by which CEL expression may influence ACAT-mediated cholesterol esterification and apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux is via its ability to hydrolyze lysophospholipids. Previous studies have shown that LPC reduces the cholesterol level in the endoplasmic reticulum (26.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), thus reducing substrate availability for ACAT esterification. Accordingly, we compared LPC content in wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages after a 48-h incubation with acLDL. Results showed an approximate 40% reduction of LPC level in CEL transgenic macrophages compared with that observed in wild type macrophages (Fig. 8). These results are consistent with the interpretation that CEL expressed in macrophages is capable of LPC hydrolysis. Carboxyl ester lipase is also a lipoamidase, capable of hydrolyzing ceramides even under low or no bile salt conditions (3.Hui D.Y. Hayakawa K. Oizumi J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4.Nyberg L. Farooqi A. Blackberg L. Duan R.D. Nilsson A. Hernell O. J. Ped. Gastroenterol. Nutrit. 1998; 27: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In view of previous reports showing that intracellular sphingolipid content can influence cholesterol esterification activity and cholesteryl ester accumulation (27.Okwu A.K. Xu X.-X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), particularly ceramide inhibition of ACAT activity and promotion of cholesterol efflux has been noted in cultured cells (28.Ridgeway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29.Witting S.R. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40121-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we ascertained the possibility that increased cholesteryl ester accumulation in the macrophages of CEL transgenic mice may be related to alteration in ceramide concentrations in the cells. Accordingly, extracts were prepared from wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages after their incubation with 200 μg/ml acLDL for 48 h at 37 °C. Results revealed that acLDL-induced ceramide accumulation was ∼2-fold lower in the CEL transgenic macrophages compared with that in wild type macrophages (Fig. 9). The results showing increased cholesteryl ester accumulation in CEL transgenic macrophages compared with cells from nontransgenic wild type mice suggested that macrophage expression of CEL may promote atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we cross-bred the CEL transgenic mice with the atherosclerosis-susceptible apoE-/- mice. The progenies were fed a Western-type high fat/cholesterol diet (no cholate added) to facilitate atherogenesis (19.Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Although apoE-/- mice with or without macrophage CEL transgenic expression displayed similar plasma cholesterol level and lipoprotein profile (Fig. 10), plasma LPC concentration was 3-fold lower in apoE-/- mice expressing the CEL transgene than in the nontransgenic apoE-/- mice (Fig. 11). Importantly, a significant increase of atherosclerosis lesions was observed in apoE-/- mice with CEL expression in macrophages compared with apoE-/- mice without the CEL transgene (Fig. 12).FIGURE 11Plasma lysophosphatidylcholine concentrations in mice. Plasma was obtained from apoE-/- (apoE null) or apoE-/- mice with the CEL transgene (apoE null; CEL tg).

One of its functions in the gastrointestinal tract is to catalyze cholesteryl ester hydrolysis to facilitate its absorption (7.Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30.Weng W. Li L. van Bennekum A.M. Potter S.H. Harrison E.H. Blaner W.S. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also synthesized in human macrophages but not in mouse macrophages (10.Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The current study used macrophages from CEL transgenic mice to show that CEL expression in macrophages actually increased instead of decreased acLDL-induced cholesteryl ester accumulation, implying that the role of CEL in macrophages is probably not related to its cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity. This hypothesis is consistent with previous reports showing that CEL cDNA did not promote intracellular cholesteryl ester hydrolysis when transfected into hepatoma cells (31.Zolfaghari R. Glick J.M. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13532-13538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of the CEL transgene to decrease cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages is most likely because of the low level or absence of trihydroxy bile salts in the cytosolic compartment where cholesteryl ester droplets accumulate in macrophages. Thus, in this environment, CEL cannot function as a cholesteryl ester hydrolase (1.Wang C.S. Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2.Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5.Rudd E.A. Brockman H.L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cells continue to accumulate cholesteryl esters in response to acLDL. The data of the current study revealed that macrophages expressing the CEL transgene actually displayed increased cholesterol esterification and accumulated more cholesteryl esters in response to acLDL in comparison to macrophages lacking CEL expression. These observations suggested that CEL participates either directly as a cholesterol esterification enzyme in macrophages or indirectly via substrate delivery to an ACAT-sensitive pool. The possibility that CEL may serve as a cholesterol esterification enzyme was suggested previously from in vitro studies demonstrating that the incubation of CEL with cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and fatty acids favors the de-esterification reaction in the presence of trihydroxy bile salt, but the reaction equilibrium favors the cholesterol esterification direction in the absence of trihydroxy bile salt (32.Kyger E.M. Riley D.J.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3853-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, in the current study, we showed that cholesterol accumulation in CEL transgenic macrophages was inhibited by specific ACAT inhibitors. Thus, the increased cholesteryl ester accumulation in these cells is unlikely because of the cholesterol esterification activity of CEL and probably an indirect effect because of other enzymatic activities of CEL that may influence cholesterol delivery to the ACAT-sensitive pool. Previous studies have shown that preincubation of macrophages with ceramide decreased whole cell cholesterol esterification activity by ∼50% (27.Okwu A.K. Xu X.-X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism appears to be related to ceramide induction of endogenous sphingomyelin synthesis (27.Okwu A.K. Xu X.-X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or ceramide trapping of cholesterol in endosomal compartments (33.Puri V. Jefferson J.R. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20961-20970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), both of which would affect intracellular cholesterol trafficking and limit cholesterol accessibility for esterification by ACAT (27.Okwu A.K. Xu X.-X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide is also capable of increasing cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded cells via stabilization of ABCA1 on the plasma membrane (29.Witting S.R. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40121-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that CEL expression decreased intracellular ceramide concentration with a concomitant increase in cholesteryl ester accumulation. Accordingly, CEL may be promoting cholesteryl ester accumulation via increased cholesterol translocation to the ACAT-accessible pool for esterification and/or reducing ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells. The ability of CEL to promote cholesterol delivery to the ACAT-accessible pool may also be related to its ability to hydrolyze LPC, thereby decreasing its inhibition of cholesterol distribution to the endoplasmic reticulum (26.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and promoting cholesterol efflux. It is interesting to note that the difference between wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages in cholesteryl ester accumulation was less obvious when the assays were performed by measuring [3H]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]oleate in the presence of acLDL. However, the total amount of acLDL-induced cholesteryl ester accumulation remained notably different between wild type and CEL transgenic macrophages. These latter observations indicated that under cholesterol-loaded conditions, CEL may facilitate overall intracellular lipid turnover by supplying increasing amounts of endogenously derived fatty acids to compete with the exogenously supplied [3H]oleate as substrates for cholesterol esterification. This interpretation is consistent with previous experiments demonstrating that CEL cDNA transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells increased intracellular phospholipid turnover rates (34.Le Petit-Thevenin J. Bruneau N. Nobili O. Lombardo D. Verine A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In view of previous reports documenting a direct effect of ceramide in inhibiting phospholipid biosynthesis (35.Allan D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 603-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Ramos B. Mouedden M.E. Claro E. Jackowski S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37.Bodennec J. Pelled D. Riebeling C. Trajkovic S. Futerman A.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which CEL increases phospholipid turnover may also be related to the reduction of steady state levels of ceramide in acLDL-treated macrophages. Taken together, these observations suggested that CEL may function as a lipoamidase and a lysophospholipase to promote intracellular lipid trafficking between different membrane compartments. Results of the current study also revealed a pathophysiological role of CEL in macrophages. Its reduction of ceramide and LPC levels in macrophages that led to increased cholesteryl ester accumulation in response to atherogenic lipoproteins also resulted in increased atherosclerosis lesion size in vivo. Interestingly, macrophage expression of CEL in vivo also resulted in decreased plasma LPC level in apoE-/- mice. This decrease can be attributed to a direct effect of CEL on hydrolysis of LPC in atherogenic lipoproteins (9.Shamir R. Johnson E.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lambardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, despite the decrease of this pro-atherogenic constituent (38.Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), atherosclerosis was exacerbated in the CEL transgenic mice compared with their nontransgenic apoE-/- littermates (Fig. 10). These observations implied that the increased LPC level is not a prerequisite of atherogenesis and the increased atherosclerosis observed in apoE-/- mice compared with their wild type counterparts is not because of the elevated levels of LPC in the apoE-/- mice. In fact, results of the current study suggest that LPC may be anti-atherogenic under selected circumstances, such as in hypercholesterolemia where the cholesterol is esterified in macrophages to induce foam cells. Reports showing LPC promotion of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells (39.Hara S. Shike T. Takasu N. Mizui T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the ability of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 to reduce LDL degradation and foam cell formation in vitro (40.Turunen P.

Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are supportive of this hypothesis. In summary, our data documented that macrophage expression of CEL is pro-atherogenic, favoring cholesteryl ester accumulation and foam cell formation to increase atherosclerosis lesions in mice. The mechanism by which CEL expression in macrophages promotes atherosclerosis is likely because of its ability to promote intracellular cholesterol esterification by reducing ceramide and LPC levels in cholesterol-loaded cells and lowering LPC levels in the circulation. These results, along with previous in vitro studies demonstrating CEL promotion of smooth muscle cell proliferation (12.Auge N. Rebai O. Lepetit-Thevenin J. Bruneau N. Thiers J.-C. Mas E. Lombardo D. Negre-Salvayre A. Verine A. Circulation. 2003; 108: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), offer a new therapeutic target to reduce the severity of vascular occlusive disease. We thank R.

https://openalex.org/W2128623795,"Adriamycin is a widely used antitumor antibiotic, but its use has been limited by its cytotoxicity in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiac tissues. While adriamycin's ability to redox cycle via one-electron transfer reactions and generate ROS is thought to promote cardiotoxicity, the mechanisms involved in non-cardiac tissue injury are not clear. Here we show that prolonged exposure (48 h) of human monocyte-derived macrophages to adriamycin at concentrations as low as 1 microM promotes caspase-independent cell death. Treatment of cells with scavengers of superoxide and peroxyl radicals blocked adriamycin-induced oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) but did not prevent macrophage injury. Macrophages treated with either adriamycin or the thiol oxidant diamide showed elevated levels of glutathione disulfide and increased protein-S-glutathionylation prior to cell injury, indicating that thiol oxidation is involved in adriamycin-induced macrophage death. Furthermore, inhibition of glutathione reductase (GR) with 1,3-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitrosourea or transfection of macrophages with small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) directed against GR or glutaredoxin (Grx) potentiated adriamycin-induced macrophage injury. Thus, both GR and Grx appear to play a crucial role in protecting macrophages from adriamycin-induced cell injury. These findings suggest a new mechanism for adriamycin-induced tissue injury whereby thiol oxidation, rather than one-electron redox cycling and ROS generation, mediates adriamycin-induced cell damage."
https://openalex.org/W2141760967,"Secretion of fully folded extracellular proteins across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is mainly assisted by the ATP-dependent type II secretion system (T2SS). Depending on species, 12-15 proteins are usually required for the function of T2SS by forming a trans-envelope multiprotein secretion complex. Here we report crystal structures of an essential component of the Xanthomonas campestris T2SS, the 21-kDa N-terminal domain of cytosolic secretion ATPase XpsE (XpsEN), in two conformational states. By mediating interaction between XpsE and the cytoplasmic membrane protein XpsL, XpsEN anchors XpsE to the membrane-associated secretion complex to allow the coupling between ATP utilization and exoprotein secretion. The structure of XpsEN observed in crystal form P43212 is composed of a 90-residue α/β sandwich core domain capped by a 62-residue N-terminal helical region. The core domain exhibits structural similarity with the NifU-like domain, suggesting that XpsEN may be involved in the regulation of XpsE ATPase activity. Surprisingly, although a similar core domain structure was observed in crystal form I4122, the N-terminal 36 residues of the helical region undergo a large structural rearrangement. Deletion analysis indicates that these residues are required for exoprotein secretion by mediating the XpsE/XpsL interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis study further suggests the more compact conformation observed in the P43212 crystal likely represents the XpsL binding-competent state. Based on these findings, we speculate that XpsE might function in T2SS by cycling between two conformational states. As a closely related protein to XpsE, secretion ATPase PilB may function similarly in the type IV pilus assembly."

We demonstrate here that an important function of arterial elastic laminae is to prevent monocyte adhesion, which is mediated by the inhibitory receptor signal regulatory protein (SIRP) α and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. In a matrix-based arterial reconstruction model in vivo, elastic laminae were resistant to leukocyte adhesion and transmigration compared with the collagen-dominant arterial adventitia. The density of leukocytes within the elastic lamina-dominant media was about 58-70-fold lower than that within the adventitia from 1 to 30 days. An in vitro assay confirmed the inhibitory effect of elastic laminae on monocyte adhesion. The exposure of monocytes to elastic laminae induced activation of SIRP α, which in turn activated SHP-1. Elastic lamina degradation peptides extracted from arterial specimens could also activate SIRP α and SHP-1. The knockdown of SIRP α and SHP-1 by specific small interfering RNA diminished the inhibitory effect of elastic laminae, resulting in a significant increase in monocyte adhesion.

Because the inhibitory effect of elastic laminae coincides with the activity of the inhibitory receptor in leukocytes, it is conceivable that, upon contacting leukocytes, elastic laminae may interact with SIRP α and activate SHP-1, leading to the inhibition of leukocyte adhesion. In this study, we test the possibility that SIRP α and SHP-1 mediate the inhibitory effect of elastic laminae. Matrix-based Aortic Reconstruction—We have established a matrix-based aortic reconstruction model to test the inhibitory effect of elastic laminae on leukocyte transmigration relative to collagen matrix. Aortic substitutes were constructed with three types of aortic matrix scaffold as follows: NaOH-treated matrix scaffolds with an elastic lamina blood-contacting surface, untreated matrix scaffolds with a basal lamina blood-contacting surface, and NaOH-treated matrix scaffolds with an adventitial blood-contacting surface. The first type of aortic substitute was created by treating fresh rat aortic specimens with 0.1 m NaOH at 20 °C for 2 h, followed by washing in distilled water for 12 h with vigorous agitation. Such a treatment removes the cellular components, basal lamina, and medial collagen matrix, leaving an aortic matrix scaffold with medial elastic laminae and collagen-dominant adventitia, as detected by immunohistochemistry (10Liu S.Q.

The aortic substitutes with untreated matrix scaffolds and a basal lamina blood-contacting surface were constructed by freezing (-76 °C) and thawing (20 °C) fresh aortic specimens for three cycles, followed by washing in distilled water with vigorous agitation for 12 h. Such a treatment removes endothelial cells and destroys other cell types, leaving a matrix scaffold with intact matrix and a basal lamina blood-contacting surface. The removal of endothelial cells was verified by immunohistochemistry with an anti-factor VIII antibody (10Liu S.Q. Tieche C. Alkema P.K. Biomaterials. 2004; 25: 1869-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The exposure of the basal lamina was verified by using an anti-collagen type IV antibody (10Liu S.Q. Tieche C. Alkema P.K. Biomaterials. 2004; 25: 1869-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To create aortic substitutes with an adventitial blood-contacting surface, fresh rat aortic specimens were treated with 0.1 m NaOH at 20 °C for 2 h, followed by washing in distilled water for 12 h with vigorous agitation, which removes cells and proteoglycans in the adventitia. The aortic specimens were then turned outside in, resulting in aortic substitutes with an adventitial blood-contacting surface. The presence of the collagen blood-contacting surface was verified by immunohistochemistry with an anti-collagen type III antibody (10Liu S.Q. Tieche C. Alkema P.K. Biomaterials. 2004; 25: 1869-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To create an aortic reconstruction model, a rat (Sprague-Dawley, male, 300-350 g) was anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. Two aortic substitutes, either a pair with elastic lamina (NaOH-treated) and basal lamina (untreated) blood-contacting surfaces or a pair with elastic lamina (NaOH-treated) and adventitial surfaces, were anastomosed together in a series and grafted into the host rat abdominal aorta by using a method established previously (33Liu S.Q. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement ensured that each matrix substitute within the pair was in contact with the host aorta at one end. It should be pointed out that it is possible to graft all three types of matrix substitutes in a series in each animal. With such an arrangement, however, one of the three substitutes will not be in contact with the host aorta. Because cell migration from the host aorta to the substitutes contribute to intimal hyperplasia (34Liu S.Q. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 140: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a model with a series of three aortic substitutes will result in conditions of inconsistent controls. Observations were carried out at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days with five rats at each observation time. Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University. Measurement of Leukocyte Transmigration in Vivo—To measure leukocyte transmigration in matrix substitutes, a rat was anesthetized as described above at each observation time. Specimens were collected from all types of arterial substitutes, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, cut into transverse cryosections of 10 μm in thickness, incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD11b/c antibody (Caltag) and Hoechst 33258 (for cell nucleus labeling), and observed by fluorescence microscopy. The density of CD11b/c-positive cells in the elastic lamina-dominant media and collagen-dominant adventitia was measured and compared between different specimens. Measurement of Monocyte Adhesion to Elastic Lamina, Basal Lamina, and Adventitia in Vitro—We used an in vitro monocyte adhesion assay to demonstrate the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of elastic laminae. To collect monocytes for the in vitro assay, rats were anesthetized as described above. A blood sample of ∼10 ml was collected from the vena cava of each rat and mixed with 20% acid/citrate/dextrose (120 mmol/liter sodium citrate, 110 mmol/liter glucose, and 80 mmol/liter citric acid). Monocytes were collected by using a monocyte enrichment kit (Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enriched monocytes were suspended in 15% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a cell count ∼6 × 106 cells/ml, supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. Aortic matrix specimens were prepared with four different surfaces for interacting with monocytes as follows: NaOH-treated elastic lamina untreated elastic lamina, basal lamina, and adventitia. Specimens with NaOH-treated elastic lamina, basal lamina, and adventitial surfaces were prepared as described under “Matrix-based Aortic Reconstruction.” Matrix specimens with an untreated elastic lamina surface were prepared as follows. Fresh aortic specimens were collected and separated between the media and adventitia with fine tweezers under a surgical microscope. The media were further separated between interior elastic laminae to expose the surface of elastic laminae. Separated medial specimens were frozen (-76 °C) and thawed (20 °C) for three cycles. The surface of exposed elastic laminae was scraped with a fine metal wire along the elastic fiber direction to remove cell debris and other matrix components, including medial collagen and proteoglycans. The medial specimens were washed in distilled water for 12 h with vigorous agitation. Medial specimens with an elastic lamina surface were selected by immunohistochemistry. All prepared elastic lamina specimens were incubated consecutively with four antibodies, including anti-collagen type III (Chemicon), anti-collagen type IV (Chemicon), anti-vascular proteoglycans (US Biological), and anti-SMC α-actin (Chemicon) antibodies. Hoechst 33258 was used for labeling cell nuclei. Specimens without collagen type III, collagen type IV, proteoglycans, SMC α-actin filaments, and cell nuclei at the elastic lamina surface were selected by fluorescence microscopy and used as untreated elastic laminae. Fig. 1 shows the presence of elastic lamina and the absence of collagen matrix and SMCs at the surface of prepared specimens. Enriched monocytes were incubated in culture media at 37 °C in the presence of the four types of matrix specimen for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h with gentle agitation. At each observation time, samples from the four types of matrix specimen were collected, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with an anti-CD 14 antibody and Hoechst 33258, and observed with a fluorescence microscope for measuring the density of monocytes adhered to the matrix specimens. Specimens from five rats were used for statistical analyses at each time point. Detection of the Role of Elastic Laminae in Regulating the Activity of SIRP α and SHP-1—To test whether the exposure of monocytes to elastic laminae induces activation of SIRP α and SHP-1, enriched monocytes were cultured in dishes coated with four types of matrix specimens as follows: NaOH-treated elastic lamina, untreated elastic lamina, basal lamina, and adventitia, which were prepared as described above. At culture times of 3, 6, and 12 h, monocytes were collected from each of the four types of matrix coatings and prepared for detecting the expression and phosphorylation of SIRP α and SHP-1. Collected monocytes were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were measured for total protein concentration, precleaned with protein A-conjugated agarose beads (10% packed beads, Upstate), immunoprecipitated with an anti-SIRP α antibody (4 μg/ml, sc-17803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 4 h, and incubated with protein A-agarose beads (10% packed beads) at 4 °C for 4 h. The agarose beads were collected and treated with protein sample buffer at ∼100 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the anti-SIRP α antibody (0.5 μg/ml). The relative level of protein was examined by secondary peroxidase-IgG labeling and chemiluminescent detection of peroxidase activity (35Liu S.Q. Tieche C. Tang D. Alkema P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1081-H1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was stripped and immunoblotted consecutively with an anti-SHP-1 antibody (sc-287; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, 05-321; Upstate). Detection of the Role of SIRP α and SHP-1 in Regulating Monocyte Adhesion to Elastic Laminae—To test the role of SIRP α and SHP-1 in regulating monocyte adhesion to elastic laminae, small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to SIRP α and SHP-1 mRNA was used to degrade these mRNAs and thus knock down the expression of SIRP α and SHP-1, respectively. Briefly, SIRP α- and SHP-1-specific siRNAs were prepared according to the provider's instruction (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Enriched monocytes were transfected with siRNA for SIRP α (0.05 μm) or siRNA for SHP-1 (0.05 μm) by the mediation of siRNA transfection reagent (0.5%, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37 °C for 48 h. Monocytes transfected with a nontargeting scrambled siRNA control, which does not degrade known mRNAs, were used as a control (36Schoenemeyer A. Barnes B.J. Mancl M.E. Latz E. Goutagny N. Pitha P.M.

Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14006-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Note that the transfection medium contains 8.8% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. Following siRNA transfection, fetal bovine serum was added to the culture to make the final serum concentration of 15%. Matrix specimens with NaOH-treated and untreated elastic lamina, basal lamina, and adventitia, prepared as described above, were applied to the culture with siRNA-transfected monocytes. Cells were subsequently cultured with the matrix specimens for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. At each time, five matrix specimens were collected and prepared for measuring the density of monocytes adhered to the matrix surface by using methods described above. The effectiveness of siRNA treatment was tested by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting for each type of siRNA. At 48 h of culture with an siRNA, monocytes were collected and prepared for detecting the expression of SIRP α and SHP-1 by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-SIRP α and SHP-1 antibodies, respectively, as described above (two assays done for each siRNA). Furthermore, monocytes were transfected with a fluorescein-conjugated nontargeting siRNA and observed by fluorescence microscopy for the verification of positive siRNA transfection. In addition, cell viability was tested by estimating the total cell number in each culture dish before and after the siRNA treatment (four samples tested for each siRNA and the control siRNA). Note that after 48 h of culture, a fraction of cells adhered to the culture base. The total cell number after the siRNA treatment was the sum of the adherent and suspended cells. Detection of Elastic Lamina Degradation Peptide Binding to SIRP α—To test the possibility that elastic laminae interact with SIRP α in monocytes, a reasonable approach is to detect whether components from elastic laminae bind to SIRP α. To achieve such a goal, we prepared elastic lamina degradation peptides from rat aortic specimens by using a method established previously (38Mecham R.P. Lange G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 744-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, aortic specimens were collected from rats. The media of the aorta were manually separated from the adventitia under a surgical microscope with a pair of fine surgical forceps. The media were collected, minced, and treated with 1 n KOH/ethanol (80:20, v/v) at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. Samples were randomly selected from the remaining insoluble fraction and used for verifying the removal of medial cells, collagen fibers, and proteoglycans by immunohistochemistry as described above. Note that the KOH treatment removed all medial components except the elastic laminae. The insoluble elastic lamina fraction was treated with the KOH/ethanol mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and neutralized with perchloric acid to pH 7.4, and the resulting precipitate was discarded. Elastic lamina degradation peptides were collected from the remaining supernatant. Monocytes were cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml elastic lamina degradation peptides, collected at 0.5, 1, and 3 h, and lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation with an anti-elastin antibody (Elastin Products), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and probed with an anti-SIRP α antibody (sc-17803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10; Upstate) as described above. Detection of SIRP α and SHP-1 Phosphorylation in the Presence of Elastic Lamina Degradation Peptides—To detect whether the binding of elastic lamina degradation peptides induces SIRP α phosphorylation and whether SIRP α phosphorylation induces SHP-1 recruitment, monocytes were cultured in the presence and absence of elastic lamina degradation peptides (10 μg/ml), collected at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h, and lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation with an anti-SIRP α antibody (sc-17803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and for consecutive immunoblotting by using anti-SIRP α, anti-SHP-1 (sc-287; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate) antibodies with antibody stripping after each immunoblotting reaction. Cytometry Confirmation of Elastic Lamina Degradation Peptide Binding to SIRP α—To confirm the binding of elastic lamina degradation peptides to SIRP α, the influence of an anti-SIRP α antibody (sc-17803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), developed with the extracellular domain of SIRP α1 (1-300 amino acids) as an antigen, on the relative binding of elastic lamina degradation peptides was detected by flow cytometry. Monocytes were treated with 0, 5, and 10 μg/ml anti-SIRP α antibody separately at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently incubated with 10 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated elastic lamina degradation peptides at 37 °C for 1 h. Monocytes incubated with an unrelated fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (10 μg/ml) without elastic lamina degradation peptides were used as controls. In addition, an anti-CD11b antibody (10 μg/ml, MLDP5; R & D Systems) was used as a control in the presence of 10 μg/ml elastic lamina degradation peptides. Monocytes were detected for fluorescent intensity by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL). Statistical Analyses—Means and standard deviations were calculated for each measured parameter at each observation time. The Student's t test was used for difference comparisons between two groups. A difference is considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Role of Elastic Laminae in Preventing Leukocyte Transmigration in Vivo—We used an in vivo matrix-based arterial reconstruction model to observe the role of elastic laminae in preventing leukocyte transmigration through the arterial media. As shown in Fig. 2, many cells found in the matrix of aortic substitutes were CD11 b/c-positive leukocytes (predominantly monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes), especially during the early period. Although a large number of leukocytes migrated into the collagen-dominant adventitia, few leukocytes were found within the elastic lamina-dominant media of the matrix-based aortic substitutes. The density of leukocytes in the media was 58-70-fold lower than that in the adventitia from 1 to 30 days after surgery, whereas no significant difference was detected in the media between NaOH-treated (with an elastic lamina blood-contacting surface) and untreated matrix (with a basal lamina blood-contacting surface) substitutes (Fig. 2). At the end of the elastic lamina-dominant media, leukocytes were not able to migrate into the gaps between the elastic laminae, even though the gaps were apparently larger than the diameter of leukocytes (Fig. 2A, Day 10*). However, at locations with aneurysm-like changes (induced possibly by excessive mechanical stretch because of surgical damage to the adventitia), leukocytes migrated into the medial wall, where elastic laminae were largely destroyed (Fig. 2A, Day 10**). These observations demonstrate that in"

Using microarray analysis, we describe here a functional cross-talk between dihydrotestosterone and interferon signaling. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that the androgen receptor and the interferon-activated RNase L interact with each other in a ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, overexpression of wild type RNase L confers IFN sensitivity to a dihydrotestosterone-inducible reporter gene, whereas R462Q-mutated RNase L does not. Based on our data we hypothesize that in 22RV1 cells, activated androgen receptor (AR) contributes to the insensitivity to IFN of the cell. Accordingly, we show that AR knockdown restores responsiveness to IFNγ. Our findings support a model in which both the activation of AR and the down-regulation of IFN signaling can synergize to promote cell survival and suppress apoptosis.

Tumors are increasingly regarded as neoplastic organs with a specific microenvironment that comprises cells of different origins. The contribution of tumor-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells to tumor growth is now well established (1Bhowmick N.A. Neilson E.G. Moses H.L. Nature. 2004; 432: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). The role of inflammatory cells has received renewed attention with two recent reports that describe the interplay between tumor cells and tumor associated immune cells (2Sparmann A. Bar-Sagi D.

In contrast to the contribution of inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulins to tumor growth, T-cell-produced interferons have be shown to act as tumor suppressive cytokines (4Kaplan D.H.

The recent identification of the interferon-activated ribonuclease RNase L as a candidate for the hereditary prostate cancer allele HPC1 further emphasized the role of interferon signaling in preventing tumor progression (5Carpten J.

Androgen signaling affects normal prostate development and maintenance as well as prostate cancer progression. Accordingly, androgen blockade is the major therapeutic approach for prostate cancer. Up-regulation of the androgen receptor activity correlates with PCa progression and resistance from hormone blockade therapies (9Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 10Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Nat.

Bentel J.M. Hickey T.E. Ricciardelli C. Weger M.A. Horsfall D.J. Tilley W.D. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Labrie F. Luu-The V. Labrie C. Belanger A. Simard J. Lin S.X. Pelletier G. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 152-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The role of androgen receptor signaling in cancer is not fully understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that AR could promote PCa progression by inhibiting apoptosis or by promoting cell survival or proliferation (13Debes J.D. Tindall D.J. Cancer Lett. 2002; 187: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We describe here an intracellular cross talk between interferon and androgen signaling pathways. RNA microarrays analysis revealed that an IFN-DHT antagonism can be observed on a subset of genes. We show that this effect can be recapitulated in vitro as IFN can antagonize the induction of a reporter gene by DHT in a cell type-specific manner. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this cross-talk, we show that the RNase L interacts with AR in a ligand-dependent manner. In transient transfection experiment, overexpression of wild type or mutated RNase L differentially affects the ability of IFN to antagonize DHT-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, we show that IFN-insensitive cells can become sensitive to IFN upon down-regulation of AR expression by siRNA. We propose a model in which either activation of AR signaling by mutation or growth factors or down-regulation of IFN signaling through mutation of RNase L contribute to cell survival and suppression of apoptosis. This model shed light on the effect of RNase L mutation on PCa progression. It also illustrates how inflammatory cytokines can affect hormonal signaling and therefore contribute to tumor development. Cell Culture and Transfection—The breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453, and the prostate cancer cell lines 22RV1 and MDA-PCa2b, were purchased from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, Hepes, sodium pyruvate. Cells were transfected in 96-well plates with a total of 150 ng of DNA and 0.5 μl of FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) per well. The reporter to expression vector ratio was typically kept at 2:1. Empty pCDNA3.1 vector was used to maintain the amount expression vector constant. Cells were treated with DHT or IFNs 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was read 18 h post-treatment using Steadylite (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cloning of RNase L cDNA—cDNA was synthesized and subcloned from MDA-MB-453 and 22RV1 RNA extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Twelve independent clones were sequenced on both strands. Genomic zygocity was confirmed on PCR clones obtained from each cell line. To address whether IFNγ and androgen signaling pathways can functionally interact in a genome wide context, we performed a microarray analysis of RNA derived from AR-expressing PCa 22RV1 cells or breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells that were treated for 16 h with vehicle, 10-7m DHT, 500 units/ml IFNγ, or a combination of both. Both 22RV1 and MDA-MB-453 cells responded to DHT to a comparable extent, with, respectively, 185 and 124 genes regulated more than 1.5× (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). Treatment with IFNγ gave a solid transcriptional response in MDA-MB-453 cells with 309 genes significantly up-regulated versus vehicle treatment (p < 0.01). In contrast, 22RV1 cells responded to the IFNγ very weakly, with only 11 genes displaying 1.5-4-fold increased expressions (Fig. 1A). A microarray study performed in the AR expressing PCa cell line, MDA-PCa2b, showed a similar response to DHT and absence of sensitivity to IFNγ (data not shown). Notably genes that poorly responded to IFNγ in both PCa cells lines, like Stat1, IRF1, and GBP1, were among the most responsive to IFNγ treatment in MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown) suggesting that 22RV1 cells are deficient in their response to IFNγ. Further analysis of data from MDA-MB-453 cells revealed a subset of genes that displayed a greater than 40% reduction (p < 0.02) of activation in the presence of both DHT and INFg compared with either treatment alone (Fig. 1B). This observation was confirmed using QRT-PCR (Taqman) analysis. By this method we found that IFNγ could suppress DHT-mediated induction of the adrenergic receptor 2b (ADRA2b) and of RASGEF1a by 90 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 1C). Conversely, DHT antagonism on IFN signaling was also observed. Under conditions where DHT alone did not affect gene expression, it could oppose IFNγ-mediated induction of a subset of genes by greater than 40% (p < 0.02). For example, our microarray data identified Caspase 1 as one of these genes. Confirmation using QRT-PCR showed that DHT almost abrogates the induction of Caspase 1 by IFNγ (Fig. 1C). Taqman analysis also suggested that both the degree of DHT and IFN induction and the level of antagonism appeared to be underestimated in the microarray experiment; the number of genes that are reciprocally antagonized by IFNγ and DHT is therefore likely to be greater. To test this functional interaction in vitro, we defined a model in which this antagonism could be recapitulated with a transiently transfected MMTV reporter system that has been extensively used to study the transcriptional properties of androgens (19Hartig P.C. Bobseine K.L. Britt B.H. Cardon M.C. Lambright C.R. Wilson V.S. Gray Jr., L.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 66: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We assayed for luciferase activity in either 22RV1 or MDA-MB-453 transfected with a MMTV-Luc reporter in the presence or absence of DHT, IFNγ, or both. Consistent with our observations on endogenous genes, treatment with IFNγ did not significantly influence MMTV activity in the absence of DHT in either MDA-MB-453 or 22RV1 cells. However, as observed in the microarray, treatment with IFNγ suppressed up to 60% of DHT-induced activity in MDA-MB-453 but not 22RV1 cells (Fig. 1D). The difference of sensitivity to IFNγ between the two cell lines was not due to IFNγ-induced cell death as no effect of IFNγ on proliferation and survival could be detected (data not shown). Hence, IFNγ could modulate DHT-induced reporter activity but not basal transcriptional activation from the MMTV promoter only in MDA-MB-453 cells. Taken together these observations demonstrated that DHT and interferon modulate each others signaling on a subset of endogenous genes as well as in the context of a reporter system. The down-regulation of IFN-induced transcriptional activation did not appear to result from DHT down-regulating the genes that control the IFNγ signal transduction pathways as DHT had no effect on IFN-mediated up-regulation of genes involved in transduction of interferon action like Stat1 or IRF1 (Fig. 1B). The oligoadenylate synthase-RNase L signaling pathway is regulated by IFNs and mediates part of their antiviral activities (20Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Mutations of RNase L have been linked to familial PCa (21Casey G. Neville P.J. Plummer S.J. Xiang Y. Krumroy L.M.

Murakami J. Plummer S. Klein E.A. Carpten J.D. Trent J.M. Isaacs W.B. Casey G. Silverman R.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6795-6801PubMed Google Scholar). We sequenced RNase L cDNA derived from 22RV1 and MDA-MBA-453 and found that both cell lines harbored a homozygous D541E mutation for which no functional phenotype has been described. Furthermore, both cell lines also carried a R462Q mutation. However MDA-MB-453 cells were heterozygous for this mutation whereas 22RV1 were homozygous (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the R462Q mutation is associated with hereditary PCa and results in reduced RNase L homodimerization and activity (7Xiang Y. Wang Z. Murakami J. Plummer S. Klein E.A. Carpten J.D. Trent J.M. Isaacs W.B. Casey G. Silverman R.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6795-6801PubMed Google Scholar, 21Casey G. Neville P.J. Plummer S.J. Xiang Y. Krumroy L.M. Klein E.A. Catalona W.J. Nupponen N. Carpten J.D. Trent J.M. Silverman R.H. Witte J.S. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Examination of the RNase L sequence revealed the presence of two LXXLL motifs at positions 187 and 583. This motif has been shown to mediate interaction with members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (24White J.H. Fernandes I. Mader S. Yang X.J. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 68: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential interaction between RNase L and the androgen receptor that would provide a mechanism for the reciprocal modulation of the two pathways. Testing for interaction between the two proteins by GST pull-down experiments revealed that AR and RNase L can interact with each other. As shown in Fig. 2B, under conditions where little or no interaction was detected between RNase L and GST, an ARLBD-GST fusion protein could readily pull-down RNase L. Addition of 100 nm DHT during the incubation and washes did not affect the interaction suggesting that, at least in vitro, the interaction is not hormone dependent (Fig. 2B). Introduction of the R462Q and D541E mutations into RNase L (mRNase L) did not affect interaction with AR (Fig. 2B, right panel). To identify regions of RNase L that are important for interaction, amino and carboxyl-terminal deletions mutants were assayed in GST pull-down experiments. Deletion of up to 400 NH2-terminal amino acids did not significantly alter AR-RNase L interaction (data not shown). In contrast, deletion of the last carboxyl-terminal 170 amino acid residues greatly diminished the interaction (lane B, Fig. 2C). Further deletion of 170 amino acid residues almost completely abolished interaction with AR (lane C, Fig. 2C) indicating that both the kinase-like domain and the RNase domain of the protein are important for interaction with AR. Interestingly, under conditions where interaction with ARLBD could be readily detected, RNase L did not interact with the glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain GRLBD in the presence or absence of dexamethazone (Fig. 2C, lane A, far right), suggesting that interaction is restricted to AR. To confirm this interaction in a cellular context, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments on MDA-MB-453 extracts. Whereas a control IgG antibody could not immunoprecipitate AR or RNase L (data not shown), we found that RNase L co-immunoprecipitates with an AR-specific antibody (Fig. 2D). In contrast to GST pull-down data, treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells with 100 nm DHT for 60 min resulted in increased interaction between AR and RNase L compared with Me2SO-treated extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation using a Rnase L-specific antibody gave similar data (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that in MDA-MB-453, AR and RNase L interact in a ligand-dependent manner. In light of IFNγ effect on DHT-induced gene transcription (Fig. 1, B and D), and of the interaction between RNase L and AR, we tested the effect of IFNγ on DHT-mediated induction of the MMTV reporter system in the context of overexpressed wild type or mutated RNase L. Co-transfection of wild type RNase L expression vector had no effect on DHT induction of the MMTV promoter in the absence of IFNγ, not even at higher RNase L-to-reporter ratios (Fig. 3A). However, in cells treated with 500 units/ml IFNγ, overexpression of RNase L led to a marked attenuation of DHT-mediated transcriptional activation. This effect was dose-dependent, as increasing amounts of cotransfected Rnase L expression resulted in further reduction of DHT-induced activation by IFNγ (Fig. 3B). In contrast, similar expression level of mRNase L did not affect DHT induction of the MMTV promoter activity even in the presence of IFNγ (Fig. 3, C and D). Under similar conditions, overexpressed wild type RNase L did not confer the MMTV promoter sensitivity to IFNγ in 22RV1 cells (data not shown). The lack of effect of IFNγ in the context of overexpressed mutated RNase L in MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 3D) or of overexpressed wild type RNase L in 22RV1 cells (data not shown) suggests that RNase L activity might not be the sole determinant in this mechanism, since mutant R462Q activity is not totally abrogated (7Xiang Y. Wang Z. Murakami J. Plummer S. Klein E.A. Carpten J.D. Trent J.M. Isaacs W.B. Casey G. Silverman R.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6795-6801PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the reduced activity of the R462Q mutant compounded to its reduced ability to dimerize contributes to the lack of IFNγ effect. Alternatively the D541E mutation could affect RNase L properties in the context of its heterodimerization with AR. The MMTV promoter is also responsive to GR agonists. Consistent with the lack of RNase L binding to GST-GRLBD (Fig. 2C), co-transfection of either wild type or mutated RNase L did not affect induction of the MMTV promoter by dexamethasone (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data suggest that the level of RNase L activity plays an important and selective role in IFNγ-mediated down-regulation of AR signaling. 22RV1 cells have high level expression of AR and are androgen-independent for growth (25Sirotnak F.M. She Y. Khokhar N.Z. Hayes P. Gerald W. Scher H.I. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 41: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Sirotnak F.M. She Y. Lee F. Chen J. Scher H.I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3870-3876PubMed Google Scholar). In the light of our findings, it is conceivable that increased AR activity might account for 22RV1 lack of response to IFNs. To test for this hypothesis, we down-regulated AR expression in 22RV1 cells using siRNA and then monitored the effect of IFNγ on genes that had previously been found in our microarray analysis to be highly induced by IFNγ in MDA-MB-453 cells but only marginally induced in 22RV1 cells. Transfection of AR-specific siRNA in 22RV1 cells resulted in a specific and pronounced down-regulation of AR mRNA (supplemental Fig. 1) and protein (Fig. 3F, inset) that persisted for at least 48 h. Consistent with our microarray data, Stat1 was marginally activated by IFNγ in naïve 22RV1 cells or cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA (NS siRNA) (Fig. 3F). Strikingly, down-regulation of AR expression was sufficient to restore responsiveness to IFNγ (Fig. 3F). Similar results were obtained with GBP1 genes (data not shown). These data demonstrate that, in the absence of DHT, activated AR can suppress response to interferon in PCa cells. The significance of interferon signaling to prostate cancer progression is not entirely understood. RNase L acts as a tumor suppressor that, in the presence of interferons, stimulates apoptosis in prostate cells (6Silverman R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Xiang Y. Wang Z. Murakami J. Plummer S. Klein E.A. Carpten J.D. Trent J.M. Isaacs W.B. Casey G. Silverman R.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6795-6801PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many attempts to characterize pathways involved in PCa tumor progression have implicated IFN signaling. Proteomic analysis revealed a down-regulation of IFN-inducible genes in cancer versus normal epithelial cells derived from the same patient (27Nagano K. Masters J.R. Akpan A. Yang A. Corless S. Wood C. Hastie C. Zvelebil M. Cramer R. Naaby-Hansen S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, Shou et al. (28Shou J. Soriano R. Hayward S.W. Cunha G.R. Williams P.M. Gao W.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have shown that the acquisition of tumorigenic characteristics by BPH1 cells is accompanied by a down-regulation of IFN-responsive genes. An earlier report also showed that transition of LNCaP cells to an androgen-independent state is associated with a reduction of AR expression and a concomitant up-regulation of IFN-induced genes (29Vaarala M.H. Porvari K. Kyllonen A. Vihko P. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Significantly, many of the IFN-inducible genes shown by us to be sensitive to AR signaling, like IFIT IFI35, GBP2, and MX1, where found to be dysregulated in all three studies. In light of our data, we suggest that androgen signaling contributes to the down-regulation of IFN-induced genes during the transition from benign to malignant phenotype. Our data support a model whereby, under normal circumstances, androgens and interferons balance the effect of each other (Fig. 3G, top). Activation of AR, by ligands, cytokines, or mutation, directly affects cell survival through AR signaling but also reduce tumor suppression by IFN signaling (Fig. 3G, middle). Although a contribution of other branches of the interferons signaling, like MX1 or PKR, cannot be excluded on the basis of our observations, we show evidences that AR-IFN cross-talk involves the oligoadenylate synthase-RNase L pathway. Our data further suggest that mutations affecting IFN signaling, like HPC1, attenuate both the antiproliferative effect of IFN and the down-regulation of AR signaling by IFN, thereby exacerbating the effect of activated androgen signaling on cell survival and proliferation (Fig. 3G, bottom). The molecular mechanisms by which interaction between AR and RNase L could mediate a reciprocal antagonism between DHT and IFN are not clear. Since both proteins function as a homodimer, it is conceivable that 2′-5′A- or DHT-mediated heterodimerization could affect both RNase L and AR activities. This notion is supported by our observation that overexpression of the dimerization-deficient R462Q RNase L mutant could not antagonize DHT activity in our system. Alternatively, AR could recruit RNase L to nascent RNAs at the promoter of DHT-regulated genes thereby targeting them for IFN-stimulated and specific degradation. RNase L has been shown to attenuate IFN response by destabilizing mRNAs (30Li X.-L. Blackford J.A. Judge C.S. Liu M. Xiao W. Kalvakolanu D.V. Hassel B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8880-8888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this context DHT-dependent interaction with AR could enhance this activity. The cross-talk we described here can account for the earlier tumor onset observed in a subset of HPC1 patients (23Rokman A. Ikonen T. Seppala E.H. Nupponen N. Autio V. Mononen N. Bailey-Wilson J. Trent J. Carpten J. Matikainen M.P. Koivisto P.A. Tammela T.L. Kallioniemi O.P. Schleutker J. Am. J. Hum.

On a broader context, our findings document how the dysregulation of distinct signaling pathways can synergize and promote cancer cells survival and tumor progression.

The underlying disaggregation reaction is dependent on ATP hydrolysis at both AAA cassettes of ClpB but the role of each AAA cassette in the reaction cycle is largely unknown. Here we analyze the activity of the separately expressed and purified nucleotide binding domains of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus. The two fragments show different biochemical properties: the first construct is inactive in ATPase activity assays and binds nucleotides weakly, the second construct has a very high ATPase activity and interacts tightly with nucleotides. Both individual fragments have lost their chaperone function and are not able to form large oligomers. When combined in solution, however, the two fragments form a stable heterodimer with oligomerization capacities equivalent to wild-type ClpB. This non-covalent complex regains activity in reactivating protein aggregates in cooperation with the DnaK chaperone system. Upon complex formation the ATPase activity of fragment 2 is reduced to a level similar to wild-type ClpB. Hence functional ClpB can be reassembled from its isolated AAA cassettes showing that covalent linkage of these domains is not a prerequisite for the chaperone activity. The observation that the intrinsically high ATPase activity of AAA2 is suppressed by AAA1 allows a hypothetical assignment of their mechanistic function. Whereas the energy gained upon ATP hydrolysis at the AAA2 is likely to drive a conformational change of the structure of ClpB, AAA1 might function as a regulator of the chaperone cycle.

ClpB co-operates with the DnaK chaperone system consisting of the principal component DnaK and the co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE in the disaggregation and reactivation of protein aggregates. This chaperone network was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be essential for the survival of yeast at elevated temperatures (1Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this chaperone-mediated thermotolerance was elucidated and linked to the protein disaggregation activity of the ClpB-DnaK chaperone network (2Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This reaction is strictly dependent on the presence and hydrolysis of ATP. In Escherichia coli 25% of the heat-labile proteins were found to interact with these chaperones under heat shock conditions, indicating a broad substrate specificity of the ClpB-DnaK system in vivo and a preference for large multidomain proteins as substrates (3Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rudiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of ClpB and the DnaK system was also studied in vitro using a variety of substrate proteins (2Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). AAA cassettes consist of a core nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal subdomain. The core domain contains the classical Walker motifs characteristic of P-loop ATPases (11Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 12Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal subdomain has a high content of α-helices. The recently solved crystal structure of the ClpB monomer/trimer from Tetrahymena thermophilus and sequence comparisons within the Clp protein family reveal that ClpB can be divided into four distinct domains. An N-terminal domain precedes the first AAA cassette, which has an insertion called middle (linker) region. This domain is followed by the second AAA cassette of ClpB. A number of biochemical studies give insight into the structures and functions of the individual domains of ClpB (13Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, which precedes the first AAA cassette, consists of two 75-amino acid residue long repeats (Fig. 1A). The structure of full-length ClpB shows that the N-terminal domain is rather mobile and does not interact tightly with the first AAA cassette. In the structure of the isolated N-domain of ClpB from E. coli a small hydrophobic patch was identified. This area was supposed to be important for interactions with substrates (14Li J. Sha B. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the N-domain is dispensable for chaperone activity in vivo and in vitro (8Beinker P.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In ClpA, the N-terminal domain interacts with an adaptor protein, which influences substrate specificity (17Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). An adaptor protein of ClpB has not been identified and therefore the function of the N-domain of ClpB is not completely understood. Both AAA cassettes of ClpB must be functional for chaperone activity (2Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Walker A or Walker B motifs lead to a loss of chaperone activity and show a complex pattern of effects on the properties of ClpB. Mutations in the Walker A motif of the first AAA cassette affect the steady state ATPase activity of ClpB from T. thermophilus and E. coli (15Mogk A. Schlieker C. Strub C. Rist W. Weibezahn J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17615-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally the oligomerization capacity is reduced and the chaperone function severely impaired. The mutations in the Walker A motif of the first AAA cassette do not affect the nucleotide binding of ClpB, indicating that the second AAA cassette has a high affinity for nucleotides (18Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly ATP hydrolysis at the first AAA cassette is not essential for oligomerization. Proteins with mutations in the Walker B motif show reduced ATPase activity but still bind nucleotides and do not exhibit assembly defects (15Mogk A. Schlieker C. Strub C. Rist W. Weibezahn J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The importance of the first AAA cassette for oligomerization can be explained with residues of adjacent subunits within the ClpB hexamer interacting with the nucleotide bound to the preceding AAA cassette (13Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A unique feature of ClpB is an insertion in the first AAA cassette. This middle domain formerly also called the linker domain is not found in other Clp proteins. It is inserted in a loop of the helical subdomain of the first AAA cassette. In the ClpB structure this insertion forms a long coiled-coil structure composed of two leucine-rich segments (13Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The domain protrudes widely from the core of the molecule, has relatively few contacts to the rest of the molecule, and shows a high degree of flexibility in the structure. The middle region and its flexible conformation were shown to be essential for the chaperone activity of ClpB in vitro (13Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Mogk A. Schlieker C. Strub C. Rist W. Weibezahn J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17615-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Following this insertion the first AAA cassette continues with an α-helix connecting the two AAA cassettes of ClpB. Mutations in the Walker A motif of the second AAA cassette affect the ATPase activity of ClpB from T. thermophilus, however, their effect on oligomerization is less pronounced than for the first AAA cassette (18Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Similar results are published for ClpB from E. coli, but interestingly in Hsp104 from S. cerevisiae the functions of the AAA cassettes seem to be reversed. Here mutations in the first AAA cassette eliminate ATP hydrolysis but do not effect oligomerization, whereas mutations in the P-loop of AAA cassette 2 severely impair oligomerization and reduce ATPase activity (15Mogk A.

These findings show that for full steady state ATPase activity as well as chaperone function of ClpB cooperativity of the two AAA cassettes is necessary. In this study we examined the biochemical properties and the interactions of the two nucleotide binding domains of ClpB from T. thermophilus. A comparison of nucleotide binding and ATPase properties of the individual fragments and the chaperoning competent reassembled complex indicates that: 1) covalent linkage between the two nucleotide domains of ClpB is not necessary for functional coupling and 2) the presence of NBD1 strongly suppresses an intrinsically high ATPase activity of NBD2, which indicates a tentative assignment for the role of this hydrolysis step. Mutagenesis—Constructs for the two fragments (ClpB-(141-519) and ClpB-(519-854)) were produced by PCR-directed mutagenesis using petRS-ClpB as template (18Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and EcoRI. The DNA fragments were cloned into NdeI-EcoRI-restricted vector pet28a (Novagen) coding for proteins with an N-terminal His tag and the sequences of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—ClpB, ClpBΔN, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE from T. thermophilus were expressed and purified as described previously (8Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R.

The proteins with N-terminal His tags were expressed in E. coli Rosetta DE3 cells (Novagen) in 2× YT medium at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.6 the expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) and the cells were harvested after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C. Proteins with N-terminal His tags were purified using a Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After Ni-NTA chromatography protein containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 5mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol). His tags were removed by thrombin cleavage using 1 unit of thrombin per 10 mg of recombinant protein and incubation at 37 °C. The cleaved off His tags and undigested protein were removed by chromatography with Ni-NTA. Remaining impurities were removed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superset 75 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCL, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA; 2 mm dithioerythritol, 10% glycerol). After thrombin cleavage four additional amino acids (GSHM) remained on the N terminus of the recombinant proteins as a consequence of cloning in pet28a. Protein concentrations were measured using the methods of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and Ehresmann et al. (24Ehresmann B. Imbault P. Weil J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from Bacillus stearothermophilus containing a N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) using LB medium at 37 °C and purified as described (25Halliwell C.M. Morgan G. Ou C.P. Cass A.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If not noted otherwise, all protein concentrations refer to monomers. Gel Filtration Experiments—Oligomerization of the proteins was analyzed by gel filtration experiments at 25 °C. The experiments were performed using a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a Waters HPLC system (Waters). ClpB-(141-519), ClpB-(519-854), ClpBΔN, and the complex of ClpB-(141-519)-ClpB-(519-854) were injected (50 μl, 5 mg/ml) with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (running buffer: 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 10% glycerol, and 1-500 mm KCl). If indicated, nucleotides (1 mm) were added to the running buffer and the protein sample. Calibration of the gel filtration column was performed using a gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) and established the exponential relation between the molecular mass and retention time of subsequently analyzed proteins (data not shown). The oligomeric forms of ClpBΔN (80.9 kDa), ClpB-(141-519) (43.2 kDa), and ClpB-(519-854) (38.3 kDa) were defined within the following limits (kDa): ClpBΔN, monomer (M) 70-130, dimer (D) 130-200, trimer (T) 200-290, tetra-hexamer (H) 290-530; ClpB-(141-519), M 30-60, D 60-100, T 100-150, H 150-270; ClpB-(519-854), M 25-55, D 55-90, T 90-140, H 140-250. For analysis of the oligomerization behavior of the complex consisting of ClpB-(141-519)-ClpB-(519-854) the limits of ClpBΔN were used. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded (10-fold accumulation) with a Jasco-J710 Spectropolarimeter in 0.02-cm cuvettes at a scan rate of 20 nm/min, 0.2-nm resolution, 1 nm bandwidth, a time constant of 1 s, and a sensitivity of 20 mdeg at 25 °C. Fluorescence Measurements—Nucleotide affinities were determined in equilibrium titration experiments using a SLM 8100 Photon-counting spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C (18Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The relative fluorescence was plotted against the protein concentration and the data were analyzed with the quadratic equation using the program Grafit, version 3.01 (26Reinstein J. Vetter I.R. Schlichting I. Rösch P. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7440-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The equilibrium displacement of the fluorescent nucleotide by ADP were fitted to a cubic equation (27Thrall S.H. Reinstein J. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chaperone-assisted Reactivation of Substrate Proteins—Substrate proteins were denatured in reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm dithioerythritol) and chaperones were added (ClpB variants 0.5 μm, DnaK system: DnaK, 1.6 μm; DnaJ, 0.4 μm; GrpE, 0.2 μm) prior to refolding at 55 °C. α-Glucosidase (0.1 μm) from B. stearothermophilus (Sigma) was denatured 10 min at 75 °C (5Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). α-Glucosidase activity was determined at 40 °C at the indicated time points of the refolding reaction by diluting the reaction mixture into the assay solution (50 mm sodium phosphate, 2mm p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) (0.2 μm) from B. stearothermophilus (Sigma) was denatured 7.5 min at 75 °C (5Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). GPDH activity was determined at 40 °C at the indicated time points of the refolding reaction by diluting the reaction mixture into assay buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 40 mm MgCl2, 3 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 mm NADPH, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). LDH from B. stearothermophilus (0.2 μm) was incubated 30 min at 80 °C (5Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). LDH activity was determined at 25 °C at the indicated time points of the refolding reaction by diluting the reaction mixture into assay buffer (25 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm pyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH). Activity of the native substrate proteins was determined before the denaturation step. Concentrations refer to substrate protein solutions prior to aggregation by heat shock. Isothermal Calorimetry—Isothermal calorimetric titrations were performed with a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA) to measure the binding affinity of the ClpB fragments. The heat of binding was detected upon the titration of ClpB-(141-519) (90 μm) into a cell containing ClpB-(519-854) (10 μm) with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 as buffer system. Experiments were done at 45 °C at an injection rate of 0.5 μl/s. 29 injections were performed with a spacing of 240 s between each. The data were analyzed using the manufacturer's software to calculate the reaction enthalpy, stoichiometry of binding, and association constant. Steady State ATPase Measurements—Steady state ATP hydrolysis was measured with a coupled colorimetric assay (18Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Bergmeyer H.U. Colorimetric Assays. 1962; (Adam, H., ed) pp. , Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany: 573-577Google Scholar). ClpB variants (10 μm) were incubated at 25 °C with different concentrations of Mg·ATP in assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 0.4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm NADH, 20 μg/ml LDH, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase). The observed rate constants were determined from the decrease of A340 during the reaction. The data were analyzed with the program Grafit, version 3.01, using the Hill equation describing cooperative binding. k=kcat⋅[S]HKmH+[S]H Single Turnover ATPase Measurements and Nucleotide Analysis—The single turnover ATPase activity of the proteins was determined at 25 °C. Proteins (100 μm) were incubated with Mg·ATP (50 μm) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 100 mm KCl). For ClpB wild-type, ClpBΔN, ClpB-(141-519), and the complex formed by ClpB-(141-519)-ClpB-(519-854), the reaction was stopped at the indicated time points by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v) and incubated on ice. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant neutralized. The nucleotide content was analyzed by HPLC analysis using a Waters HPLC system (Waters) with an ODS-Hypersil reverse phase C-18 column (Bischoff, Leonberg) in isocratic running buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 6.8). The single turnover ATPase activity of ClpB-(519-854) was studied using the KinTek RQF-3 Quench-Flow apparatus (KinTek Corporation, University Park, PA). Reactions were started by rapidly mixing the two reactants (15 μl of each) and then quenched with 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid at the defined time intervals. All concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing. The nucleotide content was analyzed as described above. Design of ClpB Constructs—ClpB fragments were constructed based on sequence alignments of ClpB proteins from different organisms and the crystal structure of ClpB (Fig. 1A) (13Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The constructs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1B. For stability reasons, the N-terminal domain of ClpB, which is dispensable for function, was not included in the construct coding for the first AAA cassette. This construct started at position 141, where an alternative start codon is present in the E. coli mRNA being responsible for the natural occurrence of ClpBΔN (29Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Squires C.L. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ClpB-specific middle region inserts within the first AAA cassette it was included in the first construct. The C-terminal end of the first construct was behind the insertion of the coiled-coil domain and close to the beginning of the second AAA cassette. We introduced a stop codon after position 519. Hence the last 15 amino acids (519-534) of the first AAA cassette were not present in this construct. The second construct started at position 519 and ended with the naturally used stop codon after amino acid 854. The last 15 amino acids (519-535) of the first AAA cassettes as seen in the structure were included in the construct for the second AAA cassette. The additional N-terminal amino acids from the first AAA cassette allowed this construct to fold in its native structure and facilitated interdomain communication. Both proteins were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The correct folding of the constructs was assessed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). The CD spectra of both fragments had local minima at 208 and 222 nm typical of folded proteins with a relatively high content of α-helices. The first construct contains a coiled-coil domain and shows a typical strong peak at 208 nm. This is in agreement with the secondary structure of ClpB observed in the crystal structure and shows that the independently expressed ClpB fragments are folded correctly, which is a prerequisite for the functional characterization of the constructs. Oligomerization of the ClpB Variants—ClpB can form hexamers in the presence of ATP and this oligomerization is essential for the chaperone func"
https://openalex.org/W2136674557,"Apolipoprotein (apoA-IV) is a 376-residue exchangeable apolipoprotein that may play a number of important roles in lipid metabolism, including chylomicron assembly, reverse cholesterol transport, and appetite regulation. In vivo, apoA-IV exists in both lipid-poor and lipid-associated forms, and the balance between these states may determine its function. We examined the structural elements that modulate apoA-IV lipid binding by producing a series of deletion mutants and determining their ability to interact with phospholipid liposomes. We found that the deletion of residues 333–343 strongly increased the lipid association rate versus native apoA-IV. Additional mutagenesis revealed that two phenylalanine residues at positions 334 and 335 mediated this lipid binding inhibitory effect. We also observed that residues 11–20 in the N terminus were required for the enhanced lipid affinity induced by deletion of the C-terminal sequence. We propose a structural model in which these sequences can modulate the conformation and lipid affinity of apoA-IV.

A-IV is a 46-kDa glycoprotein that is the largest member of the exchangeable apolipoprotein family. It is synthesized by enterocytes of the small intestine in response to lipid absorption and is secreted into circulation on the surface of chylomicrons. As chylomicrons undergo lipolysis in the plasma compartment, apoA-IV rapidly dissociates from their surface and thereafter circulates as a lipid-free protein and in association with high density lipoprotein (1.Green P.H. Glickman R.M. Riley J.W. Quinet E. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 65: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that apoA-IV evolved to play a role in chylomicron assembly or catabolism (2.Weinberg R.B. Anderson R.A. Cook V.R. Emmanuel F. Denefle P. Hermann M. Steinmetz A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1410-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several additional functions have been proposed, including inhibition of lipid oxidation (3.Qin X. Swertfeger D.K. Zheng S. Hui D.Y. Tso P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1836-H1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inflammatory processes (4.Vowinkel T. Mori M. Krieglstein C.F. Russell J. Saijo F.

Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and regulation of food intake (6.Fujimoto K. Cardelli J.A. Tso P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G1002-G1006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because plasma apoA-IV can exist both as a component of plasma lipoproteins and as a lipid-free protein, it is possible that alternate conformations perform distinct functions. However, the structural features that mediate the conversion between these two states are largely unknown. ApoA-IV shares many features with the other exchangeable apolipoproteins, especially apoA-I and apoE. Indeed, intraexonic duplication of a primordial apoA-I gene may have led to the appearance of apoA-IV some 300 million years ago (7.Karathanasis S.K. Oettgen P. Haddad I.A. Antonarakis S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8457-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A distinct feature of the primary sequences of the exchangeable apolipoproteins is a variable number of 22-residue amphipathic α-helical repeats, which likely confer the ability to bind to the surface of lipoprotein particles (8.Boguski M.S. Elshourbagy N. Taylor J.M. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ApoA-IV (376 residues) contains 13 such repeats (most punctuated by proline residues), located between residues 40 and 332. The first 39 amino acids of apoA-IV are encoded by a separate exon and contain potential weakly amphipathic helical domains that are similar to those found in globular proteins (9.Elshourbagy N.A. Walker D.W. Paik Y.K. Boguski M.S. Freeman M. Gordon J.I. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7973-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the C terminus (residues 333–376) is predicted to be devoid of ordered secondary structure. Residues 354–367 are composed of a repeating EQQQ sequence that is not found in any other apolipoprotein (10.Weinberg R.B. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2212-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid-free forms of apoA-I and apoE have been shown to exhibit a compartmentalized architecture characterized by a well organized N-terminal domain and a relatively unstable C-terminal domain (11.Wilson C.

Given the similarities among these apolipoproteins, we expected that apoA-IV would exhibit a similar organization. However, we found that the α-helices in apoA-IV are organized around a single large domain (14.Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal third of apoA-IV not only lacked a lipid-binding domain, it appeared to actually inhibit lipid interactions. Removing the C-terminal 44 amino acids of apoA-IV (Δ333–376) resulted in a mutant that reorganized liposomes significantly faster than both WT apoA-IV and apoA-I (14.Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to identify the sequence(s) in the C-terminal region responsible for this lipid binding inhibitory effect. Materials—SDS-PAGE gels were obtained from Bio-Rad or Amersham Biosciences. Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the University of Cincinnati DNA Core. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). IgA protease (Igase) was purchased from MoBiTec. BL-21 (DE3) Escherichia coli and the pET30 vector were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was purchased from Fisher. His-bind resin was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Centriprep centrifugal concentrators were purchased from Millipore/Amicon Bioseparations (Bedford, MA). 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). All chemical reagents were of the highest quality available. Mutagenesis of Human ApoA-IV—Human apoA-IV DNA was ligated into the pET30 expression vector using the NcoI and HindIII sites. A cleavable N-terminal poly (His) tag was appended to facilitate purification. The C-terminal mutations were created by performing PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quick-Change, Novagen) (14.Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the Δ333–376, Δ344–376, and Δ352–376 mutants, a stop codon was inserted in place of the first amino acid to be deleted. For internal deletion mutants, complementary forward and reverse primers were designed with clamp regions on the 5′- and 3′-ends of the sequence removed. The Δ333–343 mutant DNA contained in the pET30 vector was used as the template for the double mutants (Δ1–10, 333–343, Δ1–20, 333–343, Δ1–30, 333–343, and Δ1–39, 333–343). These mutants used a forward primer that had a 3′-clamp region in which the nucleotides encoded the amino acids at position 11, 21, 31, and 40, respectively. The primer also consisted of a 5′-flap region that encoded for the NcoI site and an Igase (IgA protease) cleavage site that was used to remove the N-terminal His tag (as described below). For further details, please refer to Ref. 14.Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Point mutagenesis was performed directly in the expression vector using the Quick-Change approach as for the introduction of the stop codons. Protein Expression and Purification—Our protocol was similar to previous work with rat apoE (15.Pearson K. Liu M. Shen L. Tso P. Davidson W.S. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL-21-competent cells and plated overnight at 37 °C. Kanamycin (30 μg/ml) was used as the selective agent. Cell colonies were picked and grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) culture media overnight in 10-ml culture tubes in a shaking incubator at 37 °C. The cells in culture media were then transferred to fresh 100-ml cultures and grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.7. At this point, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for 2 h to induce overexpression of the protein. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and brought up in His-bind buffer along with protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged, and the supernatant was filtered through a Millex 0.45-μm filter and added to His-bind columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was eluted, concentrated, and digested with IgA protease, a protease that cleaves before Thr in the sequence Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-Thr-Pro. This removed the His tag and left a Thr-Pro at the N terminus. Next, the sample was passed over the His-bind column a second time to remove the cleaved tag. The His-bind column buffers in the purification contained 3 m guanidine. Finally, the samples were concentrated and dialyzed into standard Tris buffer (STB) (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% NaN3) for storage. DMPC Liposome Solubilization—DMPC in chloroform was dried in a borosilicate tube with a stream of nitrogen, solubilized in degassed STB, and bath-sonicated for 30 s to form multilamellar liposomes. Liposomes were placed in thermostated cuvettes at 24.5 °C, proteins were added to the liposomes at a final DMPC/protein mass ratio of 2.5:1, and the absorbance was continuously monitored at 325 nm in an Amersham Biosciences Ultraspec 4000 at 24.5 °C. Rate constants, k, were calculated for each mutant by fitting the first 5 min of data to a single exponential decay curve as a function of time (t): f(t) = a-kt using Sigma Plot 2000 (16.McLean L.R.

Interfacial Behavior at the Oil/Water Interface—The binding of apoA-IV at the oil/water interface was examined using a Tracker® automatic tensiometer (IT Concept) (28.Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McGuire K.

Drops of pure triolein were injected into a sample chamber containing 25 μg/ml protein in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and protein adsorption to the surface of the drop was monitored as the time-dependent decrease in interfacial tension. Thermal Denaturation Studies—The thermal denaturation of the lipid-free apoA-IV mutants was monitored as the change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm over a temperature range of 20–80 °C (18.Acharya P. Segall M.L. Zaiou M. Morrow J. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Snow J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The van't Hoff enthalpy, ΔHv, was calculated as described previously (13.Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Protein samples were studied at 0.1 mg/ml in STB on a Photon Technology International Quantamaster spectrometer in photon counting mode at room temperature. Excitation wavelength was 295 nm, excitation and emission band passes were 3.0 nm, and emission wavelength was monitored from 302 to 375 nm. Buffer blanks were subtracted from each of the samples. Quenching studies were performed by the addition of 0–0.2 m acrylamide; Stern-Volmer quenching constants, Ksv, were determined as described previously (19.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). To study the lipid association properties of human apoA-IV, we developed an efficient bacterial expression system that enables systematic deletion mutagenesis. Fig. 1 summarizes the N- and C-terminal deletion mutants that were generated for this study. The mutants were greater than 95% pure and had a size consistent with the deletions (Fig. 2). As reported previously, WT apoA-IV forms a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution with an approximate distribution of 70% dimers to 30% monomers (20.Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14279-14286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the deletions altered the oligomerization state of the mutants, we examined the mutant proteins by non-denaturing gel PAGE. None of the deletions significantly affected the quaternary structure of apoA-IV (data not shown).FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE analysis of WT apoA-IV and selected truncation mutants.

Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), WT apoA-IV was only marginally able to reorganize the DMPC multilamellar liposomes into micellar particles that scatter less light (Fig. 3A). However, as noted in our previous study (14.Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), apoA-IV Δ333–376 cleared DMPC vesicles at a dramatically faster rate than WT apoA-IV, surpassing apoA-I, which is well documented to bind lipid with higher affinity than apoA-IV (2.Weinberg R.B.

As the DMPC assay measures the end result of a complex process that involves both an initial apolipoprotein-lipid interaction and a subsequent lipid reorganization (see reaction scheme in Ref. 24.Segall M.L. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Anantharamaiah G.M. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we also examined the lipid affinity of WT and Δ333–376 apoA-IV using oil drop tensiometry (25.Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This method measures the rate at which apolipoproteins in solution bind to and lower the surface tension of the more hydrophobic triolein/water interface. As such, this technique provides a biophysical model for the binding of apoA-IV to the nascent triglyceride-rich chylomicron surface. As seen in Fig. 3B, apoA-IV Δ333–376 caused a much more rapid decrease in interfacial tension compared with WT protein, similar to its behavior in the DMPC clearance assay. In fact, for each of the mutants studied, oil drop tensiometry yielded qualitatively similar results as the DMPC clearance assay (data not shown). We hypothesized that a specific sequence in the C-terminal 44 amino acids of apoA-IV mediated the lipid binding inhibitory effect. We therefore designed a series of truncation mutants to localize the active inhibitory sequence. Deletion of residues Δ352–376 had no effect on the rate of lipid binding compared with WT (data not shown). Likewise, internal deletion of the unique EQQQ domain from Δ354–367, which generates a “pig-like” apoA-IV (26.Navarro M.A. Acin S. Iturralde M. Calleja L. Carnicer R. Guzman-Garcia M.A. Gonzalez-Ramon N. Mata P. Isabel B. Lopez-Bote C.J. Lampreave F. Piniero A. Osada J. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 325: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), also had no effect on lipid binding (Fig. 4A). We next examined apoA-IV Δ344–376 because serine 343 is the terminal amino acid in chicken apoA-IV (2.Weinberg R.B. Anderson R.A. Cook V.R. Emmanuel F. Denefle P. Hermann M. Steinmetz A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1410-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once again, this mutant was similar to WT in its lipid binding behavior (Fig. 4A). These data suggested that the lipid binding inhibitory sequence resided between residues 333 and 343. To confirm this, we examined the behavior of an internal deletion mutant, apoA-IV Δ333–343. As shown in Fig. 4B, apoA-IV Δ343–343 disrupted DMPC liposomes as fast as apoA-IV Δ333–376. A consideration of the sequence and net charge conservation of residues 333–343 across seven species revealed that residues 333–337 are highly conserved, whereas residues 338–342 are much less so (Fig. 5A). We therefore generated two shorter internal deletion mutants, apoA-IV Δ333–337, which lacked the highly conserved sequence, and apoA-IV Δ338–342, which lacked the more variable interval. Fig. 5B shows that apoA-IV Δ338–342 exhibited an intermediate binding rate. However, apoA-IV Δ333–337 was extremely efficient. In fact, this mutant was one of the fastest lipid-binding apolipoproteins we have observed. These data suggest that the most potent lipid binding inhibitory sequence in apoA-IV is located between residues 333 and 337. We previously noted that the increases in lipid binding rate displayed by the Δ333–376 and Δ271–376 deletion mutants were completely effaced by simultaneous deletion of the first 39 residues from the N terminus (14.Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that both domains can impact upon the lipid binding affinity of apoA-IV. To determine whether this phenomenon was maintained with the Δ333–343 mutant, we prepared a series of C- and N-terminal double deletion mutants. Deletion of the N-terminal 39 residues on the background of the apoA-IV Δ333–343 mutant (Δ1–39,333–343) converted the rapid binding Δ333–343 mutant to a slow lipid-binding protein, with kinetics similar to WT apoA-IV (Fig. 6). Similarly, a Δ1–20,333–343 deletion mutant also displayed slow binding. However, when only the first 10 residues were deleted from the N terminus, Δ1–10,333–343, the mutant maintained the rapid binding profile of the Δ333–343 single mutant. An internal deletion mutant, apoA-IV Δ11–20,333–343 that contained an intact N terminus, also displayed slow lipid binding kinetics (Fig. 6B). The DMPC clearance rate constants for all apoA-IV deletion mutants in this study, calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are listed in TABLE ONE. The clearance rate constants for apoA-IV Δ333–376, Δ333–343, Δ333–337, and Δ1–10,333–343 were statistically different compared with WT apoA-IV. There was no difference between the clearance rate for WT apoA-IV and the Δ354–367, Δ344–376, Δ338–342, Δ1–39,333–343, and Δ1–20,333–343 mutants. Although there was no statistical difference between the clearance rate for WT apoA-IV and apoA-IV Δ338–342 over the first 5 min, it is evident from Fig. 5 that this deletion mutant was better able to reorganize lipid at longer incubation times.TABLE ONERate constants for WT and mutant apoA-IV in the DMPC clearance assayMutant proteinkak is the rate constant derived from the first 5 min of the DMPC clearance assay; means ± S.D.WT apoA-IV0.039 ± 0.012Δ354–3670.024 ± 0.005Δ344–3760.042 ± 0.017Δ333–3760.279 ± 0.080bDenotes difference of p < 0.05 between WT and mutant as determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons testΔ333–3430.171 ± 0.029bDenotes difference of p < 0.05 between WT and mutant as determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons testΔ333–3370.217 ± 0.039bDenotes difference of p < 0.05 between WT and mutant as determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons testΔ338–3420.094 ± 0.034Δ1–39,333–3430.040 ± 0.006Δ1–20,333–3430.051 ± 0.006Δ1–10,333–3430.260 ± 0.065bDenotes difference of p < 0.05 between WT and mutant as determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons testa k is the rate constant derived from the first 5 min of the DMPC clearance assay; means ± S.D.b Denotes difference of p < 0.05 between WT and mutant as determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test Open table in a new tab The data in TABLE ONE indicate that residues 333–337 are critical for maintaining a conformation of WT apoA-IV that is relatively inefficient at interacting with lipid surfaces. To examine the impact of the deletions on protein structure we determined their thermodynamic stability using circular dichroism spectroscopy (TABLE TWO). Thermal denaturation studies determined that the Δ344–376 deletion did not significantly alter global protein stability versus the WT, as measured by the van't Hoff enthalpy of denaturation. However, mutants that lacked the inhibitory sequence exhibited enthalpies that were slightly lower than WT apoA-IV ranging from 38 to 45 kcal/mol. We also examined the fluorescence properties of Trp-12, which has proven to be a useful measure of apoA-IV conformation (27.Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The wavelength of maximum fluorescence (λmax) of Trp-12 in WT apoA-IV was 335 nm, indicative of a relatively hydrophobic environment (28.Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McGuire K. Kennedy A. Kosman J. Hazlett T.L. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14387-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (TABLE THREE). ApoA-IV Δ344–376 had a similar λmax; however, deletion of Δ333–376 or Δ333–343 caused a significant red shift in Trp emission, indicating that the N terminus had relocated to a more polar environment. Acrylamide fluorescence quenching studies further indicated that the change in the polarity of the N terminus was accompanied by a parallel increase in aqueous accessibility to the neutral quenching agent (Fig. 7). These observations, together with the DMPC binding data, suggest that the C-terminal inhibitory sequence may maintain the N-terminal globular domain in a more compact conformation that shields Trp-12 from the aqueous milieu.TABLE TWOThermal denaturation parameters of WT and mutant apoA-IVMutant proteinΔHνDMPC association ratekcal/molaThe estimated error on these experiments is ± 0.5 kcal/mol (n = 2)WT apoA-IV48SlowΔ344–37647SlowΔ333–37645FastΔ333–34340FastΔ333–33743FastΔ338–34240SlowbThis mutant reaches an equilibrium that is similar to the “fast” lipid binding mutants (Fig. 5), but a statistical comparison of the rate in the first 5 min shows no significant difference from “slow” lipid binding mutants (TABLE ONE)Δ1–10, 333–34338FastΔ1–20, 333–34343SlowΔ271–376cThe data for these two mutants is shown for discussion purposes and was previously published in Ref. 1434FastΔ1–39, 271–376cThe data for these two mutants is shown for discussion purposes and was previously published in Ref. 1428Slowa The estimated error on these experiments is ± 0.5 kcal/mol (n = 2)b This mutant reaches an equilibrium that is similar to the “fast” lipid binding mutants (Fig. 5), but a statistical comparison of the rate in the first 5 min shows no significant difference from “slow” lipid binding mutants (TABLE ONE)c The data for these two mutants is shown for discussion purposes and was previously published in Ref. 14.Pearson K.

When Ser-333 was replaced with an alanine, no effect on DMPC association was observed (Fig. 8). However, when either Phe-334 or Phe-335 was changed to alanine, the full lipid binding effect noted for the Δ333–337 mutant was recapitulated. Thus, dramatic changes in the lipid affinity of apoA-IV can be induced by the mutation of a single amino acid. It is well established that apoA-IV binds to lipid with much lower affinity than other members of the exchangeable apolipoprotein family (21.Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that its distinctively weak lipid binding behavior is due to: (a) the relative hydrophilicity and low amphipathic moment of its constitutive α-helices (29.Weinberg R.B.

https://openalex.org/W2022033979,"The equilibrium unfolding behavior of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein has been investigated by (19)F-NMR after incorporation of 4-fluorophenylalanine and by pulsed field gradient diffusion (1)H-NMR. At low urea concentrations (0-3 m) but prior to the global unfolding that begins at 4 m urea, the protein exhibits dynamic motion in the backbone and an expanded hydrodynamic radius with no major change in the side chain orientation. As monitored by two-dimensional (19)F-(19)F nuclear Overhauser effect, the distance between two phenylalanine residues (Phe(68) and Phe(93)) located in the two different beta-sheets that enclose the internal cavity did not change up to 4 m urea. Additionally, the chemical shifts of these two residues changed almost identically as a function of denaturant. At all urea concentrations, as well as in the native protein, multiple conformations exist. These conformers interconvert at different rates under different conditions, ranging from slow exchange by showing separate peaks in the native state to intermediate exchange at intermediate urea concentrations. Residual structure persisted around Phe(62) even at very high concentrations of denaturant, suggesting that region as a nucleation site during folding. The results were compared with previous studies examining the backbone behavior (Hodsdon, M. E., and Frieden, C. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 732-742) and suggest that the side chains show more stability than the backbone prior to global unfolding of the protein."
