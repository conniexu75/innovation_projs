https://openalex.org/W1492595170,"A simple method for the determination of tryptophan residues in proteins is described. The method involves (a) treatment of the protein with an excess of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, (b) purification of the labeled protein by gel filtration and ethanol washing, (c) measurement of the absorbance at 410 mµ to determine the number of colored groups incorporated, and (d) a determination of the total protein content by conventional methods. The procedure has been shown to be accurate with a wide variety of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1554164339,"Abstract 1. The low sulfur fraction of S-carboxymethyl wool keratin, which has an α-helix content of about 50% in aqueous solution, has been subjected to partial proteolysis with the enzyme Pronase P to yield an acid-precipitable fraction with a helix content of about 85%. 2. The optimum conditions for the preparation of this fraction have been studied with respect to time, temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, and Ca++ concentration. 3. In dilute solution the material appears to consist chiefly of particles with a molecular weight of about 41,000 and an axial ratio of 8:1 to 10:1. The dimensions are consistent with a multistranded, rod-like particle made up of probably three α-helical chains. 4. In 8 m urea, the particles break down irreversibly to a heterogeneous mixture, with molecular weights in the range 2000 to 5000, which suggests that peptide bonds are broken in the helical segment during proteolysis, but the integrity of the particle is maintained by its multistranded structure. Both gel chromatography and gel electrophoresis indicate that the helix-rich particle is derived from the major helical components of the low sulfur fraction of S-carboxymethyl wool keratin. 5. Amino acid analysis of the helix-rich fraction shows that, compared to the low sulfur fraction of S-carboxymethyl wool keratin, it is enriched in the helix-favoring residues lysine, leucine, alanine, and glutamic and aspartic acids and depleted in the helix-inhibiting residues S-carboxymethylcysteine, proline, serine, threonine, and glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2168163664,"Abstract Comparisons have been made of the rate of recombination of carbon monoxide with horse hemoglobin in solution, in erythrocytes, and in monoclinic crystals by means of flash photolysis. The results with solutions and erythrocytes showed close correspondence in rate and apparent activation energy. The effect of pH was also similar, hemoglobin being observed at pH 9, whereas there was a biphasic reaction at pH 7. Crystals showed rapidly reacting behavior at pH 7 and gave the same rate over a range of of ammonium sulfate concentrations from 45% of saturation to 95% of saturation, as well as in salt-free crystals. This was in contrast to hemoglobin in solution, in which increasing salt concentration raised the activity of carbon monoxide. Control experiments with whale myoglobin in solution and in crystals yielded similar rates and activation energies for the two states. It is suggested that movement of subunits in relation to one another may be restricted in hemoglobin crystals as compared with hemoglobin in solution."

No derivative substituted at histidine-119 was detected. This is in marked contrast to the products obtained on alkylation by iodoacetate at pH 5.5. The rate of alkylation of histidine in ribonuclease by iodoacetamide is about 1% that of iodoacetate, but the reaction is nevertheless facilitated since it is 10 to 100 times greater than the rate of alkylation of free histidine. The rate of alkylation of histidine-12 by iodoacetamide reaches a maximum at pH 5 to 5.5 and then decreases as the pH is increased. The rate is depressed by the presence of sodium chloride below about pH 5.5 but is unaffected above this pH. The dependence upon pH of this rate of alkylation of histidine-12 indicated that groups ionizing with apparent pK values of 3.5 to 4.3 and 6.2 ± 0.2 are involved in maintaining the reactive form of the enzyme. One explanation of the facilitated reaction is an interaction between the dipole of the amide group of the reagent and a dipole on the protein surface. This explanation is supported by the observation that acetamide inhibits the alkylation of histidine-12 by iodoacetamide. It is consistent with previous interpretations of the facilitated reactions of halo acids at either histidine-12 or at histidine-119 to suggest that it is a dipolar orientation of iodoacetamide by histidine-119 and an adjacent carboxyl group which is responsible for the unexpected specificity of iodoacetamide for histidine-12. The rate of alkylation of methionine in ribonuclease by iodoacetamide at 24° was found to be approximately constant between pH 2.3 and 7.0, and independent of sodium chloride and acetamide concentrations. This fact indicates that only minor or very localized conformational changes can be occurring in the region of the methionine residue that has undergone alkylation."

https://openalex.org/W1482661460,"The effectiveness of benzamidine and phenylguanidine as competitive inhibitors of trypsin has been attributed to the binding of their aromatic rings in a hydrophobic slit between the anionic and catalytic sites at the active center of trypsin (1). The normal function of this region of the active center was considered to be the binding of substrate methylene groups in lysyl and arginyl residues. To test this interpretation of the orientation of bound benzamidine and phenylguanidine, derivatives containing ester groups in the para position were prepared and examined for substrate behavior. Esters whose length approximated the extended form of normal substrates were found to be cleaved with kinetic characteristics consistent with this picture."

https://openalex.org/W1976483296,"IT is widely believed that the “prebiotic” formation of polynucleotides was a key step in the evolution of life. One of the least understood steps in this synthesis is the formation of nucleosides. Sugars, purines and pyrimidines can be made in relatively high yields from simple materials, and nucleosides can be converted to nucleotides under reasonably plausible “prebiotic” conditions1, but the yield of nucleosides reported in most prebiotic syntheses is poor. We have therefore investigated certain aspects of prebiotic nucleoside synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1561547507,"Abstract 1. In germinating peas the methyl group of methionine was incorporated into 24-ethylcholesterol, the major component of pea sterol, but not into the pentacyclic triterpenoid, β-amyrin, under conditions which lead to the incorporation of label from 2-14C-mevalonate into both substances. Since only C-28 and C-29 are not common to β-amyrin and the sterol, the methionine label must reside in these two carbon atoms. 2. The minor component of pea sterol was shown to be 24-methylcholesterol. 3. From the relative incorporations of label into 24-methyl- and 24-ethylcholesterol from mevalonate and from methionine it was possible to show that both C-28 and C-29 are labeled in the 24-C2 compound. 4. When labeled ethionine was used, the amount of label which appeared in sterol was nearly zero under conditions which strongly label 24-ethylcholesterol from methionine. 5. When a species of brown algae was cultured in the presence of methyl-14C-methionine, radioactive fucosterol was produced. 6. The results reported here are in agreement with the mechanism we proposed earlier (1) in which the C2 group at C-24 of naturally occurring sterols and tetracyclic triterpenoids is derived by two C1 transfers."

https://openalex.org/W2016132641,"THE immediate appearance of copper-64 in the peripheral blood of rats, rabbits, sheep and men after oral ingestion of the isotope indicates that the upper gastrointestinal tract is an important site for the absorption of copper1–3. The role, if any, of the intestinal lymphatics in the absorption mechanism is unknown and has not been reported. In order to elucidate this role, we have compared the relative proportions of absorbed copper which are transported from the intestine by portal blood and by lymph."

https://openalex.org/W1570359512,"Abstract Ethyl p-guanidinobenzoate, which is closely related structurally to some aromatic esters split by trypsin, is only a partial substrate for the enzyme. Kinetic evidence was obtained for the formation of a typical enzyme-substrate complex which, however, proceeded to a stable acyl-enzyme derivative, even at a pH normally optimal for tryptic hydrolyses. The stoichiometry of the reaction was established by spectroscopic analysis. Trypsin is consequently inactivated by ethyl p-guanidinobenzoate. Under similar conditions, chymotrypsin is unaffected. Difference spectra appearing during the inactivation indicate a transfer of the p-guanidinobenzoyl group from an aqueous to a hydrophobic environment, concomitant with an analogous shift of tyrosine residues of trypsin. The tyrosine residue or residues may be involved in the hydrophobic binding site of the active center. The failure of p-guanidinobenzoyltrypsin to undergo deacylation is attributed to a distortion of the hydrolytic site of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2077043039,"LABORATORY mice sometimes produce a characteristic mousy smell, which on occasion can be obtrusive and unpleasant. This smell comes from the secretion of the preputial glands in the male, and its purpose is to mark territory or establish dominance. Certain conditions will provoke this secretion, among them putting the mice into a clean cage, which has to be promptly marked by the males. Thus, paradoxically, frequent cage changing will result in a smellier mouse room than one in which cages are changed only once in 2, 3 or 4 weeks. This is perfectly compatible with health and hygiene if a suitably absorbent bedding material is used."
