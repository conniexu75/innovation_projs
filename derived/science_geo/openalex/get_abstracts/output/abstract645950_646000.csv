https://openalex.org/W2999739564,"Same-day initiation (SDI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been recommended to improve ART programme outcomes in South Africa since August 2017. This study assessed implementation of SDI over time in two South African districts, describing the characteristics of same-day initiators and evaluating the impact of SDI on retention in ART care. Routine data were analysed for HIV-infected adults who were newly initiating ART in Johannesburg or Mopani Districts between October 2017 and June 2018. Characteristics of same-day ART initiators were compared to later initiators, and losses to follow-up (LTFU) to six months were assessed using Kaplan Meier survival analysis and multivariate logistic regression. The dataset comprised 32 290 records (29 964 from Johannesburg and 2 326 from Mopani). The overall rate of SDI was 40.4% (n = 13 038), increasing from 30.3% in October 2017 to 54.2% in June 2018. Same-day ART initiators were younger, more likely to be female and presented with less advanced clinical disease than those initiating treatment at later times following diagnosis (p<0.001 for all). SDI was associated with disengagement from care: LTFU was 30.1% in the SDI group compared to 22.4%, 19.8% and 21.9% among clients initiating ART 1-7 days, 8-21 days and ≥22 days after HIV diagnosis, respectively (p<0.001). LTFU was significantly more likely among clients in Johannesburg versus Mopani (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.43, p<0.001) and among same-day versus later initiators (aOR = 1.45, p<0.001), while increasing age reduced LTFU (aOR = 0.97, p<0.001). In conclusion, SDI has increased over time as per national guidelines, but there is serious concern regarding the reduced rate of retention among same-day initiators. Nevertheless, SDI may result in a net programmatic benefit provided that interventions are implemented to support client readiness for treatment and ongoing engagement in ART care, particularly among younger adults in large ART programmes such as Johannesburg."
https://openalex.org/W2999208704,"Host-parasite interactions may be modulated by host- or parasite-associated microbes, but the role of these are often overlooked. Particularly for parasites with intestinal stages (either larval or adult), the host gut microbiome may play a key role for parasite establishment; moreover, the microbiome may change in response to invading parasites. Hypothesis testing at the organismal level may be hampered, particularly in mammalian definitive hosts, by ethical, logistical, and economical restrictions. Thus, invertebrates naturally serving as intermediate hosts to parasites with complex life cycles may inform the development of mammalian models as an early-stage host-parasite model. In addition, several important pathogens are vectored by insects, and insect gut microbiome-pathogen interactions may provide essential base-line knowledge, which may be used to control vectorborne pathogens. Here, we used the grain beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a host of the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta, to explore interactions between infection status and resident gut microbiota at two pre-determined time points (day two and seven) post infection. Using 16S/18S microbial profiling, we measured key parameters of the composition, relative abundance, and diversity of the host gut bacteriome and mycobiome. In addition, we quantified the systemic beetle immune response to infection by Phenoloxidase activity and hemocyte abundance. We found significant changes in the gut bacteriome and mycobiome in relation to infection status and beetle age. Thus, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the gut of infected beetles and driven mostly by an increased abundance of Acinetobacter. In addition, the mycobiome was less abundant in infected beetles but maintained higher Shannon diversity in infected compared with non-infected beetles. Beetles treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Tetracycline) exhibited significantly reduced parasite establishment compared with the untreated control group, indicating that the host microbiome may greatly influence hatching of eggs and subsequent establishment of H. diminuta larvae. Our results suggest that experimental work using invertebrates may provide a platform for explorative studies of host-parasite-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2999536597,"Automated approaches to improve the efficiency of systematic reviews are greatly needed. When testing any of these approaches, the criterion standard of comparison (gold standard) is usually human reviewers. Yet, human reviewers make errors in inclusion and exclusion of references.To determine citation false inclusion and false exclusion rates during abstract screening by pairs of independent reviewers. These rates can help in designing, testing and implementing automated approaches.We identified all systematic reviews conducted between 2010 and 2017 by an evidence-based practice center in the United States. Eligible reviews had to follow standard systematic review procedures with dual independent screening of abstracts and full texts, in which citation inclusion by one reviewer prompted automatic inclusion through the next level of screening. Disagreements between reviewers during full text screening were reconciled via consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer. A false inclusion or exclusion was defined as a decision made by a single reviewer that was inconsistent with the final included list of studies.We analyzed a total of 139,467 citations that underwent 329,332 inclusion and exclusion decisions from 86 unique reviewers. The final systematic reviews included 5.48% of the potential references identified through bibliographic database search (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.38% to 8.58%). After abstract screening, the total error rate (false inclusion and false exclusion) was 10.76% (95% CI: 7.43% to 14.09%).This study suggests important false inclusion and exclusion rates by human reviewers. When deciding the validity of a future automated study selection algorithm, it is important to keep in mind that the gold standard is not perfect and that achieving error rates similar to humans may be adequate and can save resources and time."
https://openalex.org/W3000291559,"Sample collection, processing, storage and isolation methods constitute pre-analytic factors that can influence the quality of samples used in research and clinical practice. With regard to biobanking practices, a critical point in the sample’s life chain is storage, particularly long-term storage. Since most studies examine the influence of different temperatures (4°C, room temperature) or delays in sample processing on sample quality, there is only little information on the effects of long-term storage at ultra-low (vapor phase of liquid nitrogen) temperatures on biomarker levels. Among these biomarkers, circulating miRNAs hold great potential for diagnosis or prognosis for a variety of diseases, like cancer, infections and chronic diseases, and are thus of high interest in several scientific questions. We therefore investigated the influence of long-term storage on levels of eight circulating miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-191-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-451a, miR-23a-3p, miR-93-5p, miR-24-3p, and miR-33b-5p) from 10 participants from the population-based cohort study KORA. Sample collection took place during the baseline survey S4 and the follow-up surveys F4 and FF4, over a time period spanning from 1999 to 2014. The influence of freeze-thaw (f/t) cycles on miRNA stability was also investigated using samples from volunteers (n = 6). Obtained plasma samples were profiled using Exiqon’s miRCURYTM real-time PCR profiling system, and repeated measures ANOVA was used to check for storage or f/t effects. Our results show that detected levels of most of the studied miRNAs showed no statistically significant changes due to storage at ultra-low temperatures for up to 17 years; miR-451a levels were altered due to contamination during sampling. Freeze-thawing of one to four cycles showed an effect only on miR-30c-5p. Our results highlight the robustness of this set of circulating miRNAs for decades of storage at ultra-low temperatures and several freeze-thaw cycles, which makes our findings increasingly relevant for research conducted with biobanked samples."
https://openalex.org/W2998820705,"Adequate nutrition is essential during the lactation period for better maternal and child health outcomes. Although food insecurity and dietary monotony (defined as less diverse diet), two important determinants of undernutrition, are endemic in the rural mountains of Nepal, insufficiently examined and assessed for risk factors in mothers during lactation, a life stage of high nutritional demand. This study aimed to assess the status and factors associated with food insecurity and dietary diversity among lactating mothers residing in the mountains of Nepal.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban municipality in the mountainous Bajhang District of far-western Nepal. The sampling frame and strategy led to 417 randomly selected lactating mothers. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and the tool ""Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women"" developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization were used to measure food insecurity and dietary diversity, respectively. Additional information on socio-demographics and risk factors were collected. Multivariable logistics regression assessed correlates of study outcomes.Overall, 54% of the households were food insecure, and over half (53%) of the mothers had low dietary diversity. Food insecurity status (mild food insecurity AOR = 10.12, 95% CI = 4.21-24.34; moderate food insecurity AOR = 8.17, 95% CI = 3.24-20.59, and severe food insecurity AOR = 10.56, 95% CI = 3.92-28.43) were associated with higher odds of dietary monotony. Likewise, participants with lower dietary diversity were 8.5 times more likely to be food insecure than those with higher dietary diversity (AOR = 8.48, 95% CI = 3.76-19.14). The monthly income of the family was positively associated with food insecurity. Participants' (AOR = 3.92 95%CI = 1.76-8.71) or spouses' (AOR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.07-7.85) unemployment was associated with higher odds of being food insecure. Likewise, owning a cultivable land (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.28-0.84) and participant's unemployment status (AOR = 5.92, 95% CI = 3.02-11.63), were significantly associated with increased odds of dietary monotony.The observed food insecurity and poor dietary diversity among lactating mothers, the correlates associated with these outcomes, may help local stakeholders to identify local health needs and subgroups for targeted interventions. Socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers should be specifically targeted for relevant programs and policies."
https://openalex.org/W2999773961,"The World Health Organization recommends a minimum of 33 months between two consecutive live births to reduce the risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. However, determinants of short birth interval have not been well understood in Ethiopia.The aim of this study was to assess individual- and community-level determinants of short birth interval among women in Ethiopia.A detailed analysis of the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data was performed. A total of 8,448 women were included in the analysis. A two-level multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated individual- and community-level factors and estimate between-community variance.At the individual-level, women aged between 20 and 24 years at first marriage (AOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.18-1.60), women aged between 25 and 29 years at first marriage (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.20-2.25), having a husband who attended higher education (AOR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.01-1.73), being unemployed (AOR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.31), having an unemployed husband (AOR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.04-1.45), being in the poorest wealth quintile (AOR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.39-2.39), being in the poorer wealth quintile (AOR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.21-2.06), being in the middle wealth quintile (AOR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.24-2.10), being in the richer wealth quintile (AOR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.19-2.00), increased total number of children born before the index child (AOR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.10) and death of the preceding child (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.59-2.45) were associated with increased odds of short birth interval. At the community-level, living in a pastoralist region (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.68-2.39), being a city dweller (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.38-2.22), high community-level female illiteracy (AOR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05-1.45) and increased distance to health facilities (AOR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.11-1.56) were associated with higher odds of experiencing short birth interval. Random effects showed significant variation in short birth interval between communities.Determinants of short birth interval are varied and complex. Multifaceted intervention approaches supported by policy initiatives are required to prevent short birth interval."
https://openalex.org/W3000502041,"Background Knowledge on the molecular epidemiology of Escherichia coli causing E. coli bacteremia (ECB) in the Netherlands is mostly based on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-Ec). We determined differences in clonality and resistance and virulence gene (VG) content between non-ESBL-producing E. coli (non-ESBL-Ec) and ESBL-Ec isolates from ECB episodes with different epidemiological characteristics. Methods A random selection of non-ESBL-Ec isolates as well as all available ESBL-Ec blood isolates was obtained from two Dutch hospitals between 2014 and 2016. Whole genome sequencing was performed to infer sequence types (STs), serotypes, acquired antibiotic resistance genes and VG scores, based on presence of 49 predefined putative pathogenic VG. Results ST73 was most prevalent among the 212 non-ESBL-Ec (N = 26, 12.3%) and ST131 among the 69 ESBL-Ec (N = 30, 43.5%). Prevalence of ST131 among non-ESBL-Ec was 10.4% (N = 22, P value < .001 compared to ESBL-Ec). O25:H4 was the most common serotype in both non-ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Ec. Median acquired resistance gene counts were 1 (IQR 1–6) and 7 (IQR 4–9) for non-ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Ec, respectively (P value < .001). Among non-ESBL-Ec, acquired resistance gene count was highest among blood isolates from a primary gastro-intestinal focus (median 4, IQR 1–8). Median VG scores were 13 (IQR 9–20) and 12 (IQR 8–14) for non-ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Ec, respectively (P value = .002). VG scores among non-ESBL-Ec from a primary urinary focus (median 15, IQR 11–21) were higher compared to non-ESBL-Ec from a primary gastro-intestinal (median 10, IQR 5–13) or hepatic-biliary focus (median 11, IQR 5–18) (P values = .007 and .04, respectively). VG content varied between different E. coli STs. Conclusions Non-ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Ec blood isolates from two Dutch hospitals differed in clonal distribution, resistance gene and VG content. Also, resistance gene and VG content differed between non-ESBL-Ec from different primary foci of ECB."
https://openalex.org/W2998865050,"Herein, the concentrations of food toxicants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), in salmon fillets smoke flavored with different smoking wood chips (oak, apple, bourbon soaked oak, cherry and hickory) and barbecuing were determined. Benzo[a]anthracene (up to 0.24 ng/g) and chrysene (0.22 ng/g) were determined in the raw salmon fillets. While ∑PAH8 (benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene) in the raw samples ranged between 0.44 and 0.46 ng/g, smoke flavoring increased the amount of ∑PAH8 and the amount varied between 0.47 and 0.73 ng/g. Salmon smoked flavored with bourbon soaked oak, cherry and hickory wood chips and barbecued showed significantly (P <0.05) lower contents of ∑PAH4 (benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene) and ∑PAH8 compared to non-smoke flavored barbecued samples. Additionally, smoke flavoring with apple, bourbon soaked oak, and cherry wood chips significantly (P <0.05) reduced the total HAA contents in barbecued salmon. A remarkable result was that the bourbon-soaked oak and cherry wood chips had inhibitory effects on both PAH and HAA contents. In sum, barbecued non-smoke flavored and smoke flavored salmon with different wood chips could be considered safe from the perspective of the detected amounts of PAHs and HAAs in salmon fillets."
https://openalex.org/W3000709619,"Aortic valve disease is one of the leading forms of complications in the cardiovascular system. The failing native aortic valve is routinely surgically replaced with a bioprosthesis. However, insufficient durability of bioprosthetic heart valves often requires reintervention. Valve degradation can be assessed by an analysis of the blood flow characteristics downstream of the valve. This is cost and labor intensive using clinical methodologies and is performed infrequently. The integration of consumer smartphones and implantable blood flow sensors into the data acquisition chain facilitates remote management of patients that is not limited by access to clinical facilities. This article describes the characteristics of an implantable magnetic blood flow sensor which was optimized for small size and low power consumption to allow for batteryless operation. The data is wirelessly transmitted to the patient’s smartphone for in-depth processing. Tests using three different experimental setups confirmed that wireless and batteryless blood flow recording using a magnetic flow meter technique is feasible and that the sensor system is capable of monitoring the characteristic flow downstream of the valve."
https://openalex.org/W2999920696,"The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is a causative agent of pine wilt disease (PWD). To date, although several molecular diagnostic methods have been developed, rapid on-site diagnostic tools for detecting PWN in pinewood are limited. In this study, a point of care diagnostic (POCD) method for detecting PWN in pinewood using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was developed. This method comprises quick gDNA extraction buffer (DAP buffer) for the direct extraction of gDNA of PWN from pinewood and a battery-mounted portable optical isothermal device (POID) for the detection of PWD in the field. The RPA assay can distinguish between the PWN and its conspecies which exist in pinewood and can complete diagnostic procedures within 25 min in the field. Moreover, the RPA assay can detect PWN in old wood samples in both natural and stored conditions. The POCD-RPA assay to detect PWN will be useful for epidemiological investigations in the field as well as for quarantine processes in the wood trade."
https://openalex.org/W2999625215,"Background Little is known about depressive symptoms among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study aimed to identify the prevalence of depression and its association with self-esteem, individual, parental and family factors among adolescents aged 12 to 18 in UAE. Methods Six hundred adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years were recruited from 4 of 111 schools in a cross-sectional study. We administered Beck Depression Inventory Scale and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale to measure self-report symptoms of depression and self-esteem. We used multiple linear regression to identify significant predictors of depression. Results Over 86% of the identified sample participated to the survey. The mean age of the sample was 14.3 (±1.3) with an excess of girls (61%). Depressive symptoms were detected in 17.2% (95% CI 14.2–20.7). There was an inverse relationship between self-esteem scores and depressive symptoms. Positive predictors of depressive symptoms, having controlled for age, gender, and ethnicity included experiencing neglect, being verbally abused in school, having no monthly allowance to spend in school, a history of physical morbidities requiring treatment, being a current or past smoker and a low family income. Conclusion The high prevalence of depressive symptoms measured in this survey suggests a significant public health problem among adolescents in the UAE. Public health interventions aimed at facilitating education and early detection and potential treatment of depressive symptoms are a priority in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2999819403,"Desalination plants along the Mediterranean Israeli coastline currently provide ~587 million m3 drinking water/year, and their production is planned to increase gradually. Production of drinking water is accompanied by a nearly equivalent volume of brine discharge with a salinity of ~80 that is twice the normal, which can potentially impact marine ecosystems. The goal of this study was to examine whether benthic foraminifera, a known sensitive marine bio-indicator, are affected by this brine-discharge. For that, we investigated the seasonal and cumulative effect of brine discharges of three operating desalination facilities along the Israeli coast. Those facilities are located in Ashkelon, Hadera, and Sorek. The brine-discharge in the first two desalination plants is associated with thermal pollution, while the Sorek facility entails increased salinity but no thermal pollution. In four seasonal cruises during one year, we collected surface sediment samples in triplicates by grabs from the outfall (near the discharge site), and from a non-impacted control station adjacent to each study site. Our results highlight that the most robust responses were observed at two out of three desalination shallow sites (Ashkelon and Hadera), where the brine was discharged directly from a coastal outfall and was accompanied with thermal pollution from the nearby power plants. The total foraminiferal abundance and diversity were, generally, lower near the outfalls, and increased towards the control stations. Moreover, changes in the relative abundances of selected species indicate their sensitivity to the brine discharge. The most noticeable response to exclusively elevated salinity was detected at Sorek discharge site, where we observed a sharp decline in organic-cemented agglutinated benthic foraminifera, suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to elevated salinity. The herein study contribute new insights into the effect of brine discharge from desalination plants, on benthic foraminifera, and propose a scientifically-based ecological monitoring tool that can help stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W3000414336,"The regulation mechanisms involved in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and the motility of human endometrial and decidual stromal cells (ESCs and DSCs, respectively) during decidualization remain unclear. DSCs show significant increased cell motility and expression of FOS-like 1 (FOSL1) and MMP1, MMP2, and MMP9 compared with ESCs, whereas lack of decidualization inducers leads to a rapid decrease in FOSL1 and MMP1 and MMP9 expression in DSCs in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that a link exists between decidualization inducers and FOSL1 in up-regulation of motility during decidualization. Based on the response of ESCs/DSCs to different decidualization systems in vitro, we found that progesterone (P4) alone had no significant effect and that 17β-estradiol (E2) significantly increased cell motility and FOSL1 and MMP1 and MMP9 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas 8-bromo-cAMP significantly decreased cell motility and FOSL1 and MMP9 expression in the presence of P4. In addition, we showed that E2 triggered phosphorylation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), which could directly bind to the promoter of FOSL1 in ESCs/DSCs. Additionally, we also revealed silencing of ESR1 expression by siRNA abrogated E2-induced FOSL1 expression at the transcript and protein levels. Moreover, silencing of FOSL1 expression by siRNA was able to block E2-induced MMP1 and MMP9 expression and cell motility in ESCs/DSCs. Taken together, our data suggest that, in addition to its enhancement of secretory function, the change in MMP expression and cell motility is another component of the decidualization of ESCs/DSCs, including estrogen-dependent MMP1 and MMP9 expression mediated by E2–ESR1–FOSL1 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W3000582273,"Cataracts can limit a person's ability to perform vision-dependent tasks safely, affecting the quality of life of older people. This study examines the relationship between visual function and driving, by studying which visual parameters might be important for predicting driving performance in older drivers with and without cataracts, ascertaining whether the objective measurement of intraocular scattering should be considered in assessment procedures for older drivers. This cross-sectional study involved a total of 20 older drivers (10 patients with bilateral cataracts and 10 control subjects). All participants were examined for visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual discrimination capacity, and intraocular scattering. Driving performance was also tested using a driving simulator. To study the relationship between visual parameters and driving performance, a correlation analysis and regression model were used. Drivers with cataracts showed a significantly impaired (p<0.05) visual function, with an Objective Scattering Index (OSI) 3.5 times greater than the control group. Driving performance was also significantly worse (p<0.05) in drivers with cataracts, reflected by a notable deterioration in lane keeping. The correlation analysis showed significant associations between driving performance and all the visual parameters studied. Finally, the regression model revealed that the OSI was the best predictor of driving performance, accounting for 51.3% of its variance. Visual function and driving performance are markedly deteriorated when cataracts are present. Our results demonstrate that the objective scattering index (OSI) has a high predictive power when it comes to simulated driving performance in older drivers, both with and without cataracts, suggesting that scatter measurements could be important in helping better understand visual limitations in older drivers."
https://openalex.org/W2999274207,"Because of the rapid increase of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and high burden of healthcare-related financial issues in Bangladesh, there is a concern that out-of-pocket (OOP) payments related to illnesses may become a major burden on household. It is crucial to understand what are the major illnesses responsible for high OPP at the household level to help policymakers prioritize key areas of actions to protect the household from 100% financial hardship for seeking health care as part of universal health coverage.We first estimated the costs of illnesses among a population in urban Bangladesh, and then assessed the household financial burden associated with these illnesses.A cross-sectional survey of 1593 randomly selected households was carried out in Bangladesh (urban area of Rajshahi city), in 2011. Catastrophic expenditure was estimated at 40% threshold of household capacity to pay. We employed the Bayesian two-stage hurdle model and Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate age-adjusted average cost and the incidence of household financial catastrophe for each illness, respectively.Overall, approximately 45% of the population of Bangladesh had at least one episode of illness. The age-sex-adjusted average medical expenses and catastrophic health care expenditure among the households were TK 621 and 8%, respectively. Households spent the highest amount of money 7676.9 on paralysis followed by liver disease (TK 2695.4), injury (TK 2440.0), mental disease (TK 2258.0), and tumor (TK 2231.2). These diseases were also responsible for higher incidence of financial catastrophe. Our study showed that 24% of individuals who suffered typhoid incurred catastrophic expenditure followed by liver disease (12.3%), tumor (12.1%), heart disease (8.4%), injury (7.9%), mental disease (7.9%), cataract (7.1%), and paralysis (6.5%).The study findings suggest that chronic illnesses were responsible for high costs and high catastrophic expenditures in Bangladesh. Effective risk pooling mechanism might reduce household financial burden related to illnesses. Chronic illness related to NCDs is the major cause of OOP. It is also important to consider prioritizing vulnerable population by subsidizing the high health care cost for some of the chronic illnesses."
https://openalex.org/W2999474502,"Cochlear implantation for single-sided deafness (SSD) is the only treatment option with the potential to restore binaural hearing cues. Significant binaural benefit has been measured in adults by speech in noise and localisation tests, who receive a cochlear implant for SSD, however, little is known on the cortical changes that help provide this benefit. In the present study, detection of sound in the auditory cortex, speech testing and localisation was used to investigate the ability of a cochlear implant (CI) to restore auditory cortical latencies and improve binaural benefit in the adult SSD population.Twenty-nine adults with acquired single-sided deafness who received a CI in adulthood were studied. Speech perception in noise was tested using the Bamford-Kowal-Bench speech-in-noise test, localisation ability was measured using the auditory speech sounds evaluation (AδE) localisation test and cortical auditory evoked responses, comparing N1-P2 latencies recorded from the normal hearing ear and cochlear implant were used to investigate the synchrony of the cortical pathway from the CI and normal hearing ear (NHe) with binaural hearing function.There was a significant improvement in speech perception in noise in all spatial configurations S0/N0 (Z = -3.066, p<0.002), S0/NHE (Z = -4.031, p<0.001), SCI/NHE (Z = -3.851, p<0.001). Localization significantly improved when tested with the cochlear implant on (p<0.001) with a shorter duration of deafness correlating to a greater improvement in localisation ability F(1:18) = 6.854; p = 0.017). There was no significant difference in N1-P2 latency recorded from the normal hearing ear and the CI.Cortical auditory evoked response latencies recorded from the CI and NHe showed no significant difference, indicating that the detection of sound in the auditory cortex occurred simultaneously, providing the cortex with auditory information for binaural hearing."

Previous studies of Zika virus in pregnant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have described injury to the developing fetus and pregnancy loss, but neonatal outcomes following fetal Zika virus exposure have yet to be characterized in nonhuman primates. Herein we describe the presentation of rhesus macaque neonates with a spectrum of clinical outcomes, including one infant with CZS-like symptoms including cardiomyopathy, motor delay and seizure activity following maternal infection with Zika virus during the first trimester of pregnancy. Further characterization of this neonatal nonhuman primate model of gestational Zika virus infection will provide opportunities to evaluate the efficacy of pre- and postnatal therapeutics for gestational Zika virus infection and CZS."

Interestingly, Ogg1-/- mice had a markedly altered intestinal microbiome under both control-fed and hypercaloric diet conditions. Several microbial species that were increased in Ogg1-/- animals were associated with increased energy harvest, consistent with their propensity to high-fat diet induced weight gain. In addition, several pro-inflammatory microbes were increased in Ogg1-/- mice. Consistent with this observation, Ogg1-/- mice were significantly more sensitive to intestinal inflammation induced by acute exposure to dextran sulfate sodium. Taken together, these data indicate that in addition to their proclivity to obesity and metabolic disease, Ogg1-/- mice are prone to colonic inflammation. Further, these data point to alterations in the intestinal microbiome as potential mediators of the metabolic and intestinal inflammatory response in Ogg1-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W3000015309,"Transporters mediate the movement of compounds across the membranes that separate the cell from its environment and across the inner membranes surrounding cellular compartments. It is estimated that one third of a proteome consists of membrane proteins, and many of these are transport proteins. Given the increase in the number of genomes being sequenced, there is a need for computational tools that predict the substrates that are transported by the transmembrane transport proteins. In this paper, we present TranCEP, a predictor of the type of substrate transported by a transmembrane transport protein. TranCEP combines the traditional use of the amino acid composition of the protein, with evolutionary information captured in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and restriction to important positions of the alignment that play a role in determining the specificity of the protein. Our experimental results show that TranCEP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The results quantify the contribution made by each type of information used."

The program is continued at the commencement of universal health coverage (UHC) in 2014. ""This study aimed to report the utilization and cost of the implementation of Prolanis in Indonesia from 2014 to 2016, or two years since the commencement of Indonesian universal health coverage."" Secondary data analysis was performed using publicly available data and data obtained from the national health insurance agency (BPJS); while data on disease prevalence were collected from basic national health survey. There was an increase trend of Prolanis participants, from around 11,000 participants in 2014 to more than 250,000 in 2016. More than 70% of participants were adults living in Java, however, the acceptance rate was very low in other area. Across different activities in Prolanis, physical activity was the most participated ones. In comparison to other regions, regions in Java were the most active area. The total expenditure for Prolanis program in 2016 increased almost triple from the annual cost in 2014. However, the cost per person was actually decreased more than 50%. Within two years of UHC implementation, there were increase covered participants and total costs, but cost per individual was decreased and there was significant difference in of cost between Java and outside Java. Further study and routine monitoring-evaluation process by health authority is needed to assess whether the cost difference would affect the service quality."
https://openalex.org/W2999247442,"Using data from the European Value Survey, covering more than 300,000 respondents in 32 countries between 2002 and 2012, we offer new insight into the consequences for subjective well-being of self-employment. We hypothesize that the positive link between entrepreneurship and well-being is influenced by the extent to which the decision to engage in entrepreneurship reflects voluntary choice and by the ability of the entrepreneur to match entrepreneurial preferences for autonomy, task variety, and challenging tasks to task environments. While the hypotheses are confirmed by our empirical analysis, we also find-rather surprisingly-no evidence that the effects are mediated by autonomy. To handle the endogeneity and simultaneity problems that arise from the fact that the choice to become an entrepreneur is not random and which potentially threaten the validity of our findings, we rely on a novel econometric method which allows us to sidestep the selection problem and establish that the well-being increase associated with entering into entrepreneurial activity is at least approximately equivalent to a one-decile increase in household income."
https://openalex.org/W3000451848,"Introduction Use of tenofovir based anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in HIV patients is associated with low bone mineral density (BMD). Low BMD predisposes people living with HIV (PLWHIV) to fractures thereby increasing morbidity and mortality. Since the introduction of tenofovir based ARV regimens in 2011, information on the prevalence of low BMD in PLWHIV and receiving ART is still scarce in Malawi. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low BMD among adults living with HIV and receiving ART in Blantyre, Malawi. Methodology This was a cross sectional study involving 282 HIV-positive adults of whom 102 (36%) were males. The participants aged 18–45 years were recruited from three primary and one tertiary health care facilities. Patients with no other comorbidities or conditions associated with low BMD and on ART >12 months were included. Data on BMD (femoral neck and lumbar spine) were collected using Dual–Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess the physical activity (PA) levels. Participants’ body weight (kg) and height (m) were also measured. Descriptive statistics, Chi–Square test and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyse data. Results Mean age of participants was 37(± 6.4) years, mean duration on ART was 5(± 3.5) years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23(± 4.5) kg/m2. Twenty percent (55) had reduced BMD. More males (28%) had reduced BMD than females (14%) (p = 0.04). There was a significant association between lumbar BMD and femoral neck BMD (r = 0.66,p<0.001). However, on average, lumbar BMD (g/cm2) was significantly lower than the femoral BMD (p < 0.001). Participants with low PA level (OR 1.23,p = 0.6) had higher odds of having reduced BMD compared to those with high PA level. Conclusions and recommendation Prevalence of reduced BMD is high among PLWHIV in Malawi especially male Malawian adults. Occurrence of low BMD is associated with low PA level. There is need for health care providers to routinely monitor BMD and PA levels of this population."
https://openalex.org/W2998929497,"Candida krusei is one of the most common agents of invasive candidiasis and candidemia worldwide, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. This species has become a problem due to its intrinsic resistance and reduced susceptibility to azoles and polyenes. Moreover, the number of antifungal drugs available for candidiasis treatment is limited, demonstrating the urgent need for the discovery of novel alternative therapies. In this work, the in vivo and in vitro activities of a new oxadiazole (LMM11) were evaluated against C. krusei. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 32 to 64 μg/mL with a significant reduction in the colony forming unit (CFU) count (~3 log10). LMM11 showed fungicidal effect, similar to amphotericin, reducing the viable cell number (>99.9%) in the time-kill curve. Yeast cells presented morphological alterations and inactive metabolism when treated with LMM11. This compound was also effective in decreasing C. krusei replication inside and outside macrophages. A synergistic effect between fluconazole and LMM11 was observed. In vivo treatment with the new oxadiazole led to a significant reduction in CFU (0.85 log10). Furthermore, histopathological analysis of the treated group exhibited a reduction in the inflammatory area. Taken together, these results indicate that LMM11 is a promising candidate for the development of a new antifungal agent for the treatment of infections caused by resistant Candida species such as C. krusei."
https://openalex.org/W2999198149,"Locoregional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include endovascular treatments such as chemoembolization (TACE) and bland embolization (TAE). TACE is the most adopted technique, despite a lack of definitive evidence of superiority over TAE, which is less costly and better tolerated due to the absence of chemotherapy. However, few studies have reported data on TAE monotherapy for unresectable HCC. We report our results in a cohort of 230 patients with unresectable HCC treated with TAE (TAE with 40-100micron microparticles, TAE with microparticles plus n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, TAE with Lipiodol) over the course of seven years. Thirty-seven patients (14%) were down-staged during observation and also received a percutaneous ablation. We observed 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year rates of 84,8%, 58,7%, 38,3%, 28,3%, and 18,7%. Patients who also received percutaneous treatment performed best. Our results broaden the body of evidence for the use of TAE in advanced HCC."

Here, we identify asparagine hydroxylation as a novel posttranslational modification involved in the regulation of Cezanne (also known as OTU domain–containing protein 7B (OTUD7B)), a DUB that controls key cellular functions and signaling pathways. We demonstrate that Cezanne is a substrate for factor inhibiting HIF1 (FIH1)- and oxygen-dependent asparagine hydroxylation. We found that FIH1 modifies Asn35 within the uncharacterized N-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA)-like domain of Cezanne (UBACez), which lacks conserved UBA domain properties. We show that UBACez binds Lys11-, Lys48-, Lys63-, and Met1-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro, establishing UBACez as a functional ubiquitin-binding domain. Our findings also reveal that the interaction of UBACez with ubiquitin is mediated via a noncanonical surface and that hydroxylation of Asn35 inhibits ubiquitin binding. Recently, it has been suggested that Cezanne recruitment to specific target proteins depends on UBACez. Our results indicate that UBACez can indeed fulfill this role as regulatory domain by binding various ubiquitin chain types. They also uncover that this interaction with ubiquitin, and thus with modified substrates, can be modulated by oxygen-dependent asparagine hydroxylation, suggesting that Cezanne is regulated by oxygen levels.

https://openalex.org/W2999688663,"The foods we eat contain microorganisms that we ingest alongside the food. Industrialized food systems offer great advantages from a safety point of view, but have also been accused of depleting the diversity of the human microbiota with negative implications for human health. In contrast, artisanal traditional foods are potential sources of a diverse food microbiota. Traditional foods of the Greenlandic Inuit are comprised of animal-sourced foods prepared in the natural environment and are often consumed raw. These foods, some of which are on the verge of extinction, have not previously been microbiologically characterized. We mapped the microbiota of foods stemming from traditional Inuit land-based hunting activities. The foods included in the current study are dried muskox and caribou meat, caribou rumen and intestinal content as well as larval parasites from caribou hides, all traditional Inuit foods. This study shows that traditional drying methods are efficient for limiting microbial growth through desiccation. The results also show the rumen content of the caribou to be a highly diverse source of microbes with potential for degradation of plants. Finally, a number of parasites were shown to be included in the biodiversity of the assessed traditional foods. Taken together, the results map out a diverse source of ingested microbes and parasites that originate from the natural environment. These results have implications for understanding the nature-sourced traditional Inuit diet, which is in contrast to current day diet recommendations as well as modern industrialized food systems."

Firstly, the highway crash data and corresponding traffic data of upstream and downstream are extracted and processed by using the matched case-control method to exclude the influence of other factors on the model. Secondly, considering the weight of traffic volume, speed and occupancy, a multi-parameter fusion cluster method is applied to divide traffic safety state. In addition, the quantitative relationship between different traffic states and highway crash risk is analyzed by using Bayesian conditional logistic regression model. Finally, the results of case study show that different traffic safety conditions are in different crash risk levels. The highway traffic management department can improve the safety risk management level by focusing on the prevention and control of high-risk traffic safety conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2999561014,"In order to provide a cost-effective method to narrow down the number of pathogenic Crystallin beta A4 (CRYBA4) non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs), we collected nsSNP information of the CRYBA4 gene from SNP databases and literature, predicting the pathogenicity and possible changes of protein properties and structures using multiple bioinformatics tools. The nsSNP data of the CRYBA4 gene were collected from 4 databases and published literature. According to 12 criteria, six bioinformatics tools were chosen to predict the pathogenicity. I-Mutant 2.0, Mupro and INPS online tools were used to analyze the effects of amino acid substitution on protein stability by calculating the value of ΔΔG. ConSurf, SOPMA, GETAREA and HOPE online tools were used to predict the evolutionary conservation of amino acids, solvent accessible surface areas, and the physical and chemical properties and changes of protein structure. All 157 CRYBA4 nsSNPs were analyzed. Forty-four CRYBA4 high-risk pathogenic nsSNPs (predicted to be pathogenic by all six software tools) were detected out of the 157 CRYBA4 nsSNPs, four of which (c.283C>T, p.R95W; c.449T>A, p.V150D; c.475G>A, p.G159R; c.575G>C, p.R192P) should be focused on because of their high potential pathogenicity and possibility of changing protein properties. Thirty high-risk nsSNPs were predicted to cause a decrease of protein stability. Twenty-nine high-risk nsSNPs occurred in evolutionary conserved positions. Twenty-two high-risk nsSNPs occurred in the core of the protein. It is predicted that these high-risk pathogenic nsSNPs can cause changes in the physical and chemical properties of amino acids, resulting in structural changes of proteins and changes in the interactions between domains and other molecules, thus affecting the function of proteins. This study provides important reference value when narrowing down the number of pathogenic CRYBA4 nsSNPs and studying the pathogenesis of congenital cataracts. By using this method, we can easily find 44 high-risk pathogenic nsSNPs out of 157 CRYBA4 nsSNPs."
https://openalex.org/W3000481273,"High levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) could contribute to abnormal decision making in uncertain situations. Patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often report high IU, indecisiveness and the need to seek greater certainty before making decisions. The Beads task is a commonly used task assessing the degree of information gathering prior to making a decision and so would be predicted to show impairments in OCD patients. Results to date have found mixed support for this, possibility due to methodological issues. Here, a group of OCD patients (n = 50) with no comorbidities was compared with age, gender, and verbal-IQ matched controls (n = 50) on the most commonly used version of the Beads task. An independent sample of healthy volunteers with high versus low OC symptoms, and high versus low IU were also assessed (n = 125). There was no evidence that patients with OCD differed from control volunteers in the degree of information gathering prior to making a decision. Medication status and age did not appear to mediate performance. Similarly, there were no association in healthy volunteers between task performance and OC or IU characteristics. Additional measures examining the degree of certainty initially showed support for greater uncertainty in patients, but this was due to deviations from task instructions in a subset of patients. We conclude that despite the large sample size and good matching between groups, the Beads task in its most widely used form is not a useful measure of IU or of information gathering in OCD. The results argue against a robust behavioural difference in OCD when compared to controls. Recommendations for future studies employing the task are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2999687384,"Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common postsurgical complication. Palonosetron is effective for PONV prevention at the usual dose of 75 μg, but the ideal dose for obese patients has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to compare body weight-adjusted and fixed doses of palonosetron for preventing PONV in obese female patients. Materials and methods We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial involving 80 female patients, aged 18–80 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of 2 and 3 and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg m-2 who were scheduled to undergo elective breast surgery. Patients received an intravenous body weight-adjusted dose of palonosetron (1 μg kg -1, GI = 40 patients) or a fixed dose of palonosetron (75 μg, GII = 40 patients). All patients received dexamethasone (4 mg). The incidence of PONV, complete response rate (CR), severity of nausea and need for rescue antiemetics and analgesics were assessed at: 0–1 h, 1–6 h, 6–24 h and 24–48 h postoperatively. Results The mean (± SD) BMI was 35.0 (±5.2) kg m-2 for GI and 35.7 (±3.6) kg m-2 for GII. There was no significant difference between groups in PONV incidence, CR, severity of nausea, and need for rescue antiemetics or analgesics. The incidence of PONV for GI and GII was 15% and 27.5%, respectively, during the first 48 h (P = 0.17). Conclusions A body weight-adjusted dose of palonosetron was as effective as 75 μg for preventing PONV for 48 h in obese female patients who underwent breast surgery. Hence, the fixed dose may be preferable to the body weight-adjusted dose."

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of off-label and unlicensed prescribing for paediatric patients in a public hospital, Indonesia.A retrospective cross-sectional study of 200 randomly selected paediatric patients admitted to hospital between August and October 2014, collected patient details and all drugs prescribed. Licensed drugs were classified as off-label if there was a non-compliance with the Product Information for age, weight, indication, dose, frequency and route of administration, if there was a contraindication, special precautions or not recommended for children. Unlicensed drugs were those not approved for use in Indonesia. The main outcome was the prevalence of off-label or unlicensed prescribing to infants, children and adolescents and the impact of age group on off-label prescribing.A total of 200 patients received 1961 medicines of which 1807/1961 (92.1%) were licensed and 154/1961 (7.9%) were unlicensed. There were 1403/1961 (71.5%) drugs prescribed off-label. More than half of the total drugs (n = 1066; 54.4%) were administered parenterally. Every patient was prescribed at least one off-label drug. Indication (n = 810; 34.6%) was the most common reason for off-label prescribing. Ranitidine was the most frequent drug prescribed off label. Darplex® (dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine), although manufactured in Indonesia, was unlicensed. There was a significant difference between age group and off-label prescribing in that children were prescribed significantly less off-label drugs (p<0.0003).This study revealed a high prevalence of off-label and unlicensed drug use in paediatric patients in this hospital, exposing them to drug treatments or regimens that had not been approved by regulatory authorities. The high incidence of invasive parenteral prescribing is of concern for paediatric patients. Incentives are needed to encourage specific drug evaluation in paediatric populations."
https://openalex.org/W2999937227,"Overdispersion in count data analysis is very common in many practical fields of health sciences. Ignorance of the presence of overdispersion in such data analysis may cause misleading inferences and thus lead to incorrect interpretations of the results. Researchers should account for the consequences of overdispersion and need to select the correct choice of models for the analysis of such data. In this paper, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are applied in modelling and analysis of antenatal care (ANC) count data extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014. Pearson chi-square and different score tests are used to investigate the effect of overdispersion in the analysis. Overdispersion is found to be significant in the antenatal health care count data and so appropriate modelling is used to produce valid inferences for the regression parameters. The zero-truncated negative binomial regression (0-NBR) is found to be the best choice for analysing such data while excluding zero counts. Study findings reveal that place of residence, order of birth, exposure to mass media, wealth index and education of mother have significant impacts on the ANC status of women during pregnancy in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2999082219,"Worldwide about 4 million newborns die each year; of which around 600,000 newborns die from series bacterial infections. To reduce newborn death, community based newborn care is being implemented in Ethiopia though its utilization by clients is low. Studies conducted to address perception of the community towards newborn illnesses are limited. Therefore, this study was aimed in exploring community member's perception, experiences and health seeking behavior towards newborn illnesses.A descriptive qualitative study was conducted from March 11- April 7, 2019 in Debre Libanos District, Ethiopia. Study participants were recruited purposively from six kebeles and women delivered within two months prior to data collection were the primary study participants. Five in-depth interviews, seven key informant interviews and three focused group discussions were conducted. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis in Atlas ti.7.1 software package.This study found that community members locally diagnose newborn illnesses as sunburn, evil eye, kichitat, megagna, berd, enlarged/dropping of uvula, and common cold from misconceived cause when unspecific types of symptoms are recognized on newborns. For those locally diagnosed newborn illnesses, they primarily prefer traditional medications to manage the illnesses rather than seeking care from health facilities. This study also found that clients seek health care for these newborn illnesses late. They seek care either from traditional or from health facilities when newborns become unable to breast feed, weak and feeling too hot.Local newborn illness diagnosis negatively affected health seeking behavior of the community members in that they made them to rely on traditional medications or delay in seeking care from health facilities. This might leads to negative consequences like disability and mortality. Therefore, health care providers and policy makers should design social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) to change community member's health seeking behavior towards newborn illnesses."
https://openalex.org/W2999693225,"Background Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) across the age spectrum; candidate are in clinical trials. While norovirus diagnostic testing is increasingly available, stool testing may not be performed routinely, which can hamper surveillance and burden of disease estimates. Additionally, lack of knowledge of the burden of disease may inhibit provider recommendations, which could affect coverage rates and ultimately the impact of the vaccine. Our objectives were to understand physicians' stool testing practices in outpatients with AGE, and physician knowledge of norovirus, in order to improve surveillance and prepare for introduction. Methods Internet and mail survey on AGE, norovirus, and future norovirus conducted January to March 2018 among national networks of primary care pediatricians, family practice and general internal medicine physicians. Results The response rate was 59% (820/1383). During peak AGE season, physicians estimated they ordered stool tests for a median of 15% (interquartile range: 5-33%) of their outpatients with AGE. Stool tests were reported as more often available for ova and parasites, Clostridioides difficile, and bacterial culture (>95% for all specialties) than for norovirus (6-33% across specialties); even when available, norovirus-specific tests were infrequently ordered. Most providers were unaware that norovirus is a leading cause of AGE across all age groups (Pediatricians 80%, Family Practice 86%, General Internal Medicine 89%) or that alcohol-based hand sanitizers are ineffective against norovirus (Pediatricians 51%, Family Practice 66%, General Internal Medicine 62%). Concerns cited as major barriers to implementing a future norovirus included if the is not covered by insurance (General Internal Medicine 64%, Pediatricians 67%, Family Practice 74%) and lack of adequate reimbursement for vaccination (Pediatricians 43%, General Internal Medicine 46%, Family Practice 50%). Factors that providers believed were 'not at all a barrier' or 'minor barrier' to new introduction included the belief that my patients won't need this vaccine (General Internal Medicine 78%, Family Practice 86%, Pediatricians 90%) and my patients already get too many vaccines (Family Practice 89%, General Internal Medicine 92%, Pediatricians 95%). Conclusions Primary care physicians had few concerns regarding future norovirus introduction, but have knowledge gaps on norovirus prevalence and hand hygiene for prevention. Also, physicians infrequently order stool tests for outpatients with AGE, which limits surveillance estimates that rely on physician-ordered stool diagnostics. Closing physician knowledge gaps on norovirus burden and transmission can help support norovirus introduction."

Understanding the epidemiology of ETS exposure is important to guide health promotion planning. Therefore, we designed this study to determine the prevalence of household ETS exposure in healthy young children under 2 years of age in Hong Kong, and to explore risk factors associated with the exposure. Our secondary goal was to characterise children's exposure profile to maternal smoking.A secondary analysis was performed based on the data collected from our 2013-2014 territory-wide cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveillance study, with a sample size of 1541. We conducted descriptive analysis for exposure prevalence, univariate and multivariate analysis for identification of risk factors.1541 children (mean age: 11.2 ± 6.4 months, male: 50.7%) were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of current household ETS exposure was 31.5%, prevalence of prenatal and postnatal maternal smoking was 3.5% and 1.6% respectively. Independent factors associated with children's ETS exposure were: never breastfed (AOR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.13-1.93, p = 0.004); prenatal maternal smoking (AOR: 7.46, 95% CI: 2.73-20.39, p< 0.001); overcrowding of household living place (AOR: 3.17, 95% CI: 2.02-4.96, P< 0.001); lower household income (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.04-1.72, p = 0.02). Interestingly, children residing in Kowloon (AOR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.19-2.33, p = 0.003) and New Territories West (AOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11-2.15, p = 0.01) were associated with exposure compared with children residing in Hong Kong Island.Exposure to household ETS is prevalent among Hong Kong young children, particularly in children with maternal unfavourable behaviour and lower socioeconomic status. The identified risk factors should be considered while tobacco control interventions and legislations are planned."
https://openalex.org/W3000056943,"We study the time evolution of the shape of a vesicle membrane under time-dependent spontaneous curvature by means of phase-field model. We introduce the variation in time of the spontaneous curvature via a second field which represents the concentration of a substance that anchors with the lipid bilayer thus changing the local curvature and producing constriction. This constriction is mediated by the action on the membrane of an structure resembling the role of a Z ring. Our phase-field model is able to reproduce a number of different shapes that have been experimentally observed. Different shapes are associated with different constraints imposed upon the model regarding conservation of membrane area. In particular, we show that if area is conserved our model reproduces the so-called L-form shape. By contrast, if the area of the membrane is allowed to grow, our model reproduces the formation of a septum in the vicinity of the constriction. Furthermore, we propose a new term in the free energy which allows the membrane to evolve towards eventual pinching."

Operationalizing a life course approach with the use of an innovative Testing and Risk History Calendar [TRHC], we collected pilot data on older South Africans’ risk and HIV testing. We found older persons were able to provide (1) reference points to facilitate recall over a 10-year period, (2) specifics about HIV tests during that decade, and (3) details that contextualize the testing data, such as living arrangements, relationships, and health status. Interviewer debriefing sessions after each interview captured information on context and links across domains. On a larger scale, the TRHC has potential to reveal pathways between sexual behavior, HIV testing and risk perception, and health at older ages."
https://openalex.org/W3000269183,"Background While patient-centered care is recommended as a key dimension for quality improvement, in case of serious illness, patients may have different expectations regarding information and participation in medical decision-making. In oncology, anticipation of disease worsening remains difficult, especially when patient’s preferences towards prognosis medical information are unclear. Valid tools to explore patients’ preferences could help targeting end-of-life discussions, which have been shown to decrease aggressiveness of end-of-life care. Our aim was to establish the validity and reliability of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index (API) among patients with incurable cancer and in primary care setting. Three supplementary items were specifically developed to evaluate preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration among patients with incurable cancer. Methods The psychometric properties of the API translated into French were assessed among patients consecutively recruited from January to March 2017 in the waiting rooms of 19 general practitioners (N = 391) and in an oncology (N = 187) clinic in Paris. Relationships between the newly-developed items and the API subscale scores were studied. Results A three correlated factors confirmatory model (two factors related to decision-making and a factor related to information-seeking preferences) showed an acceptable fit on the whole sample and no measurement invariance issue was found across settings, age, sex and educational level. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable for the information-seeking and decision-making subscales. One of the newly-developed items on patients’ ability to anticipate a decision on the use of artificial respiration if a sudden deterioration of their illness occurred was not related to the API subscale scores. Conclusion The French version of the API was found valid and reliable for use in general practice and oncology settings. The additional items on patient preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration can be of interest to ensure that patient values guide all end-of-life clinical decisions."

We further examined whether this switch is performed predictively or reactively. Twenty five people with Parkinson's disease continuously increased or decreased the frequency of their arm movements, inducing an abrupt-but unaware-switch between rhythmic movements (at high frequencies) and discrete movements (at low frequencies). We tested whether that precipitous change was performed reactively or predictively. We found that 56% of participants predictively switched between the two movement types. The ability of people with Parkinson's disease, taking their regular medication, to predictively control their movements on implicit tasks is thus preserved."
https://openalex.org/W2998760622,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks persist in patients despite treatment. CVD susceptibility also varies with sex and ethnicity and is not entirely explained by conventional CVD risk factors. The aim of the present study was to identify novel CVD candidate markers in circulating Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma from Arab obese subjects with and without CVD using proteomic approaches. Human adults with confirmed CVD (n = 208) and matched non-CVD controls (n = 152) living in Kuwait were examined in the present cross-sectional study. Anthropometric and classical biochemical parameters were determined. We employed a shotgun proteomic profiling approach on PBMCs isolated from a subset of the groups (n = 4, each), and differentially expressed proteins selected between the two groups were validated at the mRNA level using RT-PCR (n = 6, each). Plasma levels of selected proteins from the proteomics profiling: Proteinase-3 (PR3), Annexin-A3 (ANX3), Defensin (DEFA1), and Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), were measured in the entire cohort using human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and were subsequently correlated with various clinical parameters. Out of the 1407 we identified and quantified from the proteomics profiling, 47 proteins were dysregulated with at least twofold change between the two subject groups. Among the differentially expressed proteins, 11 were confirmed at the mRNA levels. CVD influenced the levels of the shortlisted proteins (MMP9, PR3, ANX3, and DEFA1) in the PBMCs and plasma differentially. Despite the decreased levels of both protein and mRNA in PBMCs, PR3 circulating levels increased significantly in patients with CVD and were influenced by neither diabetes nor statin treatment. No significant changes were; however, observed in the DEFA1, MMP9, and ANX3 levels in plasma. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only PR3 was independently associated with CVD. Our results suggest that the dysregulation of PR3 levels in plasma and PBMCs reflects underlying residual CVD risks even in the treated population. More prospective and larger studies are required to establish the role of PR3 in CVD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2998765138,"The acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBP) act by regulating the availability of acyl-CoA in the cytoplasm and must have essential functions in lipid metabolism. The genome of the kissing-bug Rhodnius prolixus encodes five proteins of this family, but little is known about them. In this study we investigated the expression and function of RpACBP-5. Feeding induced RpACBP-5 gene expression in the posterior midgut, and an increase of about four times was observed two days after the blood meal. However, the amount of protein, which was only detected in this organ, did not change during digestion. The RpACBP-5 gene was also highly expressed in pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes. Recombinant RpACBP-5 was shown to bind to acyl-CoA of different lengths, and it exhibited nanomolar affinity to lauroyl-CoA in an isothermal titration assay, indicating that RpACBP-5 is a functional ACBP. RpACBP-5 knockdown by RNA interference did not affect digestion, egg laying and hatching, survival, or accumulation of triacylglycerol in the fat body and oocytes. Similarly, double knockdown of RpACBP-1 and RpACBP-5 did not alter egg laying and hatching, survival, accumulation of triacylglycerol in the fat body and oocytes, or the neutral lipid composition of the posterior midgut or hemolymph. These results show that RpACBP-5 is a functional ACBP but indicate that the lack of a detectable phenotype in the knockdown insects may be a consequence of functional overlap of the proteins of the ACBP family found in the insect."
https://openalex.org/W2998975647,"We investigated the species diversity of Mycobacteriaceae in surface water samples from six environments at the zoological park in São Paulo, Brazil. Three hundred and eighty isolates were cultivated and identified by phenotypic characteristics (growth rate and pigmentation) and sequencing of hsp65, rpoB and 16S rRNA genes. The results revealed that almost 48% of the isolates could be identified at the species level; about 50% were classified at the genus level, and only less than 2% of the isolates showed an inconclusive identification. The isolates classified at the genus level and not identified were then evaluated by phylogenetic analyses using the same three concatenated target genes. The results allowed us to identify at the genus level some isolates that previously had inconclusive identification, and they also suggested the presence of putative candidate species within the sample, demonstrating that this zoological park is an important source of diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2999740434,"The present study aimed to develop a new scale to evaluate the level of difficulty in treating major depressive disorder with antidepressants based on the lifetime treatment profile.In addition to evaluating the difficulty of treatment with antidepressants (A subscale), the Treatment Resistance to Antidepressants Evaluation Scale (TRADES) is comprised of a subscale to account for the attributes that compromise the efficacy of treatment (B subscale). One hundred and six participants aged 18 to 65 years with remitted major depressive disorder were enrolled. Eligible cases were those with at least 2 years from disease onset until the scoring date of the TRADES (the index date), with a complete treatment record. Various psychosocial and clinical features, such as neuroticism, harm avoidance, and utilization of psychiatric services, were used to validate the TRADES.The mean duration of the course before and after the index date were 5.5 ± 3.5 and 3.1 ± 1.7 years, respectively. In a multiple regression analysis, the final total scores of the TRADES independently correlated with higher levels of neuroticism and harm avoidance. Total scores were also associated with a higher utilization of psychiatric outpatient and admission services before the index date. Furthermore, it is thought that total scores could predict a higher number of visits to psychiatric outpatient, emergency, and admission services following the index date.The TRADES has acceptable validity and could help to quantify the level of treatment difficulty with antidepressants in major depressive disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3000111057,"The exchange of diverse ideas has been shown to be a major driver of economic growth and innovation in local labor markets across the U.S. Yet, persistently high levels of occupational gender segregation pose a barrier to such exchange between women and men workers. Consistent with this, organizational sociologists have identified multiple economic benefits to gender diversity in workplaces. Yet, it is unclear whether these trends apply to local labor markets, which constitute the ecological geographic environment for firms. In this study, I use fixed effects regression models to examine the relationship between labor market levels of segregation and economic growth from 1980 through 2010. I find that gender segregation hinders the expansion of finance and technology sectors as two industries that rely on the exchange of information and innovation. Consequently, higher levels of gender segregation are also a bane to economic productivity, as measured through hourly wages. Results from this study suggest that gender equity, manifested in lower levels of occupational segregation, is a vital ingredient in the economic development of local U.S. labor markets."
https://openalex.org/W3000299035,"In the context of research for new cytotoxic compounds, obtaining bioactive molecules from renewable sources remain a big challenge. Microorganisms and more specifically Actinobacteria from original sources are well known for their biotechnological potential and are hotspots for the discovery of new bioactive compounds. The strain DP94 studied here had shown an interesting cytotoxic activity of its culture broth (HaCaT: IC50 = 8.0 ± 1.5 μg/mL; B16: IC50 = 4.6 ± 1.8 μg/mL), which could not been explained by the compounds isolated in a previous work. The increase of the cytotoxic activity of extracts was investigated, based on a Taguchi L9 orthogonal array design, after DP94 culture in TY medium using two different vessels (bioreactor or Erlenmeyer flasks). Various culture parameters such as temperature, pH and inoculum ratio (%) were studied. For experiments conducted in a bioreactor, stirring speed was included as an additional parameter. Significant differences in the cytotoxic activities of different extracts on B16 melanoma cancer cell lines, highlighted the influence of culture temperature on the production of cytotoxic compound(s) using a bioreactor. A culture in Erlenmeyer flasks was also performed and afforded an increase of the production of the active compounds. The best conditions for the highest cytotoxicity (IC50 on B16: 6 ± 0.5 μg/mL) and the highest yield (202.0 mg/L) were identified as: pH 6, temperature 37°C and 5% inoculum."
https://openalex.org/W3000066024,"Images of European female and male faces were digitally processed to generate spatial frequency (SF) filtered images containing only a narrow band of visual information within the Fourier spectrum. The original unfiltered images and four SF filtered images (low, medium-low, medium-high and high) were then paired in trials that kept constant SF band and face gender and participants made a forced-choice decision about the more attractive among the two faces. In this way, we aimed at identifying those specific SF bands where forced-choice preferences corresponded best to forced-choice judgements made when viewing the natural, broadband, facial images. We found that aesthetic preferences dissociated across SFs and face gender, but similarly for participants from Asia (Japan) and Europe (Norway). Specifically, preferences when viewing SF filtered images were best related to the preference with the broadband face images when viewing the highest filtering band for the female faces (about 48-77 cycles per face). In contrast, for the male faces, the medium-low SF band (about 11-19 cpf) related best to choices made with the natural facial images. Eye tracking provided converging evidence for the above, gender-related, SF dissociations. We suggest greater aesthetic relevance of the mobile and communicative parts for the female face and, conversely, of the rigid, structural, parts for the male face for facial aesthetics."
https://openalex.org/W3000428751,"Individual responses of wild birds to fragmented habitat have rarely been studied, despite large-scale habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss resulting from widespread urbanisation. We investigated the spatial ecology of the Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla, a tiny, resident, woodland passerine that has recently colonised city parks at the northern extent of its range. High resolution spatiotemporal movements of this obligate tree-living species were determined using radio telemetry within the urbanized matrix of city parks in Copenhagen, Denmark. We identified regular edge crossing behaviour, novel in woodland birds. While low numbers of individuals precluded a comprehensive characterisation of home range for this population, we were able to describe a consistent behaviour which has consequences for our understanding of animal movement in urban ecosystems. We report that treecreepers move freely, and apparently do so regularly, between isolated habitat patches. This behaviour is a possible driver of the range expansion in this species and may contribute to rapid dispersal capabilities in certain avian species, including Short-toed Treecreepers, into northern Europe. Alternatively, these behaviours might be common and/or provide an adaptive advantage for birds utilising matrix habitats, for example within urban ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3000605855,"Approximate computing is an emerging design paradigm that offers trade-offs between output accuracy and computation efforts by exploiting some applications’ intrinsic error resiliency. Computation of error metrics is of paramount importance in approximate circuits to measure the degree of approximation. Most of the existing techniques for evaluating error metrics apply simulations which may not be effective for evaluation of large complex designs because of an immense increase in simulation runtime and a decrease in accuracy. To address these deficiencies, we present a novel methodology that employs SAT (Boolean satisfiability) solvers for fast and accurate determination of error metrics specifically for the calculation of an average-case error and the maximum error rate in functionally approximated circuits. The proposed approach identifies the set of all errors producing assignments to gauge the quality of approximate circuits for real-life applications. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a test generation method to facilitate design choices, and acts as an important guide to debug the approximate circuits to discover and locate the errors. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by evaluating the error metrics of several benchmark-approximated adders of different sizes. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed SAT-based methodology accurately determines the maximum error rate and an average-case error within acceptable CPU execution time in one go, and further provides a log of error-generating input assignments."
https://openalex.org/W3000116587,"Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder in which endometrial tissue is found outside the uterine cavity. Previous reports suggest that there is a dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis during the progression of endometriosis. Our previous report showed that a short-term treatment with antalarmin, a corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor type 1 (CRHR1) antagonist decreases the number and size of endometriotic vesicles in the auto-transplantation rat model of endometriosis. Our current goal was to examine the mRNA expression of intra-adrenal receptors to better understand the mechanisms of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis involvement in endometriosis. We used two groups of female rats. The first received sham surgery or endometriosis surgery before collecting the adrenals after 7 days of the disease progression. The second group of animals received endometriosis surgery and a treatment of either vehicle or antalarmin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) during the first 7 days after endometriosis induction and then the disease was allowed to progress until day 60. Rats with sham surgery served as controls. Results showed that the mRNA expression of the mineralocorticoid (MRC2) receptor was lower in the rats after 7 days of endometriosis surgery and in rats with endometriosis that received antalarmin. In addition, the CRHR1 was significantly elevated in animals that received antalarmin and this was counteracted by a non-significant elevation in CRHR2 mRNA. The glucocorticoid receptor mRNA within the adrenals was not affected by endometriosis or antalarmin treatment. This report is one of the first to explore intra-adrenal mRNA for receptors involved in the HPA axis signaling as well as in the sympatho-adrenal signaling, calling for additional research towards understanding the role of the adrenal glands in chronic inflammatory diseases such as endometriosis."
