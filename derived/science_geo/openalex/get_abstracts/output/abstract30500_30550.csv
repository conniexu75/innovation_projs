https://openalex.org/W2030087375,"Visual presentation of words activates extrastriate regions of the occipital lobes of the brain. When analyzed by positron emission tomography (PET), certain areas in the left, medial extrastriate visual cortex were activated by visually presented pseudowords that obey English spelling rules, as well as by actual words. These areas were not activated by nonsense strings of letters or letter-like forms. Thus visual word form computations are based on learned distinctions between words and nonwords. In addition, during passive presentation of words, but not pseudowords, activation occurred in a left frontal area that is related to semantic processing. These findings support distinctions made in cognitive psychology and computational modeling between high-level visual and semantic computations on single words and describe the anatomy that may underlie these distinctions."
https://openalex.org/W2042900296,"The possibility has been explored that a subset of physiologically identifiable cells in the visual cortex is especially suited for the processing of stereoscopic depth information. First, characteristics of a disparity detector that would be useful for such processing were outlined. Then, a method was devised by which detailed binocular response data were obtained from cortical cells. In addition, a model of the disparity detector was developed that includes a plausible hierarchical arrangement of cortical cells. Data from the cells compare well with the requirements for the archetypal disparity detector and are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the model. These results demonstrate that a specific type of cortical neuron exhibits the desired characteristics of a disparity detector."

https://openalex.org/W2023308742,"Superantigens, including the staphylococcal enterotoxins and the minor lymphocyte stimulatory antigens, are highly potent immunostimulatory molecules, capable of activating virtually all T cells that express particular T cell receptor (TCR) variable regions. Superantigen stimulation of T lymphocytes depends on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, so there has been some debate as to whether superantigens interact with the antigen binding ""groove"" on class II complexes, just like conventional peptide antigens, or whether they bind elsewhere and serve as TCR coligands. We compared the presentation of peptide antigens and superantigens by a panel of mutant-presenting cell lines, each displaying an A kappa alpha chain with a single alanine replacement along the alpha helix proposed to form one face of the groove. The negligible effect of these 30 mutations on superantigen presentation, versus their drastic consequences for peptide presentation, prompts us to conclude that superantigens interact with MHC class II molecules outside the groove."

https://openalex.org/W2077125839,"Fluid transport systems mediate the transfer of materials both within an organism and between an organism and its environment. The architecture of fluid transport systems is determined by the small distances over which transfer processes are effective and by hydrodynamic and energetic constraints. All fluid transport systems within organisms exhibit one of two geometries, a simple tube interrupted by a planar transfer region or a branched network of vessels linking widely distributed transfer regions; each is determined by different morphogenetic processes. By exploiting the signal inherent in local shear stress on the vessel walls, animals have repeatedly evolved a complex branching hierarchy of vessels approximating a globally optimal system that minimizes the costs of the construction and maintenance of the fluid transport system."

NK cells are able to recognize and lyse various virally infected or neoplastic target cells without previous sensitization or major histocompatibility complex restriction. A 60-kD disulfide-linked dimer, highly expressed on NK cells, was found capable of mediating transmembrane signaling. The gene encoding this signal transduction molecule was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The encoded protein showed significant homology with a number of lectin-related membrane proteins that share receptor characteristics. This protein may function as a receptor able to selectively trigger NK cell activity."
https://openalex.org/W1495515604,"Three hemoglobins have been isolated from the symbiont-harboring gill of the bivalve mollusc Lucina pectinata. Oxyhemoglobin I (Hb I), which may be called sulfide-reactive hemoglobin, reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form ferric hemoglobin sulfide in a reaction that may proceed by nucleophilic displacement of bound superoxide anion by hydrosulfide anion. Hemoglobins II and II, called oxygen-reactive hemoglobins, remain oxygenated in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. Hemoglobin I is monomeric; Hb II and Hb III self-associate in a concentration-dependent manner and form a tetramer when mixed. Oxygen binding is not cooperative. Oxygen affinities are all nearly the same, P50 = 0.1 to 0.2 Torr, and are independent of pH. Combination of Hb I with oxygen is fast; k'on = (estimated) 100-200 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. Combination of Hb II and Hb III with oxygen is slow: k'on = 0.4 and 0.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, respectively. Dissociation of oxygen from Hb I is fast relative to myoglobin: koff = 61 s-1. Dissociation from Hb II and Hb III is slow: koff = 0.11 and 0.08 s-1, respectively. These large differences in rates of reaction together with differences in the reactions of carbon monoxide suggest differences in configuration of the distal heme pocket. The fast reactions of Hb I are comparable to those of hemoglobins that lack distal histidine residues. Slow dissociation of oxygen from Hb II and Hb III suggest that a distal residue may interact strongly with the bound ligand. We infer that Hb I may facilitate delivery of hydrogen sulfide to the chemoautotrophic bacterial symbiont and Hb II and Hb III may facilitate delivery of oxygen. The midpoint oxidation-reduction potential of the ferrous/ferric couple of Hb I, 103 +/- 8 mV, was independent of pH. Potentials of Hb II and Hb III were pH-dependent. At neutral pH all three hemoglobins have similar midpoint potentials. The rate constant for combination of ferric Hb I with hydrogen sulfide increases 3000-fold from pH 10.5 to 5.5, with apparent pK 7.0, suggesting that undissociated hydrogen sulfide is the attacking ligand. At the acid limit combination of ferric Hb I with hydrogen sulfide, k'on = 2.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, is 40-fold faster than combination with ferric Hb II or myoglobin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2077207000,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding acetylcholinesterase from mouse muscle and brain. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify cDNA clones from C2 myotubes encoding the entire open reading frame and large segments of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. The muscle cDNA clones were used to isolate clones from a brain library encoding the same mRNA species. The mouse clones encode a catalytic subunit containing a C-terminal sequence similar to that of the hydrophilic species of Torpedo. The mouse acetylcholinesterase sequence shares approximately 88% and 61% amino acid identity with bovine and Torpedo acetylcholinesterases, respectively, but only 52% identity with mouse butyrylcholinesterase, the sequence of which we have also deduced by molecular cloning. Northern blot and RNAase protection analyses indicate that the cDNA clones were derived from the acetylcholinesterase transcript that predominates in most expressing tissues. In contrast, erythroid cells are enriched in an mRNA species whose sequence diverges from that of the cDNA in the region encoding the C-terminus of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1492308129,"Purified myosin light chain kinase from smooth muscle is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and the multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Because phosphorylation in a specific site (site A) by any one of these kinases desensitizes myosin light chain kinase to activation by Ca2+/calmodulin, kinase phosphorylation could play an important role in regulating smooth muscle contractility. This possibility was investigated in 32P-labeled bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Treatment of tissues with carbachol, KCl, isoproterenol, or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increased the extent of kinase phosphorylation. Six primary phosphopeptides (A-F) of myosin light chain kinase were identified. Site A was phosphorylated to an appreciable extent only with carbachol or KCl, agents which contract tracheal smooth muscle. The extent of site A phosphorylation correlated to increases in the concentration of Ca2+/calmodulin required for activation. These results show that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C do not affect smooth muscle contractility by phosphorylating site A in myosin light chain kinase. It is proposed that phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase in site A in contracting tracheal smooth muscle may play a role in the reported desensitization of contractile elements to activation by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1602384986,"Polypeptides synthesized in eucaryotic cells with a C-terminal -Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa (-CXXX) sequence are candidates for post-translational modifications that include the removal of the last 3 amino acids and the lipidation and methyl esterification of the cysteinyl residue. To characterize the methylation reaction in vitro, the peptide Leu-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Cys (LARYKC) and its S-isoprenylated and S-alkylated derivatives were synthesized and assayed as methyl-accepting substrates with subcellular fractions of rat tissues including liver microsomal membranes. While little or no peptide-specific methyltransferase activity was detected in the latter preparation using the unmodified hexapeptide, the C10, C15, and C20 isoprenylated derivatives were substrates with Km values of 389 microM for S-geranyl-LARYKC, 2.2 microM for S-farnesyl-LARYKC, and approximately 10.9 microM for S-geranylgeranyl-LARYKC. The methyl-acceptor activities of a variety of n-alkyl S-derivatives of LARYKC (C8, C10, C13, C15) were also tested; all of these compounds were poorer substrates than the S-geranyl derivative. This enzyme activity uses S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor (Km = 2.1 microM) and can be inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (Ki = 9.2 microM), a product of the methylation reaction. The S-farnesyl-LARYKC peptide can inhibit the carboxyl methylation of bovine retinal rod outer segment membrane proteins that was previously shown to occur at the alpha-carboxyl group of C-terminal cysteine residues, demonstrating that the same enzyme can methylate both peptides and proteins. These results suggest that the methyl esterification of proteins containing a C-terminal -CXXX sequence requires not only the removal of the 3 terminal amino acids, but the isoprenylation of the sulfhydryl group as well."
https://openalex.org/W1989983474,"Egg laying by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans requires the functioning of the vulva, the gonad, the egg-laying muscles, and the two HSN neurons, which innervate these muscles. By analyzing a newly isolated mutant (dig-1) that displaces the gonad, we discovered that cell interactions coordinate the spatial relationships among the different components of the egg-laying system. First, the gonad induces the formation of the vulva, and vulval induction by dorsal gonads strongly suggests that the inductive signal can act at a distance. Second, the gonad acts at a distance to regulate the migrations of the sex myoblasts that generate the egg-laying musculature. Third, the positions of the axonal branch and synapses of each HSN neuron are displaced correspondingly with the rest of the egg-laying system in dig-1 animals, which suggests that cell interactions also control aspects of HSN development."
https://openalex.org/W1564144670,"The human transferrin receptor is post-translationally modified by the covalent attachment of palmitic acid to Cys62 and Cys67 via a thio-ester bond. To investigate the role of the acylation of the transferrin receptor, Cys62 and Cys67 were substituted with serine and alanine residues. The properties of the mutant receptors were compared with wild-type receptors after expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack endogenous transferrin receptors. Rapid incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the wild-type transferrin receptor was observed, but the mutant receptors were found to be palmitoylation-defective. The kinetics of endocytosis and recycling of the wild-type and mutant receptors were compared. It was observed that the rate of endocytosis of the palmitoylation-defective transferrin receptors was significantly greater than the rate measured for the wild-type transferrin receptor. In contrast, the mutation of Cys62 and Cys67 was found to have no significant effect on the rate of transferrin receptor recycling. Consistent with these observations, it was found that cells expressing palmitoylation-defective transferrin receptors exhibited an increased rate of accumulation of [59Fe]diferric transferrin. Together, these data indicate that the palmitoylation of the transferrin receptor is associated with an inhibition of the rate of transferrin receptor endocytosis. Addition of insulin to cultured cells causes an increase in the palmitoylation of cell surface transferrin receptors and a decrease in the rate of transferrin receptor internalization. It was observed that the effect of insulin to inhibit the endocytosis of the acylation-defective [Ala62 Ala67]transferrin receptor was attenuated in comparison with the wild-type receptor. The decreased effectiveness of insulin to inhibit the internalization of the acylation-defective transferrin receptor is consistent with the hypothesis that palmitoylation represents a potential mechanism for the regulation of transferrin receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1562952717,"We have identified a class of small mRNAs (approximately 0.5 kilobases), referred to as small auxin-up RNAs (SAURs), that increases in abundance within minutes after auxin application to excised elongating hypocotyl sections of soybean. In this study, we present evidence that SAURs accumulate in the absence of auxin when protein synthesis is inhibited. Superinduction of SAURs occurs if the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is added under conditions where protein synthesis is inhibited. Transcription run-on experiments with isolated nuclei show that, unlike 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, protein synthesis inhibitors do not activate transcription of the SAUR genes. These results suggest that protein synthesis inhibitors act by stabilizing SAURs and that some labile protein(s) are involved in the rapid turnover of SAURs. This stabilization is not observed with GH3, another auxin-inducible mRNA. Whether induced with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or cycloheximide, SAURs are primarily expressed in epidermal and cortical cells of elongating hypocotyl sections, with little or no expression in vascular tissue. Unlike 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-induced SAUR accumulation, the increase in abundance of SAURs induced by cycloheximide is transient, with a peak approximately 1 h after inhibitor addition. Complete inhibition of protein synthesis is not required for SAUR accumulation in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1495345604,"Abstract Recently we found by immunogold electron microscopy that protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI), a major resident protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of many cells, is exceptionally localized in rat exocrine pancreatic cells not only in the ER but also in plasma membranes and other organelles along secretory pathway (Akagi, S., Yamamoto, A., Yoshimori, T., Masaki, R., Ogawa, R., and Tashiro, Y. (1988) J. Histochem. Cytochem. 36, 1069-1074). These observations suggest that another type of PDI, e.g. one with a defective ER retention signal, might exist and be transported in the exocrine pancreatic cells. We therefore compared biochemical and immunochemical properties of the transported PDI with the authentic ER resident PDI. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping, urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing showed that the former was indistinguishable from the latter. We prepared a polyclonal antibody against the synthetic hexapeptide, which corresponds to the carboxyl terminus of PDI containing the putative ER retention signal KDEL. The epitopes of this antibody (anti-KDEL antibody) were located within the KDEL sequence. Anti-KDEL antibody reacted with PDI in both the plasma membranes and the ER of rat pancreatic cells in immunoblot analysis as well as in immunogold electron microscopy. These results suggest that PDI exported from the ER to the plasma membranes in rat exocrine pancreatic cells possesses the KDEL sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1570444949,"Photoreceptors of vertebrate retinas contain a 33,000-dalton phosphoprotein, phosducin, which complexes with the beta, gamma subunits of the photoreceptor G-protein (guanine nucleotide-binding protein), transducin. In situ, the retinal content of phosphorylated phosducin is modulated by light in conjunction with light-triggered changes in intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentration. In vitro, phosducin is phosphorylated by either exogenous or endogenous protein kinase A. 32P-Labeled rat retina phosducin was isolated by immunoprecipitation either after phosphorylation by protein kinase A in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP or after incubation of retinas in darkness with 32Pi. In either case, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that greater than 98% of 32P was linked to serine, with less than 2% to threonine. Two-dimensional peptide mapping showed that [32P]phosphoserine was associated with the same characteristic set of tryptic peptides. Furthermore, Cleveland peptide analysis using four different proteases showed that either sample exhibited identical patterns of phosphopeptides which were characteristic of the protease used. Identical phosphopeptide maps were also obtained from 32P-labeled bovine retina phosducin, indicating that the serine phosphorylation site for protein kinase A is conserved between rat and bovine. Edman degradation of phosphopeptides derived from 32P-labeled bovine phosducin showed that radioactive phosphate was incorporated into serine residue 73 which is located within a consensus phosphorylation sequence for protein kinase A (-R-K-M-S73(P)-). These observations are uniformly in agreement with protein kinase A being the endogenous kinase that phosphorylates phosducin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1992157013,"A protein crystal structure is usually described by one single structure, which largely omits the dynamical behavior of the molecule. A molecular dynamics method with a time-averaged crystallographic restraint was used to overcome this limitation. This method yields an ensemble of structures in which all possible thermal motions are allowed, that is, in addition to isotropic distributions, anisotropic and anharmonic positional distributions occur as well. In the case of bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2, this description markedly improves agreement with the observed x-ray diffraction data compared to the results of the classical one-model structure description. Time-averaged crystallographically restrained molecular dynamics reveals large mobilities in the loops involved in lipid bilayer association."
https://openalex.org/W1494951884,"A group of five cDNA clones, representing the gadd genes, were recently isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as genes induced upon growth arrest and after DNA damage (Fornace, A. J., Jr., Nebert, D. W., Hollander, M. C., Luethy, J. D., Papathanasiou, M., Fargnoli, J., and Holbrook, N. J. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 4196-4203). We have isolated and characterized one of these genes, gadd153. The gene spans five kilobases and contains four exons. The 5'-flanking region of the gene, within 420 base pairs of the transcription initiation site, contains a number of cis elements associated with transcriptional regulation in other genes. These include a Hogness box, ATAAAA, an inverted GCCAAT box; seven SP1 transcription factor binding sites, and an AP-1 site. This region is rich in G + C content (greater than 70%) and contains an unusually long stretch of alternating CpG residues. The 800-base pair region immediately upstream of the transcription start site can drive expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, but only in its endogenous orientation, in three different cell lines: HeLa, CHO, and Jurkat. The gadd153 promoter is strongly activated by methyl methanesulfonate, hydrogen peroxide, and UV irradiation, but not by growth arrest signals. This suggests that separate and very different regulatory pathways are involved in the induction of the gadd153 gene by growth cessation and DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1508860572,"A calcium-unresponsive, phorbol ester/phospholipid-activated protein kinase was purified to apparent homogeneity from a Triton X-100 extract of an EGTA/EDTA-preextracted particulate fraction of porcine spleen by chromatography on S-Sepharose Fast Flow, phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow, protamine-agarose, and Superdex 200. The enzyme had a Mr of 76,000, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (p76-kinase). A similar value (78,000) was obtained by gel filtration. The purified p76-kinase proved to be much more stable than the enzyme in crude preparations. Storage in a buffer containing 50 mM mercaptoethanol and 20% glycerol at -20 degrees C for at least 4 months caused less than 20% loss in enzyme activity. The enzyme exhibited a pH optimum of 8.3. The affinity of the novel enzyme for substrates and cofactors differed to some extent from that of conventional alpha, beta, gamma protein kinase C (PKC). p76-kinase did not respond to calcium, had a lower requirement for magnesium, and a higher affinity for histone III-S than PKC. Both the p76-kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of histone III-S and the autophosphorylation of the enzyme could be activated by the phorbol ester TPA (or diacylglycerol) plus phosphatidyl serine, but not by calcium plus phosphatidyl serine. The stoichiometry of autophosphorylation suggested that fully phosphorylated p76-kinase contained two phosphoserine residues and one phosphothreonine residue. Like PKC, p76-kinase bound TPA with high affinity (KD = 9.6 nM). In the absence of TPA, various unsaturated fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, were more potent as activators of the enzyme than phosphatidyl serine. The p76-kinase was recognized by an antiserum raised against a delta PKC-specific peptide, but not by an alpha, beta, gamma PKC-specific antiserum. The previously described p82-kinase of mouse epidermis and spleen exhibiting the same properties as the p76-kinase did also react with the p76-kinase-specific antiserum."
https://openalex.org/W1976634101,"Fusion of the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 protein to the amino terminus of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase yields a chimera that retains the characteristics of its components. The presence of the GAL4 peptide allows the chimeric enzyme to anchor itself on the DNA template, and this anchoring in turn drives the formation of a supercoiled DNA loop, in linear or circular templates, when RNA synthesis at the polymerase site forces a translocation of the DNA relative to the site. Nonspecific interaction between the chimeric enzyme and DNA appears to be sufficient to effect supercoiling during transcription. Transcription by the chimeric polymerase is strictly dependent on the presence of a T7 promoter; thus it provides a tool in vitro and in vivo for specifically supercoiling DNA segments containing T7 promoter sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2035622337,"The deposition of cerebrovascular and plaque amyloid in the CNS is a primary feature of Alzheimer's disease and aged Down's syndrome pathology. The localization of the Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor (APP) gene on chromosome 21, along with its overexpression in Down's syndrome brain compared with normal brain, suggests that alterations in APP gene expression may play a role in the development of the neuropathology common to the two diseases. In the present report, we demonstrate that a specific spliced form of mRNA that is transcribed from the APP gene and that lacks the β/A4 sequence is elevated in the nucleus basalis, occipitotemporal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease brain relative to controls. These results are based on combined data from RNA slot blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific mRNAs taken directly from tissue sections."
https://openalex.org/W1543949372,"Acyloxyacyl hydrolase, a leukocyte enzyme previously has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of secondary (acyloxyacyl-linked) fatty acyl chains from the nonreducing glucosamine of the lipid A region of rough Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We describe here the activity of this enzyme toward smooth S. typhimurium LPS and LPS from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase released the secondary acyl chains from all of these lipopolysaccharides, regardless of the location of the acyloxyacyl linkage on the diglucosamine backbone or the structure of the acyl chains. The two acyloxyacyl linkages present in each LPS molecule apparently were hydrolyzed separately, so that free fatty acids released from the different sites accumulated at different rates. The purified enzyme also removed greater than 90% of the secondary acyl chains in each LPS, indicating that the enzyme acts not only on intact LPS but also on LPS molecules that have only one secondary acyl chain. The enzyme did not release the glucosamine-linked 3-hydroxyacyl chains. The specificity and versatility of the enzyme for cleaving acyloxyacyl linkages suggest that it may be a useful reagent for studying the structure and bioactivities of lipopolysaccharides with diverse carbohydrate and lipid A structures."

https://openalex.org/W1607976858,"Calf thymus DNA primase was examined to determine the kinetic parameters that define its unusual processivity. At 37 degrees C, the major products were 8-9 and 2-3 nucleotides long. The 2-mer was the predominant product when considered on a molar basis. At each polymerization cycle en route to synthesis of a unit length primer (7-10 nucleotides), processivity was defined by competition of enzyme dissociation with ATP binding as well as an ATP independent step(s). Reducing the temperature to 25 degrees C had relatively little effect on the production of primers less than or equal to 6 nucleotides long, but greatly enhanced production of primers twice (16-18 nucleotides) the normal unit length. Kinetic analysis revealed that synthesis of these longer primers largely involves dissociation of the primase after completion of the unit length primer. After synthesis of a primer, the primase-polymerase complex normally switches to polymerase activity. Only primers greater than or equal to 7 nucleotides long were utilized by the polymerase regardless of the dNTP concentration, indicating that the signal for the primase to polymerase activity switch is primer completion. During the switch, either the primer-template does not dissociate from the complex or the complex has extraordinarily high affinity for the primers. At 25 degrees C and physiological dNTP concentrations the activity switch is very efficient, greater than 90% of the primers are elongated. However, at 37 degrees C the switch is much less efficient, likely due to primer-template denaturation."

https://openalex.org/W1529049215,"Fast skeletal muscle troponin C (sTnC) is the calcium-binding subunit of the myofibrillar thin filament that regulates excitation-contraction coupling. Utilizing a polymerase chain reaction cloning strategy, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding murine sTnC. The 160-amino acid sTnC protein shares 70% amino acid sequence identity with the slow/cardiac isoform of troponin C (cTnC). However, three areas of significant sequence divergence were identified. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that murine sTnC is encoded by a single copy gene that is distinct from that which encodes cTnC. Northern blot analyses showed that the sTnC gene is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle (extensor digitorum and anterior tibialis) and not in neonatal or adult heart, brain, kidney, liver, lung, or testes. Studies of the murine C2C12 myoblast cell line demonstrated that sTnC gene expression is developmentally regulated during the differentiation of these myoblasts into myotubes. A full-length murine sTnC genomic clone was isolated and characterized by DNA sequence, primer extension, and S1 nuclease protection analyses. The sTnC gene is composed of six exons spanning 2.6 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA. Although the introns do not divide the gene into functional domains, the intron-exon borders are nearly identical to those of the other members of the troponin C multigene family. Transient transfection assays using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids demonstrated that the sTnC promoter alone is relatively inactive in muscle cells and that high level sTnC gene expression in these cells is controlled by a potent transcriptional enhancer element located within the first intron of the gene. In additional transfection experiments, the sTnC enhancer was shown to display three important biological activities. (i) It was required for high level transcription from the sTnC promoter in muscle cells; (ii) its activity was muscle cell specific; and (iii) its activity was developmentally regulated during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. Taken together, these data define the sTnC gene as an excellent model system for studies of developmentally regulated gene expression in skeletal muscle."

The structure of the low humidity form has been analyzed, using x-ray data collected at 88% relative humidity, in order to explore the variability in protein hydration caused by a change in the amount of water surrounding the protein molecule and the consequent conformational perturbations in the molecule. The structure has been refined by the restrained least-squares method to an R value of 0.162 for 6269 observed reflections in the 10-2.1-A resolution shell. The refined structure provides interesting examples for the variability in helical parameters, the role of interactions involving side chains and water in the stabilization of secondary structural features, and favorable specific hydration sites. The protein molecule as a whole moves slightly in the low humidity form from its position in the native crystals. The hydration shell tends to move along with the protein. Significant changes, however, occur in the hydration shell. These changes cause structural perturbations in the enzyme molecule, which are most pronounced in regions involved in substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1544860800,"Arg-47 of human beta 1 beta 1 alcohol dehydrogenase has been replaced with Lys, His, Gln, and Gly by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant enzymes with Arg and His at position 47 exhibit kinetic constants and stability which are similar to beta 1 beta 1 and beta 2 beta 2, respectively. The substitution of Lys, His, or Gln for Arg-47 resulted in active enzymes with lower affinity for coenzyme and higher Vmax values than beta 1 beta 1. The substitution of Gln at position 47 resulted in an enzyme with the highest Vmax for ethanol oxidation of any mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase. In this series of enzymes, the affinity for coenzyme decreases with decreasing pKa of the substituted amino acid side chains. The substitution of Gly at position 47 resulted in an enzyme with a Vmax that was one-half that of the low activity beta 1 beta 1 and coenzyme affinities that are lower than beta 1 beta 1, but are equal to or greater than the affinities exhibited by the His-47 or Gln-47 enzymes. Product inhibition studies indicated a change in mechanism from ordered Bi Bi for beta 1 beta 1 to rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi for the Gly-47 enzyme. The kinetic properties of the Gly-47 enzyme are substantially different from human liver alpha alpha which also has Gly at position 47."
https://openalex.org/W1944969573,"A splicing mutation in the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene of a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII has been characterized. Protein microsequencing of peptides prepared from the patient's dermal collagen identified an interstitial deletion of 18 residues. The deleted segment corresponds to the amino-terminal telopeptide junction domain encoded by the sixth exon of the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene. Sequencing of specifically primed cDNA clones confirmed the presence of two distinct populations of pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs, a normal one and another which lacks the sequences of exon 6. Limited sequencing of genomic clones showed that one of the pro-alpha 2(I) alleles displays a conservative change in the seventh codon of exon 6 (GAC for GAT), and a base substitution at position +1 of intron 6 (A for G). Since the normal transcript contains the GAT codon, the intronic change was associated with the allele that gives rise to the shortened pro-alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA. The two allelic fragments were subcloned into an expression vector and the pattern of splice-site selection for exons 5-8 was assessed for each of the constructs after transfection into COS cells. This documented skipping of exon 6 sequences only in transcripts of the minigene construct that harbors the G to A transition. Expression of allelic cross-constructs confirmed that the single-base substitution at position +1 of intron 6 is the mutation responsible for the abnormal joining of exons 5 and 7 sequences in the patient's shortened pro-alpha 2(I)mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1602413321,"Corneal buttons were obtained from patients with types 1 and 2 macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) and from control patients with Fuchs' dystrophy or keratoconus. Buttons were incubated for 20 h in the presence of [3H]glucosamine or [2-3H]mannose. Radiolabeled proteoglycans and lactosaminoglycan-glycoproteins (L-GPs) were purified using chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Superose 6, and octyl-Sepharose. They were identified using chondroitinase ABC, keratanase or endo-beta-galactosidase digestion, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or Superose 6 chromatography. This study confirms previous reports that type 1 MCD corneas synthesize a normal dermatan sulfate-proteoglycan (DS-PG) and an abnormal keratan sulfate-proteoglycan (KS-PG). The data indicate that typ 1 MCD corneas synthesize L-GP instead of KS-PG. This L-GP has a core protein of similar hydrophobicity (elution from octyl-Sepharose) and nearly similar mass (42 kDa) as the core protein of the KS-PG. It has identical glycoconjugates as those of the KS-PG except that they lack sulfate. Thus, type 1 MCD fails to synthesize keratan sulfate as a result of a defect in a sulfotransferase specific for sulfating lactosaminoglycans. Further, proteoglycans synthesized by a cornea from a patient with type 2 MCD were studied. This cornea synthesized a normal ratio of KS-PG to DS-PG although net synthesis of proteoglycans was approximately 30% below normal. The KS-PG appeared normal whereas the DS-PG had dermatan sulfate chains that were approximately 40% shorter than normal."
https://openalex.org/W1510735029,"To understand the biology and the biochemistry of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor in normal tissues we partially purified the EGF precursor from mouse kidney. The precursor was purified by affinity chromatography, using wheat germ lectin and antibodies to murine EGF. The EGF precursor is a glycosylated integral membrane protein of apparent molecular mass of 140-150 kDa. The solubilized EGF precursor is biologically active as evidenced by its ability to compete with 125I-labeled EGF for binding to the EGF receptor in intact fibroblasts and its ability to stimulate the growth of cells dependent on EGF for growth. The EGF precursor from mouse kidney can be proteolytically processed by the EGF-associated arginine esterase into a smaller fragment (97 kDa) that retains both immunologic sensitivity to EGF antiserum and biological activity. Extensive digestion of the EGF precursor with pepsin liberates a biologically and immunologically active protein of approximately the size of mature EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1933457292,"An alpha-fucosidase has been extracted from almond meal and purified 163,000-fold to apparent homogeneity using a novel affinity ligand, N-(5-carboxy-1-pentyl)-1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-L-fucitol, coupled to Affi-Gel 102. Substrate specificity studies demonstrate that the enzyme hydrolyzes the alpha-fucosidic linkages in Gal(beta 1----3)(Fuc(alpha 1----4]GlcNAc(beta 1----3)Gal(beta 1----4)Glc and Gal(beta 1----4)(Fuc(alpha 1----3]GlcNAc(beta 1----3)Gal(beta 1----4)Glc at similar rates but is unable to hydrolyze Fuc(alpha 1----2)Gal, Fuc(alpha 1----6)GlcNAc, or the synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside. Hence, the enzyme closely resembles an alpha-fucosidase I isolated previously from a commercial preparation of partially purified almond beta-glucosidase (Ogata-Arakawa, M., Muramatsu, T., and Kobata, A. (1977) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 181, 353-358). However, native and subunit relative molecular masses of 106,000 and 54,000 respectively, different charge and hydrophobicity properties, and the absence of stimulation by NaCl clearly distinguish this enzyme, designated alpha-fucosidase III, from other almond alpha-fucosidases reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W1538917359,"This paper describes studies of initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I in vitro. The protocols take advantage of the observation that active transcription complexes precipitate when incubated with S100 extracts. The pellets contain less than 5% of the protein present in unfractionated extracts and are stable to centrifugal washing. This permits rapid manipulation of the reaction conditions and facilitates kinetic studies of aspects of the initiation reaction. An initiated complex has been defined which forms rapidly at 30 degrees C and is associated with formation of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent rRNA. Once formed, initiated complexes are capable of elongation in the presence of heparin or KCl in concentrations sufficient to preclude subsequent initiation. One can therefore estimate the number of initiated complexes formed in a given reaction by measuring the number of full length transcripts recovered in a KCl or heparin-start reaction. The number of such complexes formed correlates well with the formation of a presumptive initiator trinucleotide ApCpU."
https://openalex.org/W1573159715,"Glucocorticoids inhibit transcription of rDNA in P1798 lymphoma cells. This observation can be recapitulated in vitro in that extracts from hormone-treated cells are virtually incapable of transcribing from the cloned mouse rRNA promoter. However, such extracts can be reconstituted by addition of a RNA polymerase I transcription factor, called TFIC. TFIC has been purified to homogeneity. Assays have been developed which facilitate analysis of various aspects of initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I in vitro. This paper describes a series of experiments designed to test two related hypotheses. It is proposed that TFIC is a bona fide initiation factor and that the inability of hormone-treated cells to synthesize rRNA is due to failure to form initiation complexes on rDNA. The data indicate that extracts from hormone-treated cells cannot form KCl or heparin-resistant initiated complexes upon the rRNA promoter. The ability to form such complexes is dependent upon the addition of TFIC. The lack of TFIC precludes formation of the first phosphodiester bond. At low concentrations of TFIC there is a more or less direct relationship between the amount of the factor and the number of initiated complexes formed. At higher concentrations, the system saturates and addition of TFIC beyond 80 pg/microliters (approximately 0.5 nM) has no effect upon initiation. Addition of TFIC to control extracts does not influence the formation of initiated complexes. This is consistent with the conclusion that control extracts contain excess TFIC, whereas hormone-treated extracts are depleted in this respect. The kinetics of reconstitution have been examined, and the results suggest that association of highly purified TFIC with the transcriptional apparatus is a relatively slow process, with a t1/2 of about 2 min. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that TFIC is an initiation factor and suggest that the active form of RNA polymerase I is associated with TFIC. It is proposed that in the absence of this association, initiation of transcription of rDNA does not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1599259441,"Nuclear proteins contain a signal, termed the nuclear transport signal, that specifies their selective transport into the nucleus. Previously we reported that antibodies to Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Asp (DDDED) inhibited nuclear transport of nuclear proteins in vivo. We therefore tried to detect a cellular receptor of nuclear transport signals as a protein that reacted with both anti-DDDED antibody and nuclear transport signal sequences. Using two steps of affinity chromatography, anti-DDDED-Sepharose and nucleoplasmin-Sepharose, we obtained a protein of 69 kDa (p69) from the nuclear pore fraction that showed these characters. This p69 recognized by anti-DDDED antibody interacted specifically with SV40 large T antigen and nucleoplasmin transport signals."
https://openalex.org/W1977809086,"We examined nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the avian brain using a combination of autoradiographic and intracellular electrophysiological techniques. We found that the lateral spiriform nucleus (SPL) in the mesencephalon has a very high density of 3H-nicotine binding sites but no detectable 125I-K-bungarotoxin (125I-K-BuTx) or 125I-α-bungarotoxin (125I-α-BuTx) binding sites. Intracellular recordings in brain slices revealed that SPL neurons depolarize in response to nicotine and carbachol (in the presence of atropine). These depolarizations were blocked by the classic nicotinic antagonists d-tubocurarine and dihydro-β-erythroidine. As predicted for nicotinic receptors with a high affinity for nicotine, neither K-BuTx nor a-BuTx blocked these nicotinic responses. Thus, although the existence of high-affinity 3H-nicotine binding sites has been known for some time, we now report the in situ detection of a functional nicotinic receptor that has a high affinity for nicotine and is K-BuTx-insensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1645252065,"Myosin light chain kinase is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase which exhibits a very high degree of protein substrate specificity. The regulatory light chain of myosin is the only known physiological substrate of the enzyme. Based upon epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies which inhibit kinase activity competitively with respect to the light chain substrate, residues 235-319 of the rabbit skeletal muscle kinase have been proposed to contain a light chain-binding site (Herring, B. P., Stull, J. T., and Gallagher, P. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1724-1730). With the expression of a truncated kinase, we have further localized this putative binding site to residues 235-294. Mutation of acidic residues at positions 269 and 270 of the kinase resulted in a 10-fold increase in the Km value for the myosin light chain, with no significant change in the Vmax value. In contrast, altering a cluster of acidic amino acids at positions 261-263 had little effect on the Km value for the myosin light chain. These results suggest that residues 269 and 270 may be involved in protein-substrate binding. Interestingly, these residues, located amino-terminal of the homologous catalytic core (positions 302-539), are in a region which is highly conserved among myosin light chain kinases, but not other protein kinases. It is probable that the homologous catalytic core contains structural elements required for phosphotransferase activity. The catalytic domain of myosin light chain kinase would therefore include these conserved elements together with additional specific substrate-binding residues."
https://openalex.org/W1527870019,"Octadeoxynucleotides based on the recognition sequence of the restriction endonuclease NotI were synthesized containing unmodified nucleotides and nucleotides with methyl and bromide additions at the C5 position of the pyrimidine ring of deoxycytosine. On annealing to single-stranded DNA bearing one NotI site, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of the different oligonucleotides was used quantitatively to determine differences in dissociation temperature (Td) and binding equilibrium. Buffers used in filter hybridization experiments could be used in this TLC system. In addition, actual hybridizations were carried out to filter-bound DNA with and without a NotI site. The incorporation of 5-methyldeoxycytosine and 5-bromodeoxycytosine led to a significant increase in stability of homoduplex formation during hybridization, due to a shift in the binding equilibrium and an increase of the Td, thereby improving discrimination considerably. Some implications of the results for several techniques involving oligomer hybridization are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1532445417,Two polyclonal antibodies were raised to synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids Ser21-Tyr35 and Lys247-Phe261 of cytochrome b561. These antibodies were used to test the native orientation of the amino and carboxyl termini of this transmembrane electron transport protein. Carboxyl-terminal epitopes were lost when intact chromaffin granules were treated with Pronase. This result indicates that the carboxyl terminus is cytoplasmically exposed and confirms a theoretical prediction obtained from hydropathy plots. Epitopes that were recognized by an amino-terminal antipeptide antibody were not removed under the same conditions. This finding implied that the amino terminus was not proteolytically accessible on the exterior of the granule. The abundance of threonine and serine residues in the amino-terminal region suggested that the amino terminus could be held in the membrane by covalent fatty acylation. Treatment of purified delipidated cytochrome b561 with hydroxylamine resulted in the release of a fatty acid hydroxamate. Sulfhydryl analysis of purified cytochrome b561 showed that all 3 cysteine residues were in the free sulfhydryl form. These observations indicate that cytochrome b561 is covalently fatty acylated and that the lipid is bound through ester linkages of serine or threonine residues.
https://openalex.org/W1510075175,"The assembly of mitochondrially and cytoplasmically translated subunits of NADH dehydrogenase in the inner mitochondrial membrane was studied in rat hepatoma cultures. A polyclonal antibody to the purified bovine heart holoenzyme, which reacted with comigrating proteins of both rat liver and hepatoma mitochondria on immunoblots, precipitated 25-30 [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from hepatoma cell lysates. Six of these were sensitive to an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation (chloramphenicol), resistant to an inhibitor of cytosolic translation (cycloheximide), and were not present in cytochrome oxidase. By these criteria, six NADH dehydrogenase subunits are identified as being translated on mitochondrial ribosomes. The metabolic properties of the three most prominent of these at 51, 43, and 11 kDa were studied in more detail. Mitochondrial and nuclear-coded polypeptides assemble into NADH dehydrogenase at different rates as measured by incorporation of pulse-labeled proteins into immunoprecipitable enzyme. Nuclear-coded, imported polypeptides appear immediately after a pulse with [35S]methionine and retain constant stoichiometry. Mitochondrially coded proteins, although rapidly translated, appear at peak levels at different times between 0 and 12 h of chase in the immunoprecipitated enzyme. Ongoing synthesis and import of nuclear-coded proteins is necessary for mitochondrially coded proteins to be assembled. Excess, unassembled mitochondrially translated subunits are degraded in an oligomycin-sensitive manner. These data are consistent with a model in which a scaffold of imported proteins forms the inner core of the enzyme, and later arriving mitochondrially translated proteins attach to the scaffold in a time-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W1489344230,"The therapeutic and cytotoxic effects exerted by DNA-binding drugs used for chemotherapy originate from a rather large variety of modifications sustained by the nucleic acids upon interaction with the chemical agents. Notably, these modifications are generally considered as involving the following localized chemical or structural processes: base alkylations, frameshift mutations or strand breakages at specific sites, interstrand cross-links, and local structural transitions within the secondary configurations. We find that antitumor agents hinder or prevent altogether the long range packaging of DNA molecules into compact, ordered states. This effect, observed even at low drug to base pair ratios, is general: it is induced by DNA groove binders as well as by intercalators. Nucleoprotein complexes are found to be efficiently protected against the decondensing effect of the drugs. These observations point toward a generic mechanism for the effectiveness of DNA-binding drugs against tumor cells and viruses as well as for the severe effects of chemotherapy on male fertility: actively dividing systems, such as tumor cells, are characterized by regions of chromatin which are decondensed for the purpose of replication and transcription, and therefore accessible to the drugs. Similarly, both viral infection and spermatogenesis, where histones are replaced by protamines, involve transient formation of relatively uncondensed DNA species and subsequent packaging into extremely tight structures."
https://openalex.org/W1584522697,"A monoclonal antibody against 4-aminobenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.27) from Agaricus bisporus, a common edible mushroom, has been produced by the fusion of BALB/c mouse spleen cells immunized with the denatured enzyme and P3x63Ag8U1 myeloma cells in order to locate and characterize the catalytic site of the enzyme. The monoclonal antibody immunoblotted the enzyme and immunoprecipitated its apoenzyme. The immunoprecipitation was inhibited in the presence of FAD, and the monoclonal antibody competitively inhibited the binding of FAD to the apoenzyme. The monoclonal antibody, therefore, recognizes the FAD-binding site of 4-aminobenzoate hydroxylase. Interestingly, it was shown that the monoclonal antibody was cross-reactive with FAD-dependent enzymes such as salicylate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.1) and D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3), and that it was specific for the FAD-binding sites of these enzymes. This fact suggests that these FAD-dependent enzymes have immunologically similar structures on their FAD-binding sites."
