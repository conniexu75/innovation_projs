https://openalex.org/W1967912997,"Two autoantibiotics produced by the fungus Candida albicans have been identified, with the aid of mass spectrometry, as 2-phenylethanol and 3-β-hydroxyethylindole. The cyclodipeptides, cyclo(proline-leucine) and cyclo(proline-phenylalanine) were also isolated from cultures of Candida albicans, but did not inhibit the growth of the fungus."
https://openalex.org/W2059952211,"In thin bundles of dog ventricular myocardium, a slow inward current (distinct from the sodium inward current) could be recorded under voltage-clamp conditions. This inward current was influenced by changes in external calcium concentration, but it was not dependent on external sodium concentration. Therefore, this current which contributes an appreciable amount of charge transfer during the plateau of the action potential, is carried by calcium ions. In sodium-free solution, the flow of calcium ions into the fiber is directly related to activation of contraction. In sodium-containing solution, however, calcium inward current serves primarily to fill up some intracellular stores from which calcium can be released by moderate depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2091577191,"Rats with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle stimulated their own brains at sharply reduced rates after systemic administration of disulfiram or intraventricular administration of diethyldithiocarbamate. Both drugs inhibit dopamine-β-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine. The suppressed behavior was reinstated by intraventricular injections of l-norepinephrine, but not by injection of its biologically inactive isomer, d-norepinephrine. Intraventricular administration of dopamine and serotonin did not restore self-stimulation. The rewarding effect of medial forebrain bundle stimulation may depend on the availability of norepinephrine as a transmitter, but not on dopamine or serotonin."

https://openalex.org/W2022523662,"Action spectra were determined for lightinduced phase shifts of the circadian rhythm of adult emergence in Drosophila pseudoobscura. The action spectra for advance and delay phase shifts are similar; the most effective wavelengths are in the blue region, with a sharp cutoff above 500 nanometers. This similarity suggests that the same photoreceptive pigment mediates both advance and delay phase shifts."
https://openalex.org/W2077885742,"A fast transport system of materials is shown in cat sensory fibers of sciatic nerve. After injection of tritiated leucine into the lumbar seventh ganglia, the distribution of activity was measured in the sciatic nerves from 2 to 8 hours afterward. The distribution showed a crest of activity advancing down the fibers at a rate of approximately 410 millimeters per day. An intraaxonic locus of the activity was indicated by a block of the downflow induced by local freezing which causes the fibers to close off. Some of the activity in the nerve was due to free tritiated leucine, with most of it incorporated into polypeptide, soluble protein, and subcellular particulates."
https://openalex.org/W2045639123,"Natural mammalian hibernation was continuously maintained under laboratory conditions throughout spring and summer seasons in a colony of thirteen-lined ground squirrels by serial transfusional passage of blood from hibernations animals to active animals. This procedure successfully produced hibernation in animals until late summer, at which time naturally occurring (spontaneous) hibernations occurred in the colony, thus terminating the experiment."
https://openalex.org/W1983912179,"Somatic cell hybrids have been made between an established human cell line with a long culture history and established mouse fibroblast line. When first analyzed, the hybrid cells contained nearly twice as many mouse chromosomes as the mouse parent line and a human chromosome complemnent of about half that of the human parent. There was further loss of human chromosomes on continued cultivation. This behavior resembles that of other human mouse hybrids and appears to be characteristic of the human-mouse combination. However, the number of human chromosomes is greater than in hybrids made from human diploid fibroblasts. Some clones contain more than a haptoid quantity of human DNA per cell and should synthesize a much greater number of human gene products."
https://openalex.org/W2083672158,"As judged from the midpoints of the denaturation transition of 31 water-miscible alcohols, ureas, and amides, the effectiveness of these denaturing agents on sperm-whale myoglobin increases with increasing chain length and hydrocarbon content, as expected in view of the disorganization of the hydrophobic interior of this protein. Increase in the hydroxyl content, blocking of the functional amino groups of the ureas and amides by alkyl substitution, and branching of the hydrocarbon portion of the denaturants are of less importance in determining the effectiveness of the denaturants."
https://openalex.org/W2038227313,A toxin from the Bermuda anemone Condylactis gigantea causes the early transient conductance change of crayfish giant axon membranes to persist without affecting the shape of its turning-on. The increase in late steadystate conductance is either not affected or slightly suppressed. The effect on the conductance components can adequately account for the prolonged action potential observed in the treated axon.
https://openalex.org/W2036143476,"Radiant energy reduces oxygen consumption in birds; this reduction is correlated with feather color, being greater in dark birds (26 percent reduction) than in white ones (6 percent reduction). With radiant energy (basking), the cowbird effectively increased its insulation, thus shifting the lower end of the zone of thermal neutrality down by as much as 10°C (35° to 25°C)."
https://openalex.org/W2002617002,"Structural studies on a very lysine-rich histone show that the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule is enriched in lysine (and proline). which suggests that it is a site for binding to DNA. The amino-terminal half. containing most of the acidic residues. resembles small, nonhistone proteins and so might have specificity for factors other than DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1985982300,"Pieces of chicken heart or skeletal muscle were placed in a dilute solution of the antimicrobial agent 2-phenoxyethanol and stored at room temperature. Under these conditions, the serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase in these tissues survived in easily detectable amounts for at least 2 weeks. The surviving proteins appeared to be identical with those of fresh tissues in physical, catalytic, and immunological properties. Phenoxyethanol also preserved heart and muscle proteins of representatives of other vertebrate classes. Tissue samples collected in the field may be thus preserved for later analysis by biochemical taxonomists."
https://openalex.org/W2017066277,Nerves from spider crabs anid squid fluoresce when staiined with Acridine Orange. The intenisity of fluorescence increases during nerse conduction. Prolongation of the electric response in the squid axon is associated with a fluorescence change of similar duration. These findings suggest that the physicochemical properties of the macromolecules around the dye molecules in the nerve membrane drastically change during the process of nerve conduction.
https://openalex.org/W2039717723,"Sarcomere movements during isometric tetanic contractions were resolved to 50 angstroms by diffraction techniques. After a latent period that followed the first stimulus, all sarcomeres shortened simultaneously and uniformly. Oscillations in length and tension in synchrony with the stimuli occurred during an incomplete tetanus. However, no oscillations in length were detected during the plateau of a tetanus."

This sculptured, outer wall layver appears to be uniique to the terrestrial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2008942386,"The molting hormone, alpha-ecdysone, and an analog triangle up(7)-5beta-cholestene-2beta,3beta, 14alpha-triol-6-one when applied externally, terminates diapause in larvae of the winter tick, Dermacentor albpictus. This is the first reported hormonal termination of diapause in an arthropod other than an insect."

https://openalex.org/W2068587690,"An appropriately modified cell spectrophotometer was used successfully for performing automatic counts of live and dead cells in the cytotoxic test, with trypan blue staining as an indicator of dead cells and light scattering to identify viable cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084829005,"A positive reinforcement with food produced high-voltage bursts of alpha activity over the posterior marginal gyrus in a cat deprived of food and water. This synchronization was always associated with a large (180 to 300 microvolt), positive steady potential shift comparable to that occurring during the onset of sleep. Since this shift was contingent upon the relative appropriateness and desirability of food reward, it was termed reward contingent positive variation."
https://openalex.org/W2003426740,"Unilateral spreading cortical depression was elicited by applying potassium chloride solutions to the dura of conscious, freely moving rats. Incorporation of (3)H-leucine into soluble cortical proteins was decreased in the depressed hemisphere relative to the control side, while soluble brainstem proteins from both sides had the same specific activity. Various subfractions of soluble cortical proteins were affected to equal degrees."
https://openalex.org/W2042310674,"A mixture of the cis and trans forms of propylure (10-propyl-trans-5,9-tridecadienyl acetate), the sex pheromone of the female pink bollworm moth, has been separated into its pure isomers by thin-layer chromatography. The cis isomer inhibits or masks the activity of the trans isomer, as little as 15 percent of the cis isomer being sufficient to completely nullify the activity of the trans isomer."
https://openalex.org/W1970895738,A pheromone found in the males of some species of Hypsoblennius apparently facilitates male courtship by releasing sexual appetitive behavior and by increasing sexual receptivity.
https://openalex.org/W2025676618,"A physical model of nerve excitation and conduction is proposed based on the discovery of three new axon membrane properties: the negative fixed surface charge, the birefringence change, and the infrared emission."
https://openalex.org/W2087169492,"Nerve fibers from pit organs and canal neuromasts are distinguished by the nature of their electrophysiological response to mechanical and chemical stimulation. Pit organs respond to touch but have a relatively high threshold compared with canal neuromasts. They respond readily to sodium and potassium chloride solutions, the rate of discharge increasing with the concentration of the solution. Order of effectiveness with 1 molar solutions of monovalent cations is as follows: potassium, rubidium > sodium, ammonium > cesium, lithium. Anions are ineffective. Divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium are inhibitory. Responses to acid, sugar, and quinine are either very slight or inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W1963990447,"Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) Schroet., the obligate pathlogen causing downy mildew (green-ear) of pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides Stapf. and Hubb.) has been successfully cultured for the first time on a known semisynthetic mediumn with no evident loss of fructifications. Sclerospora graminicola was first grown on host callus tissue and subsequently on a modification of White's basal medium that contained casein hydrolyzate (Oxoid). 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and kinetin."
https://openalex.org/W1984472122,Six examples of a variation in the LDH-A subunit have been detected in 408 samples from three exogamous clans in the New Guinea Highlands. The New Guinea variant is similar to the Memphis-4 variant. Origin of the New Guinea variant could not be traced by genealogy but it seems likely to have persisted for several generations.
https://openalex.org/W1981345358,In the pars intermedia of frogs in the dark two types of spontaneously firing neuronal units have been found; one can be inhibited by and the other is indifferent to increases in illumination. The receptor for the light-inhibited units appears to be the pineal organ. Transection experiments indicate that the axons to the two kinds of units in the pars intermedia are separately grouped in the floor.
https://openalex.org/W1989049058,"Newly hatched ducklinigs were exposed to a moving, imprinted stiulullls; if they followed it, the stimnulus was withdrawn briefly. The tendency to follow gradually declined durinig punishment periods, but it returned to prepunishment amounts whlen punishmnent terminated. This finding attests to the efficacy of withdrawal of reinforcement as a techniquie for behavioral control."
https://openalex.org/W1975637307,The ultimate goal of the population and family planning program of the Agency for International Development (AID) is to improve the health well-being and economic status of the populations of developing countries by improving the conditions of human reproduction in these societies. To achieve this goal the intention is to support a broad range of family planning programs designed to make family planning information and services fully available to women everywhere. The primary element initially in any population planning and control programs must be the extension of family planning information and means to all elements of the population. When women throughout the world need reproduce only if and when they choose many intense family and social problems generated by unplanned and unwanted children will be greatly ameliorated.
https://openalex.org/W1993531014,"Membrane currents were measured in thin bundles of dog ventricular myocardium under voltage-clamp conditions. A rather large initial inward current which had an equilibrium potential at about + 55 millivolts could be recorded. When the external sodium concentration was reduced, the equilibrium potential for this current was shifted by the amount predicted theoretically for a current carried solely by sodium ions. The size of the sodium inward current (INa) was largely dependent on the preceding membrane potential. The INa was completely inactivated if the membrane potential was as low as -45 millivolts. Sodium ions are the main carrier of charge during the rapid depolarization phase of the action potential."
https://openalex.org/W2061785721,"The activity of deoxycytidine aminohydrolase in the liver of various species including man was investigated. An enormously high activity was found in human liver. This fact explains the extraordinarily low level of deoxycytidine in human urine in comparison with that of other tested species. The suitability of deoxycitidinuria as a biochemical indicator of postirradiation damage in man remains, therefore, an open question."
https://openalex.org/W2007515207,"Isolated brown adipose cell devoid of a basement membrane, readily synthesized a variety of lipids from radioctive acetate, a reactionaugmented by glucose and insulin. A large proportion of the newly formed fatty acids passed into the incubation medium. In intact brown adipose slices and isolated white adipose cells, most of the synthesized lipid was retained as glyceride esters. The date suggest that the rapid turnover of endogenously synthesized lipid in brown adipose cells is almost totally obscured in studies with intact tissue slices because of interstitial barriers to the egress of fatty acid."

https://openalex.org/W1990008331,"Blood from the cockroach Periplaneta americana usually does not react with a suspension of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. When lysozyme is added to the mixture it causes an immediate reduction in the optical density at 450 nanometers which is soon followed by a strong rise. Blood from roaches injected with lysozyme causes a similar series of changes in the optical density of a suspension of M. lysodeikticus, an indication that lysozyme has been retained in the blood. It may persist for many days or weeks."

https://openalex.org/W2007165429,Both nurse and lemon sharks recovered slowly from the pressor effect of epinephrine and from the depressor effect of isoproterenol. The recovery time increased with the dose of epinephrine. Grading of dosage and the use of dibenzyline revealed that these species exhibit alpha and beta adrenergic vascular responses in a manner qualitatively similar but quantitatively dissimilar to that for mammals.
https://openalex.org/W2048375473,Certinen from 432 Choctaw Indians from Mississippi was classified as sticky or dry. The frequency of the autosomal recessive dry type was intermediate between that for Indians of western North America and that for Mayan groups of southern Mexico.
