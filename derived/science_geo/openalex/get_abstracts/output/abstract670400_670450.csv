https://openalex.org/W3131995220,"The race to produce vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis for vaccines currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK, B.1.1.7; South Africa, B.1.351; and Brazil, P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein that facilitates viral cell entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor-binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K, although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases, it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant."

https://openalex.org/W3138463162,"The red macroalgae (seaweed) Asparagopsis spp. has shown to reduce ruminant enteric methane (CH4) production up to 99% in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Asparagopsis taxiformis on CH4 production (g/day per animal), yield (g CH4/kg dry matter intake (DMI)), and intensity (g CH4/kg ADG); average daily gain (ADG; kg gain/day), feed conversion efficiency (FCE; kg ADG/kg DMI), and carcass and meat quality in growing beef steers. Twenty-one Angus-Hereford beef steers were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: 0% (Control), 0.25% (Low), and 0.5% (High) A. taxiformis inclusion based on organic matter intake. Steers were fed 3 diets: high, medium, and low forage total mixed ration (TMR) representing life-stage diets of growing beef steers. The Low and High treatments over 147 days reduced enteric CH4 yield 45 and 68%, respectively. However, there was an interaction between TMR type and the magnitude of CH4 yield reduction. Supplementing low forage TMR reduced CH4 yield 69.8% (P <0.01) for Low and 80% (P <0.01) for High treatments. Hydrogen (H2) yield (g H2/DMI) increased (P <0.01) 336 and 590% compared to Control for the Low and High treatments, respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO2) yield (g CO2/DMI) increased 13.7% between Control and High treatments (P = 0.03). No differences were found in ADG, carcass quality, strip loin proximate analysis and shear force, or consumer taste preferences. DMI tended to decrease 8% (P = 0.08) in the Low treatment and DMI decreased 14% (P <0.01) in the High treatment. Conversely, FCE tended to increase 7% in Low (P = 0.06) and increased 14% in High (P <0.01) treatment compared to Control. The persistent reduction of CH4 by A. taxiformis supplementation suggests that this is a viable feed additive to significantly decrease the carbon footprint of ruminant livestock and potentially increase production efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3138361816,"Embryo morphogenesis is impacted by dynamic changes in tissue material properties, which have been proposed to occur via processes akin to phase transitions (PTs). Here, we show that rigidity percolation provides a simple and robust theoretical framework to predict material/structural PTs of embryonic tissues from local cell connectivity. By using percolation theory, combined with directly monitoring dynamic changes in tissue rheology and cell contact mechanics, we demonstrate that the zebrafish blastoderm undergoes a genuine rigidity PT, brought about by a small reduction in adhesion-dependent cell connectivity below a critical value. We quantitatively predict and experimentally verify hallmarks of PTs, including power-law exponents and associated discontinuities of macroscopic observables. Finally, we show that this uniform PT depends on blastoderm cells undergoing meta-synchronous divisions causing random and, consequently, uniform changes in cell connectivity. Collectively, our theoretical and experimental findings reveal the structural basis of material PTs in an organismal context."
https://openalex.org/W3136681803,"Background Superinfections, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), are well-known complications of critically ill patients with severe viral pneumonia. Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from nondirected bronchial lavage (NBL). We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. Findings CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort. In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p&lt;0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p = 0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p = 0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA. Interpretation CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 is independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A standardized screening and diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify affected patients at an early stage."

Disruption of lacrimal fluid production, composition, or release results in dry eye, causing discomfort and damage to the ocular surface. Here, we describe the establishment of long-term 3D organoid culture conditions for mouse and human lacrimal gland. Organoids can be expanded over multiple months and recapitulate morphological and transcriptional features of lacrimal ducts. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing reveals the master regulator for eye development <i>Pax6</i> to be required for differentiation of adult lacrimal gland cells. We address cellular heterogeneity of the lacrimal gland by providing a single-cell atlas of human lacrimal gland tissue and organoids. Finally, human lacrimal gland organoids phenocopy the process of tear secretion in response to neurotransmitters and can engraft and produce mature tear products upon orthotopic transplantation in mouse. Together, this study provides an experimental platform to study the (patho-)physiology of the lacrimal gland."
https://openalex.org/W3137138898,"Background There has been a rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in Latin America, Africa, Asia and many countries that have an insufficient number of physicians and other health care personnel, and the need for the inclusion of medical students on health teams is a very important issue. It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, undergo appropriate training, not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, and receive continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, the motivation of medical students must be evaluated to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate the motivation of medical students to be part of health teams to aid in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and findings We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students’ perceptions about participating in the care of patients with suspected infection with coronavirus during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) one part with questions on individual characteristics, year in medical school and geographic location of the medical school and b) a second part with twenty-eight statements assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings with a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyze the data. Statements associated with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in the COVID-19 pandemic were related to a sense of purpose or duty (“It is the duty of the medical student to put himself or herself at the service of the population in the pandemic”), altruism (“I am willing to take risks by participating in practice in the context of the pandemic”), and perception of good performance and professional identity (“I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic”). Males were more prone than females to believe that only interns should participate in the care of patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.36 [coefficient interval 95%:1.24–1.49]) and that all students should participate (OR 1.68 [CI:1.4–1.91]). Conclusions Medical students are more motivated by a sense of purpose or duty, altruism, perception of good performance and values of professionalism than by their interest in learning. These results have implications for the development of volunteering programs and the design of health force policies in the present pandemic and in future health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W3137679663,"Personality traits have been found to be related to a variety of health outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine how personality traits were associated with adjustment to the COVID pandemic in college students. The sample included 484 first-year university students (76% female) attending a northeastern university who completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality assessment at the beginning of a semester that was disrupted by the COVID pandemic. Using a phone-based app, students completed daily ratings of mood, perceived stress levels, and engagement in a number of health promotion activities (exercise, mindfulness, adequate sleep, etc.) throughout the semester both before and after the onset of the pandemic (e.g., a within-person longitudinal design). Results, as expected, showed that mood and wellness indices generally declined during the COVID period, although stress levels actually decreased. Further, irrespective of COVID, improved mood, less perceived stress and greater participation in health promotion activities were significantly associated with a number of personality traits including neuroticism (lower), extraversion (higher), agreeableness (higher), and conscientiousness (higher). Of primary interest, mixed-effects models were used to test how major personality traits interacted with any changes in daily ratings from the pre-COVID to COVID period. Significant interactions terms were found suggesting differential impacts of the COVID epidemic for students with low versus high levels of particular traits. Higher levels of extraversion, for example, were found to be related to decreases in mood as the pandemic progressed in contrast to those with lower extraversion, for whom there was a slight increase in mood over time. These data support the conclusion that personality traits are related to mental health and can play a role in a person's ability to cope with major stressful events. Different traits may also be more adaptive to different types of stressors."
https://openalex.org/W3139446002,"Currently, the impact of changes in precipitation and increased nitrogen(N) deposition on ecosystems has become a global problem. In this study, we conducted a 8-year field experiment to evaluate the effects of interaction between N deposition and precipitation change on soil bacterial communities in a desert steppe using high-throughput sequencing technology. The results revealed that soil bacterial communities were sensitive to precipitation addition but were highly tolerant to precipitation reduction. Reduced precipitation enhanced the competitive interactions of soil bacteria and made the ecological network more stable. Nitrogen addition weakened the effect of water addition in terms of soil bacterial diversity and community stability, and did not have an interactive influence. Moreover, decreased precipitation and increased N deposition did not have a superimposed effect on soil bacterial communities in the desert steppe. Soil pH, moisture content, and NH4+-N and total carbon were significantly related to the structure of bacterial communities in the desert steppe. Based on network analysis and relative abundance, we identified Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria members as the most important keystone bacteria that responded to precipitation changes and N deposition in the soil of the desert steppe. In summary, we comprehensively analyzed the responses of the soil bacterial community to precipitation changes and N deposition in a desert steppe, which provides a model for studying the effects of ecological factors on bacterial communities worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3138885839,"The spread of COVID-19 and resulting local and national lockdowns have a host of potential consequences for demographic trends. While impacts on mortality and, to some extent, short-term migration flows are beginning to be documented, it is too early to measure actual consequences for family demography. To gain insight into potential future consequences of the lockdown for family demography, we use cross-national Google Trends search data to explore whether trends in searches for words related to fertility, relationship formation, and relationship dissolution changed following lockdowns compared to average, pre-lockdown levels in Europe and the United States. Because lockdowns were not widely anticipated or simultaneous in timing or intensity, we exploit variability over time and between countries (and U.S. states). We use a panel event-study design and difference-in-differences methods, and account for seasonal trends and average country-level (or state-level) differences in searches. We find statistically significant impacts of lockdown timing on changes in searches for terms such as wedding and those related to condom use, emergency contraception, pregnancy tests, and abortion, but little evidence of changes in searches related to fertility. Impacts for union formation and dissolution tended to only be statistically significant at the start of a lockdown with a return to average-levels about 2 to 3 months after lockdown initiation, particularly in Europe. Compared to Europe, returns to average search levels were less evident for the U.S., even 2 to 3 months after lockdowns were introduced. This may be due to the fact, in the U.S., health and social policy responses were less demarcated than in Europe, such that economic uncertainty was likely of larger magnitude. Such pandemic-related economic uncertainty may therefore have the potential to slightly increase already existing polarization in family formation behaviours in the U.S. Alongside contributing to the wider literature on economic uncertainty and family behaviors, this paper also proposes strategies for efficient use of Google Trends data, such as making relative comparisons and testing sensitivity to outliers, and provides a template and cautions for their use in demographic research when actual demographic trends data are not yet available."
https://openalex.org/W3138463256,"Annually, agricultural activity produces an enormous amount of plant biomass by-product. Many studies have reported the biomethane potential of agro-industrial wastes, but only a few studies have investigated applying the substrates in both batch and continuous mode. Tomato is one of the most popular vegetables globally; its processing releases a substantial amount of by-product, such as stems and leaves. This study examined the BMP of tomato plant ( Solanum lycopersicum Mill. L. cv. Alfred) waste. A comparative test revealed that the BMPs of corn stover, tomato waste,and their combination were approximately the same, around 280 mL methane/g Volatile Solid. In contrast, the relative biogas production decreased in the presence of tomato waste in a continuous mesophilic anaerobic digestion system; the daily biogas productions were 860 ± 80, 290 ± 50, and 570 ± 70 mL biogas/gVolatile Solid/day in the case of corn stover, tomato waste, and their mixture, respectively. The methane content of biogas was around 46–48%. The fermentation parameters of the continuous AD experiments were optimal in all cases; thus, TW might have an inhibitory effect on the microbial community. Tomato plant materials contain e.g. flavonoids, glycoalkaloids (such as tomatine and tomatidine), etc. known as antimicrobial and antifungal agents. The negative effect of tomatine on the biogas yield was confirmed in batch fermentation experiments. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the tomato plant waste caused significant rearrangements in the microbial communities in the continuously operated reactors. The results demonstrated that tomato waste could be a good mono-substrate in batch fermentations or a co-substrate with corn stover in a proper ratio in continuous anaerobic fermentations for biogas production. These results also point to the importance of running long-term continuous fermentations to test the suitability of a novel biomass substrate for industrial biogas production."
https://openalex.org/W3139165825,"More than one type of probability must be considered when making decisions. It is as necessary to know one's chance of performing choices correctly as it is to know the chances that desired outcomes will follow choices. We refer to these two choice contingencies as internal and external probability. Neural activity across many frontal and parietal areas reflected internal and external probabilities in a similar manner during decision-making. However, neural recording and manipulation approaches suggest that one area, the anterior lateral prefrontal cortex (alPFC), is highly specialized for making prospective, metacognitive judgments on the basis of internal probability; it is essential for knowing which decisions to tackle, given its assessment of how well they will be performed. Its activity predicted prospective metacognitive judgments, and individual variation in activity predicted individual variation in metacognitive judgments. Its disruption altered metacognitive judgments, leading participants to tackle perceptual decisions they were likely to fail."
https://openalex.org/W3138005625,"Background Individuals with ADHD are at increased risk for poor occupational outcomes. Educational attainment and psychiatric comorbidity may be important contributing factors for these outcomes, but the role of these factors is not well characterized. This study aimed to investigate the associations between ADHD and occupational outcomes, and to examine the influence of educational attainment, comorbid developmental disorders and intellectual disability on these associations. Methods We linked the Swedish population graduating from compulsory school 1998–2008 (N = 1.2 millions) to population-wide register-based data on clinical psychiatric diagnoses and medications, objective annual measures of educational, and occupational outcomes. Individuals were followed for between 6 to 16 years after graduation. Results Individuals with ADHD had annually on average 17 percent lower income, ratio = 0.83 (95% CI 0.83–0.84), 12.19 (11.89–12.49) more days of unemployment, and a higher likelihood of receiving disability pension, odds-ratio = 19.0 (18.4–19.6), compared to controls. Comorbid diagnoses of intellectual disability and developmental disorder explained most of the association between ADHD and disability pension, while lifetime educational attainment partially explained associations between ADHD and all occupational outcomes. Analyses of occupational trajectories found that income was lower and unemployment elevated relative to controls with the same educational attainment. Higher educational attainment correlated with higher income similarly among individuals with ADHD and controls after accounting for individual background factors. Conclusions The occupational burden associated with ADHD is substantial. Comorbid developmental disorders, intellectual disability and educational difficulties (e.g., failing grades) from childhood to adulthood are important factors to consider when designing interventions to improve occupational outcomes in individuals with ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W3138068584,"The combined behaviours of individuals within insect societies determine the survival and development of the colony. For the western honey bee ( Apis mellifera ), individual behaviours include nest building, foraging, storing and ripening food, nursing the brood, temperature regulation, hygiene and defence. However, the various behaviours inside the colony, especially within the cells, are hidden from sight, and until recently, were primarily described through texts and line drawings, which lack the dynamics of moving images. In this study, we provide a comprehensive source of online video material that offers a view of honey bee behaviour within comb cells, thereby providing a new mode of observation for the scientific community and the general public. We analysed long-term video recordings from longitudinally truncated cells, which allowed us to see sideways into the cells in the middle of a colony. Our qualitative study provides insight into worker behaviours, including the use of wax scales and existing nest material to remodel combs, storing pollen and nectar in cells, brood care and thermoregulation, and hygienic practices, such as cannibalism, grooming and surface cleaning. We reveal unique processes that have not been previously published, such as the rare mouth-to-mouth feeding by nurses to larvae as well as thermoregulation within cells containing the developing brood. With our unique video method, we are able to bring the processes of a fully functioning social insect colony into classrooms and homes, facilitating ecological awareness in modern times. We provide new details and images that will help scientists test their hypotheses on social behaviours. In addition, we encourage the non-commercial use of our material to educate beekeepers, the media and the public and, in turn, call attention to the general decline of insect biomass and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3136334513,"This research investigated volatile profiles of over-ripe Thai mango purée during thermal processing by solid-phase extraction, volatile quantification by XAD-2-solvent extraction, as well as descriptive sensory analysis. Overripe fruits of three varieties were analyzed for the ripening stage using specific gravity as well as firmness and the physiochemical properties were also reported. We found that aromatic profiles could be used as true representative to describe Thai mango identities of each varieties. A simple and straightforward heat treatment had differing effects on aroma characteristics and those effects were dependent with mango varieties. Indeed, the amount of terpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids alternated after heat treatment. All descriptive attributes of heated ‘sam-pee’ purée were intensified while, heat treatment significantly improved only “mango identity” in ‘maha-chanok’ and “fermented” odour in ‘keaw’ purée. With or without heat treatment, the volatile profiles of ‘maha-chanok’ remained quite stable while heating played a significant role on chemical ingredients of ‘keaw’ and ‘sam-pee’. Our study demonstrated that the manufacturing of the over-ripe mango into the products of high market value, selection of varieties is vitally important based upon their specific aroma characteristics before and after processing."
https://openalex.org/W3138934174,"Latinos in the US live significantly longer than non-Latino whites, but spend more years disabled. Differentials in socioeconomic status account for part, but not all, of the difference in older age disability between Latinos and whites. We hypothesize that a factor often ignored in the literature-the fact that Latinos, on average, have more physically strenuous jobs than non-Latino whites-contributes to the higher Latino risk of functional limitations at older ages. We use longitudinal data from the 1998-2014 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) comprising 17,297 respondents. Compared to US-born whites, Latinos, especially Latino immigrants, report substantially higher levels of physical effort at work. Latino-black differences are much smaller than Latino-white differences. As hypothesized, physical work effort is strongly related to functional limitations. However, differentials in physical work effort for Latinos and whites in their fifties and early sixties are weakly related to Latino-white differentials in FL at later ages."
https://openalex.org/W3136085196,"This study measured the total quantity and composition of waste generated in a large, New York City (NYC) hospital kitchen over a one-day period to assess the impact of potential waste diversion strategies in potential weight of waste diverted from landfill and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the one-day audit, the hospital kitchen generated 1515.15 kg (1.7 US tons) of solid waste daily or 0.23 kg of total waste per meal served. Extrapolating to all meals served in 2019, the hospital kitchen generates over 442,067 kg (487 US tons) of waste and emits approximately 294,466 kg of CO 2 e annually from waste disposal. Most of this waste (85%, 376,247 kg or 415 US tons annually) is currently sent to landfill. With feasible changes, including increased recycling and moderate composting, this hospital could reduce landfilled waste by 205,245 kg (226 US tons, or 55% reduction) and reduce GHG emissions by 189,025 kg CO 2 e (64% reduction). Given NYC’s ambitious waste and GHG emission reduction targets outlined in its OneNYC strategic plan, studies analyzing composition, emissions, and waste diversion potential of large institutions can be valuable in achieving city sustainability goals."
https://openalex.org/W3136787621,"Injuries and fatalities due to firearms are a major burden on public health in the US. The rise in gun violence in popular movies has been suggested as a potential cultural influence on this behavior. Nevertheless, homicide rates have not increased over recent decades in the US, suggesting that media portrayals have had little influence on gun violence. Here we challenge this interpretation by examining trends in the proportion of violence that are attributable to firearms, a measure that should be more sensitive to media violence. In addition, we examine trends in the portrayal of guns in popular television (TV) dramas, which are viewed more frequently than movies. We ask (a) whether gun violence has increased in these TV shows not only on an absolute basis but also as a proportion of violent scenes and (b) whether trends in gun portrayal on these shows are associated with corresponding trends in the proportion of real-world violence attributable to firearms in the US from 2000 to 2018. To answer these questions, we coded annual instances of violence, gun violence, and proportion of violence involving guns for each 5-minute segment of 33 popular TV dramas in the police, medical, and legal genres from 2000 to 2018. Trends in annual rates of violence, gun violence and proportion of violence involving guns were determined over the study period and were compared to annual rates of homicide attributable to firearms in three age groups: 15-24, 25-34 and 35 and older. Although violence on TV dramas peaked in 2011, gun use steadily increased over the study period both in absolute terms and in relation to other violent methods. The latter metric paralleled trends in homicides attributable to firearms for all three age groups, with the strongest relationship for youth ages 15-24 (R2 = .40, P = .003). The positive relation between relative amount of TV violence involving guns and actual homicides due to firearms, especially among youth, is consistent with the hypothesis that entertainment media are contributing to the normative acceptance of guns for violent purposes. Future research is needed to study the influence of media violence on gun acquisition at the individual level."
https://openalex.org/W3137894093,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant global threat. However, despite urgent need, there remains uncertainty surrounding best practices for pharmaceutical interventions to treat COVID-19. In particular, conflicting evidence has emerged surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, alone or in combination, for COVID-19. The COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator convened by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research, assembled experts from the health systems research, regulatory science, data science, and epidemiology to participate in a large parallel analysis of different data sets to further explore the effectiveness of these treatments. Methods Electronic health record (EHR) and claims data were extracted from seven separate databases. Parallel analyses were undertaken on data extracted from each source. Each analysis examined time to mortality in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the two in combination as compared to patients not treated with either drug. Cox proportional hazards models were used, and propensity score methods were undertaken to adjust for confounding. Frequencies of adverse events in each treatment group were also examined. Results Neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with time to mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. No treatment groups appeared to have an elevated risk of adverse events. Conclusion Administration of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination appeared to have no effect on time to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Continued research is needed to clarify best practices surrounding treatment of COVID-19."

Void collapse rate and dislocation activities at the void surface are found to strongly dependent on the shock orientation. For a relatively weaker shock, void collapses fastest when shocked along the &lt;100&gt; orientation; while for a relatively stronger shock, void collapses fastest in the &lt;110&gt; orientation.

https://openalex.org/W3135923077,"Background Only screening a pregnant mother is not satisfactory to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). A male partner’s involvement in HIV testing and counseling is also critical for PMTCT, however, it is one of the biggest challenges in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess a male partner’s involvement in HIV testing and counseling and associated factors among partners of pregnant women in the Delanta District, Northern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in the Delanta District from March 15 to May 10, 2018. During the study period, 609 male partners were involved. A binary and multiple logistic regression model was used to examine the association between variables. Results Out of all, 325 (53.7% at 95% CI: 49.6 to 57.5) of male partners were involved in HIV testing and counseling in the District. Male partners who were living together, ever heard about HIV from health professionals, pregnant women’s antenatal care (ANC) visit, partner visited the PMTCT clinic with wife, and partner and wife discussion before HIV testing and counseling were factors associated with male partner involvement. Conclusion The proportion of male partner involvement was found to be low as compared to the national standards. Local health authorities and health care workers need to develop and conduct interventions that help partners with their wife to live together, improve their awareness about HIV and testing, ANC visit by pregnant women, and encourage having home discussion before HIV testing through counseling, by so doing finally raise the level of male partner involvement in HIV testing and counseling."
https://openalex.org/W3136920819,"In this work, we performed an analysis of the networks of interactions between drugs and their targets to assess how connected the compounds are. For our purpose, the interactions were downloaded from the DrugBank database, and we considered all drugs approved by the FDA. Based on topological analysis of this interaction network, we obtained information on degree, clustering coefficient, connected components, and centrality of these interactions. We identified that this drug-target interaction network cannot be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, i . e ., it is not bipartite. In addition, the connectivity or associations between every pair of nodes identified that the drug-target network is constituted of 165 connected components, where one giant component contains 4376 interactions that represent 89.99% of all the elements. In this regard, the histamine H1 receptor, which belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors and is activated by the biogenic amine histamine, was found to be the most important node in the centrality of input-degrees. In the case of centrality of output-degrees, fostamatinib was found to be the most important node, as this drug interacts with 300 different targets, including arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase or ALOX5, expressed on cells primarily involved in regulation of immune responses. The top 10 hubs interacted with 33% of the target genes. Fostamatinib stands out because it is used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adults. Finally, 187 highly connected sets of nodes, structured in communities, were also identified. Indeed, the largest communities have more than 400 elements and are related to metabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders and cancer. Our results demonstrate the possibilities to explore these compounds and their targets to improve drug repositioning and contend against emergent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3138325783,"Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer type with a very high mortality rate. Inflammatory cytokine such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) plays a pivotal role in the progression of PDAC. Recently, suppression of cell invasion by preventive agents has received considerable attention in the prevention of metastatic tumors. Several clinical studies suggested that natural forms or analogues of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A and vitamin D can work as anti-cancer agents to inhibit the development of cancer. In this study, our results demonstrated that co-treatment of 13-cis retinoic acid (13-cis RA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-VD3) significantly inhibited TNF-α mediated cell invasion in PDAC in vitro . Cotreatment of 13-cis RA and 1,25-VD3 also inhibited TNF-α mediated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein through blocking c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Our results demonstrated that treatment of TNF-α lead to a decreased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 3 (TIMP-3) protein and an induction of MMP-9 protein and cell invasion through an upregulation of microRNA-221 (miR-221) in human PDAC cells. Moreover, treatment of SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK pathway) or cotreatment of 13-cis RA and 1,25-VD3 significantly induced a decreased expression of miR-221 and an increased expression of TIMP-3 protein. These results suggest that 13-cis RA and 1,25-VD3 significantly suppress TNF-α mediated cell invasion and therefore potentially act as preventive agents against PDAC."

The purpose of this study is to examine province-level disparities in age-standardised breast cancer incidence versus mortality from 2000 to 2010 and their association with socioeconomic status. Methods In this study, data from Iran’s national cancer and death registry systems, and covariates from census and household expenditure surveys were used. We estimated the age-standardised incidence and mortality rates in women aged more than 30 years for all 31 provinces in the consecutive time intervals 2000–2003, 2004–2007 and 2008–2010 using a Bayesian spatial model. Results Mean age-standardised breast cancer incidence across provinces increased over time from 15.0 per 100,000 people (95% credible interval 12.0,18.3) in 2000–2003 to 39.6 (34.5,45.1) in 2008–2010. The mean breast cancer mortality rate declined from 10.9 (8.3,13.8) to 9.9 (7.5,12.5) deaths per 100,000 people in the same period. When grouped by wealth index quintiles, provinces in the highest quintile had higher levels of incidence and mortality. In the wealthiest quintile, reductions in mortality over time were larger than those observed among provinces in the poorest quintile. Relative breast cancer mortality decreased by 16.7% in the highest quintile compared to 10.8% in the lowest quintile. Conclusions Breast cancer incidence has increased over time, with lower incidence in the poorest provinces likely driven by underdiagnoses or late-stage diagnosis. Although the reported mortality rate is still higher in wealthier provinces, the larger decline over time in these provinces indicates a possible future reversal, with the most deprived provinces having higher mortality rates. Ongoing analysis of incidence and mortality at sub-national level is crucial in addressing inequalities in healthcare systems and public health both in Iran and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W3136267649,"Abstract Adult pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) have been regarded as indistinguishable from pediatric PAs in terms of genome-wide expression and methylation patterns. It has been unclear whether adult PAs arise early in life and remain asymptomatic until adulthood, or whether they develop during adulthood. We sought to determine the age and origin of adult human PAs using two types of “marks” in the genomic DNA. First, we analyzed the DNA methylation patterns of adult and pediatric PAs to distinguish between PAs of different anatomic locations ( n = 257 PA and control brain tissues). Second, we measured the concentration of nuclear bomb test-derived 14 C in genomic DNA ( n = 14 cases), which indicates the time point of the formation of human cell populations. Our data suggest that adult and pediatric PAs developing in the infratentorial brain are closely related and potentially develop from precursor cells early in life, whereas supratentorial PAs might show age and location-specific differences."

Data from a high poverty, high performing K-8 school revealed a significant negative correlation between the number of visits to a school-based nurse and standardized academic assessments. Fixed effect regression confirmed the effect of total number of visits to the school-based nurse on performance on standardized assessments, and also revealed that two types of visits, neurological and gastrointestinal, were predictive of student performance. Taken together, these results suggest that when students are suffering from ill health their academic performance is negatively impacted. Implications for improving health equity through data-driven educational interventions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3137142962,"Cold plasma generated in air at atmospheric pressure is an extremely effective antimicrobial agent, with proven efficacy against clinically relevant bacterial biofilms. The specific mode of bacterial inactivation is highly dependent upon the configuration of the plasma source used. In this study, the mode of microbial inactivation of a surface barrier discharge was investigated against Escherichia coli biofilms grown on polypropylene coupons. Different modes of exposure were considered and it was demonstrated that the long-lived reactive species created by the plasma are not solely responsible for the observed microbial inactivation. It was observed that a synergistic interaction occurs between the plasma generated long-lived reactive species and ultraviolet (UV) photons, acting to increase the antimicrobial efficacy of the approach by an order of magnitude. It is suggested that plasma generated UV is an important component for microbial inactivation when using a surface barrier discharge; however, it is not through the conventional pathway of direct DNA damage, rather through the synergistic interaction between liquid in the biofilm matrix and long-lived chemical species created by the discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3137672616,"As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with a usage history of over 2,000 years in China, Spica Schizonepetae possesses definite clinical activity in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its active ingredients and mechanism of action remain unclear at present. The further exploration of its active components and underlying mechanism will provide a basis for the development of candidate anti-tumor drugs. Our previous study explored the chemical constituents of Spica Schizonepetae extract (SSE). On this basis, molecular networking technology was applied in analyzing the QTOF-MS/MS data of rat plasma after intragastric administration of SSE using the GNPS database platform. A total of 26 components were found, including 9 proterotype components and 17 metabolites, which revealed the potential active ingredients of SSE. Later, the Lewis lung cancer mouse model was established, and the inhibition rate and histopathological sections were used as the indicators to investigate the anti-tumor effect of SSE, whereas the body weight, survival rate, thymus index and spleen index served as the indicators to explore the pharmacological effects of SSE on improving mouse immunity. The results showed that SSE had comparable anti-tumor efficacy to cisplatin, which enhanced the immunity, improved the quality of life, and extended the survival time of lung cancer mice. Furthermore, human A549 lung tumor cells were selected to explore the mechanism of SSE in treating NSCLC based on cell metabonomics. After data mining by the MPP software, 23 differential endogenous metabolites were identified between SSE and tumor groups. Moreover, results of pathway enrichment analysis using the MetaboAnalyst 4.0 software indicated that these metabolites were mainly enriched in four metabolic pathways (p &lt; 0.1). By adopting the network pharmacology method, the metabolic pathways discovered by cell metabolomics were verified against the ChEMBL, STITCH, UniProt and TCGA databases, and differences in the underlying mechanism between cells and humans were found. It was proved that SSE affected the metabolism of purine, arachidonic acid and histidine to exert the anti-tumor efficacy. Furthermore, the multi-target, multi-pathway, and immunoenhancement mechanism of SSE in anti-tumor treatment was revealed, which provided a scientific basis for new drug development and the rational application of Spica Schizonepetae in clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3138288178,"The characterization of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) relies mainly on right heart catheterization (RHC). Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive estimation of lung perfusion that could complement the hemodynamic information from RHC. To assess the association between impedance variation of lung perfusion (ΔZQ) and hemodynamic profile, severity, and prognosis, suspected of PAH or worsening PAH patients were submitted simultaneously to RHC and EIT. Measurements of ΔZQ were obtained. Based on the results of the RHC, 35 patients composed the PAH group, and eight patients, the normopressoric (NP) group. PAH patients showed a significantly reduced ΔZQ compared to the NP group. There was a significant correlation between ΔZQ and hemodynamic parameters, particularly with stroke volume (SV) (r = 0.76; P < 0.001). At 60 months, 15 patients died (43%) and 1 received lung transplantation; at baseline they had worse hemodynamics, and reduced ΔZQ when compared to survivors. Patients with low ΔZQ (≤154.6%.Kg) presented significantly worse survival (P = 0.033). ΔZQ is associated with hemodynamic status of PAH patients, with disease severity and survival, demonstrating EIT as a promising tool for monitoring patients with pulmonary vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3138157318,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages of N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE). An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the “simple silicone mask” (SSM). Methods A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4–18. Results The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. Conclusion Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment. The authors and affiliates do not endorse the use of this device at present."
https://openalex.org/W3138322352,"The small LOV/F-box/Kelch family of E3 ubiquitin ligases plays an essential role in the regulation of plant circadian clocks and flowering time by sensing dusk. The family consists of three members, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2), and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX PROTEIN 1 (FKF1), which share a unique protein domain architecture allowing them to act as photoreceptors that transduce light signals via altering stability of target proteins. Despite intensive study of this protein family we still lack important knowledge about the biochemical and functional roles of the protein domains that comprise these unique photoreceptors. Here, we perform comparative analyses of transgenic lines constitutively expressing the photoreceptor LOV domain or the Kelch repeat protein-protein interaction domains of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. Expression of each domain alone is sufficient to disrupt circadian rhythms and flowering time, but each domain differs in the magnitude of effect. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry with the ZTL Kelch repeat domain identified a suite of potential interacting partners. Furthermore, the ZTL Kelch repeat domain can interact with the ZTL homologs, LKP2 and FKF1, and the LOV domain of ZTL itself. This suggests a hypothesis that the Kelch repeat domain of ZTL may mediate inter- and intra-molecular interactions of the three LOV/F-box/Kelch proteins and provides added insight into the composition of the protein complexes and an additional role for the Kelch repeat domain."
https://openalex.org/W3136253949,"Natural and uninterrupted water courses are important for biodiversity and fish population stability. Nowadays, many streams and rivers are obstructed by artificial migration barriers, often preventing the migration of fish. On the other hand, distribution of pathogens by migrating fishes is still a point of concern. Pathogen transport and transmission is a driving force in the dynamics of many infectious diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible consequences of the removal of an artificial migration barrier for the upstream transport of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae , the causative agent of Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) in brown trout, by migrating fish. To test this question, a river system was selected with a migration barrier separating a PKD positive river from a PKD negative tributary. After removal of the barrier, PKD prevalence and pathology was examined during five years after elimination of the barrier. In the tributary, no PKD was recorded at any time of the survey. By means of unidirectional PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagging, we confirmed upstream migration of adult brown trout into the tributary during the cold season, presumably for spawning. By eDNA, we confirmed presence of T . bryoalmonae and Fredericella sp ., the definitive host, DNA in water from the PKD positive river stretch, but not in the PKD negative tributary. Our study illustrates the importance of the connectivity of streams for habitat maintenance. Although migration of brown trout from a PKD-positive river into a PKD-negative tributary, mainly for spawning, was confirmed, upstream spreading of PKD was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W3136373105,"Collagen is the major structural protein in the extracellular matrix of skin produced by fibroblasts. UV exposure results in infiltration of neutrophils within the epidermis and dermis, inducing collagen damage and contributing to the process of photo-aging. Collagen-3 is an integral structural component with collagen-1, and is an important regulator of collagen-1 fibrillogenesis. Addition of neutrophils activated with TNFα to normal human dermal fibroblast cultures, but not their supernatant, caused significant collagen-3 damage. To study whether Lumenato can protect from collagen-3 damage, it was added to co-cultures of Normal human dermal fibroblasts and neutrophils activated with TNFα. Lumenato prevented collagen-3 damage induced by activated neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner in the co-cultures. Lumenato also induced a low rate of collagen-3 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner detected by pro-collagen-3 secretion, but did not affect fibroblast cell number. Although Lumenato inhibited MMP-8, MMP-9, and elastase secreted from neutrophils, its main effect was in inhibiting both NADPH oxidase-producing superoxides and MPO activity-producing halides in a dose-dependent manner that correlated with protection from collagen-3 damage. In conclusion, the results suggest that Lumenato induces low levels of collagen-3 that may contribute for skin health and is very effective in defending the co-cultures from collagen-3 damage by inhibiting free radicals secreted from neutrophils, thus, indicating Lumenato's possible potential for skin protection."
https://openalex.org/W3137833883,"The Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6), which is broadly compatible with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal by 1.5–2°C, contains substantial reductions in agricultural non-CO 2 emissions besides the deployment of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Failing to mitigate agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions could contribute to an overshoot of the RCP2.6 warming by about 0.4°C. We explore using additional CDR to offset alternative agricultural non-CO 2 emission pathways in which emissions either remain constant or rise. We assess the effects on the climate of calculating CDR rates to offset agricultural emission under two different approaches: relying on the 100-year global warming potential conversion metric (GWP100) and maintaining effective radiative forcing levels at exactly those of RCP2.6. Using a reduced-complexity climate model, we find that the conversion metric leads to a systematic underestimation of needed CDR, reaching only around 50% of the temperature mitigation needed to remain on the RCP2.6 track. This is mostly because the metric underestimates, in the near term, forcing from short-lived climate pollutants such as methane. We test whether alternative conversion metrics, the GWP20 and GWP*, are more suitable for offsetting purposes, and found that they both lead to an overestimation of the CDR requirements. Under alternative agricultural emissions pathways, holding to RCP2.6 total radiative forcing requires up to twice the amount of CDR that is already included in the RCP2.6. We examine the costs of this additional CDR, and the effects of internalizing these in several agricultural commodities. Assuming an average CDR cost by $150/tCO 2 , we find increases in prices of up to 41% for beef, 14% for rice, and 40% for milk in the United States relative to current retail prices. These figures are significantly higher (for beef and rice) under a global scenario, potentially threatening food security and welfare. Although the policy delivers a mechanism to finance the early deployment of CDR, using CDR to offset remaining high emissions may well hit other non-financial constraints and can thus only support, and not substitute, emission reductions."
https://openalex.org/W3138056566,"Decomposition of litter and organic matter is a very important soil ecosystem function where soil fauna play an important role. Knowledge of the responses in decomposition and soil fauna to different stressors is therefore crucial. However, the extent to which radioactivity may affect soil fauna is not so well known. There are some results showing effects on soil fauna at uranium mines and near Chernobyl from relatively high levels of anthropogenic radionuclides. We hypothesize that naturally occurring radionuclides affect soil fauna and thus litter decomposition, which will covary with radionuclide levels when accounting for important soil parameters. We have therefore used standardised litterbags with two different mesh sizes filled with birch leaves (Betula pubescens) to assess litter decomposition in an area with enhanced levels of naturally occurring radionuclides in the thorium (232Th) and uranium (238U) decay chains while controlling for variation in important soil parameters like pH, organic matter content, moisture and large grain size. We show that decomposition rate is higher in litterbags with large mesh size compared to litterbags with a fine mesh size that excludes soil fauna. We also find that litter dried at room temperature is decomposed at a faster rate than litter dried in oven (60⁰C). This was surprising given the associated denaturation of proteins and anticipated increased nutritional level but may be explained by the increased stiffness of oven-dried litter. This result is important since different studies often use either oven-dried or room temperature-dried litter. Taking the above into account, we explore statistical models to show large and expected effects of soil parameters but also significant effects on litter decomposition of the naturally occurring radionuclide levels. We use the ERICA tool to estimate total dose rate per coarse litterbag for four different model organisms, and in subsequent different statistical models we identify that the model including the dose rates of a small tube-shape is the best statistical model. In another statistical model including soil parameters and radionuclide distributions, 226Ra (or uranium precursory radionuclides) explain variation in litter decomposition while 228Ra (and precursors) do not. This may hint to chemical toxicity effects of uranium. However, when combining this model with the best model, the resulting simplified model is equal to the tube-shape dose-rate model. There is thus a need for more research on how naturally occurring radionuclides affect soil fauna, but the study at hand show the importance of an ecosystem approach and the ecosystem parameter soil decomposition."

Starvation affected growth and survival but despite degree of starvation, larvae were able to resume growth and experience high survivorship following feeding. Specific growth rate based on larval dry weight for the period directly following first feeding was highest for the day 15 and 18 delayed feeding treatments. There were no differences in survival between the 0 and 5 day treatments, however survival was reduced to 71.2%, 45.4%, and 28.8% for 10, 15, and 18 day delayed feeding treatments, respectively. Shortnose sturgeon had a point-of-no-return (PNR; 55.7% initiated feeding) at ~19 days (or 42 days post-fertilization) following the full absorption of yolk. Mean percent swimming activity and swimming speeds showed an interaction between delayed feeding treatment and larval age, such that no differences were detected at 1 and 6 days post-yolk absorption, while these swimming behaviors generally increased or spiked as feeding was delayed for 10, 15, and 18 days post-yolk absorption. At 23 days post-yolk absorption, only swimming speed increased for larvae that were denied food for 18 days. While there was an interaction between delayed feeding treatments and age for proportion of larvae exhibiting an escape response, generally, larvae from all feeding treatments exhibited a positive escape response. There were also interactions between delayed feeding treatments and age post-yolk absorption for mean and maximum escape speeds, such that less aggressive escape responses were typically detected the longer larvae were denied food. Our research suggests that larval shortnose sturgeon increase physical activity during periods of starvation to find a food patch while remaining vigilant but maybe not as capable to defend against a predatory attack as fed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3137832186,"Composite pile foundation has been widely used in ground engineering. This composite pile foundation system has complex pile-soil interactions under seismic loading. The calculation of vertical bearing capacity of composite pile foundation is still an unsolved problem if the soil around piles is partially or completely liquefied under seismic loading. We have completed indoor shaking table model tests to measure the vertical bearing capacity in a liquefiable soil foundation under seismic loading. This paper will use a numerical approach to analyze the change of this vertical bearing capacity under seismic loading. Firstly, the Goodman contact element is improved to include the Rayleigh damping. Such an improvement can well describe the reflection and absorption of seismic waves at the interface of soil and piles. Secondly, the Biot’s dynamic consolidation theory incorporated an elastoplastic model is applied to simulate the soil deformation and the generation and accumulation of pore water pressure under seismic loading. Thirdly, after verification with our indoor shaking table test data, this approach is used to investigate the effects of pile spacing on liquefaction resistance of the composite pile foundation in liquefiable soil. The time histories of pore water pressure ratio ( PPR ′) are calculated for the liquefiable soil and the vertical bearing capacity in partially liquefied soil is calculated and compared with our indoor shaking table test data at the 3D, 3.5D, 4D, 5D and 6D cases (D is the pile diameter). It is found that the pile spacing has some influence on the extent of soil liquefaction between piles. The vertical bearing capacity varies with liquefaction extent of inter-pile soil. The optimization of pile spacing varies with liquefaction extent. These results may provide some reference for the design of composite pile foundation under seismic loading."

https://openalex.org/W3139384496,"Isolated stegosaurian teeth from the Early Cretaceous high-latitude (palaeolatitude estimate of N 62°- 66.5°) Teete locality in Yakutia (Eastern Siberia, Russia) are characterized by a labiolingually compressed, slightly asymmetrical and mesiodistally denticulated (9–14 denticles) crown, a pronounced ring-like cingulum, as well as a “complex network of secondary ridges”. The 63 teeth (found during on-site excavation in 2012, 2017–2019 and screen-washing in 2017–2019) most likely belong to one species of a derived (stegosaurine) stegosaur. Most of the teeth exhibit a high degree of wear and up to three wear facets has been observed on a single tooth. The prevalence of worn teeth with up to three wear facets and the presence of different types of facets (including steeply inclined and groove-like) indicate the tooth-tooth contact and precise dental occlusion in the Teete stegosaur. The microwear pattern (mesiodistally or slightly obliquely oriented scratches; differently oriented straight and curved scratches on some wear facets) suggest a complex jaw mechanism with palinal jaw motion. Histological analysis revealed that the Teete stegosaur is characterized by relatively short tooth formation time (95 days) and the presence of a “wavy enamel pattern”. Discoveries of a “wavy enamel pattern” in the Teete stegosaur, in a Middle Jurassic stegosaur from Western Siberia, and in the basal ceratopsian Psittacosaurus , suggest that this histological feature is common for different ornithischian clades, including ornithopods, marginocephalians, and thyreophorans. A juvenile tooth in the Teete sample indicates that stegosaurs were year-round residents and reproduced in high latitudes. The combination of high degree of tooth wear with formation of multiple wear facets, complex jaw motions, relatively short tooth formation time and possibly high tooth replacement rates is interpreted as a special adaptation for a life in high-latitude conditions or, alternatively, as a common stegosaurian adaptation making stegosaurs a successful group of herbivorous dinosaurs in the Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous and enabeling them to live in both low- and high-latitude ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3139445423,"Continuous culture systems allow for the controlled growth of microorganisms over a long period of time. Here, we develop a novel test for mutagenicity that involves growing yeast in continuous culture systems exposed to low levels of mutagen for a period of approximately 20 days. In contrast, most microorganism-based tests for mutagenicity expose the potential mutagen to the biological reporter at a high concentration of mutagen for a short period of time. Our test improves upon the sensitivity of the well-established Ames test by at least 20-fold for each of two mutagens that act by different mechanisms (the intercalator ethidium bromide and alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate). To conduct the tests, cultures were grown in small, inexpensive continuous culture systems in media containing (potential) mutagen, and the resulting mutagenicity of the added compound was assessed via two methods: a canavanine-based plate assay and whole genome sequencing. In the canavanine-based plate assay, we were able to detect a clear relationship between the amount of mutagen and the number of canavanine-resistant mutant colonies over a period of one to three weeks of exposure. Whole genome sequencing of yeast grown in continuous culture systems exposed to methyl methanesulfonate demonstrated that quantification of mutations is possible by identifying the number of unique variants across each strain. However, this method had lower sensitivity than the plate-based assay and failed to distinguish the different concentrations of mutagen. In conclusion, we propose that yeast grown in continuous culture systems can provide an improved and more sensitive test for mutagenicity."
https://openalex.org/W3136068637,"Demographic models of human cultural evolution have high explanatory potential but weak empirical support. Here we use a global dataset of rock art sites and climate and genetics-based estimates of ancient population densities to test a new model based on epidemiological principles. The model focuses on the process whereby a cultural innovation becomes endemic in a population, predicting that this cannot occur unless population density exceeds a critical threshold. Analysis of the data, using a Bayesian statistical framework, shows that the model has stronger empirical support than a proportional model, where detection is directly proportional to population density, or a null model, where rock art detection ratios and population density are independent. Results for different geographical areas and periods are compatible with the predictions of the model and confirm its superiority with respect to the null model. Re-analysis of the rock art data, using a second set of independent population estimates, again supports the superiority of the model. Although the available data is sparse and the analysis cannot exclude all possible sources of bias, this is evidence that population density above a critical threshold may be a necessary condition for the maintenance of rock art as a stable part of a population's cultural repertoire. Methods similar to those described can be used to test the model for other classes of archaeological artifact and to compare it against other models."

However, whether excessive NaCl intake accompanied by a high-fat diet (HFD) affects glucose metabolism has not been elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD), a NCD plus high-NaCl diet (NCD plus NaCl), a HFD, or a HFD plus high-NaCl diet (HFD plus NaCl) for 30 weeks. No significant differences in body weight gain, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance were observed between NCD-fed and NCD plus NaCl-fed mice. In contrast, body and liver weights were decreased, but the weight of epididymal white adipose tissue was increased in HFD plus NaCl-fed compared to HFD-fed mice. HFD plus NaCl-fed mice had lower plasma glucose levels in an insulin tolerance test, and showed higher plasma glucose and lower plasma insulin levels in an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test compared to HFD-fed mice. The β-cell area and number of islets were decreased in HFD plus NaCl-fed compared to HFD-fed mice. Increased Ki67-positive β-cells, and increased expression levels of Ki67, CyclinB1, and CyclinD1 mRNA in islets were observed in HFD-fed but not HFD plus NaCl-fed mice when compared to NCD-fed mice. Our data suggest that excessive NaCl intake accompanied by a HFD exacerbates glucose intolerance, with impairment in insulin secretion caused by the attenuation of expansion of β-cell mass in the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W3137978755,"After being isolated from a sugarcane pile, the bacterium Chitinophaga sp. CB10 demonstrated to be a rich source of carbohydrases, with 350 predicted CAZyme domains. CB10 was able to grow on carbohydrates of different structural complexities: glucose, carboxymethylcellulose, corn starch, galactomannan, Aloe vera gum and sugarcane bagasse. The sugarcane bagasse is a rich source of complex polymers, and the diversity of metabolites released by its enzymatic hydrolysis has an important role for green chemistry, including minority pathways such as the degradation of mannan conjugates. In this sense, CB10 demonstrated considerable levels of gene expression for mannanases, and was stable for a period of 96-144 hours in the presence of sugarcane bagasse as sole carbon source. The bacterium showed respectively 4.8x and 5.6x expression levels for two genes predicted for GH2 β-mannosidase: one located within a gene cluster identified as ""polysaccharide utilization loci"" (PUL), and another a classic β-mannosidase. These enzymes shared less than 45% of identity with enzymes characterized from the genus Chitinophaga belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. The degree of novelty-as demonstrated by the low identity with previously characterized enzymes; the remarkable capability to grow in different substrates; mannanase activity, evidenced by the release of residual oligosaccharides in the cultivation with galactomannan (HPLC-RID, 12.3 mMol); associated to the ability of mannanases expression in a low concentration of inductor conditions (sugarcane bagasse, 0.2%) indicate the high potential for the application of CB10 as a source of enzymes in the production of oligosaccharides from biomass. This capacity might prove to be very valuable for the biorefinery process of pre-biotic precursors and other functional oligosaccharides focused on the food and pharmaceutical industries."

We hypothesized that perioperative acid-base abnormalities including lactate disturbances may predict the probability of incidence of CDI in patients after cardiac procedures. Methods Of the 12,235 analyzed patients following cardiac surgery, 143 (1.2%) developed CDI. The control group included 200 consecutive patients without diarrhea, who underwent cardiac procedure within the same period of observation. Pre-, intra and post-operative levels of blood gases, as well as lactate and glucose concentrations were determined. Postoperatively, arterial blood was drawn four times: immediately after surgery and successively; 4, 8 and 12 h following the procedure. Results Baseline pH was lower and PaO 2 was higher in CDI patients ( p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Additionally, these patients had greater base deficiency at each of the analyzed time points ( p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.004, p = 0.012, p = 0.001, p = 0.016 and p = 0.001, respectively). Severe hyperlactatemia was also more common in CDI patients; during the cardiac procedure, 4 h and 12 h after surgery ( p = 0.027, p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independent risk factors for CDI following cardiac surgery were as follows: intraoperative severe hyperlactatemia (OR 2.387, 95% CI 1.155–4.933, p = 0.019), decreased lactate clearance between values immediately and 12 h after procedure (OR 0.996, 95% CI 0.994–0.999, p = 0.013), increased age (OR 1.045, 95% CI 1.020–1.070, p &lt; 0.001), emergent surgery (OR 2.755, 95% CI 1.565–4.848, p &lt; 0.001) and use of antibiotics other than periprocedural prophylaxis (OR 2.778, 95% CI 1.690–4.565, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion This study is the first to show that perioperative hyperlactatemia and decreased lactate clearance may be predictors for occurrence of CDI after cardiac surgery."

In addition, many people around the world are being exposed to highly stressful situations deriving from the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns adopted by national and regional governments. The present study aims to analyse the possible differential effects on various psychological outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression and emotional regulation strategies) stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown experienced by individuals living near an important petrochemical complex and subjects living in other areas, nonexposed to the characteristic environmental pollutants emitted by these kinds of complex. The sample consisted of 1607 subjects who answered an ad hoc questionnaire on lockdown conditions, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The results indicate that people living closer to petrochemical complexes reported greater risk perception [ K = 73.42, p &lt; 0.001, with a medium size effect ( η 2 = 0.061)]. However, no significant relationship between psychological variables and proximity to the focus was detected when comparing people living near to or far away from a chemical/petrochemical complex. Regarding the adverse psychological effects of the first lockdown due to COVID-19 on the general population in Catalonia, we can conclude that the conditions included in this survey were mainly related to changes in the participants’ impulsivity levels, with different total impulsivity scores being obtained if they had minors in their care (p&lt;0.001), if they had lost their jobs, if they were working (p&lt;0.001), if they were not telecommuting (p&lt;0.001), if they went out to work (p&lt;0.001) or if they established routines (p = 0.009). However, we can also be fairly certain that the economic effects are going to be worse than those initially detected in this study. More research will be necessary to corroborate our results."

We extend this theory to sleep and ask: do managers report more disrupted sleep and does this vary by gender and country context? Data come from the 2012 European Social Survey Programme and our sample comprised those currently employed in their prime working age (n = 27,616; age 25–64) in 29 countries. We include country level measures of the Gender Development Index (GDI) and gross domestic product (GDP). We find that workers sleep better, regardless of gender, in countries where women are empowered. For managers, women sleep better as GDI increases and men as GDP increases. Our results suggest that men experience a sleep premium from economic development and women from gender empowerment."
https://openalex.org/W3137225063,"The yeast Pseudozyma antarctica (currently designated Moesziomyces antarcticus ) secretes a xylose-induced biodegradable plastic-degrading enzyme (PaE). To suppress degradation of PaE during production and storage, we targeted the inhibition of proteolytic enzyme activity in P . antarctica . Proteases A and B act as upper regulators in the proteolytic network of the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We searched for orthologous genes encoding proteases A and B in the genome of P . antarctica GB-4(0) based on the predicted amino acid sequences. We found two gene candidates, Pa PRO1 and Pa PRO2 , with conserved catalytically important domains and signal peptides indicative of vacuolar protease function. We then prepared gene-deletion mutants of strain GB-4(0), ΔPa PRO1 and ΔPa PRO2 , and evaluated PaE stability in culture by immunoblotting analysis. Both mutants exhibited sufficient production of PaE without degradation fragments, while the parent strain exhibited the degradation fragments. Therefore, we concluded that the protease A and B orthologous genes are related to the degradation of PaE. To produce a large quantity of PaE, we made a Pa PRO2 deletion mutant of a PaE-overexpression strain named XG8 by introducing a PaE high-production cassette into the strain GB-4(0). The ΔPa PRO2 mutant of XG8 was able to produce PaE without the degradation fragments during large-scale cultivation in a 3-L jar fermenter for 3 days at 30°C. After terminating the agitation, the PaE activity in the XG8 ΔPa PRO2 mutant culture was maintained for the subsequent 48 h incubation at 25°C regardless of remaining cells, while activity in the XG8 control was reduced to 55.1%. The gene-deleted mutants will be useful for the development of industrial processes of PaE production and storage."
https://openalex.org/W3137821653,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options in which the telomere shortening is a strong predictive factor of poor prognosis. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) administration is probed in several experimental induced lung pathologies; however, MSC might stimulate fibrotic processes. A therapy that avoids MSC side effects of transformation would be an alternative to the use of living cells. Membranes particles (MP) are nanovesicles artificially generated from the membranes of MSC containing active enzymes involved in ECM regeneration. We aimed to investigate the anti-fibrotic role of MP derived from MSC in an in vitro model of pulmonary fibrosis. Methods Epithelial cells (A549) and lung fibroblasts, from IPF patients with different telomere length, were co-cultured with MP and TGF-β for 48h and gene expression of major pro-fibrotic markers were analyzed. Results About 90% of both types of cells effectively took up MP without cytotoxic effects. MP decreased the expression of profibrotic proteins such as Col1A1, Fibronectin and PAI-1, in A549 cells. In fibroblasts culture, there was a different response in the inhibitory effect of MP on some pro-fibrotic markers when comparing fibroblast from normal telomere length patients (FN) versus short telomere length (FS), but both types showed an inhibition of Col1A1, Tenascin-c, PAI-1 and MMP-1 gene expression after MP treatment. Conclusions MP conserve some of the properties attributed to the living MSC. This study shows that MP target lung cells, via which they may have a broad anti-fibrotic effect."
https://openalex.org/W3138358417,"A new web server called PhotoModPlus is presented as a platform for predicting photosynthetic proteins via genome neighborhood networks (GNN) and genome neighborhood-based machine learning. GNN enables users to visualize the overview of the conserved neighboring genes from multiple photosynthetic prokaryotic genomes and provides functional guidance on the query input. In the platform, we also present a new machine learning model utilizing genome neighborhood features for predicting photosynthesis-specific functions based on 24 prokaryotic photosynthesis-related GO terms, namely PhotoModGO. The new model performed better than the sequence-based approaches with an F1 measure of 0.872, based on nested five-fold cross-validation. Finally, we demonstrated the applications of the webserver and the new model in the identification of novel photosynthetic proteins. The server is user-friendly, compatible with all devices, and available at bicep.kmutt.ac.th/photomod ."
https://openalex.org/W3138692150,"Introduction Morbidity and mortality conferences (M&amp;MCs) are an instrument for learning from past complications, unexpected follow-ups and deaths in hospitals and are important for improving patient safety. However, there are currently no quantitative data on the implementation of M&amp;MCs in Austria. The aim of the study was to determine the status quo of the M&amp;MCs in Austria. Materials and methods A national cross-sectional study was conducted by means of a survey of 982 chief physicians of surgical disciplines, internal medicine, anesthesiology, intensive care, gynecology/obstetrics and pediatrics. The questionnaire focused on overall goals, structure and procedures of hospital M&amp;MCs. Results Of the 982 contacted chief physicians, 314 (32.0%) completed the survey. Almost two thirds of the respondents, i.e. 203 (64.7%), had already implemented M&amp;MCs. Of the 111 chief physicians who had not yet introduced M&amp;MCs, 62 (55.9%) were interested in introducing such conferences in the future. Of the 203 respondents that had implemented M&amp;MCs, 100 stated that their M&amp;MC could be improved. They reported issues with ""shame and blame"" culture, hierarchical structures, too little knowledge about the capability of M&amp;MC and, in particular, time constraints. Overall, the participating chief physicians showed that they are striving to improve their existing M&amp;MCs. Discussion/Conclusion While we found a relatively high number of already implemented M&amp;MCs we also identified a large heterogeneity in the format of the M&amp;MCs. A highly structured M&amp;MC including guidelines, checklists or templates does not only considerably improve its outcome but can also alleviate the main limiting factor which is the lack of time."
