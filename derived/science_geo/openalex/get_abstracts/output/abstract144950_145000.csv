https://openalex.org/W2142242441,"Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates MEK-1, a kinase that activates the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK). This kinase cascade controls the proliferation and differentiation of different cell types. Here we describe a Raf-1-interacting protein, isolated using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This protein inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of MEK by Raf-1 and is designated RKIP (Raf kinase inhibitor protein). In vitro, RKIP binds to Raf-1, MEK and ERK, but not to Ras. RKIP co-immunoprecipitates with Raf-1 and MEK from cell lysates and colocalizes with Raf-1 when examined by confocal microscopy. RKIP is not a substrate for Raf-1 or MEK, but competitively disrupts the interaction between these kinases. RKIP overexpression interferes with the activation of MEK and ERK, induction of AP-1-dependent reporter genes and transformation elicited by an oncogenically activated Raf-1 kinase. Downregulation of endogenous RKIP by expression of antisense RNA or antibody microinjection induces the activation of MEK-, ERK- and AP-1-dependent transcription. RKIP represents a new class of protein-kinase-inhibitor protein that regulates the activity of the Raf/MEK/ERK module."
https://openalex.org/W2000583211,"Mice lacking suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) develop a complex fatal neonatal disease. In this study, SOCS1-/- mice were shown to exhibit excessive responses typical of those induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma), were hyperresponsive to viral infection, and yielded macrophages with an enhanced IFNgamma-dependent capacity to kill L. major parasites. The complex disease in SOCS1-/- mice was prevented by administration of anti-IFNgamma antibodies and did not occur in SOCS1-/- mice also lacking the IFNgamma gene. Although IFNgamma is essential for resistance to a variety of infections, the potential toxic action of IFNgamma, particularly in neonatal mice, appears to require regulation. Our data indicate that SOCS1 is a key modulator of IFNgamma action, allowing the protective effects of this cytokine to occur without the risk of associated pathological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1974313494,"We identified a seven-pass transmembrane receptor of the cadherin superfamily, designated Flamingo (Fmi), localized at cell-cell boundaries in the Drosophila wing. In the absence of Fmi, planar polarity was distorted. Before morphological polarization of wing cells along the proximal-distal (P-D) axis, Fmi was redistributed predominantly to proximal and distal cell edges. This biased localization of Fmi appears to be driven by an imbalance of the activity of Frizzled (Fz) across the proximal/distal cell boundary. These results, together with phenotypes caused by ectopic expression of fz and fmi, suggest that cells acquire the P-D polarity by way of the Fz-dependent boundary localization of Fmi."
https://openalex.org/W2074362522,"Nuclear receptors have been postulated to regulate gene expression via their association with histone acetylase (HAT) or deacetylase complexes. We report that hormone induces dramatic hyperacetylation at endogenous target genes through the HAT activity of p300/CBP. Unexpectedly, this hyperacetylation is transient and coincides with attenuation of hormone-induced gene activation. In exploring the underlying mechanism, we found that the acetylase ACTR can be acetylated by p300/CBP. The acetylation neutralizes the positive charges of two lysine residues adjacent to the core LXXLL motif and disrupts the association of HAT coactivator complexes with promoter-bound estrogen receptors. These results provide strong in vivo evidence that histone acetylation plays a key role in hormone-induced gene activation and define cofactor acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism in hormonal signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2169147580,"The crystal structure of FGF2 bound to a naturally occurring variant of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) consisting of immunoglobulin-like domains 2 (D2) and 3 (D3) has been determined at 2.8 Å resolution. Two FGF2:FGFR1 complexes form a 2-fold symmetric dimer. Within each complex, FGF2 interacts extensively with D2 and D3 as well as with the linker between the two domains. The dimer is stabilized by interactions between FGF2 and D2 of the adjoining complex and by a direct interaction between D2 of each receptor. A positively charged canyon formed by a cluster of exposed basic residues likely represents the heparin-binding site. A general model for FGF- and heparin-induced FGFR dimerization is inferred from the crystal structure, unifying a wealth of biochemical data."
https://openalex.org/W2031431314,"SOCS1 is an SH2-containing protein that is primarily expressed in thymocytes in a cytokine- and T cell receptor-independent manner. SOCS1 deletion causes perinatal lethality with death by 2-3 weeks. During this period thymic changes include a loss of cellularity and a switch from predominantly CD4+ CD8+ to single positive cells. Peripheral T cells express activation antigens and proliferate to IL-2 in the absence of anti-CD3. In addition, IFNgamma is present in the serum. Reconstitution of the lymphoid lineage of JAK3-deficient mice with SOCS1-deficient stem cells recapitulates the lethality and T cell alterations. Introducing a RAG2 or IFNgamma deficiency eliminates lethality. The results demonstrate that lymphocytes are critical to SOCS1-associated perinatal lethality and implicate SOCS1 in lymphocyte differentiation or regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2033881557,"SOCS3 (CIS3/JAB2) is an SH2-containing protein that binds to the activation loop of Janus kinases, inhibiting kinase activity, and thereby suppressing cytokine signaling. During embryonic development, SOCS3 is highly expressed in erythroid lineage cells and is Epo independent. Transgene-mediated expression blocks fetal erythropoiesis, resulting in embryonic lethality. SOCS3 deletion results in an embryonic lethality at 12-16 days associated with marked erythrocytosis. Moreover, the in vitro proliferative capacity of progenitors is greatly increased. SOCS3-deficient fetal liver stem cells can reconstitute hematopoiesis in lethally irradiated adults, indicating that its absence does not disturb bone marrow erythropoiesis. Reconstitution of lymphoid lineages in JAK3-deficient mice also occurs normally. The results demonstrate that SOCS3 is critical in negatively regulating fetal liver hematopoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W2077668550,"WT1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor implicated in kidney differentiation and tumorigenesis. In reporter assays, WT1 represses transcription from GC- and TC-rich promoters, but its physiological targets remain uncertain. We used hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays to search for native genes whose expression is altered following inducible expression of WT1. The major target of WT1 was amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family. The WT1(-KTS) isoform binds directly to the amphiregulin promoter, resulting in potent transcriptional activation. The in vivo expression profile of amphiregulin during fetal kidney development mirrors the highly specific pattern of WT1 itself, and recombinant Amphiregulin stimulates epithelial branching in organ cultures of embryonic mouse kidney. These observations suggest a model for WT1 as a transcriptional regulator during kidney differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2050624870,"AKT2 is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in human ovarian and pancreatic cancers. AKT2 is activated by a variety of growth factors and insulin via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). However, its normal cellular role is not well understood. To gain insight into the function of AKT2, we performed yeast two-hybrid system to screen for interacting proteins. Using this technique, we identified a novel interactor, designated APPL, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and a leucine zipper, classes of motifs defined in signaling molecules as functional interaction domains with specific targets. The PH domain of APPL shows similarity to those found in GTPase-activating proteins such as oligophrenin-1 and Graf, whereas its PTB domain exhibits homology with CED-6, an adaptor protein that promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells, and IB1, a transactivator of the GLUT2 gene. APPL is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, ovary and pancreas, tissues in which AKT2 mRNA is abundant. APPL interacts with the inactive form of AKT2; moreover, APPL binds to the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110alpha. These data suggest that APPL is an adaptor that may tether inactive AKT2 to p110alpha in the cytoplasm and thereby may expedite recruitment of AKT2 and p110alpha to the cell membrane upon mitogenic stimulation. Furthermore, the APPL gene was mapped to human chromosome 3p14.3-p21.1, where deletions and other rearrangements have often been reported in a variety of tumor types. The identification of APPL may facilitate further analysis of the physiological and oncogenic activities of AKT2."

https://openalex.org/W2073119991,"Left-right asymmetry is initiated during chick embryogenesis in small domains near Hensen's node. Subsequently, broad asymmetric gene expression domains are established in the lateral plate mesoderm, ultimately determining the directionality of morphogenetic events. The transfer of asymmetric information from the node to the lateral plate is mediated by Caronte (Car), a novel member of the Cerberus/Dan gene family, which induces targets by antagonizing symmetrically expressed BMP signals. In addition, BMP antagonism by Car induces asymmetric expression of Lefty in the midline, preventing spread of left-sided signals to the contralateral side."
https://openalex.org/W1975681855,"TGF-beta is a negative regulator of liver growth. Smad family of genes, as mediators of TGF-beta pathway, are candidate tumor suppressor genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We studied 35 HCC and non-tumour liver tissues for possible mutations in Smad2 and Smad4 genes. Three tumours displayed somatic mutations; two in Smad4 (Asp332Gly and Cys401Arg) and one in Smad2 (Gln407Arg) genes. All three mutations were A:T --> G:C transitions suspected to result from oxidative stress as observed in mitochondrial DNA. These observation demonstrate that TGF-beta pathway is altered in hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2156405291,"The organizer is a unique region in the gastrulating embryo that induces and patterns the body axis. It arises before gastrulation under the influence of the Nieuwkoop center. We show that during gastrulation, cell movements bring cells into and out of the chick organizer, Hensen's node. During these movements, cells acquire and lose organizer properties according to their position. A ""node inducing center,"" which emits Vg1 and Wnt8C, is located in the middle of the primitive streak. Its activity is inhibited by ADMP produced by the node and by BMPs at the periphery. These interactions define the organizer as a position in the embryo, whose cellular makeup is constantly changing, and explain the phenomenon of organizer regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2059591935,"Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant which antagonizes cellular proliferation by inhibiting the function of mTOR. The mTOR:FKBP12: rapamycin complex blocks G1/S transition by inhibiting downstream targets essential for cell cycle progression. One such target is p70S6k1 (S6K1), a serine/threonine kinase which is inactivated by the mTOR : FKBP12 : rapamycin complex, and which has been linked to translational control by virtue of its ability to phosphorylate the ribosomal protein S6. In the current work, we describe cloning and characterization of a novel S6K1 homolog, p54 S6 kinase 2 (p54S6k2/S6K2). Similar to S6K1, S6K2 is activated by mitogens and by constitutively active PI3K, and is inhibited by rapamycin as well as wortmannin. Differences between activation of S6K1 and S6K2 by PDK1 were observed, suggesting potential differences in the regulation of these homologs. Strikingly, S6K2 activity and S6 phosphorylation were both intact in S6K1-/-ES cell, indicating a possible role for S6K2 in in vivo S6 phosphorylation. Interestingly, we found two isoforms of S6K2 which are localized to distinct cellular compartments; the smaller form resides in the detergent-soluble fraction, whereas the larger form is found in the particulate fraction. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a family of rapamycin-sensitive protein kinases potentially involved in S6 phosphorylation, translational control, and transduction of mTOR signals."
https://openalex.org/W2083415337,"Measles virus (MV) infects 40 million persons and kills one million per year primarily by suppressing the immune system and afflicting the central nervous system (CNS). The lack of a suitable small animal model has impeded progress of understanding how MV causes disease and the development of novel therapies and improved vaccines. We tested a transgenic mouse line in which expression of the MV receptor CD46 closely mimicked the location and amount of CD46 found in humans. Virus replicated in and was recovered from these animals' immune systems and was associated with suppression of humoral and cellular immune responses. Infectious virus was recovered from the CNS, replicated primarily in neurons, and spread to distal sites presumably by fast axonal transport. Thus, a small animal model is available for analysis of MV pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997837993,"p73 has been identified as a protein which shares significant homology with the tumor suppressor p53. We found two new types of splicing variant mRNAs for p73 expressed in MCF-7 cells which we named p73γ and ε. Sequence analysis revealed that these mRNAs encode variant p73 proteins bearing distinct carboxy-terminal structures, which are also different from the previously reported variants p73α and β. The mRNAs encoding p73γ and ε as well as α and β were confirmed to be expressed in normal human tissues in varied patterns. All of these splicing variants activated promoter with the p53-binding consensus sequence, but to different degrees. Furthermore, suppressive effects of p73α, γ and ε, but not β, on endogenous p53 activity were observed when transiently expressed in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that the carboxy-terminal regions of p73 which were altered by alternative splicing affect these transactivation abilities and modulate the functions of p73 molecules."

Here we present the 1.9 A crystal structures of glycosylasparaginase precursors that are able to autoproteolyze via an N --> O acyl shift. Several conserved residues are aligned around the scissile peptide bond that is in a highly strained trans peptide bond configuration. The structure illustrates how a nucleophilic side chain may attack the scissile peptide bond at the immediate upstream backbone carbonyl and provides an understanding of the structural basis for peptide bond cleavage via an N --> O or N --> S acyl shift that is used by various groups of intramolecular autoprocessing proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2318683859,"The caspase-mediated cleavage of a limited number of cellular proteins is a common feature of apoptotic cell death. This cleavage usually inhibits the function of the target protein or generates peptides that actively contribute to the death process. In the present study, we demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is cleaved by caspases in human leukemic cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli. We have shown recently that p27Kip1 overexpression delayed leukemic cell death in response to cytotoxic drugs. In transient transfection experiments, the p23 and the p15 N-terminal peptides generated by p27Kip1 proteolysis demonstrate an anti-apoptotic effect similar to that induced by the wild-type protein, whereas cleavage-resistant mutants have lost their protective effect. Moreover, stable transfection of a cleavage-resistant mutant of p27Kip1 sensitizes leukemic cells to drug-induced cell death. Altogether, these results indicate that proteolysis of p27Kip1 triggered by caspases mediates the anti-apoptotic activity of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2331070544,"Activation of the TAL1 (or SCL) gene, originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation, is the most frequent gain-of-function mutation recognized in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The TAL1 proteins contain a basic helix – loop – helix (bHLH) motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that control transcription from an E box target element as heterodimers with the E2A- and HEB-encoded gene products. Gene knockout studies in mice indicate that this transcription factor is required for embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, and considerable evidence suggests it has specific functions in terminal erythroid differentiation. We investigated whether the broadly expressed nuclear protein p300, known to function as a coactivator for other bHLH proteins involved in cellular differentiation, also interacts with TAL1. p300 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Tal1 in extracts from murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells induced to differentiate with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and p300 and Tal1 were observed in a common E box DNA-binding complex in extracts from differentiating MEL cells. p300 also interacted with Tal1 in protein pulldown assays, suggesting this was a direct interaction. Finally, p300 augmented transcription by Tal1 from an E box-containing promoter and by a GAL4-Tal1 fusion from a promoter containing the GAL4 DNA-binding element. Deletion analysis identified the bHLH domain of Tal1 and amino-terminal sequences of p300 as necessary for p300-stimulated transactivation and Tal1-p300 interaction in vitro. These results indicate that recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator p300 can positively regulate TAL1-directed gene expression. The dependence of their interaction in MEL cells on addition of a differentiation inducer suggests, further, that this TAL1-p300 complex may have an important role in terminal erythroid differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2333239350,"One of the most frequent genetic abnormalities associated with non Hodgkin lymphoma is the structural alteration of the 5' non coding/regulatory region of the BCL6 (LAZ3) protooncogene. BCL6 encodes a POZ/Zn finger protein, a structure similar to that of many Drosophila developmental regulators and to another protein involved in a human hematopoietic malignancy, PLZF. BCL6 is a sequence specific transcriptional repressor controlling germinal center formation and T cell dependent immune response. Although the expression of BCL6 negatively correlates with cellular proliferation in different cell types, the influence of BCL6 on cell growth and survival is currently unknown so that the way its deregulation may contribute to cancer remains elusive. To directly address this issue, we used a tetracycline-regulated system in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells and thus found that BCL6 mediates growth suppression associated with impaired S phase progression and apoptosis. Interestingly, overexpressed BCL6 can colocalize with sites of ongoing DNA synthesis, suggesting that it may directly interfere with S phase initiation and/or progression. In contrast, the isolated Zn finger region of BCL6, which binds BCL6 target sequence but lacks transcriptional repression activity, slows, but does not suppress, U2OS cell growth, is less efficient at delaying S phase progression, and does not trigger apoptosis. Thus, for a large part, the effects of BCL6 overexpression on cell growth and survival depend on its ability to engage protein/protein interactions with itself and/or its transcriptional corepressors. That BCL6 restricts cell growth suggests that its deregulation upon structural alterations may alleviate negative controls on the cell cycle and cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W1991066174,"Given the high frequency of ras oncogene activation in several common human cancers, its signal pathways are an important target for novel therapy. For practical reasons, however, these have been studied mainly in the context of transformation of established fibroblast cell lines, whereas ras acts at an earlier stage in human tumorigenesis and predominantly on epithelial cells. Here we have developed a more directly relevant model - human primary thyroid epithelial cells - which are a major target of naturally-occurring Ras mutation, and in which expression of mutant Ras in culture induces clonal expansion without morphological transformation, closely reproducing the phenotype of the corresponding tumour in vivo. Transient or stable expression of mutant H-ras (by scrapeloading or retroviral infection) at levels which stimulated proliferation induced sustained activation and translocation of MAP kinase (MAPK) in these cells. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway at the level of MAPKK, by expression of a dominant-negative mutant or by the pharmacological inhibitor PD98059, efficiently blocked the proliferative response. Conversely, selective activation of MAPK by a constitutively-active MAPKK1 mutant failed to mimic the action of Ras and, although this was achievable with activated Raf, micro-injection of anti-ras antibodies showed that this still required endogenous wild-type Ras function. In contrast to recent results obtained with a rodent thyroid cell line (WRT), therefore, activation of the MAPK pathway is necessary, but not sufficient, for the proliferogenic action of mutant Ras on primary human thyroid cells. These data emphasize the unreliability of extrapolation from cell lines and establish the feasibility of using a more representative human epithelial model for Ras signalling studies."
https://openalex.org/W2322931082,"E2F-1, a transcription factor implicated in the activation of genes required for S phase such as DNA pol alpha, is regulated by interactions with Rb and by cell-cycle dependent alterations in E2F-1 abundance. We have shown that depletion of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by antisense RNA expression downregulates pol alpha and E2F-1 expression during early S phase. To examine the role of PARP in the regulation of pol alpha and E2F-1 gene expression, we utilized immortalized mouse fibroblasts derived from wild-type and PARP knockout (PARP-/-) mice as well as PARP-/- cells stably transfected with PARP cDNA [PARP-/-(+PARP)]. After release from serum deprivation, wild-type and PARP-/-(+PARP) cells, but not PARP-/- cells, exhibited a peak of cells in S phase by 16 h and had progressed through the cell cycle by 22 h. Whereas [3H]thymidine incorporation remained negligible in PARP-/- cells, in vivo DNA replication maximized after 18 h in wild-type and PARP-/-(+PARP) cells. To investigate the effect of PARP on E2F-1 promoter activity, a construct containing the E2F-1 gene promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene was transiently transfected into these cells. E2F-1 promoter activity in control and PARP-/-(+PARP) cells increased eightfold after 9 h, but not in PARP-/- cells. PARP-/- cells did not show the marked induction of E2F-1 expression during early S phase apparent in control and PARP-/-(+PARP) cells. RT - PCR analysis and pol alpha activity assays revealed the presence of pol alpha transcripts and a sixfold increase in activity in both wild-type and PARP-/-(+PARP) cells after 20 h, but not in PARP-/- cells. These results suggest that PARP plays a role in the induction of E2F-1 promoter activity, which then positively regulates both E2F-1 and pol alpha expression, when quiescent cells reenter the cell cycle upon recovery from aphidicolin exposure or removal of serum."

https://openalex.org/W2316979170,"Oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes control the balance between apoptotic death and anti-apoptotic survival signals determining whether a cell proliferates or dies. Through which effectors might oncoproteins generate sensitivity to apoptosis remains to be determined. Ras GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP) is a key element in the Ras signalling pathway, being both a negative regulator and possibly an effector of Ras. Ras-GAP acts as a regulator of transcription, and possibly connects Ras to stress-activated protein kinases. A role for Ras-GAP in cell survival has been suspected from the study of knock-out mouse embryos. In search for selective killing of tumour cells, we asked whether Ras-GAP inhibition by other means would lead to apoptosis in established cell lines. We injected a monoclonal antibody directed against the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP (mAb200) that has been shown to block Ras-GAP downstream signalling into various human normal and tumour cell lines. We show that inhibition of Ras-GAP induces apoptosis specifically in tumour, but not in normal cells, therefore pointing at a specific role for Ras-GAP in tumour cell survival. MAb200-induced apoptosis is largely prevented by coinjection of activated RhoA or Cdc42 proteins, by injection of a constitutively activated mutant of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3-K), but not by injection of v-Raf. These results show that targeting of Ras-GAP could represent a novel anticancer approach."
https://openalex.org/W2330004714,"The t(1;19) translocation of pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) produces E2a-Pbx1, a chimeric oncoprotein containing the transactivation domains of E2a joined to the homeodomain protein, Pbx1. E2a-Pbx1 causes T cell and myeloid leukemia in mice, blocks differentiation of cultured myeloid progenitors, and transforms fibroblasts through a mechanism accompanied by aberrant expression of tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated genes. Here we investigate whether aberrant gene expression also occurs specifically in the t(1;19)-containing subset of pre-B cell ALL in man. Two new genes, EB-1 and EB-2, as well as Caldesmon were transcriptionally activated in each of seven t(1;19) cell lines. EB-1 expression was extremely low in marrow from patients having pre-B ALL not associated with the t(1;19), and elevated more than 100-fold in marrow from patients with pre-B ALL associated with the t(1;19). Normal EB-1 expression was strong in brain and testis, the same tissues exhibiting the highest levels of PBX1 expression. EB-1 encodes a signaling protein containing a phosphotyrosine binding domain homologous to that of dNumb developmental regulators and two SAM domains homologous to those in the C-terminal tail of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. We conclude that aberrant expression of tissue-specific genes is a characteristic of t(1;19) pre-B ALL, as was previously found in fibroblasts transformed by E2a-Pbx1. Potentially, EB-1 overexpression could interfere with normal signaling controlling proliferation or differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2123009275,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase Epsilon (PTPε) gene gives rise to two physiologically-distinct protein products – a transmembranal, receptor-like form and a cytoplasmic, non-receptor form. Previous studies have suggested a link between expression of transmembranal PTPε and transformation of mouse mammary epithelium specifically by ras or neu, although little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms; cytoplasmic PTPε is believed to function mainly in hematopoietic tissues. As part of our efforts to understand PTPε function at the molecular level, we demonstrate here that both forms of PTPε associate with the adaptor molecule Grb2 in vivo. Binding is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb2; this domain binds exclusively to the carboxy-terminal phosphotyrosine of cytoplasmic PTPε(Y638), and probably to additional phosphotyrosine residues in transmembranal PTPε. Through its SH2 domain, Grb2 can constitutively associate with transmembranal PTPε in mammary tumors initiated by ras or neu, and can be induced to associate with cytoplasmic PTPε in Jurkat T-cells following stimulation of T-cell receptor signaling by pervanadate. These findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPε and subsequent binding to Grb may link this phosphatase to downstream events which transduce signals from the cell membrane to its interior."
https://openalex.org/W2333107910,"Mutations of the RET gene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, have been associated with the inherited cancer syndromes MEN 2A and MEN 2B. They have also further been associated with both familial and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas. Missense mutations affecting cysteine residues within the extracellular domain of the receptor causes constitutive tyrosine kinase activation through the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers. We have recently reported that a somatic 6 bp in-frame deletion, originally coding for Glu632-Leu633, potently activates the RET gene. This activation is increased with respect to the frequent MEN 2A-associated missense mutation Cys634Arg. This finding specifically correlated to the clinic behavior of the corresponding tumor, which was characterized by an unusually aggressive progression with both multiple and recurrent metastases. By examining the possibility that this deletion acts in a manner similar to cysteine substitution, we have analysed the molecular mechanism by which this oncogenic activation occurs. Phosphorylated dimers of the deleted Ret receptor were detected in immunoprecipitates separated under non-reducing conditions. Like other Cys point mutations, this 6 bp deletion affecting two amino acid residues between two adjacent Cys, is capable of activating the transforming ability of Ret by promoting receptor dimerization. These results suggest that alteration to cysteine residue position or pairing is capable of inducing ligand independent dimerization. Furthermore, we present data demonstrating that the processing and sorting of the Ret membrane receptor to the cell surface is affected by mutation type."
https://openalex.org/W2321121782,"We have previously reported that the drs gene, whose mRNA expression is downregulated by retroviral oncogenes such as v-src and v-K-ras, has the ability to suppress transformation by v-src in a rat cell line F2408. We have now isolated a human homolog of this gene (h-drs) and found that the expression of h-drs mRNA is markedly downregulated in a variety of human cancer cell lines including those of the colon, bladder, and ovary. To investigate the function of the drs gene as a tumor suppressor in human cancer cells, we constructed recombinant amphotropic retrovirus containing the drs gene, introduced this virus into human cancer cell lines whose drs expression was downregulated and found that drs has the ability to suppress anchorage-independent growth of these cells without disturbing cell proliferation. Analyses with deletion mutants of the drs gene revealed that both the C-terminal region inside the transmembrane domain and three consensus repeats in the N-terminal region are essential for the suppression of anchorage-independent growth of the cells. We also found that the G1-S progression of the cell cycle and expression of cyclin A mRNA were significantly suppressed in T24 cells expressing the drs gene under non-adhesion culture conditions. In contrast, the expression of cyclin D and E and the phosphorylation of Rb protein were not affected by ectopic expression of the drs gene, suggesting that an Rb-independent downregulation of cyclin A is involved in the suppression of anchorage-independent growth by means of the drs gene."

https://openalex.org/W2321744340,"We have previously shown that the adenovirus E1A oncogene can reactivate the cell cycle in terminally differentiated cells. Current models imply that much or all of this E1A activity is mediated by the release of the E2F transcription factors from pocket-protein control. In contrast, we show here that overexpression of E2F-1, E2F-2 and E2F-4, or a chimeric E2F-4 tethered to a nuclear localization signal cannot reactivate postmitotic skeletal muscle cells (myotubes). This is not due to lack of transcriptional activity, as demonstrated on both a reporter construct and a number of endogenous target genes. Although cyclin E was strongly overexpressed in E2F-transduced myotubes, it lacked associated kinase activity, possibly explaining the inability of the myotubes to enter S phase and accumulate cyclin A. Although E2F is not sufficient to trigger DNA synthesis in myotubes, its activity is necessary even in the presence of E1A, as dominant-negative DP-1 mutants inhibit E1A-mediated cell cycle reentry. Our data show that, to reactivate myotubes, E1A must exert other functions, in addition to releasing E2F. They also establish mouse myotubes as an experimental system uniquely suited to study the most direct E2F functions in the absence of downstream cell cycle effects."

Signal transduction via wild type Met has been shown to require the autophosphorylation of two tyrosine doublets; Y8,9 which functions to enhance enzymatic activity, and Y14,15 which provides docking sites for signaling molecules, and in the present investigation we examine the importance of these residues for signaling via mutationally activated Met. We find that activating mutations introduced into a membrane-spanning Met receptor circumvent the normally stringent requirement for Y8,9 phosphorylation, and do so in a largely ligand-dependent fashion. Similarly, activating mutations introduced into a constitutively dimerized cytoplasmic form of Met (i.e. Tpr-Met) facilitate its autophosphorylation and oncogenic activity in the absence of Y8,9 phosphorylation. We also find that activating mutations allow a membrane-spanning Met receptor to overcome the requirement for the Y14,15 phosphorylation in a manner which is largely ligand-independent. These findings support a model whereby activating mutations stabilize an active conformation of the Met kinase via a mechanism which can function independently of Y8,9 autophosphorylation and suggest that signaling via wild type Met and mutationally activated Met may proceed through distinct pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2317910127,"Induction of apoptosis by adenovirus E1A in rodent cells is stimulated by wild type (wt) p53 but completely suppressed by mutated p53. The suppression is overcome by coexpression with Id proteins (Ids). The cells expressing E1A and Ids undergo apoptosis after accumulation in S phase, suggesting that S phase events are perturbed by E1A and Ids. The E1A domains required for induction of apoptosis, analysed by transfection with expression vectors for E1A, Ids and their mutants, followed by flow cytometry, reside in N-terminal (positions 17 - 38), CR1 and CR2 regions. Interaction of E1A with Ids requires the N-terminal and CR1 regions. The cyclin D1 promoter activity in S phase was reduced severely by E1A and this reduction is caused through CR1 and CR2 regions required for interaction with pRB. Analysis of DNA synthesis in G2/M arrested cells indicated that E1A is capable of inducing >4 N cells and this E1A-mediated DNA rereplication is enhanced by coexpression with Id-1H. The E1A domains required for induction of DNA rereplication coincide with those required for apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2057250507,"The cDNA of porcine p53 was cloned and sequenced by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT – PCR) approach with primers based on regions of homology between all known p53 sequences. The p53 cDNA was found to be 87% conserved to human p53 and 86% conserved to bovine p53 at the nucleotide level. The porcine p53 sequence was inserted into an expression vector and recombinant protein expressed in vitro. An approximately 50 kDa protein was detected by Western blotting using both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies. The sequence data of porcine p53 and the ability to detect expressed protein with various anti-p53 antibodies will allow the p53 status of the pig population, and the role of p53 in porcine tumours, to be assessed. An understanding of tumour development in the pig may be important if pig cells, tissues or organs are to be used in the treatment of humans."
