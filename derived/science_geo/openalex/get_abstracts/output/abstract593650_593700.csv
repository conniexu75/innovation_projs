https://openalex.org/W2749219443,"The least understood aspects of the nutritional needs of bees are the elemental composition of pollen and the bees' need for a stoichiometrically balanced diet containing the required proportions of nutrients. Reduced plant diversity has been proposed as an indirect factor responsible for the pollinator crisis. We suggest stoichiometric mismatch resulting from a nutritionally unbalanced diet as a potential direct factor. The concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, S, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu were studied in the bodies of honeybees of various castes and sexes and in the nectar and pollen of various plant species. A literature review of the elemental composition of pollen was performed. We identified possible co-limitations of bee growth and development resulting mainly from the scarcity of Na, S, Cu, P and K, and possibly Zn and N, in pollen. Particular castes and sexes face specific limitations. Concentrations of potentially limiting elements in pollen revealed high taxonomic diversity. High floral diversity may be necessary to maintain populations of pollen eaters. Single-species crop plantations, even if these species are rich in nectar and pollen, might limit bee growth and development, not allowing for gathering nutrients in adequate proportions. However, particular plant species may play greater roles than others in balancing honeybee diets. Therefore, we suggest specific plant species that may (1) ensure optimal growth and production of individuals by producing pollen that is exceptionally well balanced stoichiometrically (e.g., clover) or (2) prevent growth and development of honeybees by producing pollen that is extremely unbalanced for bees (e.g., sunflower). Since pollen is generally poor in Na, this element must be supplemented using ""dirty water"". Nectar cannot supplement the diet with limiting elements. Stoichiometric mismatch should be considered in intervention strategies aimed at improving the nutritional base for bees."
https://openalex.org/W2747189335,"Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported as a marker for chronic inflammation, associated with poor prognosis in ischemic stroke patients, but there has been no study that investigated its association with ischemic stroke risk. This study was conducted to investigate elevated NLR as an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke incidence. Our retrospective cohort study included 24,708 generally healthy subjects aged 30-75 who received self-referred health screening at Seoul National University Hospital. Data on ischemic stroke incidence was retrieved from national medical claims registry. Median follow-up time was 5.9 years (interquartile range 4.2 years). Adjusted for major cardiovascular risk factors, compared to subjects with NLR<1.5, subjects with 2.5≤NLR<3.0, 3.0≤NLR<3.5, and NLR≥3.5 had elevated risk for ischemic stroke incidence with aHR (95% CI) of 1.76 (1.09-2.84), 2.21 (1.21-4.04), and 2.96 (1.57-5.58), respectively. NLR showed significant improvement in discrimination for ischemic stroke incidence compared to traditional cardiovascular risk factors (C-index 0.748 vs. 0.739, P = 0.025). There was significant net improvement in reclassification in Framingham risk for ischemic stroke incidence after addition of NLR, with IDI 0.0035 (P<0.0001), and NRI 6.02% (P = 0.0015). This reclassification for ischemic stroke incidence by NLR was markedly pronounced among subjects with atrial fibrillation with CHA2DS2-VASc<2 (NRI 42.41%, P = 0.056). Our study suggests elevated NLR to be an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke incidence in generally healthy adults. Future studies are needed to validate our results and further assess how subjects with elevated NLR should be managed within current guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2748449146,"Background Haemodialysis (HD) patients are predisposed to dysregulated fluid balance leading to extracellular water (ECW) expansion. Fluid overload has been closely linked with outcome in these patients. This has mainly been attributed to cardiac volume overload, but the relation between abnormalities in fluid status with micro- and macrovascular dysfunction has not been studied in detail. We studied the interaction of macro- and microvascular factors in states of normal and over- hydration in HD-dependent CKD. Methods Fluid compartments [total body water (TBW) and ECW] and overhydration index (OH) were measured with Multifrequency bio-impedance (BCM). Overhydration was defined as OH/ECW>7%. Overhydration was also assessed using the ECW/TBW ratio. Macrocirculation was assessed by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements while microcirculation through sublingual capillaroscopy assessment of the Perfused Boundary Region of the endothelial glycocalyx (PBR 5-25mcg). A panel of pro-inflammatory and vascular serum biomarkers and growth factors was analysed. Results Of 72 HD participants, 30 were in normohydration (N) range and 42 overhydrated according to the OH/ECW ratio. Average ECW/TBW was 0.48±0.03. Overhydrated patients had higher MAP (122.9±22.5 v 111.7±22.2mmHg, p = 0.04) and comorbidities (median Davies score 1.5 v 1.0, p = 0.03). PWV (p = 0.25) and PBR 5-25mcg (p = 0.97) did not differ between the 2 groups. However, Vascular Adhesion Molecule (VCAM)-1, Interleukin-6 and Thrombomodulin, and reduced Leptin were observed in the overhydrated group. Elevation in VCAM-1 levels (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06; p = 0.02) showed a strong independent association with OH/ECW>7% in an adjusted logistic regression analysis and exhibited a strong linear relationship with ECW/TBW (Bata = 0.210, p = 0.03) in an also adjusted model. Conclusion Extracellular fluid overload is significantly linked to microinflammation and markers of endothelial dysfunction. The study provides novel insight in the cardiovascular risk profile associated with overhydration in uraemia."
https://openalex.org/W2750203168,"Functional response describes the number of prey or hosts attacked by a predator or parasitoid as a function of prey or host density. Using three different experimental designs, we found a linear functional response by two insect parasitoids (the pteromalid Pachycrepoideus vindemiae and the diapriid Trichopria drosophilae) to their hosts (the drosophilids Drosophila suzukii and D. melanogaster). A linear function response is considered unusual for insect parasitoids. The first design was a 'fixed time within patch experiment' where individual parasitoids were exposed to a range of host densities for 24 h; the second two designs were a 'variable time functional response' and a 'selective functional response' experiments where individual parasitoids were presented with a range of host patches and allowed to freely select and explore only one patch (variable time) or forage for 24 h (selective). In all experimental designs, the number of hosts parasitized increased linearly until reaching an upper limit. Under the laboratory conditions used, the functional response of P. vindemiae was limited by its egg supply and time (host handling time) whereas T. drosophilae was limited by time only. The linear functional response by both parasitoids likely resulted from a constant attack rate and an incremental foraging strategy where the parasitoids left a poor (low density) host patch or remained in a higher quality host patch when there was successful oviposition and adequate host density."

However, how pyruvate controls the transcriptional responses underlying the metabolic switch from fermentation to respiration is unknown. Here, we report that this pyruvate effect involves heme.

https://openalex.org/W2749044103,"West Nile Virus (WNV) first arrived in Ontario, Canada in 2001 and has since spread throughout most of the province, causing disease in humans. The provincial government established a province-wide surveillance program to monitor WNV transmission throughout the 36 regional health units. Here we have acquired records of WNV human and mosquito surveillance from 2002 to 2013 to describe seasonal and geographic trends in WNV activity in southern Ontario. Additionally, we obtained climate data from seven municipalities to investigate how temperature and precipitation affect WNV transmission dynamics. We identified a strong quadratic relationship between the number of confirmed human cases and positive Culex mosquito pools recorded at the end of each year (R2 = 0.9783, p < 0.001). Using Spearman rank correlation tests, we identified that the minimum infection rate of Culex pipiens/restuans pools are the strongest predictor of human cases at a 1 week lag period. We also identified positive correlations between minimum infection rates, temperature, vector abundance, and cumulative precipitation. Global Moran’s I index indicates strong positive autocorrelation and clustering of positive Culex pool counts in southern Ontario. Local indicators of spatial association tests revealed a total of 44 high-high and 1 high-low trap locations (n = 680). In the current work we have identified when and where hot spots of WNV activity have occurred in southern Ontario. The municipalities surrounding the western shore of the Lake Ontario and Windsor-Essex County have the largest records of positive mosquitoes and human cases. We identified that positive mosquitoes are a strong indicator of human cases to follow in the coming weeks. An epidemic action threshold of cumulative positive Culex pools was established, allowing Ontario public health officials to predict an epidemic at epidemiological week 34 (rho = 0.90, p < 0.001). These data have the potential to contribute to more efficient larvicide programs and awareness campaigns for the public."
https://openalex.org/W2748378500,"5-Oxoproline (OP) is well-known as an enzymatic intermediate in the eukaryotic γ-glutamyl cycle, but it is also an unavoidable damage product formed spontaneously from glutamine and other sources. Eukaryotes metabolize OP via an ATP-dependent 5-oxoprolinase; most prokaryotes lack homologs of this enzyme (and the γ-glutamyl cycle) but are predicted to have some way to dispose of OP if its spontaneous formation in vivo is significant. Comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomes showed that the gene encoding pyroglutamyl peptidase, which removes N-terminal OP residues, clusters in diverse genomes with genes specifying homologs of a fungal lactamase (renamed prokaryotic 5-oxoprolinase A, pxpA) and homologs of allophanate hydrolase subunits (renamed pxpB and pxpC). Inactivation of Bacillus subtilis pxpA, pxpB, or pxpC genes slowed growth, caused OP accumulation in cells and medium, and prevented use of OP as a nitrogen source. Assays of cell lysates showed that ATP-dependent 5-oxoprolinase activity disappeared when pxpA, pxpB, or pxpC was inactivated. 5-Oxoprolinase activity could be reconstituted in vitro by mixing recombinant B. subtilis PxpA, PxpB, and PxpC proteins. In addition, overexpressing Escherichia coli pxpABC genes in E. coli increased 5-oxoprolinase activity in lysates ≥1700-fold. This work shows that OP is a major universal metabolite damage product and that OP disposal systems are common in all domains of life. Furthermore, it illustrates how easily metabolite damage and damage-control systems can be overlooked, even for central metabolites in model organisms. 5-Oxoproline (OP) is well-known as an enzymatic intermediate in the eukaryotic γ-glutamyl cycle, but it is also an unavoidable damage product formed spontaneously from glutamine and other sources.

OP is a familiar intermediate in the mammalian γ-glutamyl cycle (Fig. 1A), which involves synthesis and breakdown of glutathione and has a proposed role in amino acid transport (1Orlowski M.

In this cycle the glutamyl moiety of glutathione is enzymatically converted to OP, which is then hydrolyzed to glutamate by an ATP-dependent 5-oxoprolinase (EC 3.5.2.9; henceforth, eukaryote-type OPase) (2Griffith O.W.

The γ-glutamyl cycle has been most studied in mammals, but similar pathways (and eukaryote-type OPase) occur in plants (4Paulose B. Chhikara S. Coomey J. Jung H.I. Vatamaniuk O. Dhankher O.P.

This cycle is largely absent from prokaryotes; a few bacteria have homologs of its enzymes and probably have a γ-glutamyl cycle-like pathway to metabolize glutathione (7Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K.

Other, less widely recognized routes to OP are nonenzymatic and are present in all organisms. OP is formed via the spontaneous cyclization of the central metabolites glutamine (9Tritsch G.L. Moore G.E. Spontaneous decomposition of glutamine in cell culture media.Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 28: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), glutamate (10Park C.B. Lee S.B.

Partial reactions catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and evidence for an activated glutamate intermediate.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7095-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine is particularly susceptible; under physiological conditions it cyclizes to OP at the rate of 10% per day (9Tritsch G.L. Moore G.E. Spontaneous decomposition of glutamine in cell culture media.Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 28: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). N-terminal glutaminyl and glutamyl residues of polypeptides can likewise spontaneously cyclize to OP residues; this reaction is also catalyzed by glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (12Schilling S. Wasternack C. Demuth H.U. Glutaminyl cyclases from animals and plants: a case of functionally convergent protein evolution.Biol.

Before this study the only characterized and cloned OPase besides the eukaryote-type one was an enigmatic ATP-independent enzyme from Alcaligenes faecalis (20Nishimura A. Ozaki Y. Oyama H. Shin T.

Although the A. faecalis enzyme has OPase activity in vitro, the equilibrium of the ring-opening reaction that it catalyzes favors OP formation so strongly (Keq = [glutamate]/[OP] = 0.035) (20Nishimura A. Ozaki Y. Oyama H. Shin T. Murao S. Purification and characterization of a novel 5-oxoprolinase (without ATP-hydrolyzing activity) from Alcaligenes faecalis N-38A.Appl. Environ.

The eukaryote-type OPase overcomes the thermodynamic constraint on the ring-opening reaction by coupling it to ATP hydrolysis (2Griffith O.W. Bridges R.J. Meister A.

Because prokaryotes are doomed to form OP whether or not they have a γ-glutamyl cycle and OP is harmful, we hypothesized that prokaryotes without a eukaryote-type OPase have a different disposal system for OP, most likely a second type of OPase. In advancing this hypothesis, we were encouraged by a series of classical papers (22Van der Werf P. Meister A. Isolation of 5-oxoprolinase from a prokaryote.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This enzyme, which was never cloned, appears to have been unlike eukaryote-type OPases. We used comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomes to predict that a conserved cluster of three genes encodes a novel OPase, and we validated this prediction by genetic and biochemical methods. This prokaryotic OPase is almost surely the one adumbrated in the classical work on P. putida. We first used the SEED database and its tools (26Overbeek R. Begley T. Butler R.M. Choudhuri J.V.

Gerdes S. Hodge-Hanson K. Zhukov A. Cooper A.J. ElBadawi-Sidhu M. Fiehn O. Downs D.M. Hanson A.D. Genomic and experimental evidence for multiple metabolic functions in the RidA/YjgF/YER057c/UK114 (Rid) protein family.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16: 382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Of these genomes, only 115 have eukaryote-type OPase homologs (encoded by hyuA and hyuB genes that are almost always fused), and only 10 have homologs of the A. faecalis ATP-independent OPase. Both the known types of OPase are thus quite rare in bacteria and archaea. Among the 984 genomes surveyed, 220 encode at least one OP-producing enzyme (e.g. pyroglutamyl peptidase; Fig. 1A), and of these 220, only 16 have eukaryote-type OPase homologs. Because gene clustering on the chromosome often reflects functional relationships (28Hanson A.D. Pribat A. Waller J.C. de Crécy-Lagard V. “Unknown” proteins and “orphan” enzymes: the missing half of the engineering parts list and how to find it.Biochem. J. 2009; 425: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we searched for genes that cluster with genes encoding enzymes that produce OP (Fig. 1A). Three previously uncharacterized genes were found to cluster consistently with the pcp pyroglutamyl peptidase gene in diverse bacteria (Fig. 1B). These genes specify homologs of the fungal lactamase LamB (e.g. B. subtilis ycsF, here renamed prokaryotic 5-oxoprolinase A (pxpA)) and homologs of allophanate hydrolase subunits 1 and 2 (e.g. B. subtilis ycsJ and ycsK, renamed pxpB and pxpC). The pxpABC genes cluster with each other in various arrangements, pxpB and pxbC being sometimes fused (Fig. 1B). The pxpABC genes almost always co-occur; in the 374 genomes that contain at least one gene of the trio, 364 have all three. The pxpABC and eukaryote-type OPase genes are basically inversely distributed and seldom occur together (Fig. 1C), which fits with their having redundant functions. To summarize: clustering of pxpABC with pcp and the inverse distribution with eukaryote-type OPase suggest that the gene trio encodes a novel OPase. In addition, the P. putida OPase was reported to have three distinct protein subunits (23Seddon A.P. Li L.Y. Meister A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the P. putida genome includes pxpABC genes (Fig. 1C). The pxpABC and pcp genes also cluster with genes specifying (i) a putative metal transporter of the NRAMP family, YcsG in B. subtilis, (ii) a putative metal chaperone, YcsI in B. subtilis, and (iii) uncharacterized membrane proteins DUF969 and DUF979 (Fig. 1B). The same four genes also cluster with eukaryote-type OPase genes (supplemental Fig. S1), implying a role in OP metabolism. To assess whether pxpABC genes encode an OPase, we tested the effect of ablating these genes on the ability of B. subtilis to use OP as sole nitrogen source. Wild-type B. subtilis (but not Escherichia coli) can grow on defined medium containing 50 mmOP as the sole nitrogen source (29Bochner B.R. Gadzinski P. Panomitros E. Phenotype microarrays for high-throughput phenotypic testing and assay of gene function.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) but grows more slowly than on ammonium (Fig. 2, A and B). We obtained BKE deletants (30Koo B.M. Kritikos G. Farelli J.D. Todor H. Tong K. Kimsey H. Wapinski I. Galardini M. Cabal A. Peters J.M. Hachmann A.B. Rudner D.Z. Allen K.N. Typas A. Gross C.A. Construction and analysis of two genome-scale deletion libraries for Bacillus subtilis.Cell Syst. 2017; 4: 291-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) for each of the pxpABC genes; the deletions were designed to create single-gene knockouts without affecting the expression of neighboring genes in the same operon. The pxpA, pxpB, and pxpC deletants all failed to grow on OP (Fig. 2, A and B). Because B. subtilis pxpABC genes are in an operon with the putative metal transporter ycsG and the putative metal chaperone ycsI (Fig. 1B), which may both relate to OP metabolism (see above), we also tested BKE deletants of these genes. The ycsI deletant grew slightly more slowly than wild type on OP; the ycsG deletant did not grow at all (Fig. 2, A and B). We verified that the BKE deletions do not affect neighboring gene expression by transforming each deletant with plasmid pHCMC04 harboring the coding sequence of the respective deleted gene. In all cases, reintroducing the deleted gene restored the ability to grow on OP (Fig. 2B). We also tested the growth of pxp deletants on minimal medium with ammonium as nitrogen source. The pxpA, pxpB, and pxpC deletants all grew less well than wild type on plates (Fig. 2B) or in liquid medium (supplemental Fig. S2). The pxp genes thus affect fitness even when OP is not supplied. Because OP formation in vivo is inevitable, knocking out the pxpABC genes is expected to cause OP accumulation if these genes indeed encode an OPase. When grown with ammonium as the nitrogen source, OP was readily detected in B. subtilis pxpA, pxpB, and pxpC deletant cells and medium, with the majority of OP accumulating in the medium (Fig. 3A). No OP was detectable in the cells or medium of wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the pxpABC genes specify OPase activity, we used a radiometric assay (2Griffith O.W. Bridges R.J. Meister A. Evidence that the γ-glutamyl cycle functions in vivo using intracellular glutathione: effects of amino acids and selective inhibition of enzymes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 5405-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to measure OPase activity in cell lysates. Lysates prepared from wild-type B. subtilis cells grown with ammonium as nitrogen source contained readily detectable ATP-dependent OPase activity, but lysates prepared from pxpA, pxpB, or pxpC deletant cells did not (Fig. 3B), indicating that each of these genes is essential for the activity, and therefore, that the enzyme has three different subunits. When OP replaced ammonium as the nitrogen source, the OPase activity of wild-type cells increased 16-fold (Fig. 3B). The apparent Km for OP was determined as 39 ± 6 μm. Deleting the putative metal transporter gene ycsG or the putative metal chaperone gene ycsI did not significantly lower OPase activity (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that neither of these genes is required for OPase activity. To show that the pxpABC genes encode the subunits of an oligomeric OPase, we measured the OPase activity of recombinant proteins. The pxpB and pxpC genes are sometimes fused (Fig. 1, B and C), and the structure of the PxpBC fusion protein of Thermus thermophilus (PDB code 3ORE) suggests that unfused PxpB and PxpC could interact closely (31Jacques D.A. Langley D.B. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Trewhella J. Guss J.M. The structure of TTHA0988 from Thermus thermophilus, a KipI-KipA homologue incorrectly annotated as an allophanate hydrolase.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We, therefore, cloned the B. subtilis pxpBC genomic region into pET28B as a unit. pxpBC was cloned so that either PxpB contained an N-terminal His tag and PxpC was untagged, or PxpB was untagged, and PxpC had a C-terminal His-tag. pxpA was cloned into pET28b with either an N- or C-terminal His tag. The proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 4A). Untagged PxpC co-purified with N-terminally His-tagged PxpB and untagged PxpB co-purified with C-terminally His-tagged PxpC in roughly equal amounts (Fig. 4A), confirming that these two proteins interact strongly. Neither PxpA nor PxpBC alone had detectable OPase activity, but when they were combined in equimolar amounts ATP-dependent OPase activity was observed (Fig. 4A). As this activity was highly unstable (supplemental Fig. S3), kinetic constants could not be determined. To show that pxpABC genes from other bacteria also encode OPase, we tested the genes from E. coli, a Gram-negative bacterium that is taxonomically distant from the Gram-positive B. subtilis. The E. coli pxpBCA genomic region was cloned into pET28b and expressed in E. coli. OPase activity was readily detected in pxpBCA-expressing cell lysates but not in empty-vector control lysates (Fig. 4B). The apparent Km for OP was estimated as 32 ± 3 μm for the E. coli enzyme. Deleting pxpA, pxpB, or pxpC in E. coli slowed growth on minimal medium with ammonium as nitrogen source (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that, as for B. subtilis, these genes affect fitness in the absence of exogenous OP. Our results provide several lines of evidence that a conserved cluster of three hitherto uncharacterized but widely distributed prokaryotic genes jointly encode a novel ATP-dependent OPase. To recapitulate: (i) these three genes cluster with genes involved in OP metabolism, show an inverse distribution pattern with eukaryotic-type OPase genes, and are induced by OP; (ii) B. subtilis knockouts cannot use OP as nitrogen source, accumulate OP when grown on ammonium as nitrogen source, and lack detectable OPase activity; (iii) recombinant B. subtilis and E. coli enzymes have OPase activity. This evidence led us to name these genes prokaryotic 5-oxoprolinase pxpA, pxpB, and pxpC. These genes almost certainly encode the 3-subunit ATP-dependent OPase that was reported from P. putida more than 30 years ago (22Van der Werf P. Meister A.

Ever since the discovery of the eukaryote-type OPase in the context of the γ-glutamyl cycle, participation in this cycle has generally been held to be the physiological role of OPases (32Mazelis M.

Gigot D. Penninckx M.J. Pathways of glutathione degradation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 703-707Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our results challenge this assumption; pxpA, B, or C knockouts in B. subtilis, which has no glutathione or γ-glutamyl cycle, accumulate OP intracellularly to a concentration of 2.1 mm (based on a cell volume of 4.6 fl; Ref. 34Yu A.C.

Clearly, in this case at least, OPase has a damage-control role, i.e. it prevents deleterious accumulation of OP of spontaneous chemical origin. That the growth effects of ablating pxpABC in B. subtilis, and also in E. coli (supplemental Fig. S2), are modest conforms to a pattern noted for other microbial damage-control genes (27Niehaus T.D.

Although the eukaryote-type OPase and the prokaryote-type OPase described here catalyze the same reaction, they share no sequence similarity and differ in quaternary structure (one kind of subunit versus three). They, therefore, presumably represent independent evolutionary solutions to the universal problem of OP disposal. Because the eukaryote-type OPase occurs in α-Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria (Fig. 1C), from which the progenitors of mitochondria and plastids, respectively, are thought to have come (38Gray M.W. Lynn Margulis and the endosymbiont hypothesis: 50 years later.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28: 1285-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), this type of OPase could have an ancient prokaryotic origin. As glutamine, glutamate, and γ-glutamyl phosphate as well as peptides with N-terminal glutaminyl and glutamyl residues were almost surely present in the last universal common ancestor (39Ouzounis C.A. Kunin V. Darzentas N. Goldovsky L. A minimal estimate for the gene content of the last universal common ancestor: exobiology from a terrestrial perspective.Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), OP has been forming since the dawn of life and long before the γ-glutamyl cycle arose. The ancestral role of both ATP-dependent OPases was, therefore, most likely damage-control, with the eukaryote-type enzyme being later recru"
https://openalex.org/W2749016829,"Background The recovery of diaphragmatic function is vital for successful extubation from mechanical ventilation. Recent studies have detected diaphragm atrophy in ventilated adults by using ultrasound, but no similar report has been conducted in children. In the current study, we hypothesized that mechanically ventilated children may also develop diaphragm atrophy and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Materials and methods Children who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and were newly intubated for mechanical ventilation were enrolled into this prospective case–control study. Diaphragm ultrasound assessments were performed daily to evaluate diaphragmatic function in the enrolled children until their discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit. Diaphragm thickness and the diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) were measured through these assessments. Results A total of 31 patients were enrolled, and overall, 1389 ultrasound assessments were performed. Immediately after intubation, the initial diaphragm thickness and DTF were measured to be 1.94 ± 0.44 mm and 25.85% ± 3.29%, respectively. In the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation, diaphragm thickness and the DTF decreased substantially and decreased gradually thereafter. After extubation, the DTF was significantly different between the successful and failed extubation groups (P < 0.001), and a DTF value of <17% was associated with extubation failure. Conclusions Diaphragm ultrasound is a noninvasive method for measuring diaphragmatic function in mechanically ventilated children. In this study, significant diaphragm atrophy and a decreased DTF were observed within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. The recovery of diaphragm thickness and the DTF may be a potential predictor of successful extubation from mechanical ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2746358465,"The potential effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) as a conservation tool for large sharks has been questioned due to the limited spatial extent of most MPAs in contrast to the complex life history and high mobility of many sharks. Here we evaluated the movement dynamics of a highly migratory apex predatory shark (tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) at the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). Using data from satellite tracking passive acoustic telemetry, and stereo baited remote underwater video, we estimated residency, activity spaces, site fidelity, distributional abundances and migration patterns from the GMR and in relation to nesting beaches of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), a seasonally abundant and predictable prey source for large tiger sharks. Tiger sharks exhibited a high degree of philopatry, with 93% of the total satellite-tracked time across all individuals occurring within the GMR. Large sharks (> 200 cm TL) concentrated their movements in front of the two most important green sea turtle-nesting beaches in the GMR, visiting them on a daily basis during nocturnal hours. In contrast, small sharks (< 200 cm TL) rarely visited turtle-nesting areas and displayed diurnal presence at a third location where only immature sharks were found. Small and some large individuals remained in the three study areas even outside of the turtle-nesting season. Only two sharks were satellite-tracked outside of the GMR, and following long-distance migrations, both individuals returned to turtle-nesting beaches at the subsequent turtle-nesting season. The spatial patterns of residency and site fidelity of tiger sharks suggest that the presence of a predictable source of prey and suitable habitats might reduce the spatial extent of this large shark that is highly migratory in other parts of its range. This highly philopatric behaviour enhances the potential effectiveness of the GMR for their protection."
https://openalex.org/W2746179065,"Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder of fine-grained pitch processing in music and speech. However, it remains unclear whether amusia is a pitch-specific deficit, or whether it affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly, such as the perception of formant frequency in vowels, apart from pitch. In this study, in order to illuminate the scope of the deficits, we compared the performance of 15 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 15 matched controls on the categorical perception of sound continua in four stimulus contexts: lexical tone, pure tone, vowel, and voice onset time (VOT). Whereas lexical tone, pure tone and vowel continua rely on frequency/spectral processing, the VOT continuum depends on duration/temporal processing. We found that the amusic participants performed similarly to controls in all stimulus contexts in the identification, in terms of the across-category boundary location and boundary width. However, the amusic participants performed systematically worse than controls in discriminating stimuli in those three contexts that depended on frequency/spectral processing (lexical tone, pure tone and vowel), whereas they performed normally when discriminating duration differences (VOT). These findings suggest that the deficit of amusia is probably not pitch specific, but affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly. Furthermore, there appeared to be differences in the impairment of frequency/spectral discrimination in speech and nonspeech contexts. The amusic participants exhibited less benefit in between-category discriminations than controls in speech contexts (lexical tone and vowel), suggesting reduced categorical perception; on the other hand, they performed inferiorly compared to controls across the board regardless of between- and within-category discriminations in nonspeech contexts (pure tone), suggesting impaired general auditory processing. These differences imply that the frequency/spectral-processing deficit might be manifested differentially in speech and nonspeech contexts in amusics-it is manifested as a deficit of higher-level phonological processing in speech sounds, and as a deficit of lower-level auditory processing in nonspeech sounds."

Some countries have established microbiological criteria for non-O157 STEC, thus, the absence of serogroups O26, O45, O103, O104, O111, O121, and O145 in sprouts from the European Union or ground beef and beef trimmings from the United States is mandatory. While in Argentina screening for O26, O103, O111, O145 and O121 in ground beef, ready-to-eat food, sausages and vegetables is mandatory, other countries have zero-tolerance for all STEC in chilled beef. The aim of this study was to provide data on the prevalence of non-O157 STEC isolated from beef processed in eight Argentinean cattle slaughterhouses producing beef for export and local markets, and to know the non-O157 STEC profiles through strain characterization and genotypic analysis. Samples (n = 15,965) from 3,205 beef carcasses, 9,570 cuts and 3,190 trimmings collected between March and September 2014 were processed in pools of five samples each. Pools of samples (n = 3,193) from 641 carcasses, 1,914 cuts and 638 trimming were analyzed for non-O157 STEC isolation according to ISO/CEN 13136:2012. Of these, 37 pools of carcasses (5.8%), 111 pools of cuts (5.8%) and 45 pools of trimmings (7.0%) were positive for non-O157 STEC. STEC strains (n = 200) were isolated from 193 pools of samples. The most prevalent serotypes were O174:H21, O185:H7, O8:H19, O178:H19 and O130:H11, and the most prevalent genotypes were stx2c(vh-b) and stx2a/saa/ehxA. O103:H21 strain was eae-positive and one O178:H19 strain was aggR/aaiC-positive. The prevalence of non-O157 STEC in beef carcasses reported here was low. None of the non-O157 STEC strains isolated corresponded to the non-O157 STEC serotypes and virulence profiles isolated from human cases in Argentina in the same study period. The application of microbiological criteria for each foodstuff should be determined by risk analysis in order to have a stringent monitoring system. Likewise, zero-tolerance intervention measures should be applied in beef, together with GMP and HACCP. Further, collaborative efforts for risk assessment, management and communication are extremely important to improve the safety of foodstuffs."
https://openalex.org/W2745979338,"Introduction Blend sign has been recently described as a novel imaging marker that predicts hematoma expansion. The purpose of our study was to investigate the prognostic value of CT blend sign in patients with ICH. Objectives and methods Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage who underwent baseline CT scan within 6 hours were included. The presence of blend sign on admission nonenhanced CT was independently assessed by two readers. The functional outcome was assessed by using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. Results Blend sign was identified in 40 of 238 (16.8%) patients on admission CT scan. The proportion of patients with a poor functional outcome was significantly higher in patients with blend sign than those without blend sign (75.0% versus 47.5%, P = 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, intraventricular hemorrhage, admission GCS score, baseline hematoma volume and presence of blend sign on baseline CT independently predict poor functional outcome at 90 days. The CT blend sign independently predicts poor outcome in patients with ICH (odds ratio 3.61, 95% confidence interval [1.47–8.89];p = 0.005). Conclusions Early identification of blend sign is useful in prognostic stratification and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for prospective interventional studies."

Using culture-independent DNA-based molecular techniques, the aim of the present study was to characterize, differentiate, and compare the composition of lower airway bacterial microbiome between clinically stable and acutely infected patients with bronchiectasis experiencing exacerbation.Patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis and those experiencing acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis were recruited. All patients underwent bronchoscopy. Paired sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected for microbiological tests. Molecular analysis was performed for BAL samples using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing.The mean age of the 14 recruited patients was 60 years (range 42 to 78 years), and nine (64%) were female. Using quantitative culture and 16S rRNA sequencing, the common organisms identified from 14 BAL samples were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis, and Prevotella. Molecular techniques revealed Prevotella and Veillonella as potentially pathogenic anaerobic species. 16S rRNA gene sequencing yielded similar relative abundances and distributions of taxa in the stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis groups. Alpha diversity with richness, Simpson's and Shannon indices, and beta diversity using principal coordinate analysis revealed no significant differences in lung microbiome between patients with clinically stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis.Culture-based microbiological and molecular-based techniques did not reveal significant differences in the lung microbiome of patients who were clinically stable and those experiencing exacerbated bronchiectasis. Patient-specific microbial communities were dominated by one or several genera, regardless of clinical status. DNA sequencing could identify potentially pathogenic organisms unable to be identified using microbiological methods."
https://openalex.org/W2750150251,"Background Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is the third most common malignant neoplasm affecting Brazilian women. Little is known about the impact of specific HPV genotypes in the prognosis of ICC. We hypothesized that HPV genotype would impact ICC clinical presentation and survival. Methods Women diagnosed with ICC at the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo (ICESP) between May 2008 and June 2012 were included in the study and were followed until December 2015. HPV genotype was detected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples using Onclarity™ system (BD Viper™ LT automated system). Results 292 patients aged 50±14 years were analyzed. HPVDNA was detected in 84% of patients. The HPV genotypes studied were: HPV16 (64%), HPV18 (10%), HPV33-58 (7%), HPV45 (5%), HPV31 (4%) and other high-risk HPV genotypes (11%). HPV genotypes showed different distributions regarding histological type and clinical stage. Patients were followed for 35±21 months. The overall survival at 5 years after diagnosis of cervical cancer was 54%. Age, clinical staging, histological type and multiple HPV genotypes infection detected in the same tumor specimen were associated with poorer overall survival on multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis (p<0.05). No specific HPV genotype affected survival. Conclusion Multiple HPV genotype infection was associated with poorer ICC survival in our study, compared with single genotype infection. HPV genotyping from FFPE tumor tissue using an automated assay such as the Onclarity BD™ assay provides a simpler alternative for routine clinical use. Impact This is the largest study employing an automated HPV genotyping assay using FFPE of ICC. Multiple HPV genotype infection adversely influenced survival."
https://openalex.org/W2749640902,"Several immune-related markers have been implicated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) pathogenesis. The BCC inflammatory infiltrate is dominated by Th2 cytokines, suggesting a specific state of immunosuppression. In contrast, regressing BCC are characterized by a Th1 immune response with IFN-γ promoting a tumor suppressive activity. IL-23/Th17-related cytokines, as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23 and IL-22, play a significant role in cutaneous inflammatory diseases, but their involvement in skin carcinogenesis is controversial and is poorly investigated in BCC. In this study we investigated the expression of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-22 cytokines in BCC at the protein and mRNA level and their modulation during imiquimod (IMQ) treatment or photodynamic therapy (PDT). IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-22 levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative Real Time PCR in 41 histopathologically-proven BCCs (28 superficial and 13 nodular) from 39 patients. All BCC samples were analyzed at baseline and 19 of 41 also during medical treatment (9 with IMQ 5% cream and 10 with MAL-PDT). Association between cytokines expression and clinico-pathological variables was evaluated. Higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-22 were found in BCCs, mainly in the peritumoral infiltrate, compared to normal skin, with the expression being correlated to the severity of the inflammatory infiltrate. IFN-γ production was higher in superficial BCCs compared to nodular BCCs, while IL-17 was increased in nodular BCCs. A significant correlation was found between IFN-γ and IL-17 expression with both cytokines expressed by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. An increase of all cytokines occurred during the inflammatory phase induced by IMQ and at the early time point of PDT treatment, with significant evidence for IFN-γ, IL-23, and IL-22. Our results confirm the role of IFN-γ and support the involvement of IL-23/Th17-related cytokines in BCC pathogenesis and in the inflammatory response during IMQ and MAL-PDT treatments."

This study aimed to evaluate whether spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) in three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum ((visible-infrared (VIS), near-infrared (NIR)), and shortwave-infrared (SWIR)) could be used to track changes in morphophysiological parameters of wheat cultivars exposed to 1.00, 0.75, and 0.50 of the estimated evapotranspiration (ETc). Significant differences were found in the parameters of growth and photosynthetic efficiency, and canopy spectral reflectance among the three cultivars subjected to different irrigation rates. All parameters were highly and significantly correlated with each other particularly under the 0.50 ETc treatment. The VIS/VIS- and NIR/VIS-based indices were sufficient and suitable for assessing the growth and photosynthetic properties of wheat cultivars similar to those indices based on NIR/NIR, SWIR/NIR, or SWIR/SWIR. Almost all tested SRIs proved to assess growth and photosynthetic parameters, including transpiration rate, more efficiently when regressions were analyzed for each water irrigation rate individually. This study, the type of which has rarely been conducted in irrigated arid regions, indicates that spectral reflectance data can be used as a rapid and non-destructive alternative method for assessment of the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of wheat under a range of water irrigation rates."
https://openalex.org/W2746326653,"Over the past years, targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have led to an increase in progression-free survival and response rate for a subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring specific gene abnormalities compared with chemotherapy. However long-lasting tumor regression is rarely achieved, due to the development of resistant tumoral subclones, which requires alternative therapeutic approaches. Molecular profile at progressive disease is a challenge for making adaptive treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to monitor EGFR-mutant tumors over time based on the quantity of mutant DNA circulating in plasma (ctDNA), comparing two different methods, Crystal™ Digital™ PCR and Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS). In plasma circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) of 61 advanced NSCLC patients we found an overall correlation of 78% between mutated allelic fraction measured by Crystal Digital PCR and MPS. 7 additional samples with sensitizing mutations and 4 additional samples with the resistance mutation were detected with Crystal Digital PCR, but not with MPS. Monitoring levels of both mutation types over time showed a correlation between levels and trends of mutated ctDNA detected and clinical assessment of disease for the 6 patients tested. In conclusion, Crystal Digital PCR exhibited good performance for monitoring mutational status in plasma cfDNA, and also appeared as better suited to the detection of known mutations than MPS in terms of features such as time to results."
https://openalex.org/W2747179410,"Road and railway networks are pervasive elements of all environments, which have expanded intensively over the last century in all European countries. These transportation infrastructures have major impacts on the surrounding landscape, representing a threat to biodiversity. Roadsides and railways may function as corridors for dispersal of alien species in fragmented landscapes. However, only few studies have explored the spread of invasive species in relationship to transport network at large spatial scales. We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2750314620,"The type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase is involved in many pathophysiological processes probably via its enzymatic activity, which depends on the dynamic relationship between zymogen activation and protease inhibition. Matriptase shedding can prolong the life of enzymatically active matriptase and increase accessibility to substrates. We show here that matriptase shedding occurs via a de novo proteolytic cleavage at sites located between the SEA domain and the CUB domain. Point or combined mutations at the four positively charged amino acid residues in the region following the SEA domain allowed Arg-186 to be identified as the primary cleavage site responsible for matriptase shedding. Kinetic studies further demonstrate that matriptase shedding is temporally coupled with matriptase zymogen activation. The onset of matriptase shedding lags one minute behind matriptase zymogen activation. Studies with active site triad Ser-805 point mutated matriptase, which no longer undergoes zymogen activation or shedding, further suggests that matriptase shedding depends on matriptase zymogen activation, and that matriptase proteolytic activity may be involved in its own shedding. Our studies uncover an autonomous mechanism coupling matriptase zymogen activation, proteolytic activity, and shedding such that a proportion of newly generated active matriptase escapes HAI-1-mediated rapid inhibition by shedding into the extracellular milieu."
https://openalex.org/W2746703127,"Objective To identify changes in skeletal muscle microRNA expression after endurance exercise and associate the identified microRNAs with mRNA and protein expression to disease-specific pathways in polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) patients. Methods Following a parallel clinical trial design, patients with probable PM or DM, exercising less than once a week, and on stable medication for at least one month were randomized into two groups at Karolinska University Hospital: a 12-week endurance exercise group (n = 12) or a non-exercised control group (n = 11). Using an Affymetrix microarray, microRNA expression was determined in paired muscle biopsies taken before and after the exercise intervention from 3 patients in each group. Ingenuity pathway analysis with a microRNA target filter was used to identify microRNA transcript targets. These targets were investigated at the mRNA (microarray) and protein (mass spectrometry) levels in patients. Results Endurance exercise altered 39 microRNAs. The microRNAs with increased expression were predicted to target transcripts involved in inflammatory processes, metabolism, and muscle atrophy. Further, these target transcripts had an associated decrease in mRNA expression in exercised patients. In particular, a decrease in the NF-κB regulator IKBKB was associated with an increase in its target microRNA (miR-196b). At the protein level, there was an increase in mitochondrial proteins (AK3, HIBADH), which were associated with a decrease in microRNAs that were predicted to regulate their expression. Conclusion Improvement in disease phenotype after exercise is associated with increasing microRNAs that target and downregulate immune processes at the transcript level, as well as decreasing microRNAs that target and upregulate mitochondrial content at the protein level. Therefore, microRNAs may improve disease by decreasing immune responses and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01184625"
https://openalex.org/W2745683411,"Hydrogel nanomaterials, especially those that are of non-human and non-animal origins, have great potential in biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences due to their versatility and inherent soft-tissue like properties. With the ability to simulate native tissue function, hydrogels are potentially well suited for cellular therapy applications. In this study, we have fabricated nanofibrillar cellulose-alginate (NFCA) suture coatings as biomedical devices to help overcome some of the limitations related to cellular therapy, such as low cell survivability and distribution out of target tissue. The addition of sodium alginate 8% (w/v) increased the NFCA hydrogel viscosity, storage and loss moduli by slightly under one order of magnitude, thus contributing significantly to coating strength. Confocal microscopy showed nearly 100% cell viability throughout the 2-week incubation period within and on the surface of the coating. Additionally, typical morphologies in the dual cell culture of spheroid forming HepG2 and monolayer type SK-HEP-1 were observed. Twelve out of 14 NFCA coated surgical sutures remained intact during the suturing operation with various mice and rat tissue; however, partial peeling off was observed in 2 of the coated sutures. We conclude that NFCA suture coatings could perform as cell-carrier systems for cellular based therapy and post-surgical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2748573758,"A forward genetics approach was applied in order to investigate the molecular basis of morphological transition in the wheat pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. Z. tritici is a dimorphic plant pathogen displaying environmentally regulated morphogenetic transition between yeast-like and hyphal growth. Considering the infection mode of Z. tritici, the switching to hyphal growth is essential for pathogenicity allowing the fungus the host invasion through natural openings like stomata. We exploited a previously developed Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) to generate a mutant library by insertional mutagenesis including more than 10,000 random mutants. To identify genes involved in dimorphic switch, a plate-based screening system was established. With this approach eleven dimorphic switch deficient random mutants were recovered, ten of which exhibited a yeast-like mode of growth and one mutant predominantly growing filamentously, producing high amount of mycelium under different incubation conditions. Using genome walking approach previously established, the T-DNA integration sites were recovered and the disrupted genomic loci of corresponding mutants were identified and validated within reverse genetics approach. As prove of concept, two of the random mutants obtained were selected for further investigation using targeted gene inactivation. Both genes deduced were found to encode known factors, previously characterized in other fungi: Ssk1p being constituent of HOG pathway and Ade5,7p involved in de novo purine biosynthesis. The targeted mutant strains defective in these genes exhibit a drastically impaired virulence within infection assays on whole wheat plants. Moreover exploiting further physiological assays the predicted function for both gene products could be confirmed in concordance with conserved biological role of homologous proteins previously described in other fungal organisms."

We examined the changes in relationship of these social conditions and infections on HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections over time in British Columbia during 1990-2013.The BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC-HTC) includes ~1.5 million individuals tested for HIV or HCV, or reported as a case of HCV, HIV, HBV, or tuberculosis linked to administrative healthcare databases. We classified HCV and HIV infection status into five combinations: HIV-/HCV-, HIV+monoinfected, HIV-/HCV+seroconverters, HIV-/HCV+prevalent, and HIV+/HCV+.Of 1.37 million eligible individuals, 4.1% were HIV-/HCV+prevalent, 0.5% HIV+monoinfected, 0.3% HIV+/HCV+ co-infected and 0.5% HIV-/HCV+seroconverters. Overall, HIV+monoinfected individuals lived in urban areas (92%), had low injection drug use (IDU) (4%), problematic alcohol use (4%) and were materially more privileged than other groups. HIV+/HCV+ co-infected and HIV-/HCV+seroconverters were materially most deprived (37%, 32%), had higher IDU (28%, 49%), problematic alcohol use (14%, 17%) and major mental illnesses (12%, 21%). IDU, opioid substitution therapy, and material deprivation increased in HIV-/HCV+seroconverters over time. In multivariable multinomial regression models, over time, the odds of IDU declined among HIV-/HCV+prevalent and HIV+monoinfected individuals but not in HIV-/HCV+seroconverters. Declines in odds of problematic alcohol use were observed in HIV-/HCV+seroconverters and coinfected individuals over time.These results highlight need for designing prevention, care and support services for HIV and HCV infected populations based on the evolving syndemics of infections and social conditions which vary across groups."

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) participate in many cellular processes, including carcinogenesis, and pharmacological inhibition of HDACs has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. In this study, we explored antitumor activity of the novel HDAC inhibitor AR-42 in pancreatic cancer.Human pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and PANC-1 were used in this study. Real-time PCR, RT-PCR, and western blotting were employed to investigate expression of specific genes and proteins, respectively. Translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor was investigated by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation. The number of apoptotic cells, cell cycle stages, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation levels were determined by flow cytometry. Cell invasiveness was examined by the Matrigel invasion assay. Efficacy of AR-42 in vivo was evaluated by utilizing BxPC-3 xenograft mouse model.AR-42 inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by causing G2/M cell cycle arrest via regulating expression levels of genes and proteins involved in cell cycle. AR-42 also induced ROS generation and DNA damage, triggering apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells via both caspase-3-dependent and caspase-3-independent pathways. In addition, AR-42 increased expression levels of negative regulators of p53 (miR-125b, miR-30d, and miR33), which could contribute to lower expression level of mutant p53 in pancreatic cancer cells. Cell invasion assay showed that AR-42 reduced cancer cell aggressiveness and significantly diminished BxPC-3 xenograft tumor growth in vivo.AR-42, a novel HDAC inhibitor, inhibited pancreatic cancer cells by regulating p53 expression, inducing cell cycle arrest, particularly at the G2/M stage, and activating multiple apoptosis pathways. Additionally, AR-42 inhibited cell invasiveness and potently suppressed pancreatic cancer tumors in vivo. We conclude that by virtue of its multiple mechanisms of action, AR-42 possesses a considerable potential as an antitumor agent in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2746660326,"Objective To determine the type and nature of traditional eye medicine (TEM), their sources and use and practices related to self-medication for ophthalmic diseases in a rural Indian population. Methods A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in 25 randomly selected clusters of Rural Gurgaon, Haryana, India as part of CORE (Cornea Opacity Rural Epidemiological) study. In addition to comprehensive ophthalmic examination, health-seeking behavior and use of self-medication and TEM was assessed in the adult population using a semi-structured questionnaire. Physical verification of available ophthalmic medications in the enumerated households was conducted by the study team. Descriptive statistics were computed along with multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine associated factors for use of self-medication and TEM. Results Of the 2160 participants interviewed, 396 (18.2%) reported using ophthalmic medications without consulting an ophthalmologist, mainly for symptoms like watering (37.1%), redness (27.7%), itching (19.2%) and infection (13.6%). On physical verification of available eye drops that were being used without prescription, 26.4% participants were practicing self-medication. Steroid, expired/unlabeled and indigenous eye drops were being used by 151(26.5%), 120(21.1%) and 75 (13.2%) participants respectively. Additionally, 25.7% (529) participants resorted to home remedies like ‘kajal’(61.4%), honey (31.4%), ghee (11.7%) and rose water (9.1%). Conclusion Use of TEM is prevalent in this population. The rampant use of steroid eye drops without prescription along with use of expired or unlabelled eye drops warrants greater emphasis on safe eye care practices in this population. Public awareness and regulatory legislations must be implemented to decrease harmful effects arising due to such practices."
https://openalex.org/W2950740426,"Authorship of peer-reviewed journal articles and abstracts has become the primary currency and reward unit in academia. Such a reward is crucial for students and postdocs who are often under-compensated and thus highly value authorship as an incentive. While numerous scientific and publishing organizations have written guidelines for determining author qualifications and author order, there remains much ambiguity when it comes to how these criteria are weighed by research faculty. Here, we sought to provide some initial insight on how faculty view the relative importance of 11 criteria for scientific authorship. We distributed an online survey to 564 biomedical engineering, biology, and bioengineering faculty members at 10 research institutions across the United States. The response rate was approximately 18%, resulting in a final sample of 102 respondents. Results revealed an agreement on some criteria, such as time spent conducting experiments, but there was a lack of agreement regarding the role of funding procurement. This study provides quantitative assessments of how faculty members in the biosciences evaluate authorship criteria. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers, especially new graduate students, to help navigate the discrepancy between official policies for authorship and the contributions that faculty truly value."
https://openalex.org/W2748068241,"We report the complete chloroplast genomes of three Adenophora species, and analyzed these compared them to five published Campanuloid plastomes. The total genome length of Adenophora divaricata, Adenophora erecta, and Adenophora stricta ranged from 159,759 to 176,331 bp. Among the eight Campanuloid species, many inversions were found to be only in the LSC region. IR contraction was also identified in the plastid genome of Adenophora stricta. Phylogenetic analyses based on 76 protein coding genes showed that Campanuloids are monophyletic, and are composed of two major groups: Campanula s. str. and Rapunculus. When we compared each homologous locus among the four Adenophora species, ten regions showed high nucleotide divergence value (>0.03). Among these, nine loci, excepting ycf3-rpoB, are considered to be useful molecular markers for phylogenetic studies and will be helpful to resolve phylogenetic relationships of Adenophora."
https://openalex.org/W2749172249,"Tyrosine site-specific recombinases (T-SSR) are polynucleotidyltransferases that catalyze cutting and joining reactions between short specific DNA sequences. We developed three systems for performing genetic modifications in Bacillus anthracis that use T-SSR and their cognate target sequences, namely Escherichia coli bacteriophage P1 Cre-loxP, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Flp-FRT, and a newly discovered IntXO-PSL system from B. anthracis plasmid pXO1. All three tyrosine recombinase systems were used for creation of a B. anthracis sporulation-deficient, plasmid-free strain deleted for ten proteases which had been identified by proteomic analysis as being present in the B. anthracis secretome. This strain was used successfully for production of various recombinant proteins, including several that are candidates for inclusion in improved anthrax vaccines. These genetic tools developed for DNA manipulation in B. anthracis were also used for construction of strains having chromosomal insertions of 1, 2, or 3 adjacent atxA genes. AtxA is a B. anthracis global transcriptional regulator required for the response of B. anthracis virulence factor genes to bicarbonate. We found a positive correlation between the atxA copy number and the expression level of the pagA gene encoding B. anthracis protective antigen, when strains were grown in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. These results demonstrate that the three T-SSR systems described here provide effective tools for B. anthracis genome editing. These T-SSR systems may also be applicable to other prokaryotes and to eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2748465865,"The populations of many species that are widespread and commensal with humans have been drastically declining during the past few decades, but little attention has been paid to their conservation. Here, we report the status of the bonnet macaque, a species that is considered 'least-concern' for conservation. We show that the widely ranging rhesus macaque is expanding its range into the distributional range of the bonnet macaque, a species endemic only to southern India. Bonnet macaques have very low abundance in forests of all types indicating that it is not a typically forest dwelling species. The traditionally preferred habitats of bonnet macaques have been Hindu temples/ tourist spots but our data reveal that nearly 50% population of bonnet macaques has disappeared from such previously occupied spots. Another preferred habitat of bonnet macaques has been roadsides with abundant Ficus trees adjoining croplands. We found that between 2003 and 2015, the roadsides have drastically changed where vegetation has been replaced with barren lands and urbanization. Consequently, the populations of bonnet macaques have declined by more than 65% over the past 25 years, and by more than 50% between 2003 and 2015 alone. We, therefore, conclude that this 'least-concern' species is actually facing serious conservation challenges. We also identify a few places such as small hillocks with natural vegetation and a few temples/tourist spots which are likely to remain stable and thus can serve as 'bonnet macaque conservation reserves'. Since the bonnet macaque shares many traits with several other commensal and 'low-risk' species, it can serve as a model for the development of long-term conservation strategies for most such species."
https://openalex.org/W2749044142,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the reverse process (the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition [MET]) have been shown to be associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis in different carcinomas. The EMT and MET have recently been shown to play a key role in the pathogenic processes of sarcomas, which are completely different from those of carcinomas. However, the definitive roles of the EMT in the tumorigenesis of synovial sarcomas remain unknown. Here, we explored whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling, an important oncogenic event in synovial sarcoma, modulates tumor cell characteristics related to the EMT, such as cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and proliferation. Interestingly, we found that TGF-β1 induced tumor cell activation, resulting in a tendency to aggregate and biphasic-like features. TGF-β1 also caused downregulation of E-cadherin and subsequent upregulation of N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug, which are responsible for EMT-like phenomena and increased cell motility and invasion. To further investigate the roles of TGF-β1 in the EMT, we established a SW982 cell line with stable TGF-β1 inhibition viaSB431542.These cells exhibited significantly decreased motility, migration, and proliferation (P = 0.001). Taken together, our data demonstrated that alterations in the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway could regulate the expression of EMT-related factors and the EMT process, resulting in changes in tumor cell invasion, migration, and proliferation in synovial sarcoma cells. These results may provide a important insights into therapeutic interventions and contribute to the present understanding of tumor progression in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2749318590,"DNA barcoding is used as a universal tool for delimiting species boundaries in taxonomically challenging groups, with different plastid and nuclear regions (rbcL, matK, ITS and psbA-trnH) being recommended as primary DNA barcodes for plants. We evaluated the feasibility of using these regions in the species-rich genus Terminalia, which exhibits various overlapping morphotypes with pantropical distribution, owing to its complex taxonomy. Terminalia bellerica and T. chebula are ingredients of the famous Ayurvedic Rasayana formulation Triphala, used for detoxification and rejuvenation. High demand for extracted phytochemicals as well as the high trade value of several species renders mandatory the need for the correct identification of traded plant material. Three different analytical methods with single and multilocus barcoding regions were tested to develop a DNA barcode reference library from 222 individuals representing 41 Terminalia species. All the single barcodes tested had a lower discriminatory power than the multilocus regions, and the combination of matK+ITS had the highest resolution rate (94.44%). The average intra-specific variations (0.0188±0.0019) were less than the distance to the nearest neighbour (0.106±0.009) with matK and ITS. Distance-based Neighbour Joining analysis outperformed the character-based Maximum Parsimony method in the identification of traded species such as T. arjuna, T. chebula and T. tomentosa, which are prone to adulteration. rbcL was shown to be a highly conservative region with only 3.45% variability between all of the sequences. The recommended barcode combination, rbcL+matK, failed to perform in the genus Terminalia. Considering the complexity of resolution observed with single regions, the present study proposes the combination of matK+ITS as the most successful barcode in Terminalia."
https://openalex.org/W2749443699,"Psychosocial resources may serve as an important link to explain socioeconomic differences in health. Earlier studies have demonstrated that education, income and occupational status cannot be used interchangeably as indicators of a hypothetical latent social dimension. In the same manner, it is important to disentangle the effect of measuring different constructs of psychosocial resources. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse if associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and psychosocial resources differ depending on the measures used. A cross-sectional population-based study of a random sample (n = 1007) of middle-aged individuals (45–69 years old, 50% women) in Sweden was performed using questionnaire and register data. SES was measured as education, occupation, household income and self-rated economy. Psychosocial resources were measured as social integration, social support, mastery, self-esteem, sense of coherence (SOC) and trust. Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the relationships controlling for the effects of possible confounders. The measures of SES were low or moderately correlated to each other as were the measures of psychosocial resources. After controlling for age, sex, country of birth and employment status, household income and self-rated economy were associated with all six psychosocial resources; occupation was associated with three (social integration, self-esteem and trust) and education with two (social integration and self-esteem). Social integration and self-esteem showed a significant and graded relationship with all SES measures; trust was associated with all SES measures except education, whereas SOC and mastery were only associated with household income and self-rated economy. After controlling for other SES measures, no associations with psychosocial resources remained for education or occupation. In conclusion, associations between SES and psychosocial resources did differ depending on the measures used. The findings illustrate the importance of the choice of measure when investigating SES as well as psychosocial resources."
https://openalex.org/W2750547816,"Euroglyphus maynei is a house dust mite commonly found in homes worldwide and is the source of allergens that sensitize and induce allergic reactions in humans. It is the source of species-specific allergens as well as allergens that are cross-reactive with the allergens from house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus, and the ectoparasitic scabies mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The genomics, proteomics and molecular biology of E. maynei and its allergens have not been as extensively investigated as those of D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, and S. scabiei where natural and recombinant allergens from these species have been characterized. Until now, little was known about the genome of E. maynei and it allergens but this information will be important for producing recombinant allergens for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and for understanding the allergic response mechanism by immune effector cells that mediate the allergic reaction. We sequenced and assembled the 59 Mb E. maynei genome to aid the identification of homologs for known allergenic proteins. The predicted proteome shared orthologs with D. farinae and S. scabiei, and included proteins with homology to more than 30 different groups of allergens. However, the majority of allergen candidates could not be assigned as clear orthologs to known mite allergens. The genomic sequence data, predicted proteome, and allergen homologs identified from E. maynei provide insight into the relationships among astigmatid mites and their allergens, which should allow for the development of improved diagnostics and immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2749067678,"Previous studies have shown changes in women's behavior and physical appearance between the non-fertile and fertile phases of the menstrual cycle. It is assumed that these changes are regulated by fluctuations in sex hormone levels across the cycle. Receptors for sex hormones have been found on the vocal folds, suggesting a link between hormone levels and vocal fold function, which might cause changes in voice production. However, attempts to identify changes in voice production across the menstrual cycle have produced mixed results. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate changes in sexually dimorphic vocal characteristics and quality of women's voices in different phases of the cycle and to compare these with users of monophasic hormonal contraception. Voice samples (vowel phonation) of 44 naturally cycling women were obtained in the menstrual, late follicular (confirmed by LH surge) and luteal phases, and in 20 hormonal contraceptive users across equivalent stages of the monthly cycle. Results showed that voices of naturally cycling women had higher minimum pitch in the late follicular phase compared with the other phases. In addition, voice intensity was at its lowest in the luteal phase. In contrast, there were no voice changes across the cycle in hormonal contraceptive users. Comparison between the two groups of women revealed that the naturally cycling group had higher minimum pitch in the fertile phase and higher harmonics to noise ratio in the menstrual phase. In general, present results support the assumption that sex hormones might have an effect on voice function. These results, coupled with mixed findings in previous studies, suggest that vocal changes in relation to hormonal fluctuation are subtle, at least during vowel production. Future studies should explore voice changes in a defined social context and with more free-flowing speech."

In this study, we evaluated the quality management system for voluntary and provider-initiated point-of-care HIV testing in primary healthcare (PHC) clinics in rural KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa.We conducted a quality assessment audit in eleven PHC clinics that offer voluntary HIV testing and counselling in rural KZN, South Africa from August 2015 to October 2016. All the participating clinics were purposively selected from the province-wide survey of diagnostic services. We completed an on-site monitoring checklist, adopted from the WHO guidelines for assuring accuracy and reliability of HIV rapid tests, to assess the quality management system for HIV rapid testing at each clinic. To determine clinic's compliance to WHO quality standards for HIV rapid testing the following quality measure was used, a 3-point scale (high, moderate and poor). A high score was defined as a percentage rating of 90 to 100%, moderate was defined as a percentage rating of 70 to 90%, and poor was defined as a percentage rating of less than 70%. Clinic audit scores were summarized and compared. We employed Pearson pair wise correlation coefficient to determine correlations between clinics audit scores and clinic and clinics characteristics. Linear regression model was computed to estimate statistical significance of the correlates. Correlations were reported as significant at p ≤0.05.Nine out of 11 audited rural PHC clinics are located outside 20Km of the nearest town and hospital. Majority (18.2%) of the audited rural PHC clinics reported that HIV rapid test was performed by HIV lay counsellors. Overall, ten clinics were rated moderate, in terms of their compliance to the stipulated WHO guidelines. Audit results showed that rural PHC clinics' average rating score for compliance to the WHO guidelines ranged between 64.4% (CI: 44%- 84%) and 89.2% (CI: 74%- 100%).Ten out of eleven of the clinics were rated as moderate (70-89%). All clinic have scored highest for the following audit component: equipment; process control and specimen management; and facility ad safety, with 100%. Clinics obtained the lowest scores for the assessment audit component followed by process improvement and organisation, with 40.9% (CI: 15.7-66.1%), 45.5% (CI: 10.4-80.5%) and 56.8% (CI: 31.8 81.8%), respectively. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the following: category of staff performing the HIV rapid tests in the audited clinics and service and satisfactory audit component; weekly average number of patients using the audited PHC clinics and service and satisfactory audit component; number of HIV lay counsellors in the audited clinics and quality control audit component with p<0.05.In the small audit of primary healthcare clinics located within the rural part of KwaZulu-Natal, results revealed an overall moderate rating of the quality management system for rapid HIV testing. Improvements in the organisation, quality control, process improvement and assessment components could enable a higher quality assurance rating for rural HIV testing in KwaZulu-Natal."

Though TAVR leads to a significant reduction in mortality, a notable amount of patients are re-hospitalized early after TAVR. Parameters or biomarkers predicting outcome are therefore needed to identify patients who benefit most. Specific monocyte subsets have been associated with cardiovascular diseases and were shown to possess prognostic value.Peripheral blood was drawn before and after transfemoral TAVR with the self-expanding CoreValve, Boston Lotus or the balloon-expanding Edwards Sapien prosthesis. Classical (CD14++CD16-), intermediate (CD14++CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16++) monocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before, early after as well as 3 months after the TAVR procedure.No significant differences in the absolute monocyte counts were found after TAVR. A significant decline in the intermediate monocyte population was though observed early after TAVR (pre 4.01±0.38%, post 2.803±0.34%, p≤0.05). Creatinine levels stayed stable after TAVR procedure and intermediate monocytes were associated with worse renal function. Monocyte decline was not related to changes in CRP-, noradrenaline, cortisol or aldosterone-levels. The amount of intermediate monocytes correlated with worse cardiac function and predicted the possibility to reach an improvement in NYHA functional class at 3 months after TAVR.A significant decline of intermediate monocytes occurs shortly after TAVR. High levels of intermediate monocytes were associated with worse cardiac function and predicted poor functional capacity, hinting at a possible prognostic value."
https://openalex.org/W2745466710,"It has been shown that the response of V600EBRAF melanoma cells to targeted therapeutics is affected by growth factors. We have investigated the influence of three different growth factors, bFGF, EGF and HGF used either alone or in combination, on the response of V600EBRAF melanoma cell populations established from surgical specimens to vemurafenib and trametinib, targeting V600EBRAF and MEK1/2, respectively. We report that proliferation and phenotype of V600EBRAF melanoma cell populations were not detectably influenced by exogenous growth factors. Neither cell distribution in cell cycle and CCND1 expression nor activity of signaling pathways crucial for melanoma development and maintenance, including the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, WNT/β-catenin pathway and NF-κB signaling, were affected by the presence of different growth factors. We furthermore show that vemurafenib and trametinib abrogated the activity of ERK1/2, arrested cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase, triggered apoptosis, induced changes in the expression of CXCL8, CCND1 and CTGF and the frequency of Ki-67high and CD271high cells. These effects were, however, similar in the presence of different growth factors. Interestingly, comparable results were also obtained for melanoma cells grown without exogenous growth factors bFGF, EGF and HGF for a period as long as 4 months prior the drug treatment. We conclude that the composition or lack of exogenous growth factors bFGF, EGF and HGF do not markedly influence viability and phenotype of V600EBRAF melanoma cells and their response to vemurafenib and trametinib in vitro.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of gliomas located in the CST region on motor function with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) preoperatively. Materials and methods Forty-five patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas were included in this pilot study, in all cases (low-grade n = 13, high-grade n = 32) CST but not the motor cortex were involved by the tumor. DTI image were acquired and the posterior limb of the internal capsule fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative FA (rFA = affected FA/contralateral FA) were measured. Injury of the CST from tumor was divided into three grades (grade 1: displacement, grade 2: displacement and infiltration, grade 3: displacement and disruption). The fiber density index (FDi) and relative FDi (rFDi = affected FDi/contralateral FDi) of the injured and contralateral CST were measured. The correlations between muscle strength and the CST injury grade and the rFA, affected FDi, rFDi values were calculated using Spearman rank correlation analysis. rFA and rFDi values of muscle strength groups (MMT2-5) were compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The difference of muscle strength between low- and high-grade glioma groups were analysed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results Muscle strength was negatively correlated with the injury grade of the CST (r = -0.840, P<0.001). Muscle strength was positively correlated with rFA, FDi and rFDi (correlation coefficients (r) were 0.615, 0.643 and 0.567 for rFA, FDi and rFDi, respectively). The rFA values between grades (2&3, 2&4, 2&5, 3&5, 4&5) of muscle strength were significantly different (P<0.05), the rFDi values between grades (2&4, 2&5, 3&4, 3&5) of muscle strength were significantly different (P<0.05), while the rFA and rFDi values in the remaining groups of muscle strength grades showed no significant differences(P>0.05). Conclusions Preoperative DTI and diffusion tensor tractography may quantify the injury degrees of CST and the extent of motor dysfunction in patients with brain glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2748179023,"Better knowledge of medicinal plant species and their conservation is an urgent need worldwide. Decision making for conservation strategies can be based on the knowledge of the variability and population genetic structure of the species and on the events that may influence these genetic parameters. Achyrocline flaccida (Weinm.) DC. is a native plant from the grassy fields of South America with high value in folk medicine. In spite of its importance, no genetic and conservation studies are available for the species. In this work, microsatellite and ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat) markers were used to estimate the genetic variability and structure of seven populations of A. flaccida from southern Brazil. The microsatellite markers were inefficient in A. flaccida owing to a high number of null alleles. After the evaluation of 42 ISSR primers on one population, 10 were selected for further analysis of seven A. flaccida populations. The results of ISSR showed that the high number of exclusive absence of loci might contribute to the inter-population differentiation. Genetic variability of the species was high (Nei’s diversity of 0.23 and Shannon diversity of 0.37). AMOVA indicated higher genetic variability within (64.7%) than among (33.96%) populations, and the variability was unevenly distributed (FST 0.33). Gene flow among populations ranged from 1.68 to 5.2 migrants per generation, with an average of 1.39. The results of PCoA and Bayesian analyses corroborated and indicated that the populations are structured. The observed genetic variability and population structure of A. flaccida are discussed in the context of the vegetation formation history in southern Brazil, as well as the possible anthropogenic effects. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the results in the conservation of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2748292118,"Background It has been argued that the success of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in generating unbiased estimates for epidemiologic outcomes depends on participants’ abilities to generate long referral chains. While this is thought to depend on the number of people participants know in the target population, this idea is rarely tested. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the role of other aspects of social connectedness in recruitment, such as participants’ involvement in local clubs and venues. Methods We examine whether the recruitment potential of young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) depends on (1) their social network size and (2) their affiliations with a variety of sex venues across geographic areas. We analyze data from a 2014 RDS study of 598 YBMSM on the south side of Chicago. Results Both a participant’s personal network size and the number of different types of sex venues with which he was affiliated were significantly positively associated with (1) the total number of recruits in the participant’s prospective referral chains and (2) the lengths of those chains. However, only venue affiliation remain significantly associated with recruitment potential in the multivariate model. Conclusions The success of RDS in generating valid samples may depend more on recruiting participants who are involved in multiple venues within the community (i.e., their affiliation networks) than on recruiting those who have large personal social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2749272605,"Objectives To determine references intervals for echocardiographic measurements in adult dairy goats. Animals 125 clinically healthy, adult dairy goats aged 2–9 years, belonging to two breeds–Polish Fawn Improved (PFI, n = 64, weight range from 46 to 73, median of 58.5kg) and Polish White Improved (PWI, n = 61, weight range from 48 to 80 kg, median of 67.9kg), closely related to French Alpine and Saanen, respectively. Methods Non-invasive transthoracic echocardiography examination was performed in unsedated goats in a standing position. Two-dimensional, M-mode and pulsed wave Doppler measurements were obtained. A non-parametric method was applied for determination of reference intervals. Measurements for the two breeds were compared using an analysis of covariance to control for their body weight. Repeatability was assessed using a between-day coefficient of variation and a coefficient of repeatability. Results Following reference intervals were determined: aortic diameter in diastole 2.2–3.3, left atrial diameter in systole 2.5–4.3cm cm, the ratio of the left atrial diameter to the aortic diameter 0.96–1.5, right ventricular internal diameter in diastole 0.4–1.7cm, left ventricular internal diameter in systole and diastole 1.8–3.2 and 3.2–5.6 cm, respectively, inter-ventricular septum thickness in systole and diastole 0.7–1.5 and 0.5–1.1cm, respectively, left ventricular posterior-wall in systole and diastole 0.8–1.6 and 0.5–1.2cm, respectively, E-point to septal separation 0.3–0.8cm, left ventricular fractional shortening 28–54%, left ventricular ejection fraction 55–86%, maximum Left and Right Ventricular Outflow Tract velocity 80–140 cm/s and 70–130 cm/s, respectively Left and Right Ventricular Outflow Tract pressure gradient 2.5–8.9mmHg and 1.9–6.5mmHg, respectively. Most of the differences between the two breeds could be attributed to different body weight. Conclusions The study provides echocardiographic reference intervals determined on the highest sample of apparently healthy goats so far enrolled."
https://openalex.org/W2750364827,"The purpose of the present study was to determine the influence of hypoxic exposure during prolonged endurance exercise sessions (79 min in total) on post-exercise hepcidin levels in trained male endurance athletes. Ten endurance athletes (mean ± standard deviation; height: 169.8 ± 7.1 cm, weight: 57.1 ± 5.0 kg) conducted two endurance exercise sessions under either a normobaric hypoxic condition [inspired O2 fraction (FiO2) = 14.5%] or a normoxic condition (FiO2 = 20.9%). Exercise consisted of 10 × 3 min running on a treadmill at 95% of maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) with 60s of active rest at 60% of [Formula: see text]. After 10 min of rest, they subsequently performed 30 min of continuous running at 85% of [Formula: see text]. Running velocities were significantly lower in the HYPO than in the NOR (P < 0.0001). Exercise-induced blood lactate elevation was significantly greater in the HYPO (P < 0.01). There were significant increases in plasma interleukin-6, serum iron, and blood glucose levels after exercise, with no significant difference between the trials [interaction (trial × time) or main effect for trial, P > 0.05]. Serum hepcidin levels increased significantly 120 min after exercise (HYPO: from 10.7 ± 9.4 ng/mL to 15.8 ± 11.2 ng/mL; NOR: from 7.9 ± 4.7 ng/mL to 13.2 ± 7.9 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and no difference was observed between the trials. In conclusion, endurance exercise at lower running velocity in hypoxic conditions resulted in similar post-exercise hepcidin elevations as higher running velocity in normoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2747408071,"An empirically founded and widely established driving force in opinion dynamics is homophily i.e. the tendency of ""birds of a feather"" to ""flock together"". The closer our opinions are the more likely it is that we will interact and converge. Models using these assumptions are called bounded confidence models (BCM) as they assume a tolerance threshold after which interaction is unlikely. They are known to produce one or more clusters, depending on the size of the bound, with more than one cluster being possible only in the deterministic case. Introducing noise, as is likely to happen in a stochastic world, causes BCM to produce consensus which leaves us with the open problem of explaining the emergence and sustainance of opinion clusters and polarisation. We investigate the role of heterogeneous priors in opinion formation, introduce the concept of opinion copulas, argue that it is well supported by findings in Social Psychology and use it to show that the stochastic BCM does indeed produce opinion clustering without the need for extra assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W2748607562,"Glatiramer acetate is used therapeutically in multiple sclerosis but also known for adverse effects including elevated coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular side effects of the medication are unclear. Here, we made use of the chromosomal variation in the genes that are known to be affected by glatiramer treatment. Focusing on genes and gene products reported by drug-gene interaction database to interact with glatiramer acetate we explored a large meta-analysis on CAD genome-wide association studies aiming firstly, to investigate whether variants in these genes also affect cardiovascular risk and secondly, to identify new CAD risk genes. We traced association signals in a 200-kb region around genomic positions of genes interacting with glatiramer in up to 60 801 CAD cases and 123 504 controls. We validated the identified association in additional 21 934 CAD cases and 76 087 controls. We identified three new CAD risk alleles within the TGFB1 region on chromosome 19 that independently affect CAD risk. The lead SNP rs12459996 was genome-wide significantly associated with CAD in the extended meta-analysis (odds ratio 1.09, p = 1.58×10−12). The other two SNPs at the locus were not in linkage disequilibrium with the lead SNP and by a conditional analysis showed p-values of 4.05 × 10−10 and 2.21 × 10−6. Thus, studying genes reported to interact with glatiramer acetate we identified genetic variants that concordantly with the drug increase the risk of CAD. Of these, TGFB1 displayed signal for association. Indeed, the gene has been associated with CAD previously in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Here we establish genome-wide significant association with CAD in large human samples."

https://openalex.org/W2950175943,"Mixed effects models provide significant advantages in sensitivity and flexibility over typical statistical approaches to neural data analysis, but mass univariate application of mixed effects models to large neural datasets is computationally intensive. Threshold free cluster enhancement also provides a significant increase in sensitivity, but requires computationally-intensive permutation-based significance testing. Not surprisingly, the combination of mixed effects models with threshold free cluster enhancement and nonparametric permutation-based significance testing is currently completely impractical. With mixed effects for large datasets (MELD) we circumvent this impasse by means of a singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of neural data while maximizing signal. Singular value decompositions become unstable when there are large numbers of noise features, so we precede it with a bootstrap-based feature selection step employing threshold free cluster enhancement to identify stable features across subjects. By projecting the dependent data into the reduced space of the singular value decomposition we gain the power of a multivariate approach and we can greatly reduce the number of mixed effects models that need to be run, making it feasible to use permutation testing to determine feature level significance. Due to these innovations, MELD is much faster than an element-wise mixed effects analysis, and on simulated data MELD was more sensitive than standard techniques, such as element-wise t-tests combined with threshold-free cluster enhancement. When evaluated on an EEG dataset, MELD identified more significant features than the t-tests with threshold free cluster enhancement in a comparable amount of time."
https://openalex.org/W2746730239,"This study aims to investigate (1) motives, motivations and expectations regarding the choice for a specific rehabilitation setting after herniated disc surgery and (2) how rehabilitation-related motivations and expectations are associated with rehabilitation outcome (ability to work, health-related quality of life and satisfaction with rehabilitation) three months after disc surgery.The longitudinal cohort study refers to 452 disc surgery patients participating in a subsequent rehabilitation. Baseline interviews took part during acute hospital stay (pre-rehabilitation), follow-up interviews three months later (post-rehabilitation). Binary logistic regression and multiple linear regression analyses were applied.(1) Motives, motivations and expectations: Inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) patients stated ""less effort/stress"" (40.9%), more ""relaxation and recreation"" (39.1%) and greater ""intensity of care and treatment"" (37.0%) regarding their setting preference, whereas outpatient rehabilitation (OPR) patients indicated ""family reasons"" (45.3%), the wish for ""staying in familiar environment"" (35.9%) as well as ""job-related reasons"" (11.7%) as most relevant. IPR patients showed significantly higher motivation/expectation scores regarding regeneration (p < .001), health (p < .05), coping (p < .001), retirement/job (p < .01), psychological burden (p < .05) and physical burden (p < .001) compared to OPR patients. (2) Associations with rehabilitation outcome: Besides other factors (e.g. age, gender and educational level) rehabilitation-related motivations/expectations were significantly associated with rehabilitation outcome measures. For example, patients with less motivations/expectations to achieve improvements regarding ""physical burden"" showed a better health-related quality of life (p < .01) three months after disc surgery. Less motivations/expectations to achieve improvements regarding ""psychological burden"" was linked to a better mental health status (p < .001) and a greater satisfaction with rehabilitation (OR = .806; p < .05).Rehabilitation-related motivations and expectations differed substantially between IPR and OPR patients before rehabilitation and were significantly associated with rehabilitation outcome. Taking motivational and expectation-related aspects into account may help to improve allocation procedures for different rehabilitation settings and may improve rehabilitation success."
https://openalex.org/W2748475888,"Objectives The present study explored tone perception ability in school age Mandarin-speaking children with otitis media with effusion (OME) in noisy listening environments. The study investigated the interaction effects of noise, tone type, age, and hearing status on monaural tone perception, and assessed the application of a hierarchical clustering algorithm for profiling hearing impairment in children with OME. Methods Forty-one children with normal hearing and normal middle ear status and 84 children with OME with or without hearing loss participated in this study. The children with OME were further divided into two subgroups based on their severity and pattern of hearing loss using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Monaural tone recognition was measured using a picture-identification test format incorporating six sets of monosyllabic words conveying four lexical tones under speech spectrum noise, with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from -9 to -21 dB. Results Linear correlation indicated tone recognition thresholds of children with OME were significantly correlated with age and pure tone hearing thresholds at every frequency tested. Children with hearing thresholds less affected by OME performed similarly to their peers with normal hearing. Tone recognition thresholds of children with auditory status more affected by OME were significantly inferior to those of children with normal hearing or with minor hearing loss. Younger children demonstrated poorer tone recognition performance than older children with OME. A mixed design repeated-measure ANCOVA showed significant main effects of listening condition, hearing status, and tone type on tone recognition. Contrast comparisons revealed that tone recognition scores were significantly better under -12 dB SNR than under -15 dB SNR conditions and tone recognition scores were significantly worse under -18 dB SNR than those obtained under -15 dB SNR conditions. Tone 1 was the easiest tone to identify and Tone 3 was the most difficult tone to identify for all participants, when considering -12, -15, and -18 dB SNR as within-subject variables. The interaction effect between hearing status and tone type indicated that children with greater levels of OME-related hearing loss had more impaired tone perception of Tone 1 and Tone 2 compared to their peers with lesser levels of OME-related hearing loss. However, tone perception of Tone 3 and Tone 4 remained similar among all three groups. Tone 2 and Tone 3 were the most perceptually difficult tones for children with or without OME-related hearing loss in all listening conditions. Conclusions The hierarchical clustering algorithm demonstrated usefulness in risk stratification for tone perception deficiency in children with OME-related hearing loss. There was marked impairment in tone perception in noise for children with greater levels of OME-related hearing loss. Monaural lexical tone perception in younger children was more vulnerable to noise and OME-related hearing loss than that in older children."
https://openalex.org/W2748546452,"This paper suggests a probability-dominant user equilibrium (PdUE) model to describe the selfish routing equilibrium in a stochastic traffic network. At PdUE, travel demands are only assigned to the most dominant routes in the same origin-destination pair. A probability-dominant rerouting dynamic model is proposed to explain the behavioral mechanism of PdUE. To facilitate applications, the logit formula of PdUE is developed, of which a well-designed route set is not indispensable and the equivalent varitional inequality formation is simple. Two routing strategies, i.e., the probability-dominant strategy (PDS) and the dominant probability strategy (DPS), are discussed through a hypothetical experiment. It is found that, whether out of insurance or striving for perfection, PDS is a better choice than DPS. For more general cases, the conducted numerical tests lead to the same conclusion. These imply that PdUE (rather than the conventional stochastic user equilibrium) is a desirable selfish routing equilibrium for a stochastic network, given that the probability distributions of travel time are available to travelers."
