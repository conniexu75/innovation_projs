So far, it has not been studied as to whether miRNAs, suppressing target expression by binding to the 3′-UTR, regulate Pdcd4 or invasion. The present study was conducted to investigate the regulation of Pdcd4, and invasion/intra-vasation, by miRNAs. A bioinformatics search revealed a conserved target-site for miR-21 within the Pdcd4-3′-UTR at 228–249 nt. In 10 colorectal cell lines, an inverse correlation of miR-21 and Pdcd4-protein was observed. Transfection of Colo206f-cells with miR-21 significantly suppressed a luciferase-reporter containing the Pdcd4-3′-UTR, whereas transfection of RKO with anti-miR-21 increased activity of this construct. This was abolished when a construct mutated at the miR-21/nt228–249 target site was used instead. Anti-miR-21-transfected RKO cells showed an increase of Pdcd4-protein and reduced invasion. Moreover, these cells showed reduced intra-vasation and lung metastasis in a chicken–embryo–metastasis assay. In contrast, overexpression of miR-21 in Colo206f significantly reduced Pdcd4-protein amounts and increased invasion, while Pdcd4-mRNA was unaltered. Resected normal/tumor tissues of 22 colorectal cancer patients demonstrated an inverse correlation between miR-21 and Pdcd4-protein. This is the first study to show that Pdcd4 is negatively regulated by miR-21. Furthermore, it is the first report to demonstrate that miR-21 induces invasion/intravasation/metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2146562437,"Background Amphibians are rapidly vanishing. At the same time, it is most likely that the number of amphibian species is highly underestimated. Recent DNA barcoding work has attempted to define a threshold between intra- and inter-specific genetic distances to help identify candidate species. In groups with high extinction rates and poorly known species boundaries, like amphibians, such tools may provide a way to rapidly evaluate species richness. Methodology Here we analyse published and new 16S rDNA sequences from 60 frog species of Amazonia-Guianas to obtain a minimum estimate of the number of undescribed species in this region. We combined isolation by distance, phylogenetic analyses, and comparison of molecular distances to evaluate threshold values for the identification of candidate species among these frogs. Principal Findings In most cases, geographically distant populations belong to genetically highly distinct lineages that could be considered as candidate new species. This was not universal among the taxa studied and thus widespread species of Neotropical frogs really do exist, contrary to previous assumptions. Moreover, the many instances of paraphyly and the wide overlap between distributions of inter- and intra-specific distances reinforce the hypothesis that many cryptic species remain to be described. In our data set, pairwise genetic distances below 0.02 are strongly correlated with geographical distances. This correlation remains statistically significant until genetic distance is 0.05, with no such relation thereafter. This suggests that for higher distances allopatric and sympatric cryptic species prevail. Based on our analyses, we propose a more inclusive pairwise genetic distance of 0.03 between taxa to target lineages that could correspond to candidate species. Conclusions Using this approach, we identify 129 candidate species, two-fold greater than the 60 species included in the current study. This leads to estimates of around 170 to 460 frog taxa unrecognized in Amazonia-Guianas. Significance As a consequence the global amphibian decline detected especially in the Neotropics may be worse than realised."
https://openalex.org/W2089706810,"Treatment failure of chloroquine for P. vivax infections has reached high levels in the eastern provinces of Indonesia, however, in vitro characterization of chloroquine resistance and its associated molecular profile have yet to be determined.Using a modified schizont maturation assay we investigated the in vitro chloroquine susceptibility profile and molecular polymorphisms of P. vivax isolates collected from Papua, Indonesia, where high levels of clinical chloroquine treatment failure have been reported, and from Thailand, where chloroquine treatment is generally effective.The geometric mean chloroquine IC(50) for P. vivax isolates from Papua (n = 145) was 312 nM [95%CI: 237-411 nM] compared to 46.8 nM [95%CI: 34.7-63.1 nM] from Thailand (n = 81); p<0.001. Correlating with the known clinical efficacy of the area, a cut off for chloroquine resistance was defined as 220 nM, a level exceeded in 13.6% (11/81) of Thai isolates and 65% (94/145) of Papuan isolates; p<0.001. Several sequence polymorphisms in pvcrt-o and pvmdr1, and difference in pvmdr1 copy number were identified. A Y976F mutation in pvmdr1 was present in 96% (123/128) of Papuan isolates and 25% (17/69) of Thai isolates; p<0.001. Overall, the geometric mean chloroquine IC(50) in isolates with the Y976F mutation was 283 nM [95%CI: 211-379], compared to 44.5 nM [95%CI: 31.3-63.4] in isolates with the wild type; p< 0.001. Pvmdr1 amplification occurred in 23% (15/66) of Thai isolates compared to none (0/104) of Indonesian isolates (p<0.001), but was not associated with increased chloroquine resistance after controlling for geographical location.In vitro susceptibility testing of P. vivax discriminates between populations with differing levels of clinical efficacy of chloroquine. The pvmdr1 polymorphism at Y976F may provide a useful tool to highlight areas of emerging chloroquine resistance, although further studies defining its clinical correlates are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2163169468,"Cryptochromes (Cry) have been suggested to form the basis of light-dependent magnetic compass orientation in birds. However, to function as magnetic compass sensors, the cryptochromes of migratory birds must possess a number of key biophysical characteristics. Most importantly, absorption of blue light must produce radical pairs with lifetimes longer than about a microsecond. Cryptochrome 1a (gwCry1a) and the photolyase-homology-region of Cry1 (gwCry1-PHR) from the migratory garden warbler were recombinantly expressed and purified from a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. Transient absorption measurements show that these flavoproteins are indeed excited by light in the blue spectral range leading to the formation of radicals with millisecond lifetimes. These biophysical characteristics suggest that gwCry1a is ideally suited as a primary light-mediated, radical-pair-based magnetic compass receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2096963938,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAH1-encoded Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1, 3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate to yield diacylglycerol and Pi. This enzyme plays a major role in the synthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in S. cerevisiae. PAP1 contains the DXDX(T/V) catalytic motif (DIDGT at residues 398-402) that is shared by the mammalian fat-regulating protein lipin 1 and the superfamily of haloacid dehalogenase-like proteins. The yeast enzyme also contains a conserved glycine residue (Gly80) that is essential for the fat-regulating function of lipin 1 in a mouse model. In this study, we examined the roles of the putative catalytic motif and the conserved glycine for PAP1 activity by a mutational analysis. The PAP1 activities of the D398E and D400E mutant enzymes were reduced by >99.9%, and the activity of the G80R mutant enzyme was reduced by 98%. The mutant PAH1 alleles whose products lacked PAP1 activity were nonfunctional in vivo and failed to complement the pah1Delta mutant phenotypes of temperature sensitivity, respiratory deficiency, nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane expansion, derepression of INO1 expression, and alterations in lipid composition. These results demonstrated that the PAP1 activity of the PAH1 gene product is essential for its roles in lipid metabolism and cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2018934684,"Increased levels of circulating saturated free fatty acids, such as palmitate, have been implicated in the etiology of type II diabetes and cancer. In addition to being a constituent of glycerolipids and a source of energy, palmitate also covalently attaches to numerous cellular proteins via a process named palmitoylation. Recognized for its roles in membrane tethering, cellular signaling, and protein trafficking, palmitoylation is also emerging as a potential regulator of metabolism. Indeed, we showed previously that the acylation of two mitochondrial proteins at their active site cysteine residues result in their inhibition. Herein, we sought to identify other palmitoylated proteins in mitochondria using a nonradioactive bio-orthogonal azido-palmitate analog that can be selectively derivatized with various tagged triarylphosphines. Our results show that, like palmitate, incorporation of azido-palmitate occurred on mitochondrial proteins via thioester bonds at sites that could be competed out by palmitoyl-CoA. Using this method, we identified 21 putative palmitoylated proteins in the rat liver mitochondrial matrix, a compartment not recognized for its content in palmitoylated proteins, and confirmed the palmitoylation of newly identified mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase. We postulate that covalent modification and perhaps inhibition of various mitochondrial enzymes by palmitoyl-CoA could lead to the metabolic impairments found in obesity-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1972151888,"High affinity nitrate assimilation genes in fungi occur in a cluster (fHANT-AC) that can be coordinately regulated. The clustered genes include nrt2, which codes for a high affinity nitrate transporter; euknr, which codes for nitrate reductase; and NAD(P)H-nir, which codes for nitrite reductase. Homologs of genes in the fHANT-AC occur in other eukaryotes and prokaryotes, but they have only been found clustered in the oomycete Phytophthora (heterokonts). We performed independent and concatenated phylogenetic analyses of homologs of all three genes in the fHANT-AC. Phylogenetic analyses limited to fungal sequences suggest that the fHANT-AC has been transferred horizontally from a basidiomycete (mushrooms and smuts) to an ancestor of the ascomycetous mold Trichoderma reesei. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences from diverse eukaryotes and eubacteria, and cluster structure, are consistent with a hypothesis that the fHANT-AC was assembled in a lineage leading to the oomycetes and was subsequently transferred to the Dikarya (Ascomycota+Basidiomycota), which is a derived fungal clade that includes the vast majority of terrestrial fungi. We propose that the acquisition of high affinity nitrate assimilation contributed to the success of Dikarya on land by allowing exploitation of nitrate in aerobic soils, and the subsequent transfer of a complete assimilation cluster improved the fitness of T. reesei in a new niche. Horizontal transmission of this cluster of functionally integrated genes supports the “selfish operon” hypothesis for maintenance of gene clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2070278304,"Normal subjects deactivate specific brain regions, notably the posteromedial cortex (PMC), during many tasks. Recent cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggests that deactivation during memory tasks is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to prospectively determine the prognostic significance of PMC deactivation in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).75 subjects (34 MCI, 13 AD subjects and 28 controls) underwent baseline fMRI scanning during encoding of novel and familiar face-name pairs. MCI subjects were followed longitudinally to determine conversion to AD. Regression and analysis of covariance models were used to assess the effect of PMC activation/deactivation on conversion to dementia as well as in the longitudinal change in dementia measures. At longitudinal follow up of up to 3.5 years (mean 2.5+/-0.79 years), 11 MCI subjects converted to AD. The proportion of deactivators was significantly different across all groups: controls (79%), MCI-Nonconverters (73%), MCI-converters (45%), and AD (23%) (p<0.05). Mean PMC activation magnitude parameter estimates, at baseline, were negative in the control (-0.57+/-0.12) and MCI-Nonconverter (-0.33+/-0.14) groups, and positive in the MCI-Converter (0.37+/-0.40) and AD (0.92+/-0.30) groups. The effect of diagnosis on PMC deactivation remained significant after adjusting for age, education and baseline Mini-Mental State Exam (p<0.05). Baseline PMC activation magnitude was correlated with change in dementia ratings from baseline.Loss of physiological functional deactivation in the PMC may have prognostic value in preclinical AD, and could aid in profiling subgroups of MCI subjects at greatest risk for progressive cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2086109478,"Exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), one of the reactive oxidants in the gas phase of cigarette smoke (CS), induces aberrant phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in the lack of ubiquitination by c-Cbl, and impaired degradation. EGFR activation without the feedback regulation of normal degradation leads to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor promotion. Using immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and confocal microscopy, we now demonstrate that the pattern of EGFR activation by CS is similar to H2O2. We found that exposure of human airway epithelial cells to CS, as with exposure to H2O2, not only results in an increase in EGFR activation over time, but the EGFR activated by H2O2 or CS is neither ubiquitinated nor subsequently degraded due to its inability to bind the E3 ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, either directly or indirectly via the Grb2 adapter protein. Moreover, the stabilized H2O2- and CS-activated EGFR remains plasma membrane-bound, while a population of the receptor is trafficked to a perinuclear region. Concomitantly, CS exposure results in the activation of downstream Akt and ERK1/2 survival and proliferation pathways. Therefore, exposure to CS, like exposure to H2O2, results in prolonged signaling by the EGFR and may contribute to uncontrolled lung cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2023316908,"Tau is an important microtubule-stabilizing protein in neurons. In its hyperphosphorylated form, Tau protein loses its ability to bind to microtubules and then accumulates and is part of pathological lesions characterizing tauopathies, e.g. Alzheimer disease. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), antagonized by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), regulates Tau phosphorylation at many sites. Diabetes mellitus is linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease. This could be partially caused by dysregulated GSK-3β. In a long term experiment (–16 h) using primary murine neuron cultures, we interfered in the insulin/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002 treatment and insulin boost) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) (AICAR and rapamycin treatment) signaling pathways and examined consequent changes in the activities of PP2A, GSK-3β, and Tau phosphorylation. We found that the coupling of PI3K with mTor signaling, in conjunction with a regulatory interaction between PP2A and GSK-3β, changed activities of both enzymes always in the same direction. These balanced responses seem to ensure the steady Tau phosphorylation at GSK/PP2A-dependent sites observed over a long period of time (≥6 h). This may help in preventing severe changes in Tau phosphorylation under conditions when neurons undergo transient fluctuations either in insulin or nutrient supply. On the other hand, the investigation of Tau protein at Ser-262 showed that interference in the insulin/PI3K and mTor signaling potentially influenced the Tau phosphorylation status at sites where only one of two enzymes (in this case PP2A) is involved in the regulation.

The main physiological function of the protein Tau is to promote the assembly and stabilization of the microtubule structure in neurons. Tau is a protein with multiple phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation is essential for its function (1Matsuo E.S. Shin R.W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Connor M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Of these, Alzheimer disease is the most prominent. Several kinases and phosphatases have been identified to regulate the phosphorylation of Tau.Among the various Tau kinases glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is of particular interest. GSK-3β has been shown to phosphorylate Tau at most sites found hyperphosphorylated in PHFs (9Gong C.X. Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neural Transm. 2005; 112: 813-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-9, which is the target for several kinases, including Akt (10Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Activated Akt maintains GSK3-β in a Ser-9-phosphorylated, inhibited state, whereas decreases in Akt activity lead to dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3β. This regulatory unit plays an essential role in PI3K-mediated signal transduction, like the insulin-signaling pathway.Several prospective and retrospective epidemiological findings indicate that type II diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for developing Alzheimer disease (11Ott A.

It was hypothesized that the disease-related disturbances in either the insulin-receptor binding or transduction pathway leads to overactivated GSK-3β creating hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in neurons. In vitro and in vivo studies dealing with this subject showed contradictory results (14Hong M. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3320-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study we found that not only PI3K but also mTor signaling participates in the regulation of GSK-3β-mediated Tau phosphorylation. This is important insofar as mTor kinase influences the activity of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (20Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). PP2A is known to be the major Tau phosphatase, antagonizing the phosphorylation mediated by Tau kinases (21Tian Q. Wang J. NeuroSignals. 2002; 11: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).To gain more insight into this regulation, we systematically influenced either the insulin/PI3K signaling (LY294002 treatment and insulin boost) or the mTor kinase signaling (AICAR and rapamycin treatment) in cultured murine neurons. We detected sustained changes (up to 16 h) in both the specific activity of PP2A and in the phosphorylation of activity-regulating sites of Akt (Ser-473), GSK-3β (Ser-9), and mTor (Ser-2448). We found that PP2A and GSK-3β were simultaneously activated during an inhibition of PI3K and mTor, whereas they were both repressed during a stimulation of PI3K with insulin. This equilibrium was established by the regulatory coupling of mTor with the PI3K signaling and by a dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 mediated by PP2A. The changes in activities of PP2A and GSK-3β seemed to be well balanced, explaining why the phosphorylation of Tau protein at GSK-3β/PP2A-dependent sites remained unchanged over a long period. The investigation of Tau at Ser-262 showed that interferences in the insulin/PI3K and mTor signaling potentially affects phosphorylation when only one of the enzymes, in this case the PP2A, is involved in the regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Neuronal Cell Culture—Neuron cultures were prepared from cortices of embryonic mice (E16, C57B6). Cells were plated (50,000 cells/cm2) in poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated culture flasks (BD Falcon). Cells were grown in Neurobasal medium, containing the supplement B-27, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (all Invitrogen). Cultures were kept at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere (5% CO2). Half of the medium was replaced by fresh medium every 3 days. For experiments 7-day-old cultures were used.Culture Conditions for Insulin Treatment—Insulin is part of the B-27 supplement. The supplement contains several other components that are essential for neuronal survival and hence could not be completely omitted. To lower the insulin concentration in cultures, we used medium without the B-27 supplement for the last feeding 24 h before the experiments were started.Treatments of Cell Cultures—The part of the study in which we interfered either in the insulin/PI3Kor mTor signaling pathway was designed as a long term experiment. Samples were taken after 0.5, 1, 6, and 16 h. Experiments in which we specifically inhibited the GSK-3β or PP2A were performed within 2 h, and samples were taken at regular intervals of 20 or 30 min. Substances were applied to the cells at concentrations that are listed as follows: okadaic acid (Sigma) at 20, 40, 60, and 100 nm, from a 100 μm stock solution in Me2SO (Sigma); lithium chloride (Sigma) at 15 mm, from a 1 m stock solution in PBS; AICAR (Calbiochem) at 1 mm, from 0.1 m stock solution in PBS; insulin (Sigma) at 200 nm, from a 200 μm stock solution in 0.05 n HCl; LY294002 (Calbiochem) at 15 μm, from a 5 mm stock solution in Me2SO; and rapamycin (Calbiochem) at 20 ng/ml, from a ready to use stock solution.Sample Preparation—Cells grown in 1 flask were washed twice with 4 ml of cold (4 °C) PBS and subsequently scraped into 300 μl of 4 °C cold extraction buffer: 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, protease/inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 20 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma), and 100 nm okadaic acid (Sigma) from a 100 μm stock solution in Me2SO. After transferring into chilled Eppendorf tubes, neurons were disintegrated with 20 pulses (100 watts, intervals of 0.5-s pulses and 0.5-s pause), using a UP100H sonifier equipped with a MS1 sonotrode (Dr. Hielscher) on ice. Extracts were centrifuged for 10 min, 10,000 × g (Eppendorf centrifuge 5804 R), at 4 °C. From the supernatant an aliquot was taken for the protein quantification (BCA, Amersham Biosciences). The remaining cell extract was supplemented with SDS sample buffer, heated at 60 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, room temperature). The supernatants were stored at –20 °C until further use.SDS-PAGE/Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of protein from control and treated cells were separated on 10 and 6% (v/v) SDS-PAGE and blotted semi-dry (Bio-Rad, minigels and transfer unit) on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking for 1 h in 10% (w/v) skimmed milk (Merck) in TBST (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), the antibodies, diluted in TBST containing 3% (w/v) dried skimmed milk, were applied and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The concentrations of the individual antibodies are listed below. After washings with TBST, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories), diluted 1:4,000 in TBST, was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washings (TBST), bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECLPlus detection kit, Amersham Biosciences). Hyperfilms (Amersham Biosciences) were used for the detection. The films were scanned with an Epson 1680 professional scanner. The optical densities and the areas of bands were measured using the NIH-image software. Calculation of volumes (area × density) and statistics were performed in EXCEL (Microsoft).Determination of Total Tau Protein—For measuring total Tau protein, protein blots were treated with alkaline phosphatase followed by probing Tau with Tau-1 antibody for dephosphorylated sites Ser-199/Ser-202. The efficiency of dephosphorylation was tested with the AT8 antibody. The procedure described below allows a reliable measurement of total Tau protein. After blocking, blots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) diluted to 20 units/ml in alkaline reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C. After three washings with TBST, the antibody Tau-1 (Roche Applied Science) was applied, diluted 1:3000 in TBST, 3% (w/v) dried skimmed milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Treatments with secondary antibody, ECL-based detection, and volumetric measurements were performed as described above.Antibodies Used for Analysis—For Tau analysis, AT8 (Innogenetics) recognizing phosphorylation at Ser-202/Thr-205 was diluted 1:2000. For Tau-1 recognizing dephosphorylation at Ser-199/Ser-202 (Roche Applied Science) was diluted 1:3000. PHF1 (generous gift from Peter Davies) specific for phosphorylated Ser-396/Ser-404 was diluted 1:2000. 12E8 (Athena Neurosciences) binding at phosphorylated Ser-262 was diluted 1:2000. For signal transduction, all antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and were diluted 1:1000 prior to use. Phosphorylation-independent antibodies for measuring total protein were as follows: Akt (9272), GSK-3β (9315), and mTor (2972). Phosphorylation-dependent antibodies specific for activity-regulating sites were as follows: phospho-Akt Ser-473 (9271), phospho-GSK-3β Ser-9 (9336), and phospho-mTor Ser-2448 (2971).Phosphatase 2A Activity—We used a phosphatase activity assay from Upstate for measuring the PP2A activity in cell extracts. The procedures of sample preparation, immune precipitation, and substrate incubation were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The color development of liberated phosphate was performed in 96-well plastic-plates (Falcon), and absorbance (630 nm) was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Kontron). Linearity of the test was confirmed in a range of 200–1000 μg of protein used for the initial immune precipitation. Liberated phosphate was read off from a standard curve (0–1000 pmol of phosphate in 125 μl), and specific activity was calculated as liberated phosphate in pmol/mg protein/min.Statistics—Mean values, analysis of variance, and significance (Student's t test) were calculated in EXCEL (Microsoft).RESULTSSignificance of GSK-3β and PP2A for the Phosphorylation of Tau Epitopes—To test the involvement of the PP2A and the GSK-3β on the Tau phosphorylation at certain phosphorylation sites, we treated cell cultures for 1 h with okadaic acid (100 nm), an inhibitor of the PP2A, and in a second experiment with lithium chloride (15 mm), an inhibitor of the GSK-3β. Phosphorylation at the epitopes recognized by the antibodies AT8, PHF1, and Tau-1 showed strong dependence on both the PP2A and the GSK-3β activity (Fig. 1). The inhibition of PP2A led to a strong increase of PHF1 and AT8-positive Tau, whereas the Tau fraction positive for Tau-1 antibody nearly vanished after 1 h. In this context we can confirm data published by Lovestone et al. (22Lovestone S. Davis D.R. Webster M.-T. Kaech S. Brion J.-P. Matus A. Anderton B.H. Biol. Psychiatry. 1999; 45: 995-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), showing inverse binding of Tau-1 and AT8 antibodies. Both antibodies share the phosphorylation site Ser-202 recognized by AT8 in its phosphorylated form and by Tau-1 only in its dephosphorylated form. Inhibition of the GSK-3β with lithium chloride led to a massive decline of phosphorylated Tau at AT8 and PHF1 epitope accompanied by the increase of Tau protein positive for Tau-1 antibody (Fig. 1).Inhibition of the PI3K with LY294002—For effects on total protein levels, the administration of the PI3K inhibitor reduced the protein levels of total GSK and Tau protein after an incubation of 16 h (Fig. 2A). The protein load of the respective protein samples had to be adjusted for the subsequent determination of the phosphorylated form of the proteins. The levels of total Akt and mTor were not affected (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Changes in the specific concentrations of proteins.

This reduction persisted during the whole period of observation. From the state of GSK-3β phosphorylation, we predicted an increase in the phosphorylation of Tau protein at GSK-3β relevant epitopes Ser-199/Ser-202, Ser-202/Thr-205, and Ser-396/Ser-404. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation at these epitopes was not elevated; on the contrary, the phosphorylation values fell significantly below those of the control after 16 h (Fig. 4A), concomitant with the reduced levels of total GSK protein (Fig. 2A). The antagonist of GSK-3β in Tau phosphorylation is the phosphatase PP2A. The activity of this enzyme is negatively regulated by mTor raptor. We determined the activity of mTor by analyzing its phosphorylation at Ser-2448. We detected a rapid and strong decline in the phosphorylation of this site, persisting over the entire observation period (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we measured the PP2A activity in extracts of neurons treated for 1 and 16 h with LY294002. In both extracts the specific activity of the PP2A was strongly increased over control extracts (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained with wortmannin (data not shown).FIGURE 3Changes in the specific concentrations of phosphorylated kinases. GSK-3β (Ser-9), Akt (Ser-473), and mTor (Ser-2448) during treatments with LY294002 (15 μm)(A), insulin (200 nm boost) (B), and AICAR (1 mm) for 0. 5, 1, 6 and 16 h; n = 3, for each treatment and time point (C).

B, insulin induced significant increases in phosphorylated Akt (p values for 0.5 h, <0.01; 1 h, <0.05; 6 h, <0.01), phosphorylated GSK (p values for 0.5 h, <0.01; 1 h, <0.005; 6 h, <0.05), and phosphorylated mTor (p values for 0.5 h, <0.05; 1 h, <0.005; 6 h, <0.01), which lasted for 6 h. C, AICAR treatments for 1–16 h increased phosphorylation of Akt significantly (p values for 1 h, <0.005; 6 h, <0.01; 16 h, <0.005), whereas the phosphorylation of GSK (p values for 1 h, <0.05; 6 h, <0.05; 16 h, <0.01) and mTor (p values for 1 h, <0.05; 6 h, <0.05; 16 h, <0.01) were significantly reduced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Changes in Tau phosphorylation at the epitopes.

Protein extracts from neuronal cell cultures were analyzed and treated for 1 and 16 h with the inhibitor or with solvent, respectively.

Note that insulin significantly decreased the specific PP2A-activity (∼0.5-fold) measured at these points, (p values for 1 h, <0.05; 6 h, <0.05). C, influence of AICAR treatments (1 mm) on the specific activity of PP2A. Protein extracts from neuronal cell cultures were analyzed, treated for 1 and 16 h with the AMPK activator, or with the solvent PBS. Note that AICAR induced strong increases in the specific PP2A activity (∼3-fold) at the two points (p values for 1 h, <0.001; 16 h, <0.005).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of the Insulin Stimulus—As already mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” we could not cultivate the neurons without insulin, which is part of the supplement B-27. But the strategy to omit B-27 in the last medium used for feeding 1 day before the experiments with insulin started ensured that the neurons responded transiently to the boost of insulin.Effects on Total Protein Levels—The levels of the proteins examined in this study were unaffected by the administration of insulin (Fig. 2B).Effects on the Phosphorylation of Proteins and PP2A Activity—The phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and GSK-3β at Ser-9 was significantly elevated in extracts obtained from insulin-treated neurons. This increase was transient and vanished during prolonged incubation (16 h) (Fig. 3B). On the basis of these data we expected a reduced phosphorylation of the Tau protein at GSK-3β-dependent epitopes, at least for the first three points of measurement. But the phosphorylation at the Tau-1, AT8, and PHF-1 epitopes was largely stable (Fig. 4B). Already the experiments with blocked PI3K showed that the phosphorylation of mTor at Ser-2448 is influenced by Akt. We detected a significant increase in phosphorylation of mTor for a period that was also marked by an elevated phosphorylation of Akt (0.5, 1, and 6 h) (Fig. 3B). The measurement of the PP2A activity at two points (1 and 6 h) revealed that the specific activity of this phosphatase was significantly reduced in extracts from insulin-treated neurons (Fig. 5B).Activation of the AMPK with AICAR—We used AICAR for the stimulation of the neuronal AMPK; alternatively Metformin (2.5 mm) was used which elicited similar effects (data not shown).Effects on Total Protein Levels—A prolonged administration of the AMPK activator (16 h) reduced the protein levels of total GSK and Tau protein (Fig. 2C). The reduction in Tau protein was not significant, whereas the decrease in total GSK was. However, the protein load for the subsequent determination of phosphorylated protein was adapted not only for GSK-3β but also for Tau protein, to compensate for the reduced protein concentrations. The levels of total Akt and mTor were not affected (Fig. 2C).Effects on the Phosphorylation of Proteins and PP2A Activity—It is described that activation of AMPK stimulates the activity of Akt, indicated by an increased phosphorylation at Ser-473. Extracts of AICAR-treated neurons also showed significant increases in Akt phosphorylation during the whole period of surveillance (Fig. 3C). As a consequence of the activated Akt, we expected an increase of GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser-9. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of GSK-3β was significantly reduced at any point (Fig. 3C). The phosphorylation of Tau protein at the GSK3-β-dependent sites was stable after incubations that lasted for 0.5, 1, and 6 h. After 16 h we noticed a significant reduction in phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), an effect that was also observed during the inhibition of PI3K (see above) and that was also accompanied with reduced amounts of total GSK3-β. The AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 and thereby inactivates the mTor. We investigated the phosphorylation of the activity-regulating site Ser-2448. We detected reduced phosphorylation of this site after 1 h, an effect that lasted for at least 16 h (Fig. 3C). The dephosphorylation at Ser-2448 indicates inhibited mTor. This should have consequences for the activity of the PP2A. The cell extracts obtained from cultures treated for 1 and 16 h with AICAR expressed increased specific PP2A activities that were elevated nearly 3-fold over the control (Fig. 5C). The concomitant elevations of both PP2A and GSK activities probably could explain the stable Tau phosphorylation.Influence of PP2A on Akt and GSK-3β Phosphorylation—The observation that the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 was reduced during AICAR treatment needed to be explained. To test a possible cross-talk between PP2A and GSK-3β, we treated neurons with okadaic acid, which is an inhibitor of the PP2A. The inhibition of PP2A increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9. This effect depended on the concentration of the inhibitor. This was tested in a range described to be suitable for a specific PP2A inhibition (20–100 nm) (Fig. 6). Using the same extracts, we investigated the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. Unlike the case of the GSK-3β, here we could not detect any changes in the phosphorylation of this kinase (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Immunoblots, effects of PP2A inhibition on GSK-3β (Ser-9) and Akt (Ser-473) phosphorylation.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role among the common stress factors--directly--through incomplete reduction of O(2) during respiration, or indirectly--caused by other stressing factors. Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid acts as a scavenger of ROS, thereby potentially protecting cells from harmful oxidative products. While most eukaryotes synthesize ascorbic acid, yeast cells produce erythro-ascorbic acid instead. The actual importance of this antioxidant substance for the yeast is still a subject of scientific debate.We set out to enable Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to produce ascorbic acid intracellularly to protect the cells from detrimental effects of environmental stresses. We report for the first time the biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid from D-glucose by metabolically engineered yeast cells. The amount of L-ascorbic acid produced leads to an improved robustness of the recombinant cells when they are subjected to stress conditions as often met during industrial fermentations. Not only resistance against oxidative agents as H(2)O(2) is increased, but also the tolerance to low pH and weak organic acids at low pH is increased.This platform provides a new tool whose commercial applications may have a substantial impact on bio-industrial production of Vitamin C. Furthermore, we propose S. cerevisiae cells endogenously producing vitamin C as a cellular model to study the genesis/protection of ROS as well as genotoxicity."

Homocysteine is linked to lipid metabolism through the methionine cycle and the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methyltransferase, which is responsible for the synthesis of 20–40% of liver PC. The goal of the present study was to determine if the reduced methylation capacity in HHcy is associated with alterations in liver phospholipid and fatty acid metabolism. Mice heterozygous for disruption of cystathionine β-synthase (Cbs+/-) fed a diet to induce HHcy (HH diet) had higher (p < 0.001) plasma total homocysteine (30.8 ± 4.4 μm, mean ± S.E.) than C57BL/6 mice (Cbs+/+) fed the HH diet (7.0 ± 1.1 μm) or Cbs+/+ mice fed a control diet (2.3 ± 0.3 μm). Mild and moderate HHcy was accompanied by lower adenosylmethionine/adenosylhomocysteine ratios (p < 0.05), higher PE (p < 0.05) and PE/PC ratios (p < 0.01), lower PE methyltransferase activity (p < 0.001), and higher linoleic acid (p < 0.05) and lower arachidonic acid (p < 0.05) in PE. Mice with moderate HHcy also had higher linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid (p < 0.05) and lower arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (p < 0.05) in liver PC. The first step in the desaturation and elongation of linoleic acid and linolenic acid to arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively, is catalyzed by Δ(6)-desaturase (encoded by Fads2). We found hypermethylation of the Fads2 promoter (p < 0.01), lower Fads2 mRNA (p < 0.05), and lower Δ(6)-desaturase activity (p < 0.001) in liver from mice with HHcy.

Within the cycle, methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which serves as a methyl donor for numerous methyl acceptors, including phospholipids, DNA, RNA, protein, histones, and neurotransmitters (14Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) is produced as a byproduct of methyl donation, and homocysteine is formed through the (reversible) liberation of adenosine from AdoHcy. In human subjects with HHcy, intracellular concentrations of AdoHcy may increase, resulting in a lower AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, diminished methylation capacity, and global DNA hypomethylation (15Yi P.

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in liver occurs by two pathways, both of which are linked to homocysteine via the methionine cycle. One pathway of PC synthesis is liver-specific and involves the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with three AdoMet molecules to form PC by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT, EC 2.1.1.17) (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, is responsible for the synthesis of the majority of liver PC but requires preformed choline derived from the diet or the PEMT pathway. Through this requirement for choline, the CDP-choline pathway is linked to homocysteine metabolism, because choline can be oxidized to form betaine, which can also serve as a methyl donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The rate-limiting step in the CDP-choline pathway is the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15), following which CDP-choline is transferred to 1,2-diacylglycerol (19Vance J.E.

Phosphatidylcholine synthesized via the PEMT pathway has higher levels of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) at the sn-2 position, whereas PC produced via the CDP-choline pathway has higher monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (18:1n-9) and stearic acid (18:0) in the sn-1 position (20Ridgway N.D.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the reduced tissue methylation capacity in HHcy is accompanied by changes in the methylation and expression of Fads2 and alterations in liver phospholipids and long chain fatty acids. We chose to focus our study on Fads2, because it encodes Δ(6)-desaturase (EC 1.14.19.3), which catalyzes the first step in the desaturation and elongation of the dietary essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and linolenic acid (18:3n-3), to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), respectively (22Nakamura M.T. Nara T.Y. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 345-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). We speculate that alterations in liver phospholipid and fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the vascular pathology observed in HHcy because of the central role of liver in secreting phospholipids and fatty acids into plasma for subsequent delivery to other tissues. We used Cbs+/- mice in these studies because they are susceptible to diet-induced increases in plasma tHcy, have reduced tissue methylation capacity, and show enhanced sensitivity to homocysteine-related endothelial dysfunction in aorta and mesenteric and cerebral arterioles (4Dayal S. Bottiglieri T. Arning E. Maeda N. Malinow M.R. Sigmund C.D. Heistad D.D. Faraci F.M. Lentz S.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 5Eberhardt R.T.

Our findings demonstrate that the reduced methylation capacity in mice with HHcy is associated with hypermethylation of Fads2, lower Fads2 mRNA, and lower Δ(6)-desaturase activity in liver. We also found higher PE/PC ratios in liver, primarily due to higher levels of PE with little changes in PC, and lower levels of PEMT activity in mice with HHcy. This was accompanied by higher levels of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 and lower levels of 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 in liver PC, and higher levels of 18:2n-6 and lower levels of 20:4n-6 in liver PE. These findings suggest that the reduced hepatic methylation capacity in HHcy is associated with methylation silencing of Fads2 expression resulting in impaired synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and elevation of PE due to reduced synthesis of PC via the PEMT pathway. Mice and Experimental Protocol—Mice heterozygous for targeted disruption of the Cbs gene (Cbs+/-) (23Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), on a C57BL/6 background, and their wild-type C57BL/6 littermates (Cbs+/+) were used in the study. Genotyping for the wild-type Cbs allele was conducted by PCR as described previously (18Devlin A.M. Bottiglieri T. Domann F.E. Lentz S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25506-25511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, genotyping for the disrupted Cbs allele, Cbstm1Unc, was accomplished by PCR using the P10 primer and a primer corresponding to the neo cassette used in the targeted disruption (23Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). At weaning, Cbs+/- and Cbs+/+ mice were fed either a control diet (TD 05108, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or a hyperhomocysteinemic (HH) diet (TD 00205, Harlan Teklad) for 3–9 weeks. The HH diet has been previously used to induce HHcy and contained double the amount of methionine (8.2 g/kg), low amounts of folic acid (0.2 mg/kg), and succinyl sulfathiazole (5.0 g/kg) to inhibit growth of intestinal bacteria, another source of folic acid (6Devlin A.M.

The control and HH diets contained identical amounts of choline, riboflavin, pyridoxine, cobalamin, and cysteine, but the control diet contained 4.0 g/kg methionine and 4.0 mg/kg folic acid. Both diets were devoid of cholesterol and supplied 14 and 17%, respectively, of total energy from soybean oil, which contains 55% 18:2n-6 and 8% 18:3n-3. At 6–12 weeks of age, mice were anesthetized with 1% Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 0.3 ml/10 g body weight, intraperitoneally), and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA (final concentration, 5 mm). Blood was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and plasma was collected, immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until later analysis of tHcy. Samples of liver were immediately deproteinized in ice-cold 0.4 m perchloric acid, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatant fraction was immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C for later analysis for AdoMet and AdoHcy. Additional samples of liver were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for later extraction of genomic DNA and RNA. The protocol was approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Biochemical Analyses—Plasma tHcy, defined as the total concentration of homocysteine after quantitative reductive cleavage of all disulfide bonds, was measured using a modified high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection (24Ubbink J.B. Hayward Vermaak W.J. Bissbort S. J Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1991; 565: 441-446Crossref Scopus (637) Google Scholar). AdoMet and AdoHcy levels in liver were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using UV detection as described (25Bottiglieri T. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1990; 4: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted from total liver and liver microsomal fractions (prepared as described below) by the method of Folch et al. (26Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen, the lipids were solubilized in chloroform:methanol:acetone:hexane (2.0:3.0:0.5:0.5, v/v), and individual classes of lipids were separated using a Waters 2690 Alliance high-performance liquid chromatograph (Waters Limited, Milford, MA). The separated lipid classes were detected and quantified by evaporative light scattering detection (Model 2000, Alltech, Mandel Scientific, Guelph, Canada) as described previously (27Innis S.M. Dyer R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1529-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were quantified as their respective methyl esters by gas-liquid chromatography using heptadecanoic acid (17:0) as the internal standard on a Varian 3400 gas-liquid chromatograph (Varian Canada, Mississauga, Canada) equipped with a flame ionization detector (27Innis S.M. Dyer R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1529-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For analysis of PEMT activity, microsomal fractions of liver samples were prepared and PEMT activity determined by the method of Ridgeway and Vance (28Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Samples of liver were homogenized in a 225 mm sucrose and 25 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.8 containing 10 mm glutathione, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 20 min to remove debris followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g for 20 min to pellet mitochondrial and nuclear fractions. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min to pellet microsomes. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm potassium chloride, 40 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 30 mm EDTA at pH 7.2, and protein concentrations were determined using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) based on the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For PEMT activity, 25 μg of protein of microsomal fractions was incubated with phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). The methylated lipids were then extracted by the method of Folch (26Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by separation by TLC using chloroform: methylacetate:n-propanol:methanol:0.25% potassium chloride (28:25:25:10:7, v/v), and the phospholipid bands were visualized by exposure to 2,7-dichlorofluroscein (Supelco Inc.). Individual bands were scraped, and the incorporation of S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine into phospholipids was quantified using a Microbeta TriLux Scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Δ(6)-Desaturase activity was also determined in microsomal fractions (1 mg of protein) following the previously described method of Garg et al. (30Garg M.L. Sebokova E. Thomson A.B.R. Clandinin M.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Bisulfite Pyrosequencing—The CpG-rich region of the Fads2 promoter was identified by in silico analysis using the University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, genome browser (31Consortium Mouse Genome Sequencing Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5420) Google Scholar) and MethPrimer (32Li L.C. Dahiya R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). The percent methylation of CpG sites within the Fads2 promoter (Fig. 4) were quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing (33Dupont J.M. Tost J. Jammes H. Gut I.G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 333: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from liver using the DNeasy kit and included RNase I treatment (Qiagen). Genomic DNA samples (0.5–1 μg) were bisulfite-treated using the EZTM DNA Methylation Kit (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd, Hornby, Canada) and stored at -20 °C until further analysis. A 253-bp fragment corresponding to a portion of the Fads2 promoter between -477 and -224 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4A) was amplified by PCR from bisulfite-treated DNA. The PCR reaction used HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and the following primers: PMFads2F, 5′-GAAAGATTTTTTTGGGTTAATGG-3′ and PMFads2RB, 5′-ACTTCCCAATACCCCCAAAC-3′ (IDT Inc., Coralville, IA), with the reverse primer containing a biotin at the 5′-end. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 15 min followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were purified and sequenced using a PyroMark MD System (Biotage, Foxboro, MA) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol and the sequencing primer: PMFads2S, 5′-TGTTGATTATTGTGGAAAT-3′ (IDT Inc.). The sequencing primer was designed to sequence a 194-bp region of the 253-bp PCR product that contains 11 CpG sites (Fig. 4A). Samples were analyzed in duplicate, and the percent methylation at each CpG site was quantified using the Pyro Q-CpG software, version 1.0.9 (Biotage). Real-time PCR Quantification of mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from liver using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and included DNase I treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Integrity of the RNA was assessed by confirming the presence of 18 S and 28 S rRNA on agarose gels. Synthesis of cDNA was accomplished using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems). Liver RNA samples (1.0 μg) were incubated with 5.0 units/μl Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase, 1× random primer mix, 1× dNTP mix, 1× Reverse Transcription Buffer in a final reaction volume of 80 μl. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h and then stored at -20 °C until later quantification of transcripts. Fads2, Pcty1a, and Pemt mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR using the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt) (34Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar) of relative quantification and commercially available primers and TaqMan MGB probes (FAM-fluorescein dye-labeled) from Applied Biosystems specific for Fads2 (Mm00517221), Pcyt1a (Mm00447774), and Pemt (Mm00839436). β-Actin served as the endogenous control in the ΔΔCt assay with levels quantified using mouse ACTB endogenous control primers and TaqMan MGB probes (FAM-dye-labeled, Applied Biosystems). Samples (0.1 μl of cDNA reaction) were incubated with 1× TaqMan Universal PCR mix and 1× TaqMan primer/probe mix in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Samples were placed at 50 °C for 2 min followed by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min in a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of relative changes in expression were determined following the manufacturer's suggested protocol for a ΔΔCt assay, and data were analyzed using the 7500 System Sequence Detection software, version 1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was run in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated three separate times. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference test for multiple comparisons was used to compare findings in Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet, Cbs+/+ fed the HH diet, and Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet. These analyses were accomplished by SPSS for Windows version 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Effect of Diet and Cbs Genotype on Plasma tHcy Levels, Methylation Capacity, and Lipid Classes in Liver—Feeding the HH diet to Cbs+/- mice produced plasma tHcy levels of 30.8 ± 4.4 μm, significantly higher (p < 0.001) than levels of 7.0 ± 1.1 μm in Cbs+/+ mice fed the HH diet and levels of 2.3 ± 0.4 μm in Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 1A). The elevation in plasma tHcy in both the Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet was accompanied by a significant reduction in liver methylation capacity as determined by AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio. AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios in liver were significantly lower in Cbs+/+ mice (p < 0.05) and Cbs+/- mice (p < 0.001) fed the HH diet than in Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 1D). These differences were due primarily to higher levels of AdoHcy in mice fed the HH diet, levels of which were highest in Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet and significantly different than Cbs+/+ mice fed the HH diet (p < 0.05) and Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (p = 0.001) (Fig. 1C). No significant differences in levels of AdoMet in liver were observed between Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet and Cbs+/+ mice fed the HH diet and Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 1B). We also investigated whether HHcy was accompanied by changes in levels of major lipid classes in liver. Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet had significantly higher (p < 0.01) levels of triglyceride in liver than Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Table 1). We found no significant differences in levels of total cholesterol, free cholesterol, free fatty acids, or total phospholipids between Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet and Cbs+/+ mice fed the HH diet and Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Table 1).TABLE 1Changes in major lipid classes in liver from mice with hyperhomocysteinemia Values are means ± S.E.Lipid classDiet/Cbs genotype groupCbs+/+ control diet (n = 5–6)Cbs+/+ HH diet (n = 4–6)Cbs+/– HH diet (n = 7–8)Triglyceride (μg/mg of protein)38.68 ± 3.0049.37 ± 6.6163.83 ± 5.93ap < 0.01 versus Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet, as determined by one-way analysis of varianceTotal cholesterol (μg/mg of protein)24.58 ± 2.7729.32 ± 3.3727.16 ± 1.81Free cholesterol (μg/mg of protein)10.72 ± 0.5112.58 ± 1.3810.56 ± 0.30Free fatty acids (μg/mg of protein)11.12 ± 1.7312.88 ± 2.6615.91 ± 2.27Total phospholipid (μg/mg of protein)168.5 ± 10.1185.9 ± 18.2181.2 ± 2.00 Phosphatidylinositol16.98 ± 0.9419.15 ± 1.7417.79 ± 0.50 Phosphatidylserine6.10 ± 0.335.96 ± 0.166.59 ± 0.54 Sphingomyelin4.73 ± 0.355.27 ± 0.375.30 ± 0.11 Cardiolipin7.98 ± 0.449.62 ± 0.949.24 ± 0.34 Lysophosphatidylcholine2.80 ± 0.133.00 ± 0.193.33 ± 0.22a p < 0.01 versus Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet, as determined by one-way analysis of variance Open table in a new tab HHcy and Liver Phospholipids—The reduced liver methylation capacity in mice with HHcy was accompanied by higher PE/PC ratios in liver. PE/PC ratios were significantly higher in Cbs+/- mice (p < 0.001) and Cbs+/+ mice (p < 0.01) fed the HH diet than Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 2C). These differences were primarily due to significantly higher PE levels in liver of Cbs+/- mice (p < 0.001) and Cbs+/+ mice (p = 0.01) fed the HH diet than Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 2A) with no differences in liver PC levels between the groups (Fig. 2B). Notably, the PE/PC ratios were significantly inversely associated with the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios in liver (p = 0.001, r = 0.703). We also investigated whether mice with HHcy showed differences in expression of the genes encoding Pemt, responsible for the methylation of PE to PC, and, Pcyt1a, responsible for the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of PC via the CDP-choline pathway in liver (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Liver levels of Pemt mRNA were not significantly different between Cbs+/- mice and Cbs+/+ mice fed the HH diet and Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 3A). Similarly we found no differences in levels of Pcyt1a mRNA between the diet/genotype groups (Fig. 3C). However, we did find significantly lower levels of PEMT activity in liver of Cbs+/- mice (p < 0.001) and Cbs+/+ mice (p = 0.001) fed the HH diet than Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (Fig. 3B). This effect was greatest in Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet with levels of PEMT significantly lower"
https://openalex.org/W2018282805,"Background The etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) results from a combination of several risk factors that act synergistically and occurs in the same circumstances as those which lead to innate immunity activation. Pattern recognition molecules could be an important player in the initiation of an exaggerated inflammatory response leading to intestinal injury in NEC. Methodology/Principal Findings We specifically evaluated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), TLR-4, NOD2 and phosphorylated NF-κB (pNF-κB) after mucosal injury in a rat model of NEC induced by prematurity, systemic hypoxia, and a rich protein formula. In the control group (group 1), neonatal rats were full-term and breast-fed; in the experimental groups, rat pups were preterm at day 21 of gestation and rat-milk fed (group 2) or hand-gavaged with a protein rich formula after a hypoxia–reoxygenation procedure (group 3). Morphological mucosal changes in the small bowel were scored on hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen tissue sections using anti TLR-2 and active pNF-κB p65 antibodies. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess mRNA expression of NOD2, TLR-2 and TLR-4. Proliferation and apoptosis were studied in paraffin sections using anti Ki-67 and caspase-3 antibodies, respectively. The combination of immaturity, protein rich formula and a hypoxia–reoxygenation procedure induces pathological mucosal damage consistent with NEC. There was an overexpression of TLR-2, and pNF-κB in IECs that was correlated with the severity of mucosal damage, together with an increase of apoptotic IECs and markedly impaired proliferation. In addition, these immunological alterations appeared before severe mucosal damage. TLR-2 mRNA were also increased in NEC together with TLR-4 mRNA using real-time RT-PCR whereas NOD2 expression was unchanged. Conclusions/Significance These results show that this rat model of NEC induced mucosal injury, leading to a highly responsive IEC phenotype and suggesting that alterations in the innate immune system participates in the pathogenesis of NEC and are enhanced by prematurity."
https://openalex.org/W2162349773,"Background The surgical treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy is preceded by a pre-surgical evaluation period during which intracranial EEG recordings are performed to identify the epileptogenic network and provide a functional map of eloquent cerebral areas that need to be spared to minimize the risk of post-operative deficits. A growing body of research based on such invasive recordings indicates that cortical oscillations at various frequencies, especially in the gamma range (40 to 150 Hz), can provide efficient markers of task-related neural network activity. Principal Findings Here we introduce a novel real-time investigation framework for mapping human brain functions based on online visualization of the spectral power of the ongoing intracranial activity. The results obtained with the first two implanted epilepsy patients who used the proposed online system illustrate its feasibility and utility both for clinical applications, as a complementary tool to electrical stimulation for presurgical mapping purposes, and for basic research, as an exploratory tool used to detect correlations between behavior and oscillatory power modulations. Furthermore, our findings suggest a putative role for high gamma oscillations in higher-order auditory processing involved in speech and music perception. Conclusion/Significance The proposed real-time setup is a promising tool for presurgical mapping, the investigation of functional brain dynamics, and possibly for neurofeedback training and brain computer interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2062758674,"Emotion significantly strengthens the subjective recollective experience even when objective accuracy of the memory is not improved. Here, we examine if this modulation is related to the effect of emotion on hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation. Two critical predictions follow from this hypothesis. First, since consolidation is assumed to take time, the enhancement in the recollective experience for emotional compared to neutral memories should become more apparent following a delay. Second, if the emotion advantage is critically dependent on the hippocampus, then the effects should be reduced in amnesic patients with hippocampal damage. To test these predictions we examined the recollective experience for emotional and neutral photos at two retention intervals (Experiment 1), and in amnesics and controls (Experiment 2). Emotional memories were associated with an enhancement in the recollective experience that was greatest after a delay, whereas familiarity was not influenced by emotion. In amnesics with hippocampal damage the emotion effect on recollective experience was reduced. Surprisingly, however, these patients still showed a general memory advantage for emotional compared to neutral items, but this effect was manifest primarily as a facilitation of familiarity. The results support the consolidation hypothesis of recollective experience, but suggest that the effects of emotion on episodic memory are not exclusively hippocampally mediated. Rather, emotion may enhance recognition by facilitating familiarity when recollection is impaired due to hippocampal damage."

The growing fatty acid chain is bound covalently during chain elongation and reduction to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that is then able to access each catalytic site. In this work we report the high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of the isolated rat fatty acid synthase apoACP domain. The final ensemble of NMR structures and backbone 15N relaxation studies show that apoACP adopts a single, well defined fold. On conversion to the holo form, several small chemical shift changes are observed on the ACP for residues surrounding the phosphopantetheine attachment site (as monitored by backbone 1H-15N correlation experiments). However, there are negligible chemical shift changes when the holo form is modified to either the hexanoyl or palmitoyl forms. For further NMR analysis, a 13C,15N-labeled hexanoyl-ACP sample was prepared and full chemical shift assignments completed. Analysis of two-dimensional F2-filtered and three-dimensional 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments revealed no detectable NOEs to the acyl chain. These experiments demonstrate that unlike other FAS ACPs studied, this Type I ACP does not sequester a covalently linked acyl moiety, although transient interactions cannot be ruled out.

Science. 2006; 311: 1258-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) has provided key structural and mechanistic insights into this important enzyme. Although the resolution of the crystal is insufficient to discern the backbone and side chains, the electron density has permitted the authors to propose a model based on the structures of individual domains and homologous enzymes. The authors have proposed a “head to head” dimeric model that comprises a central core consisting of the enol-reductase, dehydratase (DH), and ketosynthase with the malonyl transferase and ketoreductase domains being located peripherally. Dimerization occurs through association of the KS domains. Notable absences in the crystal structure are the locations of the peripheral ACP and thioesterase domains, suggesting that the positions of the ACP and thioesterase domains are relatively mobile compared with the core of the FAS. fatty acid synthase acyl carrier protein ketosynthase polyketide synthase heteronuclear single quantrum coherence ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment root mean square holo-ACP synthase fatty acid synthase acyl carrier protein ketosynthase polyketide synthase heteronuclear single quantrum coherence ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment root mean square holo-ACP synthase In comparison, bacterial Type II FASs consist of discrete monofunctional proteins (4White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the Type II FAS ACP components are particularly well developed and have revealed the structural basis of acyl chain binding and the phenomenon of conformational switching. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli FAS butyryl (5Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), hexanoyl-, heptanoyl-, and decanoyl-ACPs (6Roujeinikova A. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. Slabas A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures of spinach FAS decanoyl- and stearoyl-ACPs have been reported (7Zornetzer G.A. Fox B.G. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5217-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These structures reveal that during fatty acid biosynthesis, fully saturated acyl chains are sequestered within a central cavity in the ACP formed through conformational changes in the protein. The fatty acid chain is sequestered within the hydrophobic core of the ACP perhaps to protect the thioester moiety from hydrolysis. Binding of the acyl chain also influences the dynamics of the ACPs. Spinach FAS holo-ACP exists in equilibrium between a folded and largely disordered form, however, upon acylation this equilibrium is shifted toward the folded form. At present the physiological role of switching of this, and other ACPs, is unknown (8Kim Y. Kovrigin E.L. Eletr Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Koglin A. Mofid M.R. Lohr F. Schafer B. Rogov V.V. Blum M.M. Mittag T. Marahiel M.A. Bernhard F. Dotsch V. Science. 2006; 312: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that switching confers allosteric regulation of the ACP, whereby its interaction with other enzymes may be modulated and controlled. Unlike the Type II ACPs, the acyl chain binding and dynamic properties of Type I ACPs are not well understood. We have previously reported the low resolution solution phase structure of the isolated rat FAS apoACP domain (10Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and found it to adopt an α helical bundle structure consistent with the Type II ACPs from fatty acid (11Mayo K.H. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) (12Crump M.P. Crosby J. Dempsey C.E. Parkinson J.A. Murray M. Hopwood D.A. Simpson T.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6000-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the rat FAS ACP can substitute for the E. coli FAS ACP (13Tropf S. Revill W.P. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. Schweizer M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in vivo and that it is recognized as a substrate by enzymes known to modify Type II ACPs including Streptomyces coelicolor holo-ACP synthase (ACPS) and malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase in vitro (10Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study we report the high-resolution NMR solution structure and 15N-relaxation properties of the rat FAS apoACP domain. Importantly, we demonstrate that upon acylation of the rat FAS ACP, there is no sequestration of either a hexanoyl or palmitoyl side chain. This may provide the first evidence for a mechanistically distinct role for the Type I ACP domains compared with their Type II homologues. Protein Expression and Purification—Rat FAS apoACP was recombinantly expressed from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the rat FAS ACP (amino acids 2114-2202) in the pET15b expression plasmid as previously described (13Tropf S. Revill W.P. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. Schweizer M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ACP was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by anion exchange chromatography on a HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) eluting with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl over 10 column volumes. 15N-Labeled ACP was obtained by growth and expression in M9 minimal media with 15N ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source. 15N,13C-Labeled ACP was obtained by growth and expression in M9 minimal media with [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source and [13C]glucose (2 g/liter) as the sole carbon source. NMR of Rat FAS ApoACP Domain—The protein was dissolved to a final concentration of 1.5 mm in 10% D2O, 90% H2O containing sodium deuteroacetate (50 mm, pH 5.5). All NMR spectra were collected on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with Z-pulsed field gradients. For 15N,13C-labeled ACP, 1H-15N sensitivity enhanced (14Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY, and two-dimensional constant time 1H-13C HSQC data sets were acquired (15Kay L.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These spectra supplemented the 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra gained previously (10Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed and viewed with NMRPipe (16Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar) and CcpN Analysis (17Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L.

For the acyl chain binding studies, standard sensitivity enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired. NMR of Rat FAS Hexanoyl-ACP Domain—A 13C,15N dual acquisition (CN) NOESY experiment (acquired with 150 ms mixing time) and a two-dimensional F2-filtered NOESY experiment with a 400-ms mixing time (19Peterson R.D. Theimer C.A. Wu H.H. Feigon J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were recorded on a 1.5 mm sample of [12C,14N]-hexanoyl-[13C,15N]-labeled rat FAS apoACP. In this sample both the hexanoyl group and phosphopantetheine side arm are not enriched with 13Cor 15N. Structure Calculation—Peak and shift lists were assigned manually using standard sequential assignment methods. Peak intensities were measured using the default CcpN Analysis program settings assuming a Gaussian peak shape. Additional backbone torsion angle restraints were obtained from chemical shift data using the TALOS algorithm (20Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 21Bonvin A.M. Houben K. Guenneugues M. Kaptein R. Boelens R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated using Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment (ARIA) 1.2 (22Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) in conjunction with CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) by means of a torsion angle dynamics procedure. ARIA has been developed for the automated assignment of NOESY spectra, where it cycles through a number of rounds of peak assignment and validation (by structure calculation using simulated annealing). At the end of first step the lowest energy structures are used to improve the peak assignment that is used in the next calculation cycle. This process was continued for nine iterations, with each step stricter in relation to accepted assignments, thus decreasing the ambiguity of the data and converging to an assignment that fits the experimental data. Calculation of the rat FAS apoACP domain structure was based on three separate ARIA runs with the resultant constraint list being checked manually at each stage. 200 structures were calculated in the final run with the 30 lowest energy structures selected and water refined. The quality of the structures was checked by PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (25Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). 15N Relaxation Analysis—15N-T1, T2, and 1H-15N NOE relaxation experiments were acquired on Varian Unity 600 MHz and Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometers at the University of Alberta, Canada, as previously described (26Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). For the T1 experiments 550-ms cosine-modulated rectangular pulses were employed with excitation maxima 2 kHz away from the carrier to minimally disturb the water resonance. At both 500 and 600 MHz T1 delays of 11.1, 55.5, 122.1, 199.8, 277.5, 388.5, 499.5, 666, 888, and 1110.0 ms were employed. For the T2 pulse sequence, the delay between transients was 2.5 s at 500 and 600 MHz and nitrogen powers were kept to a minimum (3.7 to 4.2 kHz, respectively) to minimize sample heating. At 600 MHz T2 delays of 16.3, 32.0, 58.0, 48.9, 65.2, 81.4, 97.7, 114.0, 130.3, 146.6, 162.9, and 179.1 ms were employed and at 500 MHz T2 delays of 16.6, 33.2, 49.8, 66.4, 83.0, 99.7, 116.3, 132.9, 149.5, 166.1, and 182.7 ms were utilized. 15N NOEs were measured by recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra with and without proton saturation. The spectra without NOE were recorded with delays of 5 s and spectra with NOE used 3 s of proton saturation and 2 s of delay to give the same total delay of 5 s between transients. T1 and T2 values were obtained by non-linear least squares fits of the amide cross-peak intensities to a two-parameter exponential decay. Uncertainties in the T1 and T2 values were estimated from non-linear least squares fits. Uncertainties in the NOE values were estimated from the base plane noise in two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded with and without proton saturation according to Farrow et al. (26Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Internal motions of the backbone 15N nuclei were modeled using reduced spectral density mapping as implemented by Ishima and Nagayama (27Ishima R. Nagayama K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and assuming a simple monotonic decay of the spectral density, J(ω), around frequencies ωH ± ωN (where ωH and ωN are the proton and nitrogen frequencies, respectively) and that J(ωH - ωN) = J(ωH) = J(ωH + ωN). Motions at the three frequencies, J(0), J(ωN), and J(0.87ωH) were derived. Due to the errors associated with deriving J(0.87ωH), this parameter was not interpreted (27Ishima R. Nagayama K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Acylation of Rat FAS ACP—ApoACP (100 μm) was acylated with ACPS (1 μm) and the corresponding acyl-CoA (500 μm) in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.8) with MgCl2 (1 mm). For the formation of palmitoyl-ACP, the ACP was acylated in the presence of 50 μm MgCl2, due to precipitation of the coenzyme at high Mg2+ concentrations (28Constantinides P.P. Steim J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Acylation was monitored by electrospray mass spectrometry. All samples were prepared as described by Winston and Fitzgerald (29Winston R.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 262: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and analyzed in positive ion mode on a QStar XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Structure of Rat FAS ApoACP—15N-Labeled and 15N-13C double labeled rat FAS apoACP were overexpressed and purified in a similar fashion to that described previously (10Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Routinely, 5-10 mg/liter of 15N-labeled and 3-5 mg/liter of 15N-13C double labeled rat FAS ACP was obtained. Spin systems were unambiguously assigned using standard multidimensional multinuclear NMR experiments, performed at 25 °C (pH 5.5). NOEs were automatically assigned using the ARIA algorithm (22Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 30Habeck M. Rieping W. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 379-402PubMed Google Scholar) and 200 structures were generated in the final calculation. The structures were based on a total of 1700 restraints, of which 330 were long range. Among these, 53 long range NOEs remained ambiguous (for example, the final structure may simultaneously satisfy two or more possible NOE assignments that cannot be discriminated against on the basis of chemical shift). Ambiguous restraints were checked manually along with any peaks rejected by the ARIA algorithm. The 30 lowest energy structures were selected and the structural statistics for this ensemble are summarized in Table 1. All NOEs were checked for consistency and accuracy at the end of the structure generation procedure. Experimental restraints were well satisfied with no NOE violations exceeding 0.3 Å. Over 95% of the angles fell within the most favorable or favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot (31Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar) and the ensemble gave good Z-score values (calculated with WHATCHECK) when compared with other published ACP structures and other NMR structures in general (32Nederveen A.J. Doreleijers J.F. Vranken W. Miller Z. Spronk C.A. Nabuurs S.B. Guntert P. Livny M. Markley J.L. Nilges M. Ulrich E.L. Kaptein R. Bonvin A.M.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1A shows the final ensemble of 30 rat FAS apoACP structures. The lack of short or long range NOEs in the N- and C-terminal regions resulted in poorly defined segments of structure over residues Gly2114 to Arg2120 and Ser2187 to Asn2202. Excluding these residues, the final family of structures had fewer residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot than previously reported (10Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reflecting the improvement obtained with implementing the greater number of restraints and spin diffusion corrections in the structure calculation. The overall fold of the family of conformers was well defined, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) over the backbone and heavy atoms in well defined regions of 0.55 and 0.91 Å, respectively. The ACP forms a helical bundle composed of four α-helices, helix I (Asp2121 to Ile2129), helix II (Val2155 to His2165), helix III (Ile2171 to Gln2176) and helix IV (Arg2180 to Met2185). A small turn was observed between residues 2144 and 2147 with NOEs only detected between residue (i) and residue (i+2) residues. Comparison of the closest to average structure (Fig. 1B) with that previously reported (Fig. 1C) showed that although the general fold of the previous structure was retained, the recalculated structure was more compact and better defined by virtue of a greater number of long range NOEs (330 versus 41). The greater compactness was predominantly due to the positions of helix I and III being unambiguously identified. The Loop Regions—There are 3 principal loop regions observed in the rat FAS ACP. Loop I runs from Leu2130 to Ser2143, connecting helix I to the small turn between residues 2144 and 2147, and has an r.m.s. deviation of 0.75 Å. The loop has just three exposed charged residues (Arg2133, Asp2134, and Asp2141) and four hydrophobic residues (Ile2132, Leu2135, Ile2138, and Leu2140) that pack alongside Leu2179 to form a miniature hydrophobic core. This core is spatially distinct from the main hydrophobic packing that stabilizes the four helices. Residues 2144-2151 form loop II, comprised of a well structured turn (2144-2147) followed by a short stretch of residues (2148-2150) connecting this to helix II. Finally loop III (residues Asp2166-Arg2172) shows additional hydrophobic contacts with both helix II, through contact of Val2168 and the side chain of Arg2158, and helix IV, with Leu2167 and Leu2169 packing against the hydrophobic Met2185. 15N Backbone Dynamics—At 500 and 600 MHz, complete 15N relaxation data could be obtained for 67 and 75 of the 89 residues of rat FAS apoACP, respectively. Missing residues included the N-terminal residue and 2 proline residues. T1, T2, and NOE values and associated errors are shown in Fig. 2, A-C, at both 500 and 600 MHz. For N-terminal residues 2115-2121 and the C-terminal residues 2187-2202, large T1 and T2 values and negative NOE values indicate that they are highly disordered in solution, in agreement with the structural data where few NOEs were observed. Loop I (residues 2130-2143) showed small increases in T1 and T2 and a reduction in the magnitude of heteronuclear NOEs indicating a degree of disorder. Backbone 15N nuclei with NOEs smaller than 0.65 are considered to be structured (33Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) and only residues 2132-2137 in loop I have values below this threshold. Over the remainder of the protein there were fairly uniform T1, T2, and NOE values with the exception of Asp2150 that displays shorter T2 values than expected, possibly indicating localized conformational exchange. To further interpret the relaxation data, the internal dynamics of the protein were analyzed using reduced spectral density mapping (34Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 35Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16733-16752Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This approach estimates the form of the spectral density function for each N-H vector at three frequencies, J(0), J(ωH), and J(0.87ωH). 4We avoided interpretation of the dynamics data using a Lipari-Szabo Model Free Approach despite acquiring data at two separate fields. This was due to difficulties in obtaining a single isotropic correlation time when data was fitted over structured (NOE > 0.65) residues (rc = 7.4 ns at 600 MHz and 8.2 ns at 500 MHz). The tumbling of the ACP was most likely modified by the long flexible C terminus (residues 68-89), the 8 unstructured residues at the N terminus and 6 residues in the loop connecting helices I and II, accounting for 40% of the total number of residues. Although the data could be interpreted using a fully asymmetric diffusion tensor the improvement in the fits over an axially symmetric diffusion model was not significant. J(0) is sensitive to motions on a broad range of time scales and essentially smaller J(0) values correlate with broader spectral density profiles and more rapid rotational fluctuations of a backbone N-H vector (36Peng J.W. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar). The J(0) values determined at 500 and 600 MHz are shown in Fig. 2D. J(0) values for the long C-terminal tail are small, ranging from 3.5 ns at the C-terminal of helix IV to below 0.5 ns at the C terminus. The average J(0) values over residues 2123-2131, 2139-2146, 2148-2161, and 2171-2180 were 3.6 ± 0.4 ns at 600 MHz and 3.6 ± 0.3 ns at 500 MHz, respectively. Importantly the values determined at 500 and 600 MHz show no systematic scaling with field that would suggest conformational averaging of the structure on a microsecond-millisecond time scale in this region. The exception to this is residue Asp2150 that shows an elevated J(0) value of 5.1 ns at 600 MHz and 3.9 at 500 MHz possibly indicating microsecond-millisecond conformational exchange. The values of J(0) over loop I (2130-2143), the latter part of loop II (2148-2150), and loop III (residues 2166-2172) are reduced and non-uniform and reflect the disorder observed in these regions in the structural model. J(ωN) samples the spectral density at 50 and 60 MHz for the 500 and 600 MHz data, respectively, and is sensitive to higher frequency internal motions. The values for J(ωN) at both fields are shown in Fig. 2E and these scaled with the field as expected (J(ωN) 500 > J(ωN) 600). The average J(ωN) is 0.41 ± 0.02 ns (600 MHz) and 0.47 ± 0.02 ns (500 MHz). J(ωN) values supplement the J(ωN) values and reveal more clearly the reduced spectral density, particularly over residues 50-56 that show a shift in J(ωN) to a distribution covering higher frequency motions. Over the helical regions, J(ωN) was uniform (helix I, 0.41 ns; helix II, 0.41 ns; helix III, 0.41 ns; helix IV, 0.41 ns). Acylation of Rat FAS ApoACP—Type II fatty acid and polyketide apoACPs can be phosphopantetheinylated and acylated in a single step using S. coelicolor phosphopantetheinyl transferase (ACPS) and a corresponding acyl-CoA (37Arthur C. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Rahman M.M. Simpson T.J. Soulas F. Spogli R. Szafranska A.E. Westcott J. Winfield C.J. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown previously that the same ACPS can be used to convert the Type I rat FAS ACP domain into the active holo form and, like other ACPs, transfer of the phosphopantetheine is not affected by a covalent modification of the phosphopantetheine thiol (10Reed M.A. Schweizer M.

We have therefore used ACPS in this work to form holo-, hexanoyl-, and palmitoyl-ACP from rat FAS apoACP and -CoA or respective acyl-CoAs.

https://openalex.org/W1974992652,"Honokiol, a small molecular weight natural product, has been shown to possess potent anti-neoplastic and anti-angiogenic properties. Its molecular mechanisms and the ability of anti-gastric cancer remain unknown. It has been shown that the anti-apoptotic function of the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) predicts that their induction in neoplastic cells can lead to cancer progression and drug resistance. We explored the effects of honokiol on the regulation of GRPs and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells and tumor growth.Treatment of various human gastric cancer cells with honokiol led to the induction of GRP94 cleavage, but did not affect GRP78. Silencing of GRP94 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) could induce cell apoptosis. Treatment of cells with honokiol or chemotherapeutics agent etoposide enhanced the increase in apoptosis and GRP94 degradation. The calpain activity and calpain-II (m-calpain) protein (but not calpain-I (micro-calpain)) level could also be increased by honokiol. Honokiol-induced GRP94 down-regulation and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells could be reversed by siRNA targeting calpain-II and calpain inhibitors. Furthermore, the results of immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation revealed a specific interaction of GRP94 with calpain-II in cells following honokiol treatment. We next observed that tumor GRP94 over-expression and tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice, which were inoculated with human gastric cancer cells MKN45, are markedly decreased by honokiol treatment.These results provide the first evidence that honokiol-induced calpain-II-mediated GRP94 cleavage causes human gastric cancer cell apoptosis. We further suggest that honokiol may be a possible therapeutic agent to improve clinical outcome of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2078030560,"Previous reports suggest heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) associates with endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) to increase nitric oxide (·NO) generation. Ansamycin inhibition of chaperone-dependent activity increases eNOS generation of superoxide anion (O2·¯) upon enzyme activation. In the present study we identify where hsp90 binds to eNOS using overlapping decoy peptides based on the amino acid (aa) sequence of eNOS (291–420). B1, B2, and B3 peptides inhibited hsp90 association with eNOS in cell lysates from proliferating bovine aortic endothelial cells. B2 (aa 301–320), common to both B1 and B3, decreased stimulated ·NO production and hsp90 association in bovine aortic endothelial cells. The B2/B3 peptide was redesigned to TSB2 that includes a TAT protein transduction domain and shortened to 14 aa. TSB2 impaired vasodilation of isolated facialis arteries in vitro and in vivo and increased eNOS-dependent O2·¯ generation in native endothelial cells on mouse aortas, whereas a control peptide, TSB(Ctr), which has the four glutamic acids in TSB2 substituted with alanine, showed no such effects. Site-directed mutagenesis of eNOS at 310, 314, 318, and 323 Glu to Ala yields an eNOS mutant that exhibited reduced hsp90 association and generated O2·¯ rather than ·NO upon activation. Together, these data demonstrate that hsp90 associates with eNOS at aa 310–323. Moreover, a decoy peptide based on this sequence is sufficient to displace hsp90 from eNOS and uncouple eNOS activity from ·NO generation. Thus, Glu-310, Glu-314, Glu-318, and Glu-323 in eNOS, although each does not do much by itself, synergistically they increase “cooperativity” in the association step that is critical for maintaining hsp90-eNOS interactions and promoting coupled eNOS activity. Such chaperone-dependent signaling may play an important role in modulating the balance of ·NO and O2·¯ generation from eNOS and, therefore, vascular function.

Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) showed, using a yeast two-hybrid system, that hsp90 interacted with eNOS at amino acid (aa) 300–400 of eNOS. Previous studies by Pagano and co-workers (6Rey F.E. Cifuentes M.E. Kiarash A. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) showed that small peptides corresponding to a portion of gp91phox could act as decoy peptides to inhibit assembly of vascular NADPH oxidoreductase and, therefore, vascular O2·¯ generation. On the basis of these studies we reasoned that small peptides derived from the primary aa sequence of eNOS might be useful to determine where hsp90 bound on eNOS. Such knowledge might help in developing new tools for dissecting the cellular mechanisms by which hsp90 modulates eNOS function and subsequently EC-dependent vasodilation. The objectives here were to determine where hsp90 binds to eNOS by developing decoy peptides that could disrupt hsp90 interactions with eNOS and determine the critical sites in eNOS that are responsible for hsp90-eNOS interactions and, thus, coupled eNOS activity. Here we identify the location where hsp90 binds to eNOS and show that decoy peptides derived from this site in eNOS are potent inhibitors of stimulated ·NO production and eNOS-dependent vasodilation. Peptide Synthesis—Twelve overlapping peptides (B1–B12, 20-mers) were designed to span the entire region where hsp90 was reported to associate with eNOS (aa 291–420, bovine) (5Fontana J. Fulton D.

All peptides were made with C-terminal amide and N-terminal acetylation and HPLC-purified, and predicted molecular weights were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Preparation of Proliferating EC Lysates and Disruption of hsp90 Interactions with eNOS—BAEC were expanded and maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and mycotics. BAEC cultures were passaged with trypsin-EDTA and used for experiments between passage 5 and 7 (4Ou J. Ou Z. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory revealed that proliferating EC had much higher levels of hsp90 association with eNOS than confluent, non-proliferating EC (4Ou J. Ou Z. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify which eNOS-derived peptide disrupts hsp90 interactions with eNOS, the 12 different B peptides were incubated with cell lysates from proliferating BAEC cultures. Proliferating BAEC in 100-mm dishes (10–20 dishes) prepared as previously described (4Ou J. Ou Z. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1× protease inhibitors (Sigma), 1× phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)). Cell lysates were transferred to 1. 5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, placed on ice, and sonicated 2 times (30 s), and cell debris was isolated by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) (4Ou J. Ou Z. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Supernatants were removed from the cell debris and pooled, and cell protein was determined in the supernatants using BCA reagent (Pierce). An aliquot of the proliferating EC lysates (300 μg in 0.5 ml) was precleared with protein A/G (20 μl of a 50% slurry, 2 h at 4 °C) and then incubated with each of the individual decoy peptides (final concentration 4.3 μm) for 2 h at 4 °C. Next, eNOS was immunoprecipitated from the incubations using H32 antibody from BioMol (1 μg/100 μg of cell lysate) as previously described (4Ou J. Ou Z. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protein A/G (50 μl of a 50% slurry) was added to isolate the immunoprecipitates. eNOS and its associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel), transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for eNOS and hsp90 as described (4Ou J. Ou Z. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Effects of eNOS-derived Peptides on Stimulated ·NO Production and hsp90 Association with eNOS in BAEC Cultures—BAEC were cultured and maintained in 100-mm culture dishes until confluent. The eNOS-derived peptide B2, which possesses aa sequences that are common to B1 and B3, was incubated for 30 min with PEP1, a protein transduction domain peptide (7Morris M.C. Depollier J. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) (mole:mole = 1:20) and then added to the BAEC cultures at a final peptide concentration of 5 nm. BAEC cultures were incubated overnight with either nothing (control), PEP1 alone (transduction control), or B2+PEP1. These pretreated BAEC cultures were washed and incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing l-arginine (25 μm) at 37 °C for 15 min to obtain basal ·NO production or l-arginine (25 μm) + A23187 (5 μm), a calcium-ionophore to stimulate eNOS-dependent ·NO production. The incubation buffers were removed and stored on ice for immediate nitrite + nitrate analysis by ozone chemiluminescence as described (8Ou Z. Ou J. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). BAEC proteins were lysed in 400 μl of MOPS lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitors (Sigma), 1× phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)) and subjected to eNOS immunoprecipitation as described above. eNOS and the levels of associated hsp90 in the immunoprecipitates were determined by Western blot analysis as described above. Vasodilation Studies—Previous studies showed that vasodilation of facialis arteries of mice was an eNOS-dependent mechanism (3Ou J. Fontana J.T. Ou Z. Jones D.W. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Yu J.

Hillery C.A. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2337-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of B2 on vasodilation, we redesigned B2 to contain a PTD. The B2 peptide was also shortened to 14 aa (ELVLEVPLEHPTLE) with an Ala added at the N terminus with the TAT PTD (RKKRRQRRR) added N-terminal to the Ala linker, as described by Pagano and co-workers (6Rey F.E. Cifuentes M.E. Kiarash A. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This redesign yielded a new decoy peptide (RKKRRQRRR-A-ELVLEVPLEHPTLE), which we called TSB2. In designing a control peptide, TSB(Ctr) (RKKRRQRRR-A-ALVLAVPLAHPTLA), we reasoned that if Glu were important for binding, then replacing Glu with Ala would result in a peptide that would fail to bind to hsp90 and, therefore, fail to impair vasodilation. To test these ideas, TSB2 and TSB(Ctr) (2.9 μm) were incubated with separate facialis arteries from healthy C57BL/6 male mice, whose vasodilation is mediated 100% by eNOS (3Ou J. Fontana J.T. Ou Z.

Ten min later, excess peptides were removed by changing the buffer, and ACh-dose response curves of the preconstricted and pressurized vessels were determined as before (3Ou J. Fontana J.T. Ou Z.

To determine whether TSB2 peptide blocks the direct actions of ·NO, vasodilation responsive curves to an ·NO donor, DETA-NONOate, were measured on preconstricted and pressurized facialis arteries from healthy C57BL/6 male mice. The vessels were preincubated with either TSB2 or TSBSCR (scrambled TSB2 peptide, RKKRRQRRR-A-EALTELPVHLEELPV) (2.9 μm) for 10 min before the addition of DETA-NONOate. To determine chronic effects of the decoy peptide on vasodilation in mice ex vivo, we injected C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), male, 6 weeks) with TSB2 (1 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Facialis arteries from these mice and PBS-treated C57BL/6 mice were isolated and examined for changes in ACh-dependent vasodilation as described above (3Ou J. Fontana J.T. Ou Z. Jones D.W.

Effects of TSB2 on EC- and eNOS-dependent O2·¯ Generation in Situ—To determine whether TSB2 altered O2·¯ generation in native EC on vascular tissues, anesthetized C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by exsanguination, and aortas were perfused in situ at a rate of 2 ml/min with MOPS buffer containing TSB2 (2.9 μm) and dihydroethidine (DHE, 10 μm) in the absence and presence of l-NAME (200 μm) for 10 min followed by washout of excess, unreacted DHE with MOPS buffer alone. DHE is a cell-permeable probe that upon reaction with O2·¯ is converted to a fluorescent 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+) product that can be quantified by fluorescent microscopy or HPLC (2Pritchard Jr., K.A.

The intensity of the staining in each image taken from the confocal microscope was quantified by NIH image. Determining Which Glutamic Acids and the Extent to Which These Glu Residues in eNOS Are Important for hsp90 Association—To determine which Glu residues are important to eNOS, we synthesized a series of decoy peptides that had Glu residues systematically replaced by Ala residues. The ability of these peptides to disrupt the eNOS-hsp90 interactions was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation of eNOS as described before. Site-directed Mutagenesis of eNOS and Establishing HEK-293 Mutant eNOS Cell Lines—The cDNA for bovine eNOS was mutated at 310, 314, 318, and 323 such that when translated Glu residues were substituted by Ala residues. Four glutamic acid site mutations of eNOS (E310A, E314A, E318A, and E323A) were generated by overlap extension PCR as described by Fulton and Sessa and co-workers (12Jagnandan D. Sessa W.C. Fulton D.

The region of mutation was verified by automated sequencing in the Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Laboratory of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Mutant eNOS 310, 314, 318, and 323 Glu to Ala (eNOS-4A) in pcDNA3 was transfected into HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine and G418-selected, and individual clones were isolated and examined for levels of mutant eNOS expression. NADPH Consumption with Mutant eNOS—eNOS protein was extracted from transfected HEK-293 cells according to Osuka et al. (14Osuka K. Watanabe Y. Usuda N. Nakazawa A. Tokuda M. Yoshida J. Stroke. 2004; 35: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, WT-eNOS and eNOS-4A HEK-293 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 nm BH4, 1× protease inhibitors, 1× phosphatase inhibitors, pH 7.5) by incubating on ice for 30 min followed with sonicating at 10% power for 30 s twice. Supernatants of the lysates from centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) were incubated with 2′-5′-ADP-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The next day the beads were washed twice with the above buffer but without Nonidet P-40, and then eNOS was eluted from the beads using 10 mm NADPH. Eluents were then centrifuged through 30-kDa cutoff Microcon cups twice to remove NADPH. The eNOS crude extracts from this preparation were used for the NADPH consumption assay as described by Vasquez-Vivar et al. (15Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.

HEK-293 cell proteins were lysed in 400 μl of MOPS lysis buffer and subjected to eNOS immunoprecipitation as described above. eNOS and the levels of associated hsp90 and CaM in the immunoprecipitates were determined by Western blot analysis as described above. l-NAME-inhibitable O2·¯ Generation from Mutant eNOS-4A—To assess l-NAME-inhibitable O2·¯ generation from WT and mutant eNOS-4A, we quantified 2-OH-E+ production by HPLC (2Pritchard Jr., K.A.

Briefly, HEK-293 cells in 35-mm dishes were washed 2× with Dulbecco's PBS and then incubated in 2 ml of DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum, DHE (10 μm, final concentration), and A23187 (5 μm) with or without l-NAME (1 mm) at 37 °C for 30 min. The HEK cells cultures were washed 2× with Dulbecco's PBS and scraped into Dulbecco's PBS, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was lysed and sheared in 0.25 ml of Dulbecco's PBS solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 using a 0.5-inch 26-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe. After mixing, an aliquot was removed for protein analysis. Next, 0.5 ml of n-butanol was added to the microcentrifuge tubes and vortexed vigorously for 15 min. The microcentrifuge tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. An aliquot of 450 μl of the butanol phase was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and dried under a stream of argon gas at 37 °C. The dried residue was dissolved in water and quantified by HPLC (HP1100, Agilent Technologies) with fluorescence detection (excitation 510 and emission 595 nm) using authentic standards (2–10 μm) in the Free Radical Research Center as described (2Pritchard Jr., K.A.

Care was taken to minimize exposure of reagents and samples to light during incubations and analysis. Mice—Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Effects of eNOS-derived Peptides on hsp90 Association with eNOS in EC Lysates—Incubation of the 12 eNOS-derived peptides individually with aliquots of lysates of proliferating EC cultures revealed where hsp90 bound to eNOS. Immunoprecipitation eNOS and Western blot analysis for eNOS and hsp90 revealed that B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 all inhibited hsp90-eNOS interactions. B1 (291–310 aa), B2 (301–320 aa), and B3 (311–330 aa) significantly impaired association (Fig. 1, ∼80%, p < 0.05, n = 6). Effects of B2 on Basal and Stimulated eNOS-dependent ·NO Generation and hsp90 Association with eNOS—Because B2 contained aa sequences that were common to B1 and B3, we examined the effects of B2 on stimulated EC ·NO generation using the PTD peptide PEP1 to facilitate B2 uptake (for uptake efficiency, see the supplemental data). The B2:PEP1 mixture significantly inhibited basal and A23187-stimulated ·NO production compared with BAEC cultures treated with PEP1 alone or nothing (control) (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05, n = 3). Immunoprecipitates of eNOS from these test groups reveal the B2:PEP1 mixture markedly decreased hsp90 association not only under basal conditions but also when the cultures were stimulated with A23187 (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05, n = 3). B2 decreased hsp90 association to half that of the levels in BAEC cultures treated with PEP1 alone or nothing. Effects of Acute Disruption of hsp90 Association on EC- and eNOS-dependent Vasodilation—To further pinpoint the region in eNOS that is responsible for association with hsp90, we redesigned a peptide from B1 to B3 regions in eNOS that contain the four Glu residues. This peptide, SB2, with the sequence of ELVLEVPLEHPTLE, retained the ability to disrupt hsp90-eNOS interaction in BAEC lysates (Fig. 3A). Then a TAT PTD was added to SB2 to increase cellular uptake (for uptake efficiency, see supplemental data). The resultant peptide, TSB2, significantly decreased ACh-induced vasodilation by >50%, whereas the modified TSB(Ctr) had no effect on vasodilation compared with vehicle control (Fig. 3B, p < 0.02, n = 6). Failure of TSB2 to inhibit ·NO-mediated vasodilation from DETA-NONOate demonstrated that TSB2 disrupts cell signaling at a point upstream of ·NO (Fig. 3C, n = 4). Effects of Chronic Disruption of hsp90 Association on EC- and eNOS-dependent Vasodilation ex Vivo—If hsp90 association with eNOS is important for vascular function in vivo, then chronic TSB2 treatments should inhibit EC- and eNOS-dependent vasodilation in the C57BL/6 mice. TSB2 treatments of C57BL/6 mice decreased ACh-induced vasodilation of facialis arteries (Fig. 3D, p < 0.01, n = 6). During isolation we noted that the facialis arteries from control C57BL/6 mice had thin layers of connective tissue on the advential side of the vessel. When facialis arteries from TSB2-treated mice were examined, connective tissue on the surface of the vessel appeared as large, thick fibers crisscrossing the adventitia (data not shown). Effects of Disrupting hsp90 Association on eNOS-dependent O2·¯ Generation in Native EC—To test the hypothesis that disruption of hsp90 interactions with eNOS uncouples eNOS activity in native vascular EC, we perfused aortas of mice in situ with TSB2 and DHE under a physiological flow rate of 2 ml/min and then rapidly removed the vessels and analyzed the fluorescent intensity in the native EC by fluorescent confocal microscopy. TSB2 markedly increases 2-OH-E+ staining, an index of O2·¯ generation (Fig. 4, upper right compared with upper left), by a mechanism that could be inhibited in part by l-NAME (Fig. 4, lower right). On the basis that l-NAME is a substrate-specific inhibitor that blocks both ·NO and O2·¯ generation from eNOS (15Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N."
https://openalex.org/W2010235460,"The neuron loss characteristic of hippocampal sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy patients is thought to be the result of excitotoxic, rather than ischemic, injury. In this study, we assessed changes in vascular structure, gene expression, and the time course of neuronal degeneration in the cerebral cortex during the acute period after onset of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Immediately after 2 hr SE, the subgranular layers of somatosensory cortex exhibited a reduced vascular perfusion indicative of ischemia, whereas the immediately adjacent supragranular layers exhibited increased perfusion. Subgranular layers exhibited necrotic pathology, whereas the supergranular layers were characterized by a delayed (24 h after SE) degeneration apparently via programmed cell death. These results indicate that both excitotoxic and ischemic injuries occur during pilocarpine-induced SE. Both of these degenerative pathways, as well as the widespread and severe brain damage observed, should be considered when animal model-based data are compared to human pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1968833561,"Isotope (Na15NO3, (15NH4)SO4 or [13C]glucose) labeling was used to analyze chlorophyll synthesis and degradation rates in a set of Synechocystis mutants that lacked single or multiple small Cab-like proteins (SCPs), as well as photosystem I or II. When all five small Cab-like proteins were inactivated in the wild-type background, chlorophyll stability was not affected unless the scpABCDE- strain was grown at a moderately high light intensity of 100–300 μmol photons m-2 s-1. However, the half-life time of chlorophyll was 5-fold shorter in the photosystem I-less/scpABCDE- strain than in the photosystem I-less strain even when grown at low light intensity (∼3 μmol photons m-2 s-1) (32 ± 5 and 161 ± 25 h, respectively). In other photosystem I-less mutants that lacked one to four of the scp genes the chlorophyll lifetime was in between these two values, with the chlorophyll lifetime generally decreasing with an increasing number of inactivated scps. In contrast, the chlorophyll biosynthesis rate was only marginally affected by inactivation of scps except when all five scp genes were deleted. Small Cab-like protein deficiency did not significantly affect photoinhibition or turnover of photosystem II-associated β-carotene. It is concluded that SCPs do not alter the stability of functional photosystem II complexes but retard the degradation of photosystem II-associated chlorophyll, consistent with the proposed involvement of SCPs in photosystem II re-assembly or/and repair processes by temporarily binding chlorophyll while photosystem II protein components are being replaced.

In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms two pigment-protein complexes, photosystem I (PS I) 2The abbreviations used are: PS Iphotosystem ILAHGlight-activated heterotrophic growthPS IIphotosystem IISCPsmall Cab-like proteins 2The abbreviations used are: PS Iphotosystem ILAHGlight-activated heterotrophic growthPS IIphotosystem IISCPsmall Cab-like proteins and photosystem II (PS II), work in concert to extract electrons from water and produce NADP+ using energy from light. The light-capturing capacity of the two photosystems is enhanced by peripheral antenna pigment-protein complexes, which are different in various groups of photosynthetic organisms (1Grossman A.R. Bhaya D. Apt K.E. Kehoe D.M. Annu. Rev. Genetics. 1995; 9: 231-288Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In plants and green algae these antenna complexes are constituted by polypeptides encoded by a multigene family of cab genes (2Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and contain chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids as light-harvesting cofactors. Most of the cab gene family members code for proteins with three transmembrane helices, of which the sequences of the first and third membrane-spanning regions including their chlorophyll-binding sites are similar (Cab-family proteins). Other Cab-family members in plants include the four-transmembrane helix PsbS protein of PS II that is involved in non-photochemical energy dissipation (see Ref. 3Szabó I. Bergantino E. Giacometti G.M. EMBO Reports. 2005; 6: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar for review) and early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs) that have one, two, or three predicted transmembrane helices and that accumulate in thylakoids under stress conditions (reviewed in Ref. 4Heddad M.

Prasil O. Vacha F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as major peripheral antenna complexes. However, cyanobacteria contain single-helix proteins of the Cab family, named SCPs (small Cab-like proteins) or Hli (high light-induced proteins) (6Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A.

Similar to other Cab proteins, the sequence of SCPs includes conserved motifs of residues involved in chlorophyll binding, although association of SCPs with chlorophyll has never been demonstrated experimentally despite considerable effort in various laboratories. Multiple scp genes are present in all sequenced cyanobacteria, including prochlorophytes. The genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (the organism will be referred to in this article as Synechocystis) contains four scp genes that have been named scpB-scpE (7Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, ferrochelatase in many cyanobacteria and the chloroplast-targeted isozyme in plants have a ∼60-residue C-terminal extension that is similar to the SCPs. For this reason, the C-terminal extension has been named ScpA and this SCP extension does not seem to be necessary for activity of ferrochelatase in Synechocystis (7Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The current working hypothesis is that members of the SCP family are involved in processes of PS II assembly/repair and may serve as a temporary pigment reservoir with relatively low affinity for pigments while PS II components are being replaced (19Vavilin D.

Inactivation of scp genes in Synechocystis alters cell pigmentation (22Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), reducing the amount of chlorophyll, carotenoids, and phycobilisomes in the cells (23Havaux M. Guedeney G. He Q. Grossman A.R.

By using a Synechocystis mutant with non-functional light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase, which is unable to synthesize chlorophyll in the dark, it has been demonstrated that inactivation of scp genes in this background strain causes accelerated chlorophyll degradation when SCP-less mutants were placed in darkness (24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins are involved in chlorophyll stabilization. When these dark-incubated cells that were depleted of chlorophyll were returned to the light, chlorophyll synthesis was also slower in the absence of SCPs (22Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol.

Although ScpB-ScpD physically interact with PS II, and are hypothesized to bind chlorophyll, these proteins do not enhance the light-harvesting capacity of the functional PS II complex (24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that selected SCPs associate with PS II and may aid in chlorophyll stabilization. In line with this working hypothesis, SCP proteins rapidly accumulate in thylakoid membranes of Synechocystis cells when photosystems may be degraded upon exposure to strong light (8He Q. Dolganov N.

In fact, as many as 23 scp genes have been identified in the genome of Prochlorococcus marinus MED4, a strain adapted to grow at high light intensity and with one of the smallest genomes among free-living cyanobacteria (25Rocap G. Larimer F.W. Lamerdin J. Malfatti S. Chain P. Ahlgren N.A. Arellano A. Coleman M. Hauser L. Hess W.R. Johnson Z.I. Land M. Lindell D. Post A.F. Regala W. Shah M. Shaw S.L. Steglich C. Sullivan M.B.

Genes that encode SCP proteins are also present in genomes of certain cyanophages, and are speculated to help maintain photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacterial host during infection (26Clokie M.R.J. Mann N.H. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Earlier we have shown that synthesis and degradation rates of porphyrins can be measured in Synechocystis cells in situ by analyzing 15Nor 13C isotope incorporation into pigments (27Vavilin D. Brune D.C. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, stable isotope labeling has been used to perform a systematic survey of mutants lacking single or multiple SCPs with respect to their ability to synthesize, degrade, and reuse chlorophyll under different growth conditions in the light. Our data show that SCPs prevent degradation of PS II-associated chlorophyll molecules, but do not alter the stability of functional PS II. SCPs do not significantly affect lifetimes of chlorophyll associated with PS I. Therefore, our study provides support for the concept of the involvement of SCPs in chlorophyll reutilization upon the repair of damaged PS II complexes. Strains and Growth Conditions—The construction of Synechocystis SCP-less strains in different backgrounds has been described earlier (22Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol.

Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) buffered with N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES)-NaOH (pH 8.0). For photoheterotrophic growth, the medium was supplemented with 10 mm glucose. Unless specified otherwise, strains containing PS I were routinely grown under continuous illumination at a light intensity of 40–45 μmol photons m-2 s-1, whereas those in a PS I-less background were grown at a light intensity of 2–3 μmol photons m-2 s-1. Growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 730 nm in a 1-cm cuvette using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer. Isotope Labeling—Stable isotope labeling experiments were performed essentially as described in Ref. 27Vavilin D. Brune D.C. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys.

In brief, to label cells with 15N, Synechocystis cultures were grown to OD730 ∼ 0.7 (late exponential phase) in BG-11 medium containing regular NaNO3 as fixed-nitrogen source and were then diluted with fresh BG-11 medium without NaNO3, to a final OD730 of 0.1 for the wild-type strain and PS II-less mutants and 0.2 for the slower growing PS I-less mutants. At the time of dilution (t = 0), the cultures were supplemented with a mixture of (15NH4)2SO4 and Na15NO3 to a final concentration of 2 mm and 9 mm, respectively, and grown for the time specified. Glucose (10 mm final concentration) was added to all cultures except for the wild type, HT-3, and scpABCDE- strains incubated at 45–300 μmol photons m-2 s-1 to support cell growth. For 13C labeling of chlorophyll and carotenoids, Synechocystis cells were grown from OD730 ∼ 0.2 to an OD730 of about 0.6 in 10 mm TES/NaOH (pH 8.2)-buffered BG-11 medium supplemented with 1.5 mm glucose and then resuspended to an OD730 of 0.15 in freshly autoclaved 10 mm TES/NaOH (pH 8.2)-buffered BG-11 medium from which NaHCO3 had been omitted. The medium was supplemented with a mixture of 2 mm [13C]glucose and 2.4 mm Na 132CO3. Every 24 h, the cultures were supplemented with an additional 1 mm of [13C]glucose and 2.4 mm of Na 132CO3 to maintain a high concentration of labeled bicarbonate and exponential growth of the cultures. All chemicals enriched in 13C and 15N isotopes were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA). 13C enrichment in [13C]glucose and Na 132CO3 was at least 99% and 15N enrichment in (15NH4)2SO4 and Na15NO3 was more than 98%. Pigment Extraction and Purification—The extraction of pigments from Synechocystis cells and their purification by HPLC (using a Waters Spherisorb S10ODS2 (250 × 10 mm) Semi-Prep column eluted with a water/methanol-acetone gradient) was performed essentially as described earlier (27Vavilin D. Brune D.C. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pigment detection upon elution was performed by continuously recording absorption at 440 and 665 nm; the integrated peak areas at these two wavelengths were used to quantify carotenoids and chlorophyll (chlorophyllide), respectively. The fractions containing pigments were collected and dried under vacuum. Chlorophyll and chlorophyllide labeled with 15N were used for MS measurements without further purification. To perform mass spectrometry analysis of 13C-labeled chlorophyll, the pigment was first converted to pheophytin by dissolving it into 0.4 ml of an acetone/water mixture (9:1 v/v) containing 20 μl of 0.1% (v/v) HCl and then chlorophyll-derived pheophytin was subjected to a second round of HPLC using the elution conditions described above. Considering the significantly increased retention time of pheophytin relative to that of chlorophyll, this procedure allowed to obtain pigment that is free of contaminants that co-elute with chlorophyll. Before mass spectrometric analysis of 13C-labeled carotenoids, the HPLC-separated pigments were re-dissolved in a small volume of methanol and subjected to a second round of HPLC purification using a YMC Carotenoid S-5 column (Waters) eluted with a linear methanol/acetone gradient for 15 min. After drying the pigments were stored at -80 °C until further mass spectrometric analysis. Mass Spectroscopy—Positive ion mass spectra of 15N- or 13C-labeled pigments were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Voyager Biospectrometry Work Station (Foster City, CA) using a terthiophene matrix. Pigment samples were excited by nitrogen laser excitation pulses at a frequency of 3 Hz. The laser power was optimized to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio after averaging 200–800 single-shot spectra. Analysis of Pigment Mass Spectra—Mass spectra of 15N-labeled chlorophyll and chlorophyllide were analyzed as described in Ref. 27Vavilin D. Brune D.C. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. In brief, experimentally measured mass spectra of the porphyrins composed of a mixture of 14N and 15N isotopes were simulated by a linear combination of five theoretical spectra of chlorophyll or chlorophyllide assumed to contain zero, one, two, three, or four 15N atoms (the balance being 14N atoms), whereas isotopes of all other elements were present according to their natural relative abundance. Using this analysis, relative amounts of chlorophyll with different numbers of 15N atoms per molecule were calculated for every pigment sample, and the obtained ratios were related to the total concentration of the corresponding pigment present in the growing Synechocystis culture. Chlorophyll stability in different strains was determined from changes in the concentration of the pool of chlorophyll molecules in which all four nitrogen atoms were 14N (unlabeled chlorophyll). Assuming that chlorophyll degradation is monoexponential with a rate constant of kd, changes in the total chlorophyll concentration CChl (labeled plus unlabeled) in exponentially growing Synechocystis culture can be expressed as Equation 1, dCchl/dt=fchlm0eμt-kdCchl(Eq. 1) where μ is the specific growth rate of the culture, and m0 is the concentration of cell biomass m at time t = 0. The parameter fChl reflects the fraction of biomass converted to chlorophyll per unit time and formally corresponds to the rate constant of chlorophyll synthesis (27Vavilin D. Brune D.C. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the exponential growth phase, when the chlorophyll-to-biomass ratio (CChl/m) remains constant in Equation 2, fchl=(kd+μ)×Cchl/m(Eq. 2) The parameter fChl calculated on the basis of Equation 2 was used to compare rates of chlorophyll synthesis in different cyanobacterial mutants. To determine the stability of β-carotene, mass spectra of this carotenoid isolated from 13C-labeled cells were viewed as an overlay of mass spectra produced by (i) the pool of unlabeled β-carotene containing 13C at natural abundance (1.1%) and represented by four mass peaks with m/z ratios ranging from 536.4 to 539.4 (m/z = 536.4 corresponds to the M+ mass of monoisotopic β-carotene) and (ii) the pool of labeled β-carotene with m/z ratios ranging from 560.5 to 576.6 due to significant enrichment in 13C in molecules synthesized after administering the label. Relative amounts of the two pools of β-carotene were determined by measuring the total intensities of the mass peaks corresponding to the two groups of pigments; the absolute concentrations of labeled and unlabeled carotenoids were calculated from the total content of this pigment in the sample. Isolation of PS I and PS II Complexes—PS II and PS I were isolated from the HT-3 strain of Synechocystis (30Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which contains a His6 tag at the C-terminal end of the CP47 protein, using procedures described in detail in (31Kashino Y.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with modifications as described below. To reduce possible pheophytinization of chlorophyll, the pH of all buffers used to isolate PS II was maintained at 7.0 using 40 mm HEPES-NaOH. Considering that thylakoids were isolated from a small volume of 15N-labeled cells, thylakoid membranes were resuspended to a final chlorophyll concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and solubilized with dodecyl maltoside that was added to a final concentration of 0.25%, as compared with 1.0 mg chlorophyll ml-1 and 0.8% dodecyl maltoside used in (31Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q.J. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). After passing through a column containing 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) that retained PS II complexes, the eluant was applied to a second 1.0 × 10-cm column filled with DEAE-cellulose to purify PS I by ion-exchange chromatography. PS I was eluted from the second column by applying a 0–200 mm NaCl gradient in 40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) buffer. Oxygen Evolution—Steady-state rates of oxygen evolution were measured at 25 °C using an oxygraph (Hansatech, Cambridge, UK) equipped with a Clark-type electrode. The suspension of Synechocystis cells at 1.2 μg chlorophyll ml-1 was supplemented with artificial electron acceptors 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and potassium ferricyanide to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and 2.0 mm, respectively. Oxygen production was measured upon exposure of cells to a saturating light intensity (Xe lamp) of about 2500 μmol photons m-2 s-1 passed through an orange cutoff filter (Corning) transmitting light at λ ≥ 570 nm. 15N Labeling of Chlorophyll in SCP-less Mutants—Growth of Synechocystis cells in the presence of 15NO-3 and 15NH+4 caused gradual accumulation of chlorophyll molecules enriched in 15N, whereas the amount of chlorophyll containing only 14N remained stable or decreased gradually due to degradation of the pigment (Fig. 1). Fixed nitrogen is taken up very readily in cyanobacteria (33Hu Q. Westerhoff P. Vermaas W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and incorporation of nitrogen into chlorophyll is rapid (27Vavilin D. Brune D.C. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thus minimizing lag times in labeled N incorporation. Table 1 compares half-life times of chlorophyll molecules in different Synechocystis strains calculated from the kinetics of disappearance of unlabeled (14N) chlorophyll in cultures growing in the presence of 15N-labeled nitrate and ammonium.TABLE 1Chlorophyll synthesis and degradation rates in Synechocystis strains with various deletions in SCPs and/or photosystems 10 mm glucose was added to all cultures except for the wild type and scpABCDE– strains incubated at 45–300 μmol photons m–2 s–1. The cell doubling time in the cultures was determined by measuring changes in OD730. The chlorophyll half-life time t½ was determined from changes in the concentration of unlabeled chlorophyll. The rate constant of chlorophyll synthesis, fChl, was calculated according to Equation 2 using the parameters shown in this table.

https://openalex.org/W2022218000,"Potato virus Y (PVY) is a common potyvirus of agricultural importance, belonging to the picornavirus superfamily of RNA plus-stranded viruses. A covalently linked virus-encoded protein VPg required for virus infectivity is situated at the 5′ end of potyvirus RNA. VPg seems to be involved in multiple interactions, both with other viral products and host proteins. VPgs of potyviruses have no known homologs, and there is no atomic structure available. To understand the molecular basis of VPg multifunctionality, we have analyzed structural features of VPg from PVY using structure prediction programs, functional assays, and biochemical and biophysical analyses. Structure predictions suggest that VPg exists in a natively unfolded conformation. In contrast with ordered proteins, PVY VPg is not denatured by elevated temperatures, has sedimentation values incompatible with a compact globular form, and shows a CD spectrum of a highly disordered protein, and HET-HETSOFAST NMR analysis suggests the presence of large unstructured regions. Although VPg has a propensity to form dimers, no functional differences were seen between the monomer and dimer. These data strongly suggest that the VPg of PVY should be classified among intrinsically disordered proteins. Intrinsic disorder lies at the basis of VPg multifunctionality, which is necessary for virus survival in the host.

These data strongly suggest that the VPg of PVY should be classified among intrinsically disordered proteins. Intrinsic disorder lies at the basis of VPg multifunctionality, which is necessary for virus survival in the host. It is generally accepted that a protein should attain stable folded conformation to perform its specific physiological functions. However, we are beginning to realize that many proteins contain large unfolded regions, and there are examples of entire proteins lacking regular secondary and tertiary structures (1Romero P. Obradowic Z. Kissinger C.R. Villafranca J.E. Garner E. Guilliot S. Dunker A.K. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 1998; : 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). There is abundant evidence that the unstructured state, common to all living organisms, is essential for basic cellular functions. Approximately 10% of proteins are predicted to be fully disordered (2Tompa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Proteins should fulfill multiple functions through interactions with distinct partners, which requires structured proteins to use separate binding surfaces or domains. In contrast, intrinsically unstructured proteins can, because of their malleability, use the same regions or overlapping surfaces for different interactions by taking advantage of their capacity to adopt different conformations upon binding. Potyvirus VPg is a virus-coded terminal protein of ∼22 kDa, attached to the 5′ end of virus RNA genome. During the virus life cycle VPg is expressed as a part of a larger polyprotein, which self-processes into mature viral protein components. VPg is the N-terminal part of one of the first products, VPg-Pro (also called NIa), liberated by polyprotein proteolysis. At the end of the viral cycle VPg is attached to the 5′ terminus of the progeny genome and is packaged into virions along with viral RNA. VPg is required for potyvirus infectivity. The latter is abolished when genomic PVY 3The abbreviations used are:PVYpotato virus YTFE2,2,2-trifluoroethanolDTTdithiothreitolGSTglutathione S-transferaseeIFeukaryotic initiation factor RNA is treated with proteinase K (3Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of the tyrosine residue involved in the linkage between RNA and the VPg protein is lethal for virus growth and replication (4Murphy J.F. Klein P.G. Hunt A.G. Shaw J.G. Virology. 1996; 220: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Mitra T. Sosnovtsev S.V. Green K.Y. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). VPg seems to be involved in multiple interactions, with both other viral products and host proteins. It has been implicated in translation (6Lellis A.D. Kasschau K.D. Whitham S.A. Carrington J.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1046-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), long distance movement in plant tissue (7Schaad M.C. Lellis A.D. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 11: 8624-8631Crossref Google Scholar), and replication (8Fellers J. Wan J. Hong Y. Collins G.B. Hunt A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2043-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to interact with viral RNA polymerase, suggesting a role, possibly as a primer, in viral RNA synthesis (8Fellers J. Wan J. Hong Y. Collins G.B. Hunt A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2043-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Hong Y. Levay K. Murphy J.F. Klein P.G. Shaw J.G. Hunt A.G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38103-38110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). VPg, as part of the VPg-Pro protein, has been observed to translocate to the host cell nucleus at the beginning of infection, possibly by an import independent mechanism (11Restrepo M.A. Freed D.D. Carrington J.C. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. Leinicke A.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 953-962PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schaad M.C.

Virol. 2007; 81: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, VPg contains a two-partite nuclear localization signal (amino acid residues 1–11 and 43–57 in VPg of tobacco etch virus potyvirus (12Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. Leinicke A.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 953-962PubMed Google Scholar)). However, the role of VPg in the nucleus is not clear because mature potyvirus particles accumulate in the cytoplasm of infected plants. Nevertheless, knocking out VPg nuclear translocation inhibits genome amplification, suggesting that the nuclear localization signal might be in a region critical for RNA replication (13Schaad M.C. Haldeman-Cahill R. Cronin S. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7039-7048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional VPg seems to be complexed with another viral product, protein 6kDa, which may mediate VPg binding to membranes at sites of RNA replication (15Restrepo-Hartwig M.A. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Léonard S. Viel C. Beauchemin C. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberte J.F. J. Gen.

Strokovska L. Andrieu J.P. Dublet B. Zagorski W. Chroboczek J. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This interaction seems to be crucial for a productive virus cycle. Natural plant resistance to potyvirus infection has been shown to stem from the inability of VPg to interact with eIF4E, as a result of amino acid mutations either in VPg (22Borgstrom B. Johansen I.E. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or in eIF4E (19Duprat A. Caranta C. Revers F. Menand B. Browning K.S. Robaglia C. Plant J. 2002; 3: 927-934Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Ruffel S. Dussault M.H. Palloix A. Moury B. Bendahmane A. Robaglia C. Caranta C. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). VPg of turnip mosaic virus also interacts with the host poly(A)-binding protein (16Léonard S. Viel C. Beauchemin C. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberte J.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, turnip mosaic virus VPg has been shown to interact with a plant protein called potyvirus VPg-interacting protein through the 16 amino acids at the VPg N terminus (24Dunoyer P. Thomas C. Harrison S. Revers F. Maule A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2301-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of potyvirus VPg-interacting protein has been observed to diminish susceptibility to turnip mosaic virus infection, whereas eliminating the interaction with VPg resulted in reduced virus cell-to-cell and systemic movement (24Dunoyer P. Thomas C. Harrison S. Revers F. Maule A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2301-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that VPg of infecting PVY can be phosphorylated by plant kinases (25Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently it has been hypothesized that VPg phosphorylation could trigger disassembly of infecting virions and subsequent initiation of potyvirus protein synthesis in infected cells (26Puustinen P. Rajamaki M.L. Ivanov K.I. Valkonen J.P. Makinen K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12703-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All of these data show first that VPg is potyvirus virulence factor and second that VPg is a multifunctional protein. We demonstrate here that the structure of VPg of PVY is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein, which may help to explain the multiple functions played by this protein in the potyvirus life cycle. Proteins—Recombinant PVY VPg (accession number Z29526, potato virus Y strain 0, British isolate) and wheat iso isoform of eIF4E were expressed and purified as described (21Grzela R. Strokovska L. Andrieu J.P. Dublet B. Zagorski W. Chroboczek J. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both plant eIF4E isoforms are able to interact with PVY VPg; however, the iso isoform interacts more tightly (21Grzela R. Strokovska L. Andrieu J.P. Dublet B. Zagorski W. Chroboczek J. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Analysis—The analysis was carried out under denaturing conditions according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) or under semi-denaturing conditions, that is, with samples suspended without boiling in Laemmli sample buffer devoid of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Proteolytic Analysis—VPg (15 μg) was incubated with chymotrypsin (2.5, 12.5, and 60 ng) for 10 min at room temperature in 25 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl. The reactions were stopped with the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were analyzed using 17% SDS-PAGE. For N-terminal amino acid analysis, proteolytic fragments were transferred onto a Problot (ABI) membrane and sequenced as described (21Grzela R. Strokovska L. Andrieu J.P. Dublet B. Zagorski W. Chroboczek J. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Disorder Prediction—The VPg folding predictions were carried out using two software packages: PONDR VL-XT, XL1_XT and CAN_XT, which predict natural disordered regions (www.pondr.com), and FoldIndex©, which predicts to what extent a given protein sequence is intrinsically unfolded (28Prilusky J. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E. Felder C. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). FoldIndex© can be used as a Web Service for remote and automatic data processing by accessing this URL: bioportal.weizmann.ac.il/fldbin/findex?m=xml&sq=SEQUENCE. The analyses have been performed using default values. Dynamic Light Scattering—Protein samples were dialyzed against prefiltered (0.22-μm Millipore filters) 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 200 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The samples were placed in a reduced volume cuvette (45 μl; Greiner). The automated measurements were collected with a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument, using a 2 °C incremental temperature ramp and a 2-min equilibrium delay at each temperature. The data were adjusted using the cumulants method. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 42,000 rpm and 10 °C, using an AN-60 rotor of Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and two-channel centerpiece with 1.2-cm path length. Three different VPg preparations were analyzed: VPg purified in the presence (5 mm) or absence of DTT, and VPg was stored for 2 weeks at 4 °C without DTT. Each preparation contained ∼0.15 mg of protein/ml (A280 nm = 0.1) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl. The scans were recorded overnight every 6 min at 280 nm using a 0.003-cm radial spacing. The data for each preparation were analyzed as a continuous distribution c(s) of sedimentation coefficients, s, with the program Sedfit. The program Sedphat was used to perform a global analysis of the three sets of data (all together) in terms of a mixture of noninteracting VPg species with fixed molar masses of the monomer and dimer.

Protein Structures: Methods in Protein Structure and Stability Analysis. Nova Science Publishers, Inc., Hauppauge, NY2007Google Scholar). Corrected s20,w were obtained in the usual way using a partial specific volume of v̄ = 0.742 ml/g estimated from amino acid composition with the program Sednterp (www.jphilo.mailway.com), using the experimental solvent density, ρ = 1.013 g/ml, and viscosity η = 1.35 mPa/s. The Svedberg equation relates s to protein molar mass M, and hydrodynamic radius Rh as follows, s=M(1-ν¯ρ/(NA6πηRh))(Eq. 1) where NA is Avogadro's number. Theoretical values for a globular compact monomer and dimer were calculated with Rh = f/fmin × Rmin, using the frictional ratio f/fmin = 1.25. Rmin is the minimum theoretical value for Rh, corresponding to the anhydrous volume v̄M/NA = (4/3)π R3min. Far-UV CD—CD spectra of VPg at 25 °C were recorded using a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter. The wavelength range used was 180–260 nm, with a 1-nm interval and an integration time of 4 s in continuous scanning mode. The samples were contained in 0.1-cm optical path length quartz cuvettes. VPg (0.2 mg/ml) was in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 60 mm NaCl with or without 20% TFE. To monitor VPg thermal stability CD spectra were recorded after 30 min of incubation at various temperatures up to 95 °C. NMR Spectroscopy—Conventional 1H one-dimensional NMR using excitation sculpting for water suppression purposes (31Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) and one-dimensional HET-SOFAST experiments (32Schanda P. Forge V. Brutscher B. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2006; 44: S177-S184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were performed on a Varian DirectDrive 600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance cold-probe. The one-dimensional HET-SOFAST experiments are composed of two data sets recorded with and without a band-selective inversion pulse covering the aliphatic region. The data were acquired at 10 or 30 °C. Data processing was done using the VnmrJ software (Varian, Inc.). The time domain data were multiplied with a 90° phase-shifted sine-bell apodization function and zero-filled to 8192 complex data points prior to Fourier transformation. The reference and saturated intensities were obtained by integrating the spectra from ∼7.0 to 10.0 ppm. Structure Prediction and Proteolysis—Full-length PVY polyprotein was analyzed using FoldIndex©. This program furnishes an estimate of the degree of protein disorder. It was developed from the algorithm proposed by Uversky et al. (36Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar) and is based on the mean net charge and hydrophobicity of the polypeptide chain. The results clearly show that most of VPg, which is located between amino acids 336 and 523 of PVY polyprotein, lies in the unfolded region of the polyprotein, in contrast to other PVY proteins: CI, 6K2, and NI-Pro (the C-terminal part of NIa proteins containing the protease domain only) (Fig. 1A). The structure of VPg was also probed experimentally with proteases, and the results were compared with the PONDR disorder prediction. There are 31 consensus cleavage sites for trypsin alone, distributed throughout the VPg amino acid sequence. However, when treated with trypsin or chymotrypsin, VPg was cleaved mainly between residues 11–21 and 41–61 (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Thus, the VPg N-terminal region is predominantly accessible to proteases. We infer that also the C-terminal part of the VPg is cleaved as the N-terminal analysis revealed the presence of peptides with the same N termini but with a different mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, upper panel). C-terminal short peptides could not be identified because they ran out of the gel. The results of proteolytic analysis agree with PONDR predictions. The latter unambiguously indicates that the regions between residues 62–83, 118–130, and 140–149 are ordered and suggests that the N-terminal region as well as fragments delineated by residues 84–117, 130–139, and 150–188 in the C-terminal region are disordered (Fig. 1C). Effect of Temperature on VPg—Structured proteins are generally denatured by heat. Indeed, eIF4E aggregates completely, when maintained at 100 °C for 15 min, implying denaturation, whereas VPg endures this treatment without precipitating (Fig. 2A). Assuming that GST would have a protective effect, we applied the same treatment to the fusion protein GST-eIF4E, which, however aggregated, as did bovine serum albumin (results not shown). The dynamic light scattering technique makes it possible to monitor unfolding or denaturation caused by changes in pH or temperature. The protein melting point temperature Tm obtained from dynamic light scattering analysis is indicative of thermal stability. In the absence of aggregation-inhibiting agents, interpolymer hydrophobic interactions can quickly lead to nonspecific aggregation of the denatured polypeptide chains. The change in mean particle size that accompanies protein denaturation was measured using a 12–65 °C thermal gradient. In this temperature range the VPg preparation showed no signs of denaturation (Fig. 2B). Parallel measurements done with eIF4E produced a typical denaturation profile with a slow increase in particle size beginning at ∼55 °C, followed by a rapid increase at 60 °C. VPg Oligomerization—VPg contains one cysteine (Cys150) among its 188 amino acid residues. When VPg was prepared under nonreducing conditions and run on semi-denaturing SDS-PAGE, a slowly migrating band of 44 kDa, consistent with the molecular weight calculated for VPg dimer (21Grzela R. Strokovska L. Andrieu J.P. Dublet B. Zagorski W. Chroboczek J. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was observed in addition to a major band (22kDa) corresponding to the monomeric protein (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The same preparation run on denaturing PAGE showed only one band migrating at 22 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The amount of the 44-kDa form increased with time of storage at 4 °C but disappeared when VPg was incubated with 5 mm DTT (Fig. 3A, lane 2). When N-ethylmaleimide was added at the beginning of VPg purification, the protein appeared in a monomeric form only (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). N-Ethylmaleimide forms covalent bonds with sulfhydryl groups of cysteines and prevents S-S bond formation. Similar gel analysis performed on VPg C-terminally truncated at residue 139 showed only one band migrating with the monomer molecular weight under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, no VPg dimers were observed in freshly expressing insect cells (Fig. 3B, lane 6; His-tagged VPg is somewhat retarded in comparison with untagged protein). It seems thus that the VPg dimer arises during VPg purification or manipulation, when atmospheric oxygen induces formation of disulfide bonds. It is worth noting that the RNAs prepared from three different potyviruses were found in an apparently VPg-dependent aggregated form (37Luciano C.S. Murphy J.F. Rhoads R.E. Shaw J.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The propensity for oligomerization has been observed previously for VPg proteins of clover yellow vein virus (38Yambao M.L. Masuta C. Nakahara K. Uyeda I. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2861-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and turnip mosaic virus (14Beauchemin C. Boutet N. Laliberte J.F. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The appearance of dimers caused by the formation of disulfide bridges might have changed or impaired VPg functionality. For example, stabilization of Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB7, an outer membrane-associated lipoprotein, is correlated with its ability to form disulfide cross-linked homodimers (39Spudich G.M. Fernandez D. Zhou X.R. Christie P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7512-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, cysteine oxidation prevents p53 dimerization and hence inhibits DNA binding (40Delphin C. Cahen P. Lawrence J.J. Baudier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In some redox-responsive proteins, the formation of disulfide bonds modulates protein-protein interactions; upon oxidation Escherichia coli chaperone Hsp33 undergoes a large conformational transition to a state that can bind polypeptide substrates and rescue them from aggregation (41Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffman J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Structure. 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of VPg dimerization on function through a change in interaction with its host partner, eIF4E, we studied the complex formation using monomeric and dimeric VPg in parallel. As shown in Fig. 3C (lanes E), no difference is observed in the interaction of DTT-treated VPg (monomeric form) and stored VPg (dimeric form) with GST-eIF4E immobilized on a GST column. This suggests that VPg utilizes for dimerization regions different from those implicated in its interaction with eIF4E. Note that the N-terminal part of VPg seems to interact with host eIF4E (18Léonard S. Plante D. Wittmann S. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberté J.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7730-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Grzela R. Strokovska L. Andrieu J.P. Dublet B. Zagorski W. Chroboczek J. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal part is involved in dimerization (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Also oligomerization of clover yellow vein virus VPg involves the C-terminal part of the protein (38Yambao M.L. Masuta C. Nakahara K. Uyeda I. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2861-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed to evaluate the shape and oligomeric state of VPg under nondenaturating conditions. As mentioned earlier, VPg has a tendency to oligomerize upon prolonged storage. From c(s) analysis (Fig. 4), VPg stored at –20 °C and thawed (VPgM+D sample) has a maximum mean s20,w of 2.5 S. VPg stored for 2 weeks at 4 °C (VPgD sample) and believed to be a dimer has a larger mean s20,w value of 3.0 S, whereas VPg purified in the presence of DTT (monomer, VPgM) has the smallest s20,w mean value of 2.0 S. The three sets of data were also modeled as a mixture of noninteracting monomer and dimer species. In this approach, the molar mass is fixed, whereas the sedimentation coefficient for monomer and dimer, as well as the proportion of both species in different samples, are fitted. The results are compatible with the presence of ∼90% monomer in the VPgM sample, ∼90% dimer in the VPgD sample, and equal amounts of the monomer and dimer in the VPgM+D sample (Tables 1 and 2). The quality of our data (not shown) does not allow us to distinguish between rapid equilibrium (as suggested by the intermediate position of the VPgM+D peak in Fig. 4) and slow equilibrium (corresponding to an analysis with two species). The results of the monomer/dimer mixture analysis gives the s20,w values 1.7 and 3.0 S for VPg monomer and dimer, respectively. These values are rather small compared with those calculated for globular compact species, namely 2.1 and 3.4 S (Table 2). The results thus imply an elongated structure for both monomeric and dimeric VPg.TABLE 1Percentage of monomer and dimer in each sampleSamplesMonomerDimer%%VPgM8911VPgM+D4753VPgD892 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Global analysis of sedimentation velocity of the three VPg samples in terms of two noninteracting species: monomer and dimer (Sedphat program)Molecular massFitted S20wTheoretical S20w with f/fmin = 1.25kDaSSMonomer22.21.72.1Dimer44.43.03.4 Open table in a new tab Circular Dichroism—Intrinsically unstructured proteins possess distinctive far-UV CD spectra with a characteristic deep minima in the vicinity of 200 nm and relatively low ellipticity at 215 and 222 nm resulting from the low content of ordered secondary structure. The CD spectra of monomeric and dimeric VPg (Fig. 5A) are identical and exhibit negative ellipticity near 205 nm, a shoulder at 220 nm, and a weak positive maximum of ∼190 nm. These spectral features have been assigned to a group of β-sheet-rich proteins containing short segments of β-strands (so called beta-II proteins) (42Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The VPg spectrum was not changed by the presence of 10% TFE but was significantly modified by 20% TFE (Fig. 5A, dots). This spectrum has a positive molar ellipticity, centered at ∼200 nm and a negative band at 228 nm, strikingly similar to spectra observed with beta-I rich proteins (42Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The effect of temperature was tested (Fig. 5B), and in common with other unfolded proteins (43Sanchez-Puig N. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1410-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), no cooperative transition of the molar ellipticity was observed. Our data show that VPg does not have a compact structure, nor does it contain significant secondary elements. In addition, it appears that VPg undergoes a structural reorganization in TFE, which is known to favor local interactions by increasing the propensity for helix formation. Because the dielectric constant of TFE is approximately one-third of that of water, charge-mediated interactions should be stronger in TFE; in particular intramolecular hydrogen bonds should be strengthened by the addition of TFE to an aqueous solution (Ref. 44Thomas P.D. Dill K.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2050-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and the references therein). NMR Spectroscopy—The degree of dispersion of the proton signals observed by one-dimensional NMR reflects the extent of protein folding. Recently, a new NMR experimental procedure, called HET-SOFAST, has been proposed by Schanda et al. (32Schanda P. Forge V. Brutscher B. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2006; 44: S177-S184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which allows the extent of protein compactness to be quantified using the ratio, λNOE (measure of average proton density), between a reference and a saturated spectrum.

https://openalex.org/W2018135438,"Heterochromatin formation involves the nucleation and spreading of structural and epigenetic features along the chromatin fiber. Chromatin barriers and associated proteins counteract the spreading of heterochromatin, thereby restricting it to specific regions of the genome. We have performed gene expression studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation on strains in which native centromere sequences have been mutated to study the mechanism by which a tRNA(Alanine) gene barrier (cen1 tDNA(Ala)) blocks the spread of pericentromeric heterochromatin at the centromere of chromosome 1 (cen1) in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Within the centromere, barrier activity is a general property of tDNAs and, unlike previously characterized barriers, requires the association of both transcription factor IIIC and RNA Polymerase III. Although the cen1 tDNA(Ala) gene is actively transcribed, barrier activity is independent of transcriptional orientation. These findings provide experimental evidence for the involvement of a fully assembled RNA polymerase III transcription complex in defining independent structural and functional domains at a eukaryotic centromere."
https://openalex.org/W1996463845,"Senescence is a mechanism that limits cellular lifespan and constitutes a barrier against cellular immortalization. To identify new senescence regulatory genes that might play a role in tumorigenesis, we have designed and performed a large-scale antisense-based genetic screen in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Out of this screen, we have identified five different genes through which loss of function partially bypasses senescence. These genes belong to very different biochemical families: csn2 (component of the Cop9 signalosome), aldose reductase (a metabolic enzyme) and brf1 (subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex), S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase and Bub1. Inactivation, at least partial, of these genes confers resistance to both p53- and p16INK4a-induced proliferation arrest. Furthermore, such inactivation inhibits p53 but not E2F1 transcriptional activity and impairs DNA-damage-induced transcription of p21. Since the aim of the screen was to identify new regulators of tumorigenesis, we have tested their inactivation in human tumors. We have found, either by northern blot or quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR analysis, that the expression of three genes, Csn2, Aldose reductase and Brf1, is lost at different ratios in tumors of different origins. These genes are located at common positions of loss of heterogeneity (15q21.2, 7q35 and 14q32.33); therefore,we have measured genomic losses of these specific genes in different tumors. We have found that Csn2 and Brf1 also show genomic losses of one allele in different tumors. Our data suggest that the three genes identified in the genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screen are putative tumor suppressors located at 15q21.2; 7q35 and 14q32.33."
https://openalex.org/W2082652978,"Background Neurophysiological studies showed that in macaques, grasp-related sensorimotor transformations are accomplished in a circuit connecting the anterior intraparietal sulcus (area AIP) with premotor area F5. Single unit recordings of macaque indicate that activity of neurons in this circuit is not simply linked to any particular object. Instead, responses correspond to the final hand configuration used to grasp the object. Although a human homologue of such a circuit has been identified, its role in planning and controlling different grasp configurations has not been decisively shown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explicitly test whether activity within this network varies depending on the congruency between the adopted grasp and the grasp called by the stimulus. Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects were requested to reach towards and grasp a small or a large stimulus naturally (i.e., precision grip, involving the opposition of index finger and thumb, for a small size stimulus and a whole hand grasp for a larger stimulus) or with an constrained grasp (i.e., a precision grip for a large stimulus and a whole hand grasp for a small stimulus). The human anterior intraparietal sulcus (hAIPS) was more active for precise grasping than for whole hand grasp independently of stimulus size. Conversely, both the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and the primary motor cortex (M1) were modulated by the relationship between the type of grasp that was adopted and the size of the stimulus. Conclusions/Significance The demonstration that activity within the hAIPS is modulated according to different types of grasp, together with the evidence in humans that the dorsal premotor cortex is involved in grasp planning and execution offers a substantial contribution to the current debate about the neural substrates of visuomotor grasp in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2028515503,"Crystallization is a major bottleneck in the process of macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Successful crystallization requires the formation of nuclei and their subsequent growth to crystals of suitable size. Crystal growth generally occurs spontaneously in a supersaturated solution as a result of homogenous nucleation. However, in a typical sparse matrix screening experiment, precipitant and protein concentration are not sampled extensively, and supersaturation conditions suitable for nucleation are often missed.We tested the effect of nine potential heterogenous nucleating agents on crystallization of ten test proteins in a sparse matrix screen. Several nucleating agents induced crystal formation under conditions where no crystallization occurred in the absence of the nucleating agent. Four nucleating agents: dried seaweed; horse hair; cellulose and hydroxyapatite, had a considerable overall positive effect on crystallization success. This effect was further enhanced when these nucleating agents were used in combination with each other.Our results suggest that the addition of heterogeneous nucleating agents increases the chances of crystal formation when using sparse matrix screens."
https://openalex.org/W2023282331,"Background Multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria is an important health problem in the Peruvian Amazon region. We carried out a randomised open label clinical trial comparing mefloquine-artesunate, the current first line treatment in this region, with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Methods and Findings Between July 2003 and July 2005, 522 patients with P. falciparum uncomplicated malaria were recruited, randomized (260 with mefloquine-artesunate and 262 with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine), treated and followed up for 63 days. PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response, estimated by Kaplan Meier survival and Per Protocol analysis, was extremely high for both drugs (99.6% for mefloquine-artesunate and 98.4% and for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) (RR: 0.99, 95%CI [0.97−1.01], Fisher Exact p = 0.21). All recrudescences were late parasitological failures. Overall, gametocytes were cleared faster in the mefloquine-artesunate group (28 vs 35 days) and new gametocytes tended to appear more frequently in patients treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (day 7: 8 (3.6%) vs 2 (0.9%), RR: 3.84, 95%CI [0.82–17.87]). Adverse events such as anxiety and insomnia were significantly more frequent in the mefloquine-artesunate group, both in adults and children. Conclusion Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is as effective as mefloquine-artesunate in treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria but it is better tolerated and more affordable than mefloquine-artesunate (US$1.0 versus US$18.65 on the local market). Therefore, it should be considered as a potential candidate for the first line treatment of P.falciparum malaria in Peru. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00373607"
https://openalex.org/W1972682824,"Upon binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), PDGF receptor is autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic region, which induces the activation of diverse intracellular signaling pathways such those involving Ras-ERK, c-Src, and Rap1-Rac. Signaling through activated Ras-ERK promotes cell cycle and cell proliferation. The sequential activation of Rap1 and Rac affects cellular morphology and induces the formation of leading-edge structures, including lamellipodia, peripheral ruffles, and focal complexes, resulting in the enhancement of cell movement. In addition to the promotion of cell proliferation, the Ras-ERK signaling is involved in the regulation of cellular morphology. Here, we showed a novel role of afadin in the regulation of PDGF-induced intracellular signaling and cellular morphology in NIH3T3 cells. Afadin was originally identified as an actin filament-binding protein, which binds to a cell-cell adhesion molecule nectin and is involved in the formation of cell-cell junctions. When afadin was tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src activated in response to PDGF, afadin physically interacted with and increased the phosphatase activity of Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates PDGF receptor, leading to the prevention of hyperactivation of PDGF receptor and the Ras-ERK signaling. In contrast, knockdown of afadin or SHP-2 induced the hyperactivation of PDGF receptor and Ras-ERK signaling and consequently suppressed the formation of leading-edge structures. Thus, afadin plays a critical role in the proper regulation of the PDGF-induced activation of PDGF receptor and signaling by Ras-ERK.

Nectin initiates the formation of cell-cell adhesion and then induces the activation of Rap1, Cdc42, and Rac small G proteins through the activation of c-Src.

On the other hand, afadin, which binds to Rap1 activated by the action of nectin, associates with p120ctn and inhibits the endocytosis of accumulated non-trans-interacting E-cadherin to facilitate the trans-interaction of E-cadherin. In parallel with these processes, Cdc42 increases the number of filopodia and cell-cell contact sites, whereas Rac induces the formation of lamellipodia, which efficiently zip the cell-cell adhesion between the filopodia, acting like a “zipper.” We recently found that nectin also interacts with integrin αvβ3 and that the activation of integrin αvβ3 is necessary for the nectin-induced signaling and formation of AJs (11Sakamoto Y. Ogita H. Hirota T. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Yasumi M. Kanzaki N. Ozaki M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

We recently showed that cell-cell adhesion based on the nectin-afadin complex is indispensable for the formation of tight junctions but that the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is not always essential for it under certain conditions (12Yamada A.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5085-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although it had been believed from several lines of circumstantial evidence that cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is required for the formation of tight junctions (13Gonzalez-Mariscal L.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a family of growth factors consisting of three isoforms, PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB (17Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Binding of PDGF to its receptor causes the autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular parts of the receptor, leading to the activation of diverse intracellular signaling pathways such as Ras-ERK, c-Src, and Rap1-Rac signalings. It is well known that the Ras-ERK signaling enhances cell cycle progression and facilitates cell proliferation (18Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 19McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Satoh T.

Takai, unpublished observation. In addition, it has been reported that the Ras-ERK signaling plays roles in cellular morphology as well as cell proliferation (24Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 25Zhong C. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor is in turn dephosphorylated and inactivated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) such as Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) (26Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Manao G. Taddei L. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Markova B. Herrlich P. Ronnstrand L. Bohmer F.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is a widely expressed cytosolic non-transmembrane PTP containing two SH2 domains at the N terminus and a single central phosphatase domain. It is reported that when PDGF receptor is autophosphorylated by PDGF, SHP-2 binds to PDGF receptor, and its phosphatase activity is up-regulated to dephosphorylate PDGF receptor (28Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.A. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21478-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pluskey S. Wandless T.J.

We show here a novel role of afadin in the regulation of the activation of PDGF receptor and Ras-ERK signaling. When afadin is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src activated in response to PDGF, it binds to SHP-2 and stimulates the phosphatase activity of SHP-2, resulting in dephosphorylation of PDGF receptor. This contributes to the fine tuning of the activation of PDGF receptor and Ras-ERK signaling. We also found that the afadin- and SHP-2-mediated regulation of PDGF receptor and Ras-ERK signaling are important for the formation of leading-edge structures necessary for directional cell movement. Cell Culture, Expression Vectors, Transfection, and Knockdown Experiment—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum.

Afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells, in which afadin is stably knocked down, were generated as follows; the fragment containing the H1-RNA promoter and short hairpin RNA sequence against afadin was excised from the pBS-H1-afadin vector, which was previously created to transiently knock down afadin as described (10Sato T. Fujita N. Yamada A. Ooshio T. Okamoto R. Irie K. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Miwa (University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan) to construct the pEB-H1-afadin vector. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the short hairpin RNA specific for afadin were generated by the transfection of pEB-H1-afadin into NIH3T3 cells followed by selection with 500 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque). Control NIH3T3 cells for afadin short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were similarly produced using scrambled shRNA sequence (5′-CCATCTCAATTCTTGGACG-3′). To knock down SHP-2, double-stranded 25-nucleotide RNA duplex (Stealth™ RNA interference; Invitrogen) for SHP-2 (5′-CCACUUUGGCUGAACUGGUUCAGUA-3′) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells with HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). As a control for SHP-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), the scrambled RNA duplex (5′-CCAGGUUAGUCGUCACUUGAUCGUA-3′) was also purchased from Invitrogen and transfected into NIH3T3 cells. For DNA transfection, the Lipofectamine 2000 or the Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen) was used. Antibodies and Reagents—A rabbit anti-afadin polyclonal Ab (pAb) and a mouse anti-afadin monoclonal Ab (mAb) were prepared as described (30Sakisaka T. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Miyahara M.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and fluorophore-conjugated secondary Abs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Chemicon, respectively. PDGF-BB and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from PEPROTECH and Sigma, respectively. Vitronectin was purified from human plasma (Kohjinbio) as described (31Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PDGF Receptor and ERK and Activation of Ras—To examine the level of the phosphorylation of PDGF receptor and ERK in each kind of NIH3T3 cells after the PDGF stimulation, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated with 15 ng/ml PDGF at 25 °C for the indicated periods of time. After being washed with ice-cold PBS, cells were harvested using prewarmed Laemmli buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I (Sigma), boiled for 5 min, and sonicated 3 times for 10 s with 20-s cooling periods. Protein concentrations of the samples were determined using an RC DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a reference protein. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated phospho-specific Abs. To assess the activation of Ras, the pulldown assay was performed as described previously (33Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Shingai T. Fujito T. Yamada A. Minami Y. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36419-36425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the treatment with PDGF, cells were lysed with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μm p-aminophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Raf-RBD+CRD (the Ras binding and cysteine-rich domains of Raf-1 fused to GST) and incubated at 2 °C for 30 min. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 0 °C for 5 min and incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 2 °C for 1 h. After the beads were washed with Buffer A, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the anti-Ras mAb. Band intensity was assessed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and paired Student's t tests were performed for statistical analysis. Immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293 cells expressing in various combinations of the indicated molecules were lysed with Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were rotated for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then incubated with the anti-FLAG mAb or the anti-Myc mAb at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with the protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling with the SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated Abs. To investigate the interaction of endogenous SHP-2 with afadin in a c-Src-dependent manner, NIH3T3 cells were treated with or without 10 μm PP2 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) dissolved in 0.2% Me2SO, 10 μm PP3 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) dissolved in 0.2% Me2SO, 10 μm SU6656 (Sigma) dissolved in 0.2% Me2SO, or 0.2% Me2SO as a negative control in DMEM for 4 h and lysed with Buffer B, and the cell lysates were incubated with the anti-SHP-2 mAb or control mouse IgG by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. Biotinylation Assay for Internalization of PDGF Receptor upon PDGF Stimulation—After stimulation with 15 ng/ml PDGF for the indicated periods of time, cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido) ethyldithioproprionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with streptavidin beads (Sigma) to collect bound biotinylated proteins. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Direct Binding of SHP-2 to Afadin—Recombinant GST-fused full-length SHP-2 (GST-SHP-2) was prepared as described (34Takekuni K. Ikeda W. Fujito T. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5497-5500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused full-length afadin (MBP-afadin) was prepared as described (6Hoshino T. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Yamada T. Kimura T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, High Five insect cells were infected with the baculovirus bearing the afadin cDNA, cultured for 64 h, treated with or without 0.1 mm pervanadate for 8 h, and then purified by the use of TALON metal affinity beads (Clontech). Pervanadate, which strongly inhibits tyrosine dephosphorylation and, thus, retains tyrosine phosphorylation, was prepared as described (35Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of purified MBP-afadin was confirmed by Western blotting. To examine the affinities of SHP-2 for afadin, GST-SHP-2 or GST was incubated with MBP-afadin (20 pmol) immobilized on 20 μl of amylose resin beads in 400 μl of Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 27.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer C, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The amount of bound GST-SHP-2 was determined by comparing the band intensity of various amounts of BSA using a densitometer Fluorchem™ (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The Kd value was calculated by Scatchard analysis. Phosphatase Assay for SHP-2—Control NIH3T3 or afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells were seeded at density of 2.5 × 103 cells/cm2, cultured for 18 h, starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 16 h, and then stimulated with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and 15 ng/ml PDGF at 25 °C for 0 or 2 min. After stimulation, the cells were lysed with Buffer D (25 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100). The cell lysates were rotated for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then incubated with the anti-SHP-2 mAb at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with the protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the beads were extensively washed twice with Buffer D and twice with PTP buffer (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Beads were re-suspended in 50 μl of PTP buffer supplemented with 250 μm phosphopeptide, TSTEPQpYQPGENL (pY is phosphotyrosine, Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To assess the amount of free phosphate from reactions, aliquots of supernatants were added in 96-well plates with 100 μl of malachite green solution (Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Absorbances were read at 620 nm with a microplate reader. The absorbance was compared with a phosphate standard curve to determine the release of phosphate in picomoles. For the quantities of inorganic phosphate released, the absorbance values were in the middle of the optical density range where the absorbance curve is linear. To control the expression levels of SHP-2 in the immune complex in the assays, aliquots of the immune complexes were Western blotted using the anti-SHP-2 mAb. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Paired Student's t test was performed for statistical analysis. Cell Proliferation and Directional Stimulation by PDGF—Cell proliferation assessed by BrdUrd incorporation was performed as described previously (36Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and afadin-knockdown and SHP-2-knockdown NIH3T3 cells were starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 24 h and then stimulated by 30 ng/ml PDGF and 10 μg/ml insulin for the indicated periods of time. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 2 h before the end of the stimulation. For directional stimulation of cells with PDGF, the μ-Slide VI flow (Ibidi), which has six parallel channels and was coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin, was used to generate a concentration gradient of PDGF as described previously (23Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentration gradient of PDGF was made using DMEM containing 30 ng/ml PDGF and 0.5% BSA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2, cultured for 18 h, and starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm U0126 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem).

https://openalex.org/W1993081995,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are promising anticancer agents but their long-term use at high doses is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. The molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer or toxic cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors remain unknown. Here we report that COX-2-selective celecoxib and a novel COX-2 inhibitor ON09310 upregulate death receptor 5 (DR5) and cooperate with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), the ligand for DR5, to induce apoptosis in COX-2-positive and -negative cancer cells. We also show that both agents engage GADD153/CHOP to transcriptionally upregulate DR5 expression; GADD153/CHOP is a C/EBP homologous transcription factor implicated in cellular stress response and apoptosis. Based on our results, we propose that (1) these agents appear to mediate their effects, at least in part, by engaging GADD153/CHOP to activate DR5-dependent apoptotic pathway and (2) their regulation of GADD153/CHOP and DR5 expression appears to occur independent of their COX-2 inhibitory effects. Our results also indicate that ON09310 is generally more potent than celecoxib and, at lower concentration, strongly cooperates with TRAIL to induce apoptosis. Taken together, our findings form the basis for future in-depth studies to further explore the utility of TRAIL and/or agonistic anti-DR5 antibodies in combination with low-dose COX-2 inhibitors as a rational approach for cancer prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2061495418,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) synthesizes and transfers ADP ribose polymers to target proteins, and regulates DNA repair and genomic integrity maintenance. PARP-1 also plays a crucial role in the progression of the inflammatory response, and its inhibition confers protection in several models of inflammatory disorders. Here, we investigate the impact of a selective PARP-1 inhibitor in experimental arthritis. PARP-1 inhibition with 5-aminoisoquinolinone (AIQ) significantly reduces incidence and severity of established collagen-induced arthritis, completely abrogating joint swelling and destruction of cartilage and bone. The therapeutic effect of AIQ is associated with a striking reduction of the two deleterious components of the disease, i.e. the Th1-driven autoimmune and inflammatory responses. AIQ downregulates the production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, decreases the antigen-specific Th1-cell expansion, and induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Our results provide evidence of the contribution of PARP-1 to the progression of arthritis and identify this protein as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2001040136,"Despite substantial progress in defining central components of the circadian pacemaker, the output pathways coupling the clock to rhythmic physiological events remain elusive. We previously showed that LARK is a Drosophila RNA-binding protein which functions downstream of the clock to mediate behavioral outputs. To better understand the roles of LARK in the circadian system, we sought to identify RNA molecules associated with it, in vivo, using a three-part strategy to (1) capture RNA ligands by immunoprecipitation, (2) visualize the captured RNAs using whole-genome microarrays, and (3) identify functionally relevant targets through genetic screens. We found that LARK is associated with a large number of RNAs, in vivo, consistent with its broad expression pattern. Overexpression of LARK increases protein abundance for certain targets without affecting RNA level, suggesting a translational regulatory role for the RNA-binding protein. Phenotypic screens of target-gene mutants have identified several with rhythm-specific circadian defects, indicative of effects on clock output pathways. In particular, a hypomorphic mutation in the E74 gene, E74(BG01805), was found to confer an early-eclosion phenotype reminiscent of that displayed by a mutant with decreased LARK gene dosage. Molecular analyses demonstrate that E74A protein shows diurnal changes in abundance, similar to LARK. In addition, the E74(BG01805) allele enhances the lethal phenotype associated with a lark null mutation, whereas overexpression of LARK suppresses the early eclosion phenotype of E74(BG01805), consistent with the idea that E74 is a target, in vivo. Our results suggest a model wherein LARK mediates the transfer of temporal information from the molecular oscillator to different output pathways by interacting with distinct RNA targets."
https://openalex.org/W2060524045,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of increased iron absorption that can result in cirrhosis, diabetes, and other morbidities. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying supranormal glucose tolerance despite decreased insulin secretion in a mouse model of hemochromatosis with deletion of the hemochromatosis gene (Hfe–/–). Hfe–/– mice on 129Sv or C57BL/6J backgrounds have decreased glucose excursions after challenge compared with controls. In the C57BL/6J/ Hfe–/–, for example, incremental area under the glucose curve is reduced 52% (p < 0.001) despite decreased serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance is decreased 50% (p < 0.05). When studied by the euglycemic clamp technique 129Sv/Hfe–/– mice exhibit a 20% increase in glucose disposal (p < 0.05) at submaximal insulin but no increase at maximal insulin compared with wild types. [1,2-13C]d-glucose clearance from plasma is significantly increased in Hfe–/– mice (19%, p < 0.05), and lactate derived from glycolysis is elevated 5.1-fold in Hfe–/– mice (p < 0.0001). Basal but not insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is elevated in isolated soleus muscle from Hfe–/– mice (p < 0.03). Compared with controls Hfe–/– mice exhibit no differences in serum lipid, insulin, glucagon, or thyroid hormone levels; adiponectin levels are elevated 41% (p < 0.05), and the adiponectin message in adipocytes is increased 83% (p = 0.04). Insulin action measured by phosphorylation of Akt is not enhanced in muscle, but phosphorylation of AMP-dependent kinase is increased. We conclude that supranormal glucose tolerance in iron overload is characterized by increased glucose disposal that does not result from increased insulin action. Instead, the Hfe–/– mice demonstrate increased adiponectin levels and activation of AMP-dependent kinase.

Hereditary hemochromatosis Type 1, an autosomal recessive disorder, occurs at a frequency of ∼0.5% in populations of Northern European extraction (1Edwards C. Lee G.R. Lukens J. Paraskevas F.

Most patients with hemochromatosis are homozygous for a missense mutation (C282Y) in the Hfe protein (3Feder J.N. Tsuchihashi Z. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Mapa F.A. Morikang E. Prass C.E. Starnes S.M.

This results in an inability of serum iron to normally regulate secretion of the peptide hepcidin, allowing unlimited egress of dietary iron from duodenal cells and macrophages into the circulation (4Nemeth E.

The fully penetrant clinical syndrome is characterized by skin pigmentation, cirrhosis, arthritis, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and other endocrinopathies, although phenotypic expression varies greatly (1Edwards C. Lee G.R. Lukens J. Paraskevas F. Greer J.P. Rodgers G.M. Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1999: 1056-1070Google Scholar). Iron excess is also associated with non-hemochromatotic diabetes and other aspects of the metabolic syndrome, although causality and pathogenic mechanisms for that association are not established (6Jehn M. Clark J.M. Guallar E. Diabetes Care. 2004; 27: 2422-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 7Iwasaki T. Nakajima A. Yoneda M. Yamada Y. Mukasa K. Fujita K. Fujisawa N. Wada K. Terauchi Y.

Diabetes is part of the classic presentation of hemochromatosis, and we have recently reported that the prevalence of diabetes in persons with hemochromatosis over the age of 45 exceeds 20% (10McClain D.A. Abraham D. Rogers J. Brady R. Gault P. Ajioka R. Kushner J.P. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In a mouse model with targeted deletion of the Hfe gene (Hfe–/–), insulin secretory capacity is diminished secondary to loss of β-cell mass and desensitization of glucose-induced insulin secretion (11Cooksey R.C. Jouihan H.A. Ajioka R.S. Hazel M.W. Jones D.L. Kushner J.P. McClain D.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5305-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial function is also impaired in Hfe–/– mice. 3H. Jouihan and D. A. McClain, submitted for publication. These defects, however, are well compensated and affected mice have supranormal glucose tolerance. Humans with hemochromatosis have a similar phenotype, namely decreased insulin secretion that tends to be compensated by increased insulin sensitivity (10McClain D.A. Abraham D. Rogers J. Brady R. Gault P. Ajioka R. Kushner J.P. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most individuals with hemochromatosis and diabetes are overweight, suggesting that when obesity-related insulin resistance intervenes, these individuals are not able to compensate with increased insulin secretion due to the loss of β-cell mass (10McClain D.A. Abraham D. Rogers J. Brady R. Gault P. Ajioka R. Kushner J.P. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Normalization of iron stores results in increased insulin secretion but decreased insulin sensitivity (12Abraham D. Rogers J. Gault P. Kushner J.P. McClain D.A. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results suggest that iron plays a role in regulating metabolism and glucose disposal. We therefore examined glucose homeostasis in the Hfe–/– mouse to determine the mechanism for the enhanced glucose tolerance. We report that the increased glucose disposal is associated with increased adiponectin production and activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) 4The abbreviations used are: AMPKAMP-dependent kinaseHOMA-IRhomeostasis model assessment of insulin resistanceGLUT4glucose transporter 4 in skeletal muscle. AMP-dependent kinase homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance glucose transporter 4 Experimental Animals—Targeted mutagenesis produced a knockout of the Hfe gene (Hfe–/–) (13Levy J.E. Montross L.K. Cohen D.E. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 9-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation was bred onto the 129/SvEvTac and C57BL/6J genetic backgrounds for over ten generations. Normal chow (Harlan Teklad TD-8640) contained 4.5% of calories as fat and 0.33 g/kg iron. Age- and sex-matched wild-type 129SvEvTac/Hfe+/+ or C57BL/6J/Hfe+/+ littermates were used as controls. Procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Utah. Glucose Tolerance Testing—Following a 6-h fast mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg/g glucose in 0.9% saline. Glucose levels were measured from tail vein blood (3 μl, Glucometer Elite, Bayer Corp., Tarrytown, NY) at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Blood (30 μl) was collected at 0 and 30 min for insulin determinations. Values for the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated from the product of fasting serum glucose (mm) and insulin (microunits/ml) divided by 22.5 (14Matthews D.R. Hosker J.P. Rudenski A.S. Naylor B.A. Treacher D.F. Turner R.C. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25861) Google Scholar). Euglycemic Clamp Procedure—The jugular vein was catheterized under avertin anesthesia, using Micro-Renathane tubing (Braintree Scientific, Inc., MRE 025). After a 48-h recovery, mice were fasted overnight and infused through the catheter with [3H]glucose (20 μCi bolus, 0.1 μCi/min). A dual infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 33) was used to infuse insulin at a constant flow rate and 50% dextrose at a variable rate to maintain glucose at 100–150 mg/dl. Glucose was measured at 10-min intervals as described above for glucose tolerance testing. After steady state was reached for three successive glucometer readings five tail vein blood samples were collected every 20 min to measure specific activity. These samples were air-dried to remove tritiated water and counted in scintillation counter. The glucose infusion rate was calculated as: flow rate (milliliters/h)/60/kg/2. Glucose turnover rate (milligrams/kg/min) was calculated as the tracer infusion rate (dpm/min) divided by the plasma glucose-specific activity (dpm/min/mg) corrected for body weight. Hepatic glucose output was calculated as the difference between the tracer-derived rate of glucose appearance and the infusion rate of glucose. Ex Vivo Glucose Uptake into Isolated Soleus Muscle—2-Deoxy-d-glucose uptake was measured as previously described (15Holland W.L. Brozinick J.T. Wang L.P. Hawkins E.D. Sargent K.M. Liu Y. Narra K. Hoehn K.L. Knotts T.A. Siesky A. Nelson D.H. Karathanasis S.K. Fontenot G.K. Birnbaum M.J. Summers S.A. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Both soleus muscles were excised from Hfe–/– and wild-type mice and preincubated for 1 h in 2 ml of Krebs Ringer buffer containing bovine serum albumin (1.25%), mannitol (32 mm), and glucose (8 mm). The muscles were then placed in a wash solution for 10 min containing Krebs Ringer buffer with bovine serum albumin (1.25%), mannitol (40 mm), and pyruvate (2 mm). Muscles were then transferred to transport media for 20 min containing Krebs Ringer buffer, mannitol (39 mm), 2-deoxy-d-glucose (1 mm), [2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (1.5 μCi/ml), and [14C]mannitol (0.256 μCi/ml). One soleus muscle from each mouse was placed in transport media for basal measurement, and the second muscle was placed in transport media plus insulin (13.3 nm). All incubations were performed in a shaking water bath at 29 °C. After the final incubation muscles were flash frozen, weighed, and digested for 10 min at 70 °C with KOH (1.0 m, 0.5 ml), and then neutralized with HCl (1.0 m, 0.5 ml). Aliquots were collected for scintillation counting. Presence of [14C]mannitol was used to correct for the amount of extracellular 2-deoxy-d-glucose that was nonspecifically taken up into the tissue but not transported into muscle cells. Counts were normalized to muscle weight. Stable Isotope Tracer Studies—The [1,2-13C2]d-glucose tracer (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA, >98% isotopic purity and positional accuracy) was injected intraperitoneally (1 mg/g) 3 h prior to harvest of tissues. 1 and 2 h following tracer injection 50 μl of serum was collected from the tail vein. At 3 h animals were anesthetized, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Tissues were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen after sacrifice. Serum was deproteinized, and the derived glucose was treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and acetic anhydride to create the aldonitrile pentaacetate derivative for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Glucose molecular ion and its positional isotopomers were monitored at the m/z 328 ion cluster. Lactate was extracted by ethyl acetate after acidification with HCl and derivatized to its propylaminehepafluorobutyl ester form, and the m/z 328 (carbons 1–3 of lactate, chemical ionization) was monitored for the detection of m1 (recycled lactate through the pentose cycle) and m2 (lactate produced by glycolysis) for the estimation of glucose-triose cycling (16Lee W.N. Byerley L.O. Bassilian S. Ajie H.O. Clark I. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Lee W.N. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mass spectral data were obtained on the HP5973 mass selective detector connected to an HP6890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The settings were as follows: gas chromatography inlet 230 °C, transfer line 280 °C, mass spectrometry source 230 °C, and mass spectrometry Quad 150 °C. An HP-5 capillary column was used for glucose and lactate analysis. Mass spectral analyses were carried out by three independent automatic injections of 1-ml samples and accepted only if the standard sample deviation was <1% of the normalized peak intensity. Acute Insulin Treatment and Western Blotting for Activation of Akt and AMPK—Age-matched (6–8 month) male mice were injected with insulin (0.75 unit/kg) or saline. After 30 min, hind limb muscle was collected, and tissue homogenates were prepared for Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Ser-21), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser-79), AMPK (Thr-172), and total Akt and AMPK were detected by immunoblotting (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Quantitation of Non-heme Iron in Isolated Muscle Tissue—Non-heme iron in muscle tissue was quantified as described previously (18Rebouche C.J. Wilcox C.L. Widness J.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2004; 58: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscle (10 mg) tissue was lysed in hydrochloric acid and trichloroacetic acid. After heating for 1 h at 95 °C, non-heme iron was released into the supernatant, where it was reacted with ferrozine in the presence of thioglycolic acid quantified by spectrophotometry. Adipocyte Preparation, Sizing, and Quantitation of Muscle and Adipocyte Transcript Levels by Reverse Transcription-PCR—After a 24-h fast, mice were sacrificed and hind limb muscle and epididymal fat pads were dissected. Muscle was submerged in a volume of ∼8- to 10-fold of RNA-Later (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored at –20 °C. After homogenization, RNA extraction was performed according to the TRI Reagent manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Epididymal fat pads were digested with 4 mg/ml Collagenase type VIII (Sigma) in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min in a rotating water bath (180 rpm) at 37 °C. The adipocytes were strained through a 100-μm nylon mesh, washed with 10 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution, and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min. Adipocyte size was determined in aliquots of the isolated adipocytes fixed in osmium tetraoxide as described (19Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For RNA preparation, the fat cake was transferred to a clean tube, and the infranatant removed. RNA was extracted using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with 3.0 μg of RNA and 240 ng of oligo-dT (Invitrogen) in 20 μl. Real-time PCR was performed with a thermal cycler (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics) as described (20Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24 (960, 962): 954-958PubMed Google Scholar). Primers were designed using Primer 3 software. Reactions (10 μl) were performed using 8 ng of cDNA. For each transcript, analyses of the melting curves and visualization after agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the absence of nonspecific products. Quantitation of cDNA products was accomplished by the LightCycler software. Standard curves of log cDNA amount versus crossing point cycle number were constructed for each run. The following primers were used (designed using Primer3 Software): adiponectin (AdipoQ) 5′-GGAACTTGTGCAGGTTGGAT-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTCCAGGCTCTCCTTT, cyclophilin A (Ppia) 5′-AGCACTGGAGAGAAAGGATTTGG and 5′-TCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATT, and ribosomal protein L13a (Rpl13a) 5′-GGAGAAACGGAAGGAAAAGG and 5′-ACAGGAGCAGTGCCTAAGGA. Sample concentrations were calculated automatically by the LightCycler software using the second derivative maximum method. AdipoQ levels were normalized to the geometric mean of the Ppia and Rpl13a levels for the same sample. All samples were repeated in triplicate for each primer set. Statistical Procedures—Descriptive statistics are represented as average ± S.E. The Student t test (two tailed) was used to compare differences between groups. Improved Glucose Tolerance in Hfe–/– Mice—Glucose tolerance was assessed in male mice aged 6–8 months, when significant iron has accumulated in tissues (11Cooksey R.C. Jouihan H.A. Ajioka R.S. Hazel M.W. Jones D.L. Kushner J.P. McClain D.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5305-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the 129SvEvTac strain of Hfe–/– mice have been described and include decreased serum glucose excursions after challenge despite decreased insulin levels (11Cooksey R.C. Jouihan H.A. Ajioka R.S. Hazel M.W. Jones D.L. Kushner J.P. McClain D.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5305-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We first replicated these findings in a separate cohort (Fig. 1A) to allow comparison to the C57BL/6J strain as described below. Fasting glucose values were 17% lower (p < 0.01, see also Table 3 below), and total and incremental areas under the glucose curve were, respectively, 27 and 56% lower in the 129SvEvTac Hfe–/– mice compared with wild types (not shown, p < 0.0001). The differences in glucose tolerance were not accounted for by differences in body weight (normal chow: wild type, 28.7 ± 0.4 g; Hfe–/–, 28.5 ± 0.4 g). No differences in body composition were detected by dual photon absorptiometry; specifically, the fat mass was 15 ± 4% in the wild types and 15 ± 2% in the Hfe–/– mice (not shown).TABLE 3Fasting serum chemistries in 129SvEvTac wild-type and Hfe-/- miceWild typeHfe-/-Glucose (mg/dl)103.7 ± 2.185.8 ± 1.1ap < 0.01 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.Insulin (ng/ml)0.29 ± 0.030.26 ± 0.03Adiponectin (μg/ml)6.8 ± 0.49.6 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.Glucagon (pg/ml)77.4 ± 5.186.1 ± 9.7Leptin (ng/ml)7.1 ± 1.15.5 ± 1.5Resistin (ng/ml)3.1 ± 0.43.6 ± 0.3Free T4 (μg/ml)0.26 ± 0.020.32 ± 0.06Triglycerides (mg/dl)52.3 ± 5.331.5 ± 8.6Free fatty acids (mm)0.7 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.2a p < 0.01 for Hfe-/- versus wild type. Open table in a new tab To examine whether the enhanced glucose tolerance is strain-specific, we crossed the Hfe–/– knockout onto the diabetes- and obesity-prone C57BL/6J strain. The glucose tolerance of the wild-type C57BL/6J mice is worse than that of the wild-type 129SvEvTac strain, but the Hfe–/– mutation also resulted in improved glucose tolerance in the C57BL/6J strain (Fig. 1B). There was a 34% decrease in the total area under the glucose curve and a 52% decrease in the incremental area under the glucose curve in the C57BL/6J/Hfe–/– mice (not shown, p = 0.001). Fasting glucose was 18% lower in the C57BL/6J/Hfe–/– compared with wild types (p = NS). Body weights did not differ between the C57BL/6J Hfe–/– and wild types (wild type, 22.0 ± 0.6 g; Hfe–/–, 21.0 ± 0.4 g). Increased Glucose Disposal Rates and Insulin Sensitivity in Hfe–/– Mice—Our previously published data demonstrate that improved glucose tolerance is maintained in the face of lower insulin levels, suggesting that the Hfe–/– mice are more insulin-sensitive (11Cooksey R.C. Jouihan H.A. Ajioka R.S. Hazel M.W. Jones D.L. Kushner J.P. McClain D.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5305-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We therefore performed euglycemic clamp studies in the 129SvEvTac strain. The glucose disposal rate of Hfe–/– mice at submaximal (5 milliunits/kg/min) insulin was 36% higher than in wild types (p < 0.05). In the Hfe–/– mice the glucose disposal rate did not increase further at maximal (10 milliunits/kg/min) insulin, whereas wild-type mice showed a 20% increase in glucose disposal rate at 10 milliunits/kg/min insulin compared with 5 milliunits/kg/min insulin (Fig. 2, p = 0.05). Wild-type and Hfe–/– mice had comparable glucose disposal rates at maximal insulin. The increased insulin sensitivity seen in the 129SvEvTac strain was also present in the C57BL/6J/Hfe–/– mice. The insulin resistance indices determined by HOMA-IR were significantly lower in both strains of Hfe–/– mice compared with wild types of that same strain (Table 1). The magnitude of the effect of Hfe deletion was greater in the C57BL/6J than the 129 strain: 129SvEvTac/Hfe–/– showed a 25% reduction in HOMA-IR (p < 0.05) and a 14% reduction (p = NS) in fasting insulin values compared with wild-type controls, whereas the C57BL/6J/Hfe–/– showed a 50% reduction in HOMA-IR (p < 0.05) and a 40% reduction in fasting insulin (p < 0.05) compared with controls. We previously reported that post-challenge insulin levels are decreased in 129SvEvTacHfe–/– mice, and the same trend is seen in this smaller cohort for both 129SvEvTac and C57BL/6J strains (Table 1).TABLE 1Serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR values in wild type and Hfe-/- miceStrain/treatmentFasting serum insulinSerum insulin, 30 min post GTTHOMA-IRng/ml129SvEvTac0.29 ± 0.030.37 ± 0.031.60 ± 0.14129SvEvTac/Hfe-/-0.25 ± 0.030.30 ± 0.031.35 ± 0.14ap < 0.05 for Hfe-/- compared to wild-type control of the same strain.

Open table in a new tab Increased Glucose Disappearance and Glycolysis Revealed by Stable Isotope Tracer Studies—We next determined the metabolic fate of absorbed [1,2-13C2]d-glucose administered (as for glucose tolerance testing) intraperitoneally at 1 mg/g. Consistent with the glucose clamp data, Hfe–/– mice exhibited a 19% increase in [1,2-13C2]d-glucose clearance compared with controls (Table 2, p < 0.05). The metabolism of the [1,2-13C2]d-glucose was further tracked and demonstrates increased glycolysis. In vivo metabolism of [1,2-13C2]d-glucose to lactate produces two mass isotopomers, m1 (one 13C substitution, [3-13C1]lactate), produced after glucose oxidation in the pentose cycle, and m2 (two 13C substitutions, [2,3-13C2]lactate), produced by glycolysis (17Lee W.N. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Absolute serum lactate levels were 2.6-fold higher in Hfe–/– mice (Table 2, p < 0.0001), consistent with increased glycolysis. Levels of the m1 isotopomer (singly labeled, derived from the pentose cycle) were 2.7-fold higher in the Hfe–/– mice (p < 0.0001) but were present in similar proportion to total lactate in wild-type (13.2%) compared with Hfe–/– mice (13.7%). The m2 isotopomer product of glycolysis, however, was produced to a significantly greater degree in the Hfe–/– mice (5.1-fold higher in Hfe–/– compared with wild-type mice, p < 0.001) such that the proportion of total lactate derived from glycolysis was approximately doubled in the Hfe–/– mice (wild-type: 4.4%; Hfe–/–: 8.4%; p < 0.05).TABLE 2Metabolic fate of glucose after intraperitoneal challenge with [1,2-13C2]d-glucose in 129SvEvTac wild-type and Hfe-/- miceSerum analyteWild typeHfe-/-Plasma glucose clearance (loss of double-labeled glucose, %)22.1 ± 0.926.3 ± 1.7ap < 0.05 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.Total lactate (total lactate peak heights, 120 min)282 ± 14743 ± 15bp < 0.0001 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.Lactate from pentose cycling (m1 isotopomer, peak height, 120 min)37.3 ± 2.0102.3 ± 2.0Percent of lactate from pentose cycling13.2%13.7%Lactate from glycolysis (m2 isotopomer, peak height, 120 min)12.3 ± 0.862.8 ± 1.2bp < 0.0001 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.Percent of total lactate from glycolysis4.4%8.4%ap < 0.05 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.Glucose recycling (singly/double labeled glucose, %/h)11.8 ± 0.516.0 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.a p < 0.05 for Hfe-/- versus wild type.b p < 0.0001 for Hfe-/- versus wild type. Open table in a new tab The m1 glucose isotopomer, in which [13C]glucose occupies the carbon-1 position, is produced via metabolism of m2 glucose through the pentose cycle followed by gluconeogenesis using the derived m1 lactate as substrate. Therefore, hepatic glucose recycling can be monitored by the reappearance of m1 glucose. Consistent with the increased lactate production, the Hfe–/– mice exhibited a 36% increase in hepatic glucose recycling (p < 0.05) as revealed by the appearance in serum of the m1 glucose isotopomer. Increased Basal but Not Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake into Isolated Soleus Muscle from Hfe–/– Mice—Because skeletal muscle is a major site for glucose disposal, accounting for ∼75% of total glucose disappearance during a hyperinsulinemic clamp study (22Baron A.D. Brechtel G. Wallace P. Edelman S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E769-E774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated glucose uptake and hormone signaling in isolated soleus muscles from the wild-type 129SvEvTac and 129SvEvTac Hfe–/– mice. We first verified that muscle from the Hfe–/– mice was iron-overloaded, with a 2.1-fold increase in non-heme iron (not shown, p = 0.02). Isolated soleus muscles from Hfe–/– mice exhibited an 18% increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with controls in the absence of insulin (p < 0.03). Controls did not differ from Hfe–/– mice in maximally insulin-stimulated uptake (Fig. 3). Expression of mRNAs for the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 were not altered in the Hfe–/– muscle, and Western blotting revealed no change in GLUT1 or GLUT4 protein (not shown). Increased Adiponectin and AMPK Signaling in Hfe–/– Mice—We next investigated the basis for the observed increased glucose tolerance, glucose disposal, and insulin sensitivity of the Hfe–/– mice by measuring a series of fasting serum hormone and metabolite levels in males of the 129SvEvTac strain (Table 3). The only statistically significant differences noted were in fasting glucose and serum adiponectin, with adiponectin levels being 41% higher in the Hfe–/– mice (p < 0.01). Triglycerides and free fatty acids trended lower in the Hfe–/– mice, but not significantly. Intramyocellular lipid levels were also unchanged in the Hfe–/– mice (not shown). The increased adiponectin was attributable to an ∼2-fold up-regulation of adiponectin mRNA levels in isolated primary adipocytes from epididymal fat pads of male 129SvEvTacHfe–/– mice (Fig. 4A). Because of the inverse association of adiponectin levels with obesity (23Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y.

Collectively, these processes are regulated by a fine-tuned balance between the formation and loosening of adhesive contacts, a process involving integrins, and the elevation and diminution of cytoplasmic signalling molecules. We demonstrate that prostaglandin (PG) F2α stimulation rapidly increases the capacity of Ishikawa cells stably expressing the F-prostanoid receptor (FPS) to adhere to vitronectin. Coincident with this elevation in matrix adhesion, we demonstrate a profound PGF2α-induced alteration in cytoskeletal remodelling, characterized by polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and recruitment of focal adhesion kinase at focal adhesions and enhanced cell migration. Moreover, we show that these PGF2α-induced alterations in adhesion and morphology on vitronectin and migration could be abolished by cultivating FPS cells in the presence of integrin αvβ3 antibody or αvβ3-directed tetrapeptide arg–gly–asp–ser or inhibition of FP receptor signalling with the FP receptor antagonist, chemical disruptors of the phospholipase C-β, protein kinase A, c-Src and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase pathways or inhibition of the monomeric G proteins Rho, Rac and CDC42. These results reveal a mechanism by which prostanoids regulate cell movement, which may be relevant to pathologies of the endometrium."
https://openalex.org/W2060575057,"The recent application of genome-wide, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to investigate DNA copy number aberrations in cancer has provided unparalleled sensitivity for identifying genomic changes. In some instances the complexity of these changes makes them difficult to interpret, particularly when tumour samples are contaminated with normal (stromal) tissue. Current automated scoring algorithms require considerable manual data checking and correction, especially when assessing uncultured tumour specimens. To address these limitations we have developed a visual tool to aid in the analysis of DNA copy number data. Simulated DNA Copy Number (SiDCoN) is a spreadsheet-based application designed to simulate the appearance of B-allele and logR plots for all known types of tumour DNA copy number changes, in the presence or absence of stromal contamination. The system allows the user to determine the level of stromal contamination, as well as specify up to 3 different DNA copy number aberrations for up to 5000 data points (representing individual SNPs). This allows users great flexibility to assess simple or complex DNA copy number combinations. We demonstrate how this utility can be used to estimate the level of stromal contamination within tumour samples and its application in deciphering the complex heterogeneous copy number changes we have observed in a series of tumours. We believe this tool will prove useful to others working in the area, both as a training tool, and to aid in the interpretation of complex copy number changes."
https://openalex.org/W2142021077,"Within the hierarchy of epithelial stem cells, normal progenitor cells may express regulated telomerase during renewal cycles of proliferation and differentiation. Discontinuous telomerase activity may promote increased renewal capacity of progenitor cells, while deregulated/continuous telomerase activity may promote immortalization when differentiation and/or senescent pathways are compromised. In the present work, we show that resveratrol activates, while progesterone inactivates, continuous telomerase activity within 24 h in subpopulations of human Li-Fraumeni syndrome-derived breast epithelial cells. Resveratrol results in immortalization of mixed progenitor cells with mutant p53, but not human epithelial cells with wild type p53. Our results demonstrate the potential for renewing progenitor cells with mutant p53 to immortalize after continuous telomerase expression when exposed to certain environmental compounds. Understanding the effects of telomerase modulators on endogenous telomerase activity in progenitor cells is relevant to the role of immortalization in the initiation and progression of cancer subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2045923662,"At least two cellular processes are required for corneal epithelium homeostasis and wound repair: cell proliferation and cell-cell adhesion. These processes are delicately balanced to ensure the maintenance of normal epithelial function. During wound healing, these processes must be reprogrammed in coordination to achieve a rapid re-epithelialization. Basonuclin (Bnc1) is a cell-type-specific transcription factor expressed mainly in the proliferative keratinocytes of stratified epithelium (e.g., corneal epithelium, epidermis and esophageal epithelium) and the gametogenic cells in testis and ovary. Our previous work suggested that basonuclin could regulate transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) and genes involved in chromatin structure, transcription regulation, cell-cell junction/communication, ion-channels and intracelllular transportation. However, basonuclin's role in keratinocytes has not been demonstrated in vivo. Here we show that basonuclin-null mutation disrupts corneal epithelium homeostasis and delays wound healing by impairing cell proliferation. In basonuclin-null cornea epithelium, RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription is perturbed. This perturbation is unique because it affects transcripts from a subset of rDNA. Basonuclin-null mutation also perturbs RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts from genes encoding chromatin structure proteins histone 3 and HMG2, transcription factor Gli2, gap-junction protein connexin 43 and adheren E-cadherin. In most cases, a concerted change in mRNA and protein level is observed. However, for E-cadherin, despite a notable increase in its mRNA level, its protein level was reduced. In conclusion, our study establishes basonuclin as a regulator of corneal epithelium homeostasis and maintenance. Basonuclin likely coordinates functions of a subset of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) and a group of protein coding genes in cellular processes critical for the regulation of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2082850988,"COP1 is an evolutionarily conserved RING-finger ubiquitin ligase acting within a Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complex that promotes polyubiquitination of c-Jun and p53. Stability of the above substrates is affected by post-translational changes priming the proteins for polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. However, degradation of both substrates is controlled indirectly by signaling pathways affecting the E3 ligases involved in their polyubiquitination. Here, we report the identification of COP1D, a ubiquitously expressed splice variant of COP1 lacking a portion of a coiled-coil region involved in intermolecular associations. While being unable to associate with other components of the CRL complex, COP1D exerts a dominant-negative function over the full-length protein, due to its ability to heterodimerize with COP1 and sequester it from the enzymatically active complex. Ectopic expression of COP1D antagonizes the function of COP1, while its selective downregulation by RNA interference promotes more efficient degradation of c-Jun and p53 by the full-length protein. The COP1/COP1D mRNA ratio is modulated by UV stress and a decreased COP1/COP1D ratio correlates with elevated c-Jun, but not p53 protein levels in invasive ductal breast cancer. Thus, dynamic changes of the COP1/COP1D ratio provide an additional level of regulation of the half-life of the substrates of this E3 ligase under homeostatic or pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2108714279,"Organisms often exhibit phenotypic plasticity in multiple traits in response to impending environmental change. Multiple traits phenotypic plasticity is complex syndrome brought on by causal relations in ecological and physiological context. Larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus exhibit inducible phenotypic plasticity of two traits, when at risk of predation by dragonfly larvae. One induced phenotype is an adaptive defense behaviour, i.e., stasis at the bottom of water column, directly triggered by the predation risk. Another one is a compensatory phenotype, i.e., enlarged external gills, for an unavoidable cost (hypoxia) associated with the induced defense. We identified two ways by which this compensatory phenotype could be induced. The compensatory phenotype is induced in response to not only the associated hypoxic conditions resulting from the induced defense but also the most primary but indirect cause, presence of the predator."
https://openalex.org/W2046774277,"Recent studies suggest that the regulation of longevity may be partially conserved in many eukaryotes ranging from yeast to mammals. The three yeast mutants sch9Delta, ras2Delta, tor1Delta show extended chronological life span up to three folds. Our aim is to dissect the mechanisms that lead to the yeast life span extension.We obtain gene expression profiles of sch9Delta, ras2Delta, tor1Delta as well as that for a wild type at day 2.5 in SDC medium using Affymetrix Yeast2.0 arrays. To accurately estimate the expression differentiation between the wild type and the long-lived mutants, we use sub-array normalization followed by a variant of the median-polishing summarization. The results are validated by the probe sets of S. pombe on the same chips. To translate the differentiation into changes of biological activities, we make statistical inference by integrating the expression profiles with biological gene subsets defined by Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, and cellular localization of proteins. Other than subset-versus-other comparisons, we also make local comparisons between two directly-related gene subsets such as cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes. Our consensus is obtained by cross-examination of these inferences. The significant and systematic differentiation in the three long-lived strains includes: lower transcriptional activities; down-regulation of TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation versus up-regulation of the KEGG pathway Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis; the overall reduction of mitochondrial activities. We also report some different expression patterns such as reduction of the activities relating to mitosis in ras2Delta.The modification of energy pathways and modification of compartment activities such as down-regulation of mitochondrial ribosome proteins versus up-regulation of cytosolic ribosome proteins are directly associated with the life span extension in yeast. The results provide a new and systematic S. cerevisiae version of the free radical theory from the perspective of functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2088307325,"The atonal homolog 5 (ATH5) protein is central to the transcriptional network regulating the specification of retinal ganglion cells, and its expression comes under the spatiotemporal control of several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in the course of retina development. Monitoring the in vivo occupancy of the ATH5 promoter by the ATH5, Ngn2, and NeuroM proteins and analyzing the DNA motifs they bind, we show that three evolutionarily conserved E-boxes are required for the bHLH proteins to control the different phases of ATH5 expression. E-box 4 mediates the activity of Ngn2, ATH5, and NeuroM along the pathway leading to the conversion of progenitors into newborn neurons. E-box 1, by mediating the antagonistic effects of Ngn2 and HES1 in proliferating progenitors, controls the expansion of the ATH5 expression domain in early retina. E-box 2 is required for the positive feedback by ATH5 that underlies the up-regulation of ATH5 expression when progenitors are going through their last cell cycle.

These findings indicate a requirement for different combinations of bHLH proteins in regulating the different phases of ATH5 expression in the course of retina development. In proliferating progenitors, activation of ATH5 by Ngn2 is counteracted by HES1, which contributes to maintain expression of ATH5 at a low level in these uncommitted cells. When the cells enter their last cell cycle, the down-regulation of HES1 leads to the rapid, self-stimulated up-regulation of ATH5. The cells then exit the cell cycle, whereupon ATH5 and NeuroM cooperate to maintain ATH5 expression in the newborn RGCs (5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which neuronal bHLH transcription factors select their targets in the developing nervous system has remained elusive. bHLH proteins form heterodimers through the interaction of the HLH domains. The basic regions act as sequence-specific DNA binding domains that recognize a binding site with the sequence CANNTG, the consensus E-box. A simple model for the role of neurogenic bHLH proteins posits that they regulate transcription by binding to the E-boxes in the regulatory regions of genes expressed in neurons. This basic model has several shortcomings. First, E-boxes occur frequently in the genome, not just in the regulatory regions of neural genes. Second, the many different subfamilies of bHLH proteins recognize the same canonical sequence. Mechanisms must, therefore, be in place to limit the potential of these proteins promiscuously to activate or repress genes. Here, we monitor changes in the in vivo occupancy of the ATH5 proximal promoter by bHLH proteins during the course of retina development. Dynamic changes in the binding of these proteins correlate with the different phases of ATH5 expression along the RGC specification and differentiation pathway. By analyzing the functional properties of a cis-regulatory region encompassing the ATH5 promoter, we show that three evolutionarily conserved E-boxes play a crucial role in regulating the ATH5 gene. Whereas Ngn2 requires all three E-boxes to activate ATH5 properly, two mediate autoregulation by ATH5, and one is sufficient for activation by NeuroM. In addition, one E-box mediates the antagonistic effects of HES1 and Ngn2. In sum, we demonstrate how differential occupancy at three regulatory sites modulates ATH5 transcription as development proceeds.

Wild-type and mutated upstream sequences 912 bp in length and bounded by XbaI and BstXI restriction sites (GenBank™ AJ630209) were subcloned in the proper orientation at appropriate sites in the vectors p00-CAT, p00-lacZ, pEGFP, and pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech). In control experiments wild-type and mutated upstream sequences 2220 bp in length and bounded by EcoRI and BstXI restriction sites were subcloned in the vectors pEGFP and pDsRed2-N1. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutated promoter fragments were checked by sequencing and re-cloned at the EcoRI site of the p00-CAT vector (17Matter J.M. Matter-Sadzinski L. Ballivet M. J.

The deletion Δ(-775;-235) in the 5′ region was generated by PCR from the ATH5 promoter fragment using a downstream primer flanking E-box 4 and corresponding to the region -235 to -214 and an upstream primer located in the region +146 to +125. The PCR fragment was subcloned in the proper orientation into the unique SmaI site of the p00-CAT vector and checked by sequencing. Eukaryotic Expression Plasmids for ATH5, Ngn2, NeuroM, and HES1—The pEMSV plasmid (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M.

In co-transfection experiments, we used 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of expression vector per 106 cells. In all cases the ratio of DNA to Lipofectin (Invitrogen) was 1/4. 24 h after transfection, the cells were either fixed for X-gal staining or harvested and processed for CAT assay. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity was determined using 100 μg of cytosolic proteins, and the activity of the wild-type ATH5 promoter was set arbitrarily at 100. In all experiments a promoter-less reporter plasmid (pCAT00 (18Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.M.

The mixture of protease inhibitors contained 104 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 80 μm aprotinin, 2.1 mm leupeptin, 3.6 mm bestatin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 1.4 mm E-64 and was diluted 100× in the solution. The tissues were then treated to four snap/freeze cycles and left to thaw 30 min under rocking agitation. Cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of E47, ATH5, and NeuroM were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The probes were double-stranded DNA fragments of 70 bp end-labeled by fill-in of the 5′overhang with the Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The probes were purified using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Each electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction was set up by mixing 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) with 20,000-50,000 cpm of probe in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. Usually, 6-8 μg of whole-cell protein extract or 0.5-0.8 μg of purified proteins were used in a total volume reaction of 20 μl. Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice and loaded on 4% acrylamide, 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA gels. After a run of 2.5 h at 180 V and 4 °C, the gels were fixed in 20% ethanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed overnight at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described in Skowronska-Krawczyk et al. (15Skowronska-Krawczyk D. Ballivet M. Dynlacht B.D. Matter J.M. Development. 2004; 131: 4447-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using purified antibodies raised against the bacterially expressed chicken ATH5, Ngn2, and NeuroM proteins. In a typical experiment retinas and optic tecta (the latter, a control tissue expressing Ngn2 and NeuroM but not ATH5) were dissected from HH23 to HH38 embryos and incubated in 1% formaldehyde solution with Dounce homogenization. Cross-linking was blocked, cells were incubated in a lysing solution, and the collected nuclei were sonicated to an average DNA length of 700 bp. Cross-linked chromatin was incubated in a solution containing affinity-purified antibody, and immune complexes were captured on protein A-coated Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitated DNA sequences were quantified by real-time PCR using the iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) and a SYBR-Green-based kit for quantitative PCR (iQ Supermix; Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by comparison to a standard curve generated by serial dilution of input DNA, subtracting values obtained with a control antibody (anti-FLAG M2, Sigma). The data were plotted as the mean of at least two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and three independent amplifications. Immunoprecipitation efficiency was calculated as the ratio of precipitated sequence over total amount of sequence in the input chromatin. The primers used for real-time amplifications were as follows: ath5fwd, GCTGGGAAGGTACTGGGAT; ath5rev, CTTGACTGCCGTCGGAAGC. For the precise localization of the binding sites of the ATH5, Ngn2, and NeuroM proteins upon the ATH5 promoter (Fig. 2B), dye-labeled DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin was hybridized to a custom-designed microarray that encompassed a sequence extending about 1 kilobase pair upstream of the first coding ATG. This selected genomic region was tiled at 100-bp intervals using variable-length polynucleotides to keep a constant target Tm of 76 °C (under contract with NimbleGen Systems Inc). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization on tissue sections were performed as previously described (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). Electroporation of Genetic Material and Confocal Microscopy—Retina electroporations were as described in Matter-Sadzinski et al. (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, embryonic eyes were collected at HH22-23, and the pigmented epithelium was removed. Stripped eyes were positioned in an electroporation chamber (BT 640, BTX, Genetronics) filled with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing reporter plasmids (0.2 μg/μl each) with or without expression vectors (0.1 μg/μl each). Electroporation consisted of five 10-V/cm pulses of 50-ms duration spaced 1 s apart. The polarity was then inverted, and the electroporation protocol was repeated once. The electroporated tissues were cultured as floating explants for 24 h at 37 °C. Identification of lac+ cells was as described in Matter-Sadzinski et al. (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, retinas were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed 24 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mounted in PBS containing 43% glycerol, 21 mm 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2] octane (Sigma). Red and green fluorescent cells were imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LEICA SP2-AOBS) using a20× NA 0.7 oil objective (Leica). An argon/krypton (Ar/ArKr) laser (488 nm line) was used for both GFP and RFP excitation. Optical sections of 0.8 μm were taken through a volume of the retina up to 50 μm in depth. Image data were acquired and stored as TIFF files using confocal software (Leica) or Imaris. The 5′ Promoter Sequence of the Chick ATH5 Gene—We have reported the isolation of a proximal cis-regulatory region of the chick ATH5 gene that reproduces the expression pattern of the endogenous gene when transfected into the retina (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). We sequenced about 1300 base pairs upstream of the first ATG, determined the transcription start site, and identified several putative regulatory elements of which E-boxes were the most in evidence. As shown in Fig. 1A, there are seven E-boxes within the region upstream of the transcription start site. Numbered E1 to E7 in the proximal-to-distal direction, they are located, respectively, -43, -53, -170, -221, -283, -345, and -573 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. In addition, we identified a consensus site for the ubiquitous Sp1 transcription factor at -59 and a typical TATA-box at -20 base pairs. Sequence alignment demonstrates that E1, E2, E4, the Sp1 site, and the TATA box are conserved in distantly related vertebrates (Fig. 1B). The ATH5 Promoter Is Transiently and Sequentially Bound by bHLH Proteins during Retina Development—The expression of ATH5 goes through a sequence of phases during retina development, and the Ngn2, ATH5, and NeuroM proteins contribute differentially to ATH5 promoter activity (5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine how the binding profiles of these proteins to the ATH5 promoter correlate with changes in the kinetics of ATH5 expression in the developing retina. ATH5 mRNA level is low and steady during a first phase that extends between HH18 and HH25 (staged according to Hamburger, and Hamilton (19Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10041) Google Scholar)); it then increases during a second phase (HH26 to HH30) that coincides with the period of development when the majority of RGCs are produced. Finally, ATH5 expression is much decreased in HH35 retina and reaches background level at HH38 (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). ATH5 and Ngn2 are co-expressed (5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar), and to analyze the binding of these proteins to the ATH5 promoter in the course of development, chromatin was prepared from retinas and optic tecta in the range HH22-23 to HH38, and ChIP was performed using antibodies directed against the N-terminal domains of ATH5 and Ngn2 (15Skowronska-Krawczyk D. Ballivet M. Dynlacht B.D. Matter J.M. Development. 2004; 131: 4447-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In retina the binding of Ngn2 and ATH5 was high at HH22-23 and HH29-30 and low at HH35 and HH38 (Fig. 2A). The proportion of ATH5-expressing cells in the retina remains constant between HH22 and HH30, whereas it is much decreased at HH35 and HH38 (Fig. 2B and Refs. 5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 15Skowronska-Krawczyk D. Ballivet M. Dynlacht B.D. Matter J.M. Development. 2004; 131: 4447-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When ChIP efficiency was calculated relative to the proportion of ATH5-expressing cells, the binding of ATH5 was steady between HH22 and HH35, indicating that it may interact with its own promoter along the whole pathway leading to conversion of progenitors into newborn RGCs. In contrast, the decreased occupancy of Ngn2 at HH29-30 and HH35 suggests a role for this factor in progenitors (Figs. 2A, inset). NeuroM is expressed in newborn RGCs (5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To analyze its binding to the ATH5 promoter, ChIP was performed using antibodies directed against the C-terminal domain of NeuroM (Fig. 2A). In retina the binding of NeuroM to the ATH5 promoter was low at HH22-23 and much enhanced at HH29-30. Although similar levels of NeuroM protein were detected by Western blot in HH29-30 retina and optic tectum, no binding of NeuroM was detected in the optic tectum (Fig. 2A), suggesting that its interaction with the ATH5 promoter is a retina-specific feature. The significant increase in the binding of the NeuroM protein to the ATH5 promoter between HH22-23 and HH29-30 is consistent with the co-expression of NeuroM and ATH5 in newborn RGCs (5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Normalized ChIP efficiency (Fig. 2A, inset) revealed a much increased binding of NeuroM at HH35 despite the down-regulation of ATH5 expression. At this stage NeuroM is expressed in the inner retina but not in the newly formed ganglion cell layer (GCL) (20Roztocil T. Matter-Sadzinski L. Alliod C. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3263-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it interacts with the ATH5 promoter in newborn RGCs on their way to the GCL. This idea is supported by the finding that RGCs may co-express NeuroM and Brn3c (5Matter-Sadzinski L. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 2005; 132: 3907-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the fact that at HH38, when the large majority of RGCs have migrated in the ganglion cell layer, the binding of NeuroM to the ATH5 promoter has decreased (Fig. 2A) despite a robust expression of NeuroM in the inner nuclear layer (20Roztocil T. Matter-Sadzinski L. Alliod C. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3263-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because there are still significant amounts of NeuroM protein bound to the ATH5 promoter at HH38, we cannot exclude the possibility that the protein may also interact with the ATH5 promoter in cells unrelated to the RGC lineage. This notion is consistent with the fact that NeuroM is broadly expressed in newborn post-mitotic retinal neurons (20Roztocil T. Matter-Sadzinski L. Alliod C. Ballivet M. Matter J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3263-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that different bHLH proteins interact with the ATH5 promoter during development. Dynamic changes in the binding of these factors correlate with the different phases of ATH5 expression, indicating that bHLH proteins directly participate in the regulation of the ATH5 gene. We next attempted to find out which of the E-boxes in the ATH5 promoter mediate bHLH activity and whether the different bHLH proteins are using different combinations of E-boxes. Identification of Functional Regulatory Sequences within the ATH5 Promoter—To determine whether any of the E-boxes E1 to E7 played a role in ATH5 regulation, we mutated each of them. The activity of the mutant promoters was tested by transient transfection in chick retinal cells collected at HH29-30, the stage when ATH5 promoter activity is strongest (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Matter J.M. Ong M.T. Hernandez J. Ballivet M. Development. 2001; 128: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar) and during which most of the ganglion cells are produced (21Prada C. Puga J. Perez-Mendez L. Lopez R. Ramirez G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, we found that mutation of any of the distal E-boxes (E5, E6, or E7) had no significant effect on promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of E4 resulted in a complete loss of activity, indicating a crucial role in regulating ATH5. Similarly, mutation of E2 or E3 resulted in severe losses of activity, indicating a strong contribution of these elements (Figs. 3 and 4D), whereas mutation of E1 had no significant effect. Because E4 is necessary for promoter activity, we asked whether E4 alone is sufficient to drive ATH5 expression or whether it requires other E-boxes. We constructed a promoter where all E-boxes were mutated except E4 and assayed its activity in HH29-30 retinal cells. This mutant was clearly incapable of driving transcription (Fig. 3), demonstrating that E4 is necessary but not sufficient for ATH5 expression. We investigated the role of E4 in conjunction with other E-boxes by constructing a series of combined mutations. The presence of the distal E-boxes (E5-E7) in combination with E4 did not significantly boost activity as compared with E4 alone. In contrast, the addition of the proximal E-boxes (E1-E3) to E4 resulted in a strong enhancement of promoter activity. The recovered activity, however, was still lower than that of the wild type, suggesting that the distal E-boxes (E5-7) modestly contribute to promoter activity, their influence being detectable only when all three are mutated. In an attempt to identify other regulatory sequences and/or a minimal promoter, we performed a deletion of the entire promoter region upstream of E4. Removal of these sequences caused a severe loss in activity, suggesting that other elements besides the distal E-boxes reside in that region and are important for the regulation of ATH5. In addition, we found a strong reduction in activity when we mutated the TATA-box or the consensus site for the Sp1 transcription factor, indicating that both of these elements have a role in the transcription process. These results show that the ATH5 gene is under the control of a hierarchy of regulatory elements; a functional E-box at the position of E4 is indispensable for expression, but E4 does not operate without support from at least some of the proximal E-boxes, and optimal expression requires the contribution of other sites in"
https://openalex.org/W2045422162,"Background Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through finely tuned mechanisms regulating intestinal absorption, hepatic biosynthesis and secretion as well as plasma clearance. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted enzyme of the serine protease family that reduces cellular uptake of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by promoting LDL receptor (LDL-R) degradation. Species-specific positive selection has been noted in the LDLR promoter, leading to differential expression of LDLR among primates. Whether PCSK9 experienced significant selective pressure to maintain a functional relationship with its target protein, LDL-R, is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We compiled the sequences of the coding regions of PCSK9 from 14 primate species in the clade of Hominoids, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. To detect selective pressure at the protein level, the ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS) under different evolutionary models were calculated across the phylogeny of PCSK9. Maximum likelihood analyses of dN/dS ratios for the aligned coding region sequences among 14 primate species indicated that PCSK9 was subject to a strong functional constraint (i.e., purifying selection). However, positive selection was noted in the functional carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain in many branches across the phylogeny, especially in the lineage leading to the orangutan. Furthermore, at least five positively selected amino acids were detected in this lineage using the branch-site model A. In a sliding-window analysis, several dN/dS peaks in the C-terminal domain in both the human and the orangutan branches were noted. Conclusions These results suggest that among primates, differential selective pressure has shaped evolutionary patterns in the functional domains of PCSK9, an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2077363675,"The ARF tumour suppressor gene encodes a small highly basic protein whose known functions are largely determined by the amino acids encoded within the first exon. In mammals, the protein incorporates additional residues specified by an alternative reading frame in the second exon of INK4a, but this arrangement does not apply to the chicken homologue. In exploring the intracellular localization of chicken p7ARF, we found that while the FLAG- and HA-tagged versions localize in the nucleolus, in line with mammalian ARF, the GFP-tagged version is excluded from the nucleolus. Here we show that irrespective of the source or composition of the ARF fusion proteins, versions that accumulate in the nucleolus share the ability to bind to nucleophosmin (NPM). Depletion of NPM with siRNA results in the re-location and destabilization of nucleolar forms of ARF but has little effect on the location or stability of a nucleoplasmic form of ARF. Importantly, knockdown of endogenous NPM does not impair the ability of ARF to bind to MDM2 and stabilize p53. These findings support the view that nucleolar localization determines the stability of ARF but not its primary function."
https://openalex.org/W2054155982,"Dynamic simulations are necessary for understanding the mechanism of how biochemical networks generate robust properties to environmental stresses or genetic changes. Sensitivity analysis allows the linking of robustness to network structure. However, it yields only local properties regarding a particular choice of plausible parameter values, because it is hard to know the exact parameter values in vivo. Global and firm results are needed that do not depend on particular parameter values. We propose mathematical analysis for robustness (MAR) that consists of the novel evolutionary search that explores all possible solution vectors of kinetic parameters satisfying the target dynamics and robustness analysis. New criteria, parameter spectrum width and the variability of solution vectors for parameters, are introduced to determine whether the search is exhaustive. In robustness analysis, in addition to single parameter sensitivity analysis, robustness to multiple parameter perturbation is defined. Combining the sensitivity analysis and the robustness analysis to multiple parameter perturbation enables identifying critical reactions. Use of MAR clearly identified the critical reactions responsible for determining the circadian cycle in the Drosophila interlocked circadian clock model. In highly robust models, while the parameter vectors are greatly varied, the critical reactions with a high sensitivity are uniquely determined. Interestingly, not only the per-tim loop but also the dclk-cyc loop strongly affect the period of PER, although the dclk-cyc loop hardly changes its amplitude and it is not potentially influential. In conclusion, MAR is a powerful method to explore wide parameter space without human-biases and to link a robust property to network architectures without knowing the exact parameter values. MAR identifies the reactions critically responsible for determining the period and amplitude in the interlocked feedback model and suggests that the circadian clock intensively evolves or designs the kinetic parameters so that it creates a highly robust cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2053161428,"PNRC2 was identified in our laboratory as a general cofactor for nuclear receptors. To better characterize the physiological function of PNRC2, we used gene-targeting technology to generate PNRC2-null mice (PNRC2-/- mice). These PNRC2-/- mice are viable and fertile. PNRC2-null mice, especially male mice, are lean and are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity but without the induction of insulin resistance. Male mice devoid of PNRC2 protein have a higher metabolic rate than wild-type mice. They consume more oxygen and produce more heat. Consistent with reduced adipose mass, the levels of leptin are lower in PNRC2-/- mice. This study provides evidence that PNRC2 plays one or more important roles in controlling the energy balance between energy storage and energy expenditure.

PNRC2 may be a new target in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic diseases. Energy homeostasis is accomplished by mechanisms that control food intake, energy expenditure, and energy storage. Energy imbalance over time results in obesity. Identification of the regulatory pathways that govern the balance between energy intake, energy storage, and energy expenditure is the key to understanding diseases such as obesity and its related disorders, including insulin resistance, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. The tight matching of energy intake and energy expenditure is governed by the central nervous system, primarily in the hypothalamus (1Coppari R. Ichinose M. Lee C.E. Pullen A.E. Kenny C.D.

Leptin and insulin are primary effectors that activate receptors located on secondary effector neurons in the hypothalamus.

The subsequent manipulation of energy storage is governed by a wide variety of enzymes, transcription factors, cytokines, and receptors. Among them, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and their coactivators and corepressors have been shown to play critical roles in regulating metabolic processes and energy homeostasis by responding to an array of biological active substances, including hormones, vitamins, and drugs (4Chiang J.Y.

Quach K.M. Yang C. Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. Chen S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 986-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and PNRC2 (24Zhou D. Chen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3939-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PNRC and PNRC2 were identified as steroidogenic factor 1-interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human mammary gland cDNA expression library. These proteins were found to interact with the ligand-binding domains of all the nuclear receptors tested, including ERα, PR, GR, TR, RAR, and RXR, in a ligand-dependent manner. They were also found to interact in a ligand-independent manner with orphan receptors such as steroidogenic factor 1 and ERRα. These two coactivators are unique in that they are significantly smaller than most of the coregulatory proteins previously identified and are proline-rich. Unlike most of the coactivators that interact with nuclear receptors through their LXXLL motif, these new coactivators interact with nuclear receptors through a proline-rich Src homology domain-3-binding motif, SD(E)PPSPS (23Zhou D. Quach K.M. Yang C. Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. Chen S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 986-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Zhou D. Chen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3939-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PNRC2 was also isolated from a brain cDNA phage display library by its interaction with the AF1 domain of ERRγ (25Hentschke M. Borgmeyer U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, PNRC2 and PNRC were also repeatedly isolated as multiple nuclear receptor interacting proteins in a large interaction-screening project using an automated version of the yeast two-hybrid system (26Albers M. Kranz H. Kober I. Kaiser C. Klink M. Suckow J. Kern R. Koegl M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 205-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In their screening, PNRC2 was isolated as a prey with the ligand-binding domains of 10 different nuclear receptor baits, including ERα,ERβ, ERRγ, HNF4α, HNF4γ, LRH1, PXR, RARγ, RORα, and RORβ. In the same study, PNRC was isolated as the interacting partner of RARβ, RARγ, RORα, RORβ, HNF4α, HNF4γ,ERβ, ERRγ, and LRH1. Thus, PNRC2 and PNRC appear to be more general cofactors for nuclear receptors than previously thought. In this study, we have generated and characterized PNRC2-deficient mice (PNRC2-/- mice) to better understand the physiological function of PNRC2. PNRC2-null mice, especially male mice, are lean with reduced fat mass and are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity. The results of the present study indicate that the lean phenotype of PNRC2-/- mice is largely a consequence of the increased energy expenditure. This study provides evidence that PNRC2 plays important roles in controlling the energy balance between energy storage and energy expenditure. The PNRC2-/- mouse is an important model for the study of metabolic regulatory roles of this coactivator protein. Animals—Breeding stock strains 129S1 and C57Bl/6J were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). PNRC2-KO mice, as B6 and 129SV/J hybrids, and all other mice were bred at the City of Hope Animal Resources Center under Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved conditions. All mice were housed at the City of Hope Animal Resources Center in ventilated cage racks (Allentown Caging Equipment, Allentown, NJ), had free access to water, were exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle, and received standard rodent chow diet (chow 5001, Purina Mills, Richmond, IN), except for high fat diet experiments wherein mice were fed a 45% (wt/wt) fat diet (TestDiet). All institutional guidelines for animal care and use were followed. Generation of PNRC2-null Mice—The targeting vector for PNRC2 gene knockout, pTg3-PNRC2, was constructed by inserting fragments of the murine PNRC2 gene, amplified by PCR from 129si genomic DNA by PCR, into the targeting vector pKSLoxpNT (27Duyao M.P. Auerbach A.B. Ryan A. Persichetti F. Barnes G.T. McNeil S.M. Ge P. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Science. 1995; 269: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) (hereafter, we have named it pTg3 for simplification). This targeting vector contained the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter/neomycin gene (PGK-Neo), as well as the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (hsv-tk) gene to allow the use of a positive-negative selection scheme. The neo gene in pTg3-PNRC2 was flanked by a 2.24-kb fragment (that served as the 5′-targeting arm), a 5′-flanking region ending at 67 bp upstream of exon I, and a 4.86-kb fragment (served as the 3′-targeting arm), starting from 200 bp downstream of stop codon in exon III of the mouse PNRC2 gene. The 2.24-kb 5′-arm was inserted into a BamH1 site between the tk and neo expression cassettes of pTg3 vector by blunted end ligation, and the 4.86-kb 3′-arm was subcloned into Cla1 and Sal1 sites located 3′ to PGK-Neo. The final targeting construct is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells by this targeting vector should result in the deletion of exon1, intron1, exon II, intron II, and part of exon III that contains the entire coding sequence, as shown in Fig. 1A. The Sal1-linearized targeting vector pTg3-PNRC2 (100 μg) was electroporated into embryo stem (ES) cells derived from the 129S1 mouse strain. The transfected ES cells were selected in the medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks and then further selected in the medium containing both G418 and 2 μm ganciclovir. A total of 168 surviving colonies was screened for homologous recombination event by Southern blotting on the HindIII-digested genomic DNAs isolated from the selected positive clones. Two out of four correctly targeted clones, ES14 and ES95, were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting chimeric males were then bred to C57BL/6 females to obtain germ line transmission of the mutation and to produce F1 heterozygous (PNRC2+/-) mice, which were then interbred to generate mice homozygous for the mutation, i.e. PNRC2-null (PNRC2-/-) mice. Genotyping of ES Cells, Mice, and Embryos by Southern Blot and PCR Analysis—The genomic DNA was isolated from ES cells, tail or embryo samples, after proteinase K digestion, by means of isopropanol precipitation (28Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues or cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 100 μg proteinase K/ml) and incubated at 37 °C (cells) or 55 °C (tissues) with agitation for several hours. One volume of isopropanol was added to the lysate, and the samples were mixed or swirled until precipitation was completed. Precipitated DNA was recovered and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Extracted DNA was used as the template for PCR-based genotyping. Primers for amplification of the WT and targeted alleles were designed based on sequences external to the deleted region (within 5′-arm) (which exist in both WT allele and mutant allele) and within the deleted exon I or within the selection cassette (neo gene), respectively (see Fig. 1C). The primer pair, A (5′-GCAGGATTTCAAACCATGACAACA3′), from the end of 5′arm in the 5′-flanking region, and B (5′-GCTGAGAAGCCTCCGACTTTGTAA-3′), from exon I, was used to detect the wild-type allele (Fig. 1C), and primer pair, A (same as above) and C (5′-GGTGGATGTGGAATGTGTGCGAGG-3′), from the neomycin cassette, was used to detect the targeted allele (Fig. 1C). DNA in PCR-genotyping reactions was amplified in 40 cycles with melting, annealing, and extension temperatures of 94 °C, 59 °C, and 72 °C, respectively. The size of the PCR product for wild-type allele should be 512 bp, whereas the PCR product for targeted allele should be 392 bp in length. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA (5-10 μg) isolated from ES cells, mice tissues, or embryos, was digested overnight at 37 °C with restriction enzymes HindIII for 5′ probe and Xba1 for 3′ probe, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel (1× TBE (89 mm Trisborate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3), 25 V overnight), and transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting with 0.4 n NaOH overnight. The membrane was baked for 1 h at 80 °C in a vacuum oven and then hybridized with 5′ probe (900 bp) or 3′ probe (420 bp), which is within 5′-homologous arm, or is outside of 3′-homologous arm region, respectively. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP through random priming using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled probes were purified using probe-Quant G-50 Micro Column (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were carried out according to the protocols described in the “Gene Images random primer labeling module” from Amersham Biosciences. Briefly, the dried membrane was placed in a glass hybridization vial, pre-wet with 5× SSC and prehybridized at 60 °C for 1 h in the prehybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 1:20 diluted liquid block (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (denatured)). At the end of prehybridization, the denatured probe was added to the same prehybridization buffer at 2.5 × 106 cpm/ml and continued to incubate at 60 °C overnight. The membrane was washed once first with 1× SSC/0.1% SDS and then with 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C, each for 15 min. If necessary, the membrane was washed in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C for additional 5-10 min. Northern Blot Analysis—To confirm the absence of PNRC2 expression in homozygous mice, Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (32Zhou D. Masri S. Ye J.J. Chen S. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 361: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) on the total RNA isolated from WT, PNRC2+/- and PNRC2-/- mice tissues, using the ExpressHyb solution (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). A 900-bp 3′ end-fragment of mouse PNRC2 cDNA was generated by PCR, using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-GTACAGGTATAAAGTTAGTAGGTG-3′ and 5′-TGAGAAGTAATTGTTACTGGGTTT-3′. The PCR product was radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) using the Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used as the probe in hybridization. For RNA loading control, the stripped membrane was re-hybridized with a 32P-labeled 840-bp mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe, generated by reverse transcription-PCR, using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-ACAGCCGCATCTTCTTGTGCAGTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGATGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3′. Gene Expression Analyses by Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA (10 μg) was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega), and first-strand cDNA in a final volume of 100 μl was generated with the random hexamer (Invitrogen) using Super-Script II RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Specific primers for each gene were designed by using Primer 3 software. The sequences of primer sets used in Realtime PCR are as follows: 5′-AGTGGAGACCGCCCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCAGGTTGTCTTGGATGT-3′ for mPPARγ; 5′-TGGAAGCTTGTCTCCAGTGA-3′ and 5′-AATCCCCATTTACGATGATG-3′ for maP2; 5′-TGGACAAGAACAGCAACGAG-3 and 5′-TCACTGGTCAACTCCAGCAC-3 for mC/EBPα;5′-TCCTAGGGACCATCACCACC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGCAGACCGCTGTACA-3′ for mUCP1; and 5′-GGCAGCAAGGAAGAGGACAAGTAGT-3′ and 5′-TGGGAAGAATTCTGATCCTTGCTCT-3′ for mPNRC2. The real-time PCR reaction contained in a final volume of 25 μl, 1 μl of RT reaction product, 0.1 μg of forward and reverse primers, and 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green Supermix (170-8880, Bio-Rad). PCR reactions were carried out in Semi-Skirted 96-well PCR plates (Gene Mate) by using an iQ™5 Multicolor Real Time PCR detection System (Bio-Rad). All reactions were done in triplicate. The real-time amount of all mRNA was calculated by using the comparative cycle time method (User Bulletin No. 2, PE Biosystems). β-Actin mRNA in all samples was determined by real-time PCR and used as the invariant control for all studies. Quantitative NMR—To determine the body composition of mice, quantitative NMR analysis was performed on PNRC2-null mice and their WT littermates. This was done in the Small Animal Imaging Center at the Children's Hospital of University of Southern California, according to the procedures described previously (29Moats R.A. Velan-Mullan S. Jacobs R. Gonzalez-Gomez I. Dubowitz D.J. Taga T. Khankaldyyan V. Schultz L. Fraser S. Nelson M.D. Laug W.E. Mol. Imaging. 2003; 2: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg/10 mg/kg) and placed in a tubular imaging restraint device designed to hold the mice's torso in a comfortable position. Either hot air or a warm water jacket was used to maintain the animal's body temperature. Ophthalmic ointment was placed on the surface of the eyes to prevent corneal drying. The animal's heart and respiratory rate were monitored throughout the imaging period through use of noninvasive monitoring equipment. All images were obtained using a 500-MHz AMX MR (11.7 T) system (Bruker Instruments, Inc., Billerica, MA) equipped with microimaging gradients (1 T/m maximum gradient strength, 2 kT/m/s maximum slew rate). Metamorph software, Version 6.0 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA), was used for image processing and analysis. Determination of Body Weight, Body Length, Food Intake, Body Mass Index, and Fecal Lipid Content—When the mice were 8 weeks of age, the age-matched mice were divided into two groups under each diet condition (chow or high fat diet), PNRC2-null and WT littermates, at 12 mice/per group and 4 mice/per cage. Body weight was recorded once a week at the same time of day. For the food intake experiment, each mouse was housed in a separated metabolic cage. Food intake was determined by weighing the food given and the food remaining in the grid of the cages during a period of 4 days. The amount of food consumed per mouse per day was calculated by dividing the food consumed by the number of days in the feeding interval. To measure lipid absorption, feces of mice at 12 months of age were collected from PNRC2-null mice and WT mice, and the fecal lipid content in these feces was measured and compared. The fecal lipid content was measured gravimetrically following a Folch extraction, as described (30Folch J. Ascoli I. Lees M. Meath J.A. Le B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 833-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At 12 months of age mice were sacrificed under CO2 euthanasia. Immediately, total body length (from the tip of the nose to the anus) was measured. Measurement of Energy Expenditure by Indirect Calorimetry—Metabolic rates were measured by indirect calorimetry in 12-month-old PNRC2-null and WT mice by using an 8-chamber open-circuit Oxymax system (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) at Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center in the University of Cincinnati. Briefly, mice were individually housed in acrylic calorimeter chambers through which air of known O2 concentration was passed at a constant flow rate. The system automatically withdrew gas samples from each chamber hourly for 24 h. The system then calculated the volume of O2 consumed (vO2) and CO2 generated (vCO2) by each mouse in 1 h. The RQ, ratio of the vCO2 to vO2, was calculated. Energy expenditure measurements were carried out in both light and dark cycles at both fed and fasting conditions. Mice were maintained at 25 °C and had free access to water in all conditions. Rectal Body Temperature Measurement before and after Fasting—To measure the adaptive thermogenesis in PNRC2-null and WT mice, 6-week-old WT and PNRC2-/- mice were placed in individual cages with normal chow diet. Initial body temperature was recorded by inserting a small thermoprobe into the rectum of the mouse. Mice were then fasted (without food but with free access to water) overnight, and rectal body temperature was recorded again after fasting for 24 h. The body weights of the mice were also recorded before and after overnight fasting. Morphological Analysis of WAT, BAT, and Liver from WT and PNRC2-null Mice Fed Chow Diet or a High Fat Diet—To determine how the PNRC2-null mice respond to the effects of being fed a high fat diet, morphology of inguinal WAT, BAT, and liver from WT and PNRC2-null mice fed chow diet or a high fat diet was examined. At the end of the experiment for body weight evaluation, food intake, and fecal lipid content measurement, several of the mice (WT and PNRC2-null mice) were sacrificed. WAT, BAT, and liver tissues were collected from these mice, fixed in neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm onto poly-l-lysine-coat slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Paraffin section preparation and staining were carried out by the Anatomic Pathology Laboratory at City of Hope. Frozen sections (10 μm) of formalin-fixed liver were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and stained with Oil red O (0.15% in 60% isopropanol) for 5 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in glycerol gelatin (Sigma) to examine lipid accumulation. Plasma Analyses, Glucose, and Insulin Tolerance Tests—To further investigate the biological basis of lean phenotype of PNRC2-null mice, a series of physiological tests were performed on the PNRC2-null mice and WT control mice. Different quantitative assays were performed, including total cholesterol (Roche Diagnostics, Alameda, CA), plasma triglycerides (Thermo Trace), free fatty acids (Roche Applied Science), insulin (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL), leptin (Crystal-Chem), and total thyroid-stimulating hormone (DPC Co., Los Angeles, CA). For glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted overnight before receiving an intraperitoneal injection of 20% d-glucose (1 g/kg body weight, Sigma-Aldrich). At 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after injection, 5-10 μl of blood was drawn from the tail, and blood glucose levels were assayed using an Elite XL Glucometer (Bayer HealthCare LLC, Tarrytown, NY). For insulin tolerance test, WT and PNRC2-null mice were fasted for 5 h and given 1.7 units/kg insulin (Humulin R, Lilly, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) by intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose was monitored for 4 h at 15-min intervals after the insulin challenge. Measurement of Free Glycerol in WAT—Epididymal fat tissue was diced from male PNRC2-/- and WT littermates and incubated in the KRH buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) plus 2.5% bovine serum albumin at 37° C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h with gentle shaking. Released glycerol was assayed using an enzymatic glycerol assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Generation of PNRC2-null Mice—One allele of the PNRC2 gene was disrupted in 129s1 ES cells, using the targeting vector pTG3-PNRC2 shown in Fig. 1A. The mouse PNRC2 gene is organized in three exons, with the entire coding region in exon 3. The neomycin resistance gene (neo) in this vector was designed to replace the almost complete PNRC2 gene, beginning from 67-bp upstream exon 1 and extending into exon 3, right after the stop codon. Details of the construction of the pTG3-PNRC2 vector are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pTG3-PNRC2 targeting vector was introduced into 129 S1 ES cells by electroporation and, following selection in G418 and ganciclovir, cell clones were screened by Southern blotting analysis of their DNA. DNA was isolated from 168 G418/ganciclovir-resistant ES clones, and homologous recombinants were identified by Southern analysis of HindIII-digested DNA, using a probe derived from 5′-flanking region of the PNRC2 gene (and present in the 5′-arm of the targeting vector). The probe hybridized to a HindIII fragment of 3380 bp from the WT PNRC2 allele, whereas the mutant allele, created by homologous recombination between pTG3-PNRC2 targeting vector and the endogenous PNRC2 gene, yielded a 2487-bp fragment (Fig. 1B). Of 168 G418/ganciclovir-resistant ES clones screened, four were found to be heterozygous for the PNRC2 mutation. The structure of the mutant allele in these putative heterozygous clones was further confirmed using a 3′ probe that hybridized to an Xba1 fragment of 7133 bp from the wild-t"
https://openalex.org/W2109540280,"Selection coefficients at the mammalian Y chromosome typically do not deviate strongly from neutrality. Here we show that strong balancing selection, maintaining intermediate frequencies of DNA sequence variants, acts on the Y chromosome in two populations of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Significant correlations exist between sequence variant frequencies and annual rainfall in the years before conception, with five- to eightfold frequency changes over short time periods. Annual rainfall variation drives the balancing of sequence variant frequencies, probably by affecting parental condition. We conclude that sequence variants confer improved male reproductive success after either dry or wet years, making the population composition and dynamics very sensitive to climate change. The mammalian Y chromosome, interacting with ecological processes, may affect male reproductive success much more strongly than previously thought."

Post-entry, HIV infection leads to a rapid and potent down-modulation of CD4 molecules expressed at the cell surface.

Without strict CD4 down-modulation, CD4 induces trapping and aggregation of nascent progeny virions at the cell surface by the high affinity of gp120 for CD4 (30Palese P. Tobita K. Ueda M. Compans R.W. Virology. 1974; 61: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and a dramatic reduction in the infectivity of released virions by recruitment and sequestration of gp120 molecules away from budding sites or recruitment of nonfunctional gp120-CD4 complexes at the virion surface (31Lama J.

Allespach I. Venzke S. Fackler O.T. Keppler O.T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 714-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Partial down-regulation of CCR5 and strict down-regulation of CD4 prevent the superinfection of cells in which viral replication is already progressing. CCR5 binding domains, V3 loop, and the bridging sheet domain of gp120 are not exposed until conformational changes in gp120 are induced by interaction with CD4 on the cell surface; therefore, CCR5 would not trap nascent progeny virions at the cell surface. This may be one reason why CCR5 does not need to be strictly down-regulated after viral entry. However, a presence of an unknown inhibitory effect of CCR5 on R5 HIV-1 replication is possible. This paper addresses whether the level of CCR5 in CD4+ T-cell lines influences R5 HIV-1 replication, including late stages of the viral lifecycle. To evaluate the effect of V3 loop on viral replication with respect to CCR5 expression, 45 replication-competent mutant viruses carrying multiple amino acid substitutions in the gp120 V3 loop were used which were derived from an R5 HIV-1 V3 loop library using HIV-1JR-FLan as background (34Yusa K. Maeda Y. Fujioka A. Monde K. Harada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30083-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The library contained a set of random combinations of 0–10 polymorphic amino acid substitutions observed in 31 R5 clinical isolates. Replication of the viruses in a CD4+ T-cell line PM1 expressing low levels of CCR5 and PM1/CCR5 cells expressing high levels of CCR5 was examined. It was found that the viruses revealed different replication phenotypes with respect to CCR5 expression. The present study focused on a viral clone, HIV-1V3L#08, with a replication in PM1 cells comparable with wild type HIV-1JR-FLan but with dramatically suppressed replication in PM1/CCR5 cells. This is the first report that suppression of replication by high expression of CCR5 is V3 loop-dependent and associated with late stages of viral replication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Viruses—The human CD4+ T-cell line PM1 (35Lusso P.

Koyanagi, Kyoto University), incorporating AflII and NheI sites into Env at 6395 and 6562 nucleotides, respectively. R5 viruses, carrying a set of random amino acid substitutions in the gp120 V3 loop, were derived from the HIV-1 V3 loop library (34Yusa K. Maeda Y. Fujioka A. Monde K. Harada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30083-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For construction of V3 loop mutant viruses, amino acid substitutions were introduced into the gp120 V3 loop of pJR-FLan, as described previously (34Yusa K. Maeda Y. Fujioka A. Monde K. Harada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30083-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For virus preparation, 293T cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of molecular clone DNA using the calcium phosphate Pro-Fection Mammalian Transfection System (Promega). The supernatant was collected at 28 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter unit (Millipore) and stored at –80 °C until use.HIV-1 single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses were produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with pNL-LucR–E– (38Mariani R. Rutter G. Harris M.E. Hope T.J. Krausslich H.G. Landau N.R. J.

Culture supernatant containing pseudoviruses at a final concentration of 8 ng/ml p24 was added to 1 × 104 cells/well PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells in a 48-well plate. After 2 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and firefly luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-infection according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega).Viral Replication Assay—For determination of replication phenotype, 4 × 104 of PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells were infected with 8 ng of p24 Gag for 2 h. After washing twice with PBS, the infected cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. On day 6 post-infection, p24 Gag in the supernatant was measured using a p24 Gag ELISA (Zeptometrix).Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of CD4 and CCR5 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated in the staining solution (3% fetal calf serum plus 0.05% sodium azide in PBS) with the mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) anti-human CD4 (SK3, BD Biosciences Pharmingen) or anti-human CCR5 (2D7, BD Biosciences Pharmingen) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was used for antibody-staining. Flow cytometry was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with BD Cell Quest Version 3.1 software (BD Biosciences Pharmingen).Quantitative PCR—Virus (8 ng p24 Gag) was pretreated in culture fluids with 690 units of DNase I (Worthington Biochem) and added to PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells (4 × 104) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. Total DNA was purified using the QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen) and eluted in a total volume of 200 μl. Two μl of DNA was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Late reverse transcription products were detected using primers amplifying the region between nucleotides 685 and 789 of the provirus: forward primer (5′-ACATCAAGCAGCCATGCAAAT-3′), reverse primer (5′-ATCTGGCCTGGTGCAATAGG-3′), and probe (5′-FAM-CATCAATGAGGAAGCTGCAGAATGGGATAGA-TAMRA-3′). Reactions were performed in triplicate in TaqMan Universal PCR master mix using 0.9 pmol of each primer/μl and 0.25 pmol of probe/μl. After 10 min at 95 °C, reactions were cycled for 15 s at 95 °C followed by 1 min at 60 °C for 40 repeats on an ABI Prism model 7700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems).Virus Infectivity Assay—For infectivity assay, 5 × 103 of MAGIC5 cells (37Hachiya A. Aizawa-Matsuoka S. Tanaka M. Takahashi Y. Ida S. Gatanaga H. Hirabayashi Y. Kojima A. Tatsumi M. Oka S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were plated 1 day before infection into 48-well tissue culture plates. After absorption of virus for 2 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS and further incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At 48 h post-infection, the cells were stained, and the number of blue foci in each well was counted (39Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Four days post-infection, viruses in the supernatant of HIV-1-infected cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 175,000 × g for 60 min. Viral proteins (10 ng of p24 Gag) were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and blocked with 5% milk in PBST (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 8 h at room temperature. Immunodetection was performed with anti-gp120 antibody (Aalto Bio Reagents) and anti-gp41 antibody (2F5; National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Preference Regent Program) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and Chemi-Lumi One (Nacalai Tesque).Virus Precipitation Assay—Virus immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (40Esser M.T. Graham D.R. Coren L.V. Trubey C.M. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Ott D.E. Lifson J.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6173-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Anti-HLA-DR (L243), anti-CCR5 (3A9), and anti-CXCR4 (12G5) mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Anti-CCR5 (T21/8) mAb was purchased from BioLegend. A rat immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb against hepatitis C virus, Mo-8 (41Inudoh M. Kato N. Tanaka Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 42: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), was used as a rat isotype-matched negative control. Virus (5 ng of p24 Gag) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin was mixed with the mAb at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Then, 10 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem), a suspension of heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus cells pretreated for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin, was added to the virus/mAb mixture. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, captured viruses were removed by centrifugation (350 × g for 30 min). p24 Gag in the supernatant was determined by p24 Gag ELISA.RESULTSReplication Suppression of Viruses from the R5 HIV-1 V3 Loop Library in PM1/CCR5 Cells—An R5 HIV-1 V3 loop library was constructed carrying a set of random combinations of 0–10 amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop (34Yusa K. Maeda Y. Fujioka A. Monde K. Harada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30083-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Replication of 45 viruses randomly selected from the library was compared in PM1 and PM1/CCR5 cells (Table 1). PM1/CCR5 cells, generated by standard retrovirus transduction of PM1 cells with a CCR5 expression lentivector, regularly expressed high level of CCR5 and with similar levels of CD4 compared with PM1 cells (Fig. 2). A total of 36% of the viruses (16/45) failed to replicate in both cell types (<1.0 ng/ml p24 Gag on day 6). Among replication competent viruses, ratios of p24 Gag ranged from ≤0.1 to 27, whereas the parental virus, HIV-1JR-FLan, could replicate in both PM1 and PM1/CCR5 cells (ratio 1.9). Viruses were classified into the following three groups; 1) those that grew ≥10-fold more in PM1/CCR5 than PM1 cells (ratio ≥ 10), designated R5H phenotype, 2) those that revealed comparative replication kinetics in PM1 and PM1/CCR5 cells (0.1 < ratio < 10), designated R5HL, and 3) viruses where replication was drastically suppressed in PM1/CCR5 cells (ratio ≤ 0.1), designated R5L. Six of 45 viruses (13%), including HIV-1V3L#10, HIV-1V3L#16, HIV-1V3L#21, HIV-1V3L#23, HIV-1V3L#29, and HIV-1V3L#34, were classified as R5H phenotype, whereas 3 of the 45 (6.7%) viral clones, HIV-1V3L#08, HIV-1V3L#23, and HIV-1V3L#25, were R5L phenotype. These results indicated that the R5 HIV-1 V3 loop library contained unique replication phenotypes with respect to expression levels of CCR5 in the CD4+ T-cell line. Note that these viruses carried amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop alone, indicating that the variety of replication phenotypes was dependent on their V3 loop structure.TABLE 1Replication of viruses from the HIV-1 V3 loop library in PM1 and PM1/CCR5 cellsa PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells (4 × 104) were infected with each virus (8 ng of p24 Gag). On day 6 the extent of viral replication was measured by p24 Gag ELISA. Results represent the average of three independent experiments.b Ratio, the concentration of p24 Gag in the supernatant of PM1/CCR5 cells was divided by that of PM1 cells.

Replication of HIV-1V3L#08 was markedly suppressed in PM1/CCR5 cells, whereas the virus showed similar replication kinetics to HIV-1JR-FLan with 8 ng of p24 Gag in PM1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). On day 6 post-infection, p24 Gag in the supernatant was 33-fold lower in PM1/CCR5 than PM1 cells. However, no replication suppression of HIV-1V3L#08 was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or macrophages derived from three different donors compared with HIV-1JR-FLan (data not shown). HIV-1V3L#08 contained 8 amino acid substitutions: Ile307 to Val, His308 to Thr, Ile309 to Met, Phe315 to Leu, Thr317 to Ala, Glu320 to Asp, Ile321 to Val, and Asp324 to Asn in gp120 V3 loop alone (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Suppression of HIV-1V3L#08 replication in PM1/CCR5 cells. Replication kinetics of HIV-1JR-FLan, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T, HIV-1V3L#08, and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T in PM1 cells (A) and in PM1/CCR5 cells (B). Cells (4 × 104) were infected with 8 ng of p24 Gag. Viral replication was monitored by measuring p24 Gag production. C, amino acid substitutions in the gp120 V3 loop and C1 of HIV-1JR-FLan, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T, HIV-1V3L#08, and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T. The analysis was repeated three times; error bars represent S.D. of three replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A revertant of HIV-1V3L#08, designated HIV-1V3L#08-A69T, was isolated that restored replication ability in PM1/CCR5 cells with an additional substitution Ala69 to Thr in the C1 region of gp120 (Fig. 3C). HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T showed similar replication kinetics to HIV-1JR-FLan in PM1 cells (Fig. 3A). However, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T showed a slightly higher replication profile in PM1/CCR5 cells on days 4 and 5 compared with HIV-1JR-FLan (Fig. 3B).It is possible that suppression of HIV-1V3L#08 replication in PM1/CCR5 cells was due to high susceptibility of the virus to the chemokine(s) produced by the cells. To exclude this possibility, susceptibility of HIV-1V3L#08, HIV-1V3L#08-A69T, HIV-1JR-FLan, and HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T to a β-chemokine, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), was measured, but no differences were detected (data not shown).Entry Efficiency of HIV-1V3L#08 into PM1/CCR5 Cells—To investigate whether the entry efficiency of HIV-1V3L#08 decreased, real-time PCR was utilized to analyze cellular accumulation of the late reverse transcriptase product, gag, synthesized shortly after virus entry into the cells (Fig. 4A). There was no decrease in gag DNA synthesis of HIV-1V3L#08 in PM1/ CCR5 compared with PM1 cells. Rather, the DNA copies of HIV-1V3L#08 were 3.3-fold higher in PM1/CCR5 than in PM1 cells. Higher expression of CCR5 could promote more efficient viral entry when CD4 is not significantly expressed, consistent with previous reports for other viruses (1.9–2.5-fold) (6Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Walter B.L. Wehrly K. Swanstrom R. Platt E. Kabat D. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4828-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, there was no clear difference in DNA synthesis among the four viruses in PM1/CCR5 cells.FIGURE 4Entry of HIV-1JR-FLan, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T, HIV-1V3L#08, and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T into PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells. A, PM1 and PM1/CCR5 cells were infected with 30 ng of p24 HIV-1 for 2 h. Eight hours after infection, synthesized proviral HIV-1 DNA was determined by TaqMan real-time PCR. B, PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells were infected for 2 h with viruses pseudotyped with the envelope of HIV-1JR-FLan, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T, HIV-1V3L#08, or HIV-1V3L#08-A69T (8 ng of p24 Gag). At 48 h post-infection, luciferase activity in cell lysate was determined. The analysis was repeated three times; error bars represent the S.D. of three replicates. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001. Statistical significant differences were calculated by t test versus HIV-1JR-FLan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, the virus pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of HIV-1V3L#08 revealed 2.0-fold more efficiency in PM1/CCR5 than in PM1 cells (Fig. 4B). Luciferase activity of other viruses in PM1/CCR5 cells also increased 1.7–2.2-fold compared with PM1 cells. Measured luciferase activity in cells infected with pseudotyped viruses serves as an indirect estimation of viral entry, integration, and transcriptional activity. The results demonstrate that suppression of HIV-1V3L#08 replication in PM1/CCR5 cells is not associated with early stages of the viral lifecycle.Production of Virus from PM1/CCR5 Cells Infected with HIV-1V3L#08—A comparison was made of the number of virions generated from PM1/CCR5 and PM1 cells in the presence of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (AZT) and a CCR5 inhibitor (TAK-779) to block secondary infection by nascent progeny virus. The concentrations of AZT and TAK-779 used were 4 and 1 μm, respectively, 78- and 32-fold higher than the respective IC50 levels (the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the blue foci formation in MAGIC5 cells) (data not shown). Note that on day 2 post-infection, the number of viruses generated from HIV-1V3L#08-infected PM1/CCR5 cells was 5.7-fold higher than PM1-infected cells (Fig. 5). HIV-1JR-FLan, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T, HIV-1V3L#08, and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T showed similar results. Production of these viruses generated from PM1/CCR5 cells was 3.8–8.7-fold higher than from PM1 cells, demonstrating that V3 loop structure of HIV-1V3L#08 did not affect viral assembly and budding. Increased virus production from PM1/CCR5 cells was consistent with the higher entry efficiency, as shown in Fig. 4, although the increased levels were not equal. This excluded the possibility that replication suppression of HIV-1V3L#08 in PM1/CCR5 cells was due to decreased virus production.FIGURE 5Production of HIV-1JR-FLan, HIV-1JR-FLan-A69T, HIV-1V3L#08, and HIV-1V3L#08-A69T from PM1 or PM1/CCR5 cells in the presence of AZT and TAK-779. The cells were infected with each virus (8 ng of p24 Gag) for 2 h, then 1 μm AZT and 4 μm TAK779 were added. On day 2, the level of p24 Gag in the supernatant was determined by p24 Gag ELISA. The analysis was repeated three times; error bars represent the S.D. of three replicates. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001.

Because many of these map outside the conserved core, this approach should be broadly useful in identifying new, more kinase-specific therapeutic targets. Genes encoding protein kinases constitute one of the largest gene families and encompass ∼2% of both yeast and human genomes (1Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar). The protein kinase superfamily is classified by its catalytic activity; that is, transferring the γ-phosphate from ATP to a substrate. Kinases phosphorylate proteins and other metabolites to regulate their activity. Indeed, post-translational phosphorylation is a chief mechanism for intracellular cell signaling. Phosphate is such a ubiquitous tag for intracellular signaling that roughly one-third of all cellular proteins are phosphorylated at any moment (2Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Kinase activity is essential for signal transduction, and misregulation or altered kinase activity is associated with a myriad of diseases, including many cancers, Alzheimer disease, arthritis, Parkinson disease, and diabetes (3Bode A.M. Dong Z. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 237-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Morris H.R. Ann.

Kinases have evolved to differ in size, specificity, and mechanism of regulation of activity. However, the kinase superfamily shares a highly conserved core containing several invariant amino acids that are critical for activity in vitro (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). Although this kinase core is conserved among all metazoans, it is frequently flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal extensions that contribute at multiple levels to substrate specificity (7Shaltiel S. Cox S. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among the kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) 4The abbreviations used are:PKAprotein kinase AFOA5-fluoroorotic acid. has been intensively studied structurally and enzymatically and serves as a prototype for the superfamily (8Knighton D.R.

PKA is a global eukaryotic regulator of cellular processes, including control of division, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis. PKA also links external and internal cellular environments; external hormonal stimuli that change intracellular cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate levels (cAMP) modulate kinase activity. protein kinase A 5-fluoroorotic acid. The activity of PKA is regulated through interactions with its regulatory subunit, Bcy1. Two monomeric units of PKA interact with a Bcy1 dimer during an inhibited state. When intracellular cAMP levels are increased, each regulatory subunit binds two molecules of cAMP, causing a conformational change whereby the catalytic subunits of PKA are released and subsequently activated (11Johnson K.E. Cameron S. Toda T. Wigler M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8636-8642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rubenstein E.M. Schmidt M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Structurally, members of the PKA family share the highly conserved kinase core that consists of small and large lobes separated by a nucleotide binding pocket (Fig. 1A). The small lobe contains the C-helix that makes direct contacts with the nucleotide and is part of the nucleotide binding pocket. Also in this lobe is the glycine-rich loop that binds to ATP and positions the γ-phosphate of ATP for phosphoryl transfer (13Madhusudan Akamine P. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A linker region between residues 120-127 tethers the small and large lobes and acts to dictate motion between the two lobes. The large lobe contains many residues in proximity to the nucleotide binding pocket that are highly conserved and are directly involved in catalysis, including the catalytic loop, the magnesium positioning loop, and the activation loop (14Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae PKA enzymes are encoded by three genes: TPK1,TPK2, and TPK3 (15Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 16Cameron S. Levin L. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1988; 53: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). No individual TPK gene is essential in yeast, but at least one gene must be intact for viability (15Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), demonstrating that essential substrates may be acted upon by all three isozymes. However, when two of the three TPK genes are mutated, distinct phenotypes have been observed, establishing that unique substrates for each gene product may contribute to distinct signaling responses (17Denis C.L. Kemp B.E. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17932-17935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2005; 438: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Of the three genes, loss of TPK2 results in some of the strongest phenotypes, including effects on pseudohyphal growth, respiratory growth, transcriptional regulation, and utilization of alternative carbon sources (18Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3981-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19Robertson L.S. Causton H.C. Young R.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each Tpk protein has a highly conserved kinase core that is nearly identical among the three. Some specific kinase functions, such as pseudohyphal development, map to the core domain (23Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4874-4887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, each protein also contains N-terminal and C-terminal extensions flanking the core. Although the C-terminal extensions are highly conserved among the PKA superfamily (24Taylor S.S. Kim C. Vigil D. Haste N.M. Yang J. Wu J. Anand G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the N-terminal regions differ greatly in length and sequence among yeast isoforms as well as among other members of the kinase superfamily (15Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). TPK2 encodes the shortest N-terminal sequence flanking the kinase core (66 residues versus 83 and 84 for TPK1 and TPK3, respectively) yet has the most distinct sequence in this region; that is, two stretches of polyglutamine residues that compose ∼30% of this region. Because the three kinases share substantial identity throughout the kinase core and C-terminal extensions, it is likely that their N-terminal regions may be important contributors for cell signaling. Furthering this notion, distinct morphogenetic roles were demonstrated with chimeras created by exchanging N-terminal extensions of Candida albicans Tpk proteins (25Bockmuhl D.P. Krishnamurthy S. Gerads M. Sonneborn A. Ernst J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The chimeric proteins displayed specific characteristics of the isoforms from which the N-terminal region was derived rather than from the catalytic core and C terminus. These results supported the possibility that specific activity of each isoform of PKA may be at least partially defined by its N-terminal region. The C-terminal tails are conserved between the three yeast PKA isoforms and among AGC (protein kinase A, protein kinase G, protein kinase C) kinase family members but diverge across the kinase superfamily (26Smith C.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Akamine P. Taylor S.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 313-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Within the PKA family, the C-terminal region is a critical regulator of catalytic activity by acting as a molecular gate to limit access to the nucleotide binding pocket (2Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This illustrates that kinases have evolved to gain unique activity derived from non-conserved features that promote diversity and substrate specificity. To evaluate the functional significance of both conserved and non-conserved elements on kinase regulation, a structurally non-biased approach was employed using S. cerevisiae Tpk2p as a model. Directed point mutations were first introduced within the conserved nucleotide binding site of Tpk2p. These were screened in vivo for their ability to support viability in a tpk1Δ tpk2Δ tpk3Δ triple mutant strain. Indeed, subsequent analysis revealed that one mutant even had a dominant negative phenotype, demonstrating that although it could provide essential kinase activity, it additionally affected the activity of wild-type PKA isoforms. One double mutant that failed to support growth or maintain kinase activity was chosen for further analysis. The tpk2 sequences from the double mutant were mutagenized randomly and used to isolate intragenic suppressors with restored kinase function. These were defined by supporting viability in the tpk triple null mutant. Although the suppressors restored viability, many were distinct from wild type because they had clear phenotypes in assays designed to survey cellular functions. Few mutations mapped to sequences encoding the key catalytic residues surrounding the nucleotide binding pocket, yet many mapped to the 3′ region of the gene encoding the large lobe of the kinase domain as well as the unique N-terminal region flanking the kinase core. These results demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal extensions that are unique to Tpk2p can significantly affect kinase activity. Furthermore, both non-conserved regions flanking the core modulate activity in vivo, thereby extending a network of catalytic regulation throughout the kinase. Because of the deep functional conservation of many kinases including PKA (28Zoller M.J. Yonemoto W. Taylor S.S. Johnson K.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the experimental approach reported here may provide a basis in defining unique, kinase-specific targets inhibition. Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strain used in this study was derived from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (29Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). The strain, LPY 6292, has the following genotype: MATα his3-1 leu2-0 lys2-0 met15-0 ura3-0 tpk1Δ::KANMX tpk2Δ::KANMX tpk3Δ::KANMX. To survive, it carries a CEN, URA3-marked plasmid bearing wild-type TPK1 (pLP2024). Where indicated, wild-type and TPK2 mutants were co-expressed in a CEN,LEU2-marked vector (30Sikorski R.S. Michaud W.A. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Growth was at 30 °C unless otherwise specified, and standard techniques for yeast manipulation were performed (31Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Springs Harbor, NY2005Google Scholar). Generation of Tpk2p Pocket Mutations and Screening for Restoration of PKA Function—Point mutations were introduced into sequences encoding the nucleotide binding pocket of Tpk2p using the following forward primers the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (the corresponding PKA-Cα residue number is listed in parentheses): L76A (49Budovskaya Y.V.

Fermeglia M. Ferrone M. Tamborini E. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), 5′-TCTTTTGGTAGAGCTCATTTGGTGCGC-3′; I131A (104), 5′-CATCCGTTTCTCGCGAGAATGTGGGGT-3′; M147A (120), 5′-ATCTTTATGGTGGCCGACTATATCGAA-3′; Y149A (122), 5′-ATGGTGATGGATGCGATCGAAGGTGGT-3′; L200A (173), 5′-CCAGAAAATATCGCTCTAGATAGAAATGGC-3′; T210V (183), 5′-CACATTAAAATAGTCGACTTTGGGTTCGCC-3′. The double mutants were made sequentially. To isolate intragenic suppressors of the TPK2-V84A,T210V mutant, randomly mutagenized libraries were generated starting with the TPK2-V84A,T210V allele. Two independent approaches were taken. Libraries were made using either the GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or low fidelity amplification methods to introduce additional mutations throughout the entire coding region. Target template concentrations were varied to alter the mutation frequency to range from 0 to 16 mutations per 1000 base pairs as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified coding sequences were ligated into pRS315 plasmids bearing 2000-bp upstream and 1000-bp downstream flanking sequence of TPK2 and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Colonies were pooled to represent ∼250 colonies/culture and grown for ∼4 rounds of cell division before DNA preparation. Approximately 25,000 total mutagenized templates were screened for suppression (∼100 library pools). Mutagenized libraries were transformed into the tpk null strain and plated onto Leu-Ura-drop-out medium, and double transformants were patched onto Leu-Ura-plates, grown at 30 °C overnight, then replica-plated onto Leu-5-FOA plates. Plasmids from transformants that retained viability on 5-FOA were rescued into E. coli, and the suppressors were sequenced (University of California San Diego Cancer Center Sequencing Facility). Phenotypic Analysis of Strains with Point Mutations in TPK2—Cultures were grown in Leu-Ura-medium. Cell densities were normalized to A600 = 1.0- and 5-fold serially diluted. Dilutions were plated onto selective medium and grown at the indicated temperatures for 6 days. Dilutions were plated onto phenotypic analysis plates that were prepared as previously described (32Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Immunodetection—Wild-type and mutant TPK2 in the centromeric pRS315 vector were expressed from the endogenous promoter and C-terminal FLAG-tagged. Liquid cultures were grown until late log-phase growth (A600 = 1.0-1.3), and cell lysates were prepared by bead beating in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) (lysis buffer). Protein concentrations of cell lysates were normalized using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), separated on 12% SDS-poly-acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Either anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-histone H3 K4 (Upstate) was used as the primary antiserum. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antisera against mouse or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for enhanced chemiluminescent detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purification of FLAG-labeled PKA Catalytic Subunit—Cultures expressing wild-type and/or mutant FLAG-tagged versions of TPK2 were grown in Leu-Ura-medium, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (EMD Chemicals). Cells were lysed by bead beating and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed 5 times with lysis buffer, and FLAG-tagged Tpk2p was eluted by competition with FLAG peptide at a final concentration of 150 ng/μl. Catalytic Kinase Activity Assay with Kemptide Substrate—Catalytic activity of wild-type and altered versions of Tpk2p was assayed using the PepTag PKA activity assay kit (Promega). Reactions were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions using either 0.8 or 1.6 μg of protein per reaction, incubated for 30 min (room temperature), and then stopped by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. The Kemptide substrate is fluorescently labeled, and its overall net charge changes from +1to -1 upon phosphorylation by Tpk2p. The change in charge was detected by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, where successfully phosphorylated peptides migrate in the direction opposite to the nonphosphorylated peptides. The tpk2-V84A and TPK2-V84A,T210V Alleles Reveal Essential Sites for Tpk2p Function—Because the kinase core is nearly identical between each Tpk protein and mammalian PKA, Tpk2p residues predicted to interact directly with the nucleotide base were identified by sequence alignment (Fig. 1B). Several invariant residues have been identified crystallo-graphically to contribute hydrophobic or H-bond interactions with the nucleotide and were, therefore, predicted to be important for nucleotide binding (8Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Several of these had been characterized previously for in vitro effects on catalysis and small molecule binding, but the in vivo consequences of many active mutants remains unclear (24Taylor S.S. Kim C. Vigil D. Haste N.M. Yang J. Wu J. Anand G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding sites in TPK2 were individually mutated, and the function of each mutant was assessed in an S. cerevisiae strain in which all three genes encoding PKA were deleted (Table 1). Because some PKA activity is essential for viability, this triple null mutant strain was maintained by expression of wild-type TPK1 from a URA3-marked plasmid. We selected this genotype to provide potentially the greatest dynamic range of viability for subsequent analysis because it had been previously demonstrated that TPK1 alone supported the most robust growth in a tpk null background (15Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type proteins were expressed from the endogenous TPK2 promoter in LEU2-marked plasmids. Each mutation was designed to substitute a small hydrophobic residue in positions that interact with the nucleotide base to thereby create either loss of hydrogen-bonding or decreased hydrophobic interactions with the nucleotide. Each newly constructed TPK2 mutant was then tested using standard “plasmid shuffle” assays (31Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Springs Harbor, NY2005Google Scholar) to determine whether it could provide essential PKA activity.TABLE 1Wild-type and site-directed mutant TPK plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionaNote that the description of each plasmid specifies both nucleotide and amino acid substitutions for each mutant.pLP2024CEN URA3 TPK1pLP2025CEN LEU2 TPK2 (224 (ACG→ACC); 324 (TTT→TTC))pLP2026pLP2025 (L76A (CTT→GCC))pLP2027pLP2025 (V84A (GTT→GCT))pLP2028pLP2025 (1131A (ATT→GCG))pLP2029pLP2025 (M147A (ATG→GCC))pLP2030pLP2025 (Y149A (TAT→GCG))pLP2031pLP2025 (L200A (TTG→GCG))pLP2032pLP2025 (T210V (ACC→GTC))pLP2033pLP2025 (V84A (GTT→GCT); T210A (ACC→GTC))pLP2034CEN LEU2 TPK2::FLAG (224 (ACG→ACC); 324 (TTT→TTC))pLP2035pLP2034 (L76A (CTT→GCC))pLP2036pLP2034 (V84A (GTT→GCT))pLP2037pLP2034 (1131A (ATT→GCG))pLP2038pLP2034 (M147A (ATG→GCC))pLP2039pLP2034 (Y149A (TAT→GCG))pLP2040pLP2034 (L200A (TTG→GCG))pLP2041pLP2034 (T210V (ACC→GTC))pLP2042pLP2034 (V84A (GTT→GCT); T210A (ACC→GTC))a Note that the description of each plasmid specifies both nucleotide and amino acid substitutions for each mutant. Open table in a new tab Transformed cells were grown selecting for both URA3 and LEU2 plasmids then plated in serial dilutions onto selective medium. Growth resulting from co-expression of both the wild-type and mutant plasmids was compared (Fig. 2) to that selecting against expression of wild type (5-FOA) where the only source of PKA was from the mutant TPK2 plasmid. In most cases the tpk2 mutants supported viability. No defects in growth were observed at either permissive (25 °C) or elevated temperatures (34 °C). One mutant, tpk2-Y149A, demonstrated enhanced viability at elevated temperatures. Growth appeared at least 25-fold more robust than for the wild-type control. By contrast, the tpk2-T210V mutant could not support viability as indicated by failure of growth on 5-FOA. The lack of viability demonstrated that this mutation caused loss of essential function. To probe the defect caused by the tpk2-T210V mutation, it was coupled with additional mutations that either caused alterations in the small lobe (tpk2-V84A) or in the hinge region (tpk2-M147A), neither of which individually compromised viability. Although both residues interact with ATP within the nucleotide binding pocket, the methionine at position 147 also acts as a “molecular gate” to limit the size of molecules that bind within the pocket (34Niswender C.M. Ishihara R.W. Judge L.M. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28916-28922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of the tpk2-M147A,T210V double mutant allele, viability was partially restored. This may indicate that modifications in the hinge region of the kinase help overcome defects produced by tpk2-T210V. In contrast, viability was not regained in tpk null strains expressing the TPK2-V84A,T210V allele. We subsequently determined that this was a dominant allele as defined below. Effects of Pocket Mutations on Protein Expression—To test the possibility that the lethal tpk2-T210V or TPK2-V84A,T210V mutations affected protein expression, the level of protein was evaluated for strains with the mutant plasmids (Fig. 3A). Each plasmid was constructed to encode a C-terminal FLAG tag epitope. Mutant and wild-type genes were co-expressed with unlabeled wild-type PKA to maintain comparable viability. Cultures were grown selecting for expression of both kinases, then cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antiserum. Most mutant strains had levels of protein expression comparable with wild type. However, two of the altered proteins, mutants L76A and T210V, had significantly less expression. Of note, the tpk null strain expressing either of the mutants had nearly undetectable tpk2 protein levels yet appeared fully viable and showed only modest defects in cell signaling (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the L76A or T210V mutant proteins must be able to phosphorylate all essential targets despite lowered protein levels, indicating that their kinase activity may actually be quite efficient. Both sites in the wild-type protein are known to interact with adenosine within the nucleotide binding pocket, and adenosine enhances the overall stability of PKA (35Herberg F.W. Doyle M.L. Cox S. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6352-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Low protein levels of these two mutants may be due in part to a significantly lowered occupancy of the nucleotide binding pocket, resulting in protein destabilization and, therefore, reduced activity. In contrast, the strain transformed with the TPK2-V84A,T210V allele was inviable yet had protein levels nearly equivalent to wild type. In this instance, the loss of function phenotype may be due solely to defective catalysis.FIGURE 4The TPK2-V84A,T210V allele is dominant. The plasmid-borne tpk2-T210V and TPK2-V84A,T210V alleles, which could not support viability, were co-expressed with wild-type TPK1 expressed from a plasmid in the tpk null strain. Cells were plated in 5-fold serial dilutions. Dominant phenotypic defects were observed for the TPK2-V84A,T210V mutation for several growth conditions, including low phosphate (to test acid phosphatase induction), bleomycin (to test DNA damage repair), ethanol (to test protein stability), hydroxyurea (to probe DNA replication), and maltose (to test carbon catabolite repression). YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; SC, synthetic complete medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The TPK2-V84A,T210V Protein Has Diminished Enzymatic Activity—To address whether loss of viability in the strain expressing TPK2-V84A,T210V was due to loss of catalytic activity, kinase activity was qualitatively assayed (Fig. 3B). Wild-type and mutant proteins were partially purified by FLAG affinity and tested for their capacity to phosphorylate a peptide with the PKA substrate consensus sequence (LRRASLG) (36Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this model peptide was monitored over 30 min at 2 protein concentrations. The phosphorylated peptides were then separated from non-phosphorylated peptides by electrophoresis. When compared with wild-type activity, TPK2-V84A,T210V was severely impaired and catalyzed little to no phosphorylation of the peptide. This demonstrated that the double point mutations at sites V84A and T210V caused a significant loss of enzymatic activity. The TPK2-V84A,T210V Protein Interfered with Normal Function of PKA—Because the tpk null strain expressing either the tpk2-T210V allele or the TPK2-V84A,T210V allele was non-viable, we asked whether these mutations had additional in vivo consequences. The mutant alleles were co-expressed with wild-type TPK1 to maintain viability and assayed in a broad survey of growth conditions (32Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). There appeared to be no effects for many of the physiological challenges, but the TPK2-V84A,T210V mutation was dominant under several conditions (Fig. 4). Viability was moderately to severely impaired under a variety of circumstances, including growth when bleomycin, ethanol, or hydroxyurea were added to nutrient-rich medium or when maltose was the only carbon source.

Using a unique combination of loss of function for Shaggy/GSK-3β and a gain of function for human APC in Drosophila, we show that misexpressed human APC (hAPC) can still sequester Armadillo/β-catenin. In addition, human APC could suppress gain of Wnt/Wingless phenotypes associated with loss of Shaggy/GSK-3β activity, suggesting that sequestered Armadillo/β-catenin is non-functional. Based on these studies, we propose that binding per se of β-catenin by APC does not require phosphorylation by GSK-3β."

The bactericidal capacity of solar cookers has been demonstrated previously for conventional bacteria and contaminated clinical waste. We investigated the use of a simple solar cooker for the sterilization of mycobacterial broth cultures from the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay (MODS). Methods Simulated TB culture materials were prepared by inoculating 24-well MODS plates with 500 µL of a known concentration of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. In a series of experiments, samples were simultaneously placed inside a box-type solar cooker and control box and removed at timepoints between 15 minutes and 6 hours. Quantitative cultures were performed using retrieved samples to determine sterilization effect. Results All cultures from the control box were positive at or within 1–4 logs of inoculation concentration. Simulated culture plates at concentrations from 103colony-forming-units (CFU)/ml to 107 CFU/ml were completely sterilized after only one hour of cooker exposure, at temperatures between 50–102°C. At 109 CFU/ml (far in excess of diagnostic cultures), it was only possible to recover mycobacterial growth in plates removed after 15 minutes. By 30 minutes all plates were effectively sterilized. Discussion Solar disinfection provides a very effective, safe and low-cost alternative to conventional equipment used for disposal of mycobacterial culture material. Effect of climatic conditions and optimal operating procedure remain to be defined."
