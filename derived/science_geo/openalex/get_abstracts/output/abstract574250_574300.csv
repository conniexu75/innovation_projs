https://openalex.org/W2558665113,"Background Violence against women perpetrated by an intimate partner (IPV) is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC). The aim was to describe the attitudes of women and men towards perpetration of physical violence to women by an intimate partner, in a large group of low- and middle-income countries. Methods and Findings We used data from Round Four of the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Attitudes towards IPV against women were assessed by a study-specific scale asking if ‘wife beating’ is justified in any of five circumstances. Overall, data from 39 countries (all had data from women and 13 countries also had data from men) were included in the analyses. The proportions of women who held attitudes that ‘wife-beating’ was justified in any of the five circumstances varied widely among countries from 2.0% (95% CI 1.7;2.3) in Argentina to 90.2% (95% CI 88.9;91.5) in Afghanistan. Similarly, among men it varied from 5.0% (95% CI 4.0;6.0) in Belarus to 74.5% (95% CI 72.5;76.4) in the Central African Republic. The belief that ‘wife-beating’ is acceptable was most common in Africa and South Asia, and least common in Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean. In general this belief was more common among people in disadvantaged circumstances, including being a member of a family in the lowest household wealth quintile, living in a rural area and having limited formal education. Young adults were more likely to accept physical abuse by a man of his intimate partner than those who were older, but people who had never partnered were less likely to have these attitudes. Conclusions Violence against women is an international priority and requires a multicomponent response. These data provide evidence that strategies should include major public education programs to change attitudes about the acceptability of IPV against women, and that these should be addressed to women and girls as well as to boys and men."

This approach offers the opportunity to visualize unconventional states of matter, directly in real space, and triggered a wealth of studies at the frontier between nanomagnetism, statistical thermodynamics and condensed matter physics. Despite the strong efforts made these last ten years to provide an artificial realization of the celebrated square ice model, no simple geometry based on arrays of nanomagnets succeeded to capture the macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold of the corresponding model. Instead, in all works reported so far, square lattices of nanomagnets are characterized by a magnetically ordered ground state consisting of local flux-closure configurations with alternating chirality. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically, that all the characteristics of the square ice model can be observed if the artificial square lattice is properly designed. The spin configurations we image after demagnetizing our arrays reveal unambiguous signatures of an algebraic spin liquid state characterized by the presence of pinch points in the associated magnetic structure factor. Local excitations, i.e. classical analogues of magnetic monopoles, are found to be free to evolve in a massively degenerated, divergence-free vacuum. We thus provide the first lab-on-chip platform allowing the investigation of collective phenomena, including Coulomb phases and ice-like physics."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding an organic acid salt to alleviate some of the detrimental effects of extreme plant-ingredient substitution of fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) in gilthead sea bream diet. Three experiments were conducted. In a first trial (T1), the best dose (0.4%) of sodium butyrate (BP-70 ®NOREL) was chosen after a short (9-weeks) feeding period. In a second longer trial (T2) (8 months), four diets were used: a control diet containing 25% FM (T2-D1) and three experimental diets containing 5% FM (T2-D2, T2-D3, T2-D4). FO was the only added oil in D1, while a blend of plant oils replaced 58% and 84% of FO in T2-D2, and T2-D3 and T2-D4, respectively. The latter was supplemented with 0.4% BP-70. In a third trial (T3), two groups of fish were fed for 12 and 38 months with D1, D3 and D4 diets of T2. The effects of dietary changes were studied using histochemical, immunohistochemical, molecular and electrophysiological tools. The extreme diet (T2-D3) modified significantly the transcriptomic profile, especially at the anterior intestine, up-regulating the expression of inflammatory markers, in coincidence with a higher presence of granulocytes and lymphocytes in the submucosa, and changing genes involved in antioxidant defences, epithelial permeability and mucus production. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (Rt) was also decreased (T3-D3). Most of these modifications were returned to control values with the addition of BP-70. None of the experimental diets modified the staining pattern of PCNA, FABP2 or ALPI. These results further confirm the potential of this additive to improve or reverse the detrimental effects of extreme fish diet formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2559061868,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) exhibits divergent effects in skeletal muscle. At physiological levels, signalling through this receptor promotes muscle development in growing embryos and angiogenesis in regenerating adult muscle. However, both increased PDGF ligand abundance and enhanced PDGFRα pathway activity cause pathological fibrosis. This excessive collagen deposition, which is seen in aged and diseased muscle, interferes with muscle function and limits the effectiveness of gene- and cell-based therapies for muscle disorders. Although compelling evidence exists for the role of PDGFRα in fibrosis, little is known about the cells through which this pathway acts. Here we show in mice that PDGFRα signalling regulates a population of muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) that play a supportive role in muscle regeneration but may also cause fibrosis when aberrantly regulated. We found that FAPs produce multiple transcriptional variants of Pdgfra with different polyadenylation sites, including an intronic variant that codes for a protein isoform containing a truncated kinase domain. This variant, upregulated during regeneration, acts as a decoy to inhibit PDGF signalling and to prevent FAP over-activation. Moreover, increasing the expression of this isoform limits fibrosis in vivo in mice, suggesting both biological relevance and therapeutic potential of modulating polyadenylation patterns in stem-cell populations."

Studies on tenogenic differentiation at the molecular level may help in developing novel therapeutic strategies. As novel regulators, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to have widespread biological functions, and emerging evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs may play important regulatory roles in cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. In this study, we found that lncRNA H19 stimulated tenogenesis of human tendon-derived stem cells. Stable overexpression of H19 significantly accelerated TGF-b1-induced tenogenic differentiation in vitro and accelerated tendon healing in a mouse tendon defect model. H19 directly targeted miR-29b-3p, which is considered to be a negative regulator of tenogenesis. Furthermore, miR-29b-3p directly suppressed the expression of TGF-β1 and type I collagen, thereby forming a novel regulatory feedback loop between H19 and TGF-b1 to mediate tenogenic differentiation. Our study demonstrated that H19 promotes tenogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo by targeting miR-29b-3p and activating TGF-β1 signaling. Regulation of the TGF-β1/H19/miR-29b-3p regulatory loop may be a new strategy for treating tendon injury.—Lu, Y.-F., Liu, Y., Fu, W.-M., Xu, J., Wang, B., Sun, Y.-X., Wu, T.-Y., Xu, L.-L, Chan, K.-M., Zhang, J.-F., Li, G.

https://openalex.org/W2558608270,"W1282X is the fifth most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutation that causes cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the utility of a small molecule corrector/potentiator strategy, as used for ΔF508-CFTR, to produce functional rescue of the truncated translation product of the W1282X mutation, CFTR1281, without the need for read-through. In transfected cell systems, certain potentiators and correctors, including VX-809 and VX-770, increased CFTR1281 activity. To identify novel correctors and potentiators with potentially greater efficacy on CFTR1281, functional screens were done of ∼30,000 synthetic small molecules and drugs/nutraceuticals in CFTR1281-transfected cells. Corrector scaffolds of 1-arylpyrazole-4-arylsulfonyl-piperazine and spiro-piperidine-quinazolinone classes were identified with up to ∼5-fold greater efficacy than VX-809, some of which were selective for CFTR1281, whereas others also corrected ΔF508-CFTR. Several novel potentiator scaffolds were identified with efficacy comparable with VX-770; remarkably, a phenylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine acted synergistically with VX-770 to increase CFTR1281 function ∼8-fold over that of VX-770 alone, normalizing CFTR1281 channel activity to that of wild type CFTR. Corrector and potentiator combinations were tested in primary cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells generated from nasal brushings from one W1282X homozygous subject. Although robust chloride conductance was seen with correctors and potentiators in homozygous ΔF508 cells, increased chloride conductance was not found in W1282X cells despite the presence of adequate transcript levels. Notwithstanding the negative data in W1282X cells from one human subject, we speculate that corrector and potentiator combinations may have therapeutic efficacy in cystic fibrosis caused by the W1282X mutation, although additional studies are needed on human cells from W1282X subjects.

https://openalex.org/W2559666048,"The structural integrity of the cervix in pregnancy is necessary for carrying a pregnancy until term, and the organization of human cervical tissue collagen likely plays an important role in the tissue’s structural function. Collagen fibers in the cervical extracellular matrix exhibit preferential directionality, and this collagen network ultrastructure is hypothesized to reorient and remodel during cervical softening and dilation at time of parturition. Within the cervix, the upper half is substantially loaded during pregnancy and is where the premature funneling starts to happen. To characterize the cervical collagen ultrastructure for the upper half of the human cervix, we imaged whole axial tissue slices from non-pregnant and pregnant women undergoing hysterectomy or cesarean hysterectomy respectively using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and implemented a pixel-wise fiber orientation tracking method to measure the distribution of fiber orientation. The collagen fiber orientation maps show that there are two radial zones and the preferential fiber direction is circumferential in a dominant outer radial zone. The OCT data also reveal that there are two anatomic regions with distinct fiber orientation and dispersion properties. These regions are labeled: Region 1—the posterior and anterior quadrants in the outer radial zone and Region 2—the left and right quadrants in the outer radial zone and all quadrants in the inner radial zone. When comparing samples from nulliparous vs multiparous women, no differences in these fiber properties were noted. Pregnant tissue samples exhibit an overall higher fiber dispersion and more heterogeneous fiber properties within the sample than non-pregnant tissue. Collectively, these OCT data suggest that collagen fiber dispersion and directionality may play a role in cervical remodeling during pregnancy, where distinct remodeling properties exist according to anatomical quadrant."
https://openalex.org/W2559480386,"Tumor exosomes are emerging as antitumor immunity regulators; however, their effects on secondary exosome secretion by distal organs have not been explored. We have previously demonstrated that suppression of exosomes at the distal tumor site of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ablated the development of salivary biomarker profile. Here, we explore the function of salivary exosomes from tumor-bearing mice in immune surveillance. We provide evidence that salivary exosomes from mice with PDAC exhibit a suppressive effect that results in reduced tumor-killing capacity by NK cells. Salivary exosomes from mice with PDAC where pancreatic tumors were engineered to suppress exosome biogenesis failed to suppress NK cell cytotoxic potential against tumor cells, as opposed to salivary exosomes from mice with PDAC with normal tumor exosome biogenesis. These results reveal an important and previously unknown mechanism of antitumor immune regulation and provide new insights into our understanding of the alterations of this biofluid during tumor development.—Katsiougiannis, S., Chia, D., Kim, Y., Singh, R.

https://openalex.org/W2557882611,"Viral infection is an exacerbating factor contributing to chronic airway diseases, such as asthma, via mechanisms that are still unclear. Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist used as a mimetic to study viral infection, has been shown to elicit inflammatory responses in lungs and to exacerbate pulmonary allergic reactions in animal models. Previously, we have shown that poly(I:C) stimulates lung fibroblasts to accumulate an extracellular matrix (ECM), enriched in hyaluronan (HA) and its binding partner versican, which promotes monocyte adhesion. In the current study, we aimed to determine the in vivo role of versican in mediating inflammatory responses in poly(I:C)-induced lung inflammation using a tamoxifen-inducible versican-deficient mouse model (Vcan−/− mice). In C57Bl/6 mice, poly(I:C) instillation significantly increased accumulation of versican and HA, especially in the perivascular and peribronchial regions, which were enriched in infiltrating leukocytes. In contrast, versican-deficient (Vcan−/−) lungs did not exhibit increases in versican or HA in these regions and had strikingly reduced numbers of leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower expression of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Poly(I:C) stimulation of lung fibroblasts isolated from control mice generated HA-enriched cable structures in the ECM, providing a substrate for monocytic cells in vitro, whereas lung fibroblasts from Vcan−/− mice did not. Moreover, increases in proinflammatory cytokine expression were also greatly attenuated in the Vcan−/− lung fibroblasts. These findings provide strong evidence that versican is a critical inflammatory mediator during poly(I:C)-induced acute lung injury and, in association with HA, generates an ECM that promotes leukocyte infiltration and adhesion.

However, specific roles for versican in the regulation of pulmonary inflammatory responses are not yet well defined due to lack of versican knock-out animals, which are embryonically lethal due to defective cardiac development (35Mjaatvedt C.H.

In this study, we examine the formation of HA- and versican-enriched ECM in lungs of conditionally versican-deficient mice, developed recently in our laboratory, in response to poly(I:C) as a surrogate for viral infection. We report that global deficiency of versican perturbs both the accumulation of HA and the accumulation and infiltration of leukocytes, demonstrating that versican is a critical ECM component mediating HA-dependent leukocyte accumulation in the lungs and a potential therapeutic target. extracellular matrix hyaluronan chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan Toll-like receptor polyinosine-polycytidylic acid versican versican-deficient hyaluronan synthase glycosaminoglycan broncoalveolar lavage fluid bacterial artificial chromosome embryonic stem cell. The distribution of HA and versican was initially examined in unchallenged and poly(I:C)-instilled lungs of 8–10-week-old C57Bl/6 mice. In the unchallenged animals, moderate to strong HA staining was present in the stromal connective tissues of airways but not in alveolar sacs. In the pulmonary vasculature, moderate to strong HA staining was present mostly in the adventitial and peri-adventitial regions (Fig. 1, A–C). Versican levels were low throughout the lung with weak staining in the epithelium of bronchi and bronchioles (Fig. 1 (G–I) and Table 1). HA and versican accumulation associated with infiltrating leukocytes was prominent 48 h after the second poly(I:C) instillation in the perivascular and peribroncheal spaces as well as in the alveolar septa (Fig. 1 (D–H and J–L) and Table 1). These in vivo observations support our previously published in vitro findings that poly(I:C) treatment of lung fibroblasts promotes the formation of an HA- and versican-rich ECM, which enhances monocyte binding (30Evanko S.P.

These findings led us to hypothesize that versican plays an intergral role in promoting leukocyte infiltration into lungs during poly(I:C)-induced pulmonary inflammation. To test this hypothesis, and because the homozygous hdf (heart defect) mouse that lacks Vcan expression (35Mjaatvedt C.H. Yamamura H. Capehart A.A. Turner D. Markwald R.R.

When these B6.Vcan-e4fl/fl mice were crossed to Rosa26-CreERT2 mice, deletion of exon 4 was successfully achieved after treating the mice with tamoxifen (Fig. 2B). Deletion of exon 4 results in the generation of a stop codon in exon 5, preventing versican expression. Vcan−/− animals and littermate controls lacking Cre were treated with poly(I:C) and observed after 48 h, when the inflammatory response was at its peak. Distribution of HA and versican accumulation in PBS-treated control and Vcan−/− animals were similar to our findings in wild type C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 3, A and B and E and F). Poly(I:C) induced the accumulation of HA- and versican-enriched ECM in the perivascular and peribronchial spaces in the inflamed lungs of control animals (Fig. 3, C and G). This ECM accumulation was reduced in Vcan−/− mice. Both HA and versican accumulation were dramatically reduced in Vcan−/− lungs (Fig. 3, D and H). Messenger RNA levels of all isoforms of versican in unchallenged lungs were low in both control and Vcan−/− animals and not significantly different between genotypes. In response to poly(I:C) challenge, however, total versican mRNA levels significantly increased in lungs of control animals but not in Vcan−/− animals (Fig. 4A). Specifically, levels of V0, V1, and V2 versican isoforms were significantly increased in poly(I:C)-challenged lungs but showed no significant elevation in Vcan−/− animals (Fig. 4A). Hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) mRNA levels were also significantly increased in poly(I:C)-challenged control animals but not in Vcan−/− animals (Fig. 4B). Similarly, poly(I:C) challenge induced significant increase in protein accumulation of versican in the lungs in control animals but not in Vcan−/− animals (Fig. 5, A and B). When normalized to Vcan mRNA levels in PBS-treated control lungs, Vcan mRNA levels in poly(I:C)-treated control lungs increased to 310 ± 43%, whereas PBS- and poly(I:C)-treated Vcan−/− lungs were 20 ± 4 and 64 ± 13% of PBS-treated control lungs, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1). This represents a nearly 80% reduction in PBS- as well as poly(I:C)-induced gene expression in Vcan−/− lungs. Similarly, normalized Vcan protein levels in poly(I:C)-treated control lungs increased to 365 ± 57%, whereas PBS- and poly(I:C)-treated Vcan−/− lungs were at 100 ± 27 and 170 ± 28% of PBS-treated control lungs, respectively. This translates to no significant change in protein levels in PBS-treated lungs but a 53.4% reduction in poly(I:C)-stimulated Vcan protein in Vcan−/− lungs. When calculated as a percentage of induction above PBS-treated lungs, poly(I:C)-treated Vcan−/− lungs had 78.8% less mRNA and 73.6% less protein than poly(I:C)-treated controls.FIGURE 5A and B, protein levels of Vcan in whole lung extracts as measured by Western blot (A) were also significantly increased by poly(I:C) (pIC) stimulation in control mice (Cre−) but not in Vcan−/− (Cre+) mice, as quantified by densitometry (B). n = 6–15 mice/group. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. Error bars, S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We observed that leukocyte accumulation associated with a versican- and HA-enriched ECM in poly(I:C)-challenged lungs was blunted in Vcan−/− mice (Fig. 6A). To confirm this finding, we examined whether the numbers of total cells in broncoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from poly(I:C)-challenged animals were affected by versican deficiency. Total cell counts in BALF increased in response to poly(I:C) challenge in control animals, which was significantly reduced in Vcan−/− mice (Fig. 6B). These BALF cells were further subjected to flow cytometry analysis to examine differential counts of leukocytes. The relative percentages of neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and interstitial macrophages in the BALF were not significantly affected by reduction in versican (supplemental Fig. 2, A–C). We further examined whether the presence of versican affects the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by poly(I:C) challenge. In total lung lysates, poly(I:C) significantly increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including TNFα, IL1β, MIP2 (Cxcl2), IFNα, IFNγ, and IL10, in control mice. This response was attenuated or absent in Vcan−/− mice (Fig. 7). To determine whether there was a direct relationship between versican expression and cytokine levels, we performed linear regression analysis and found a significant positive relationship between versican and levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (supplemental Fig. 3). We further examined whether versican deficiency affected the expression of cytokines and chemokines in lung stromal fibroblasts in vitro. Cultured primary lung fibroblasts, isolated from control and Vcan−/− mice, were treated with PBS or poly(I:C), and expression of cytokines and chemokines was measured. Poly(I:C) stimulation induced a significant increase in transcript levels of versican as well as IL1β expressed by control lung fibroblasts, consistent with the changes shown in the poly(I:C)-instilled lungs. In contrast, lung fibroblasts isolated from Vcan−/− mice showed significantly reduced levels of IL1β as well as versican (Fig. 8). To determine whether versican has an impact on leukocyte chemotaxis, we tested chemotactic migration of monocytic U937 cells toward CCL2 in the presence or absence of versican or CS chains. The addition of purified exogenous versican to the bottom chamber, along with CCL2, significantly enhanced migration of monocytic cells toward the chemokine (Fig. 9). Similarly, the addition of CS enhanced chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, adding the purified versican to the monocytic cells in the filter well on the top chamber abolished this chemotactic migration, indicating that the interaction between the chemokine and versican, potentially via CS side chains, enhances leukocyte chemotaxis. Because we observed a relationship between HA, versican, and leukocyte accumulation in poly(I:C)-treated mouse lungs, we examined the formation of HA cables induced by poly(I:C) stimulation of lung fibroblasts in vitro, which promote leukocyte adhesion, as we have previously shown (30Evanko S.P. Potter-Perigo S. Bollyky P.L. Nepom G.T. Wight T.N.

As anticipated, lung fibroblasts isolated from control animals generated HA cable structures in response to poly(I:C) (supplemental Fig. 4A). On the other hand, lung fibroblasts isolated from Vcan−/− animals did not generate these HA cable structures (supplemental Fig. 4B), suggesting that versican deficiency disrupts HA cable formation. We found that poly(I:C) treatment of control lung fibroblasts in cultures induces formation of HA cables, which allows U937 monocytic cells to adhere (Fig. 10, A and B). In contrast, fibroblasts from Vcan−/− mice showed a reduction in HA cable formation and associated adherent monocytes (Fig"

Understanding domestic dog population dynamics and how they could potentially be impacted by interventions, such as rabies vaccination, is vital for such disease control efforts. For four years, we measured demographic data on 2,649 free-roaming domestic dogs in four rural villages in Tanzania: two villages with and two without a rabies vaccination campaign. We examined the effects of body condition, sex, age and village on survivorship and reproduction. Furthermore, we compared sources of mortality among villages. We found that adult dogs (>12mos) had higher survival than puppies in all villages. We observed a male-biased sex ratio across all age classes. Overall survival in one non-vaccination village was lower than in the other three villages, all of which had similar survival probabilities. In all villages, dogs in poor body condition had lower survival than dogs in ideal body condition. Sickness and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) predation were the two main causes of dog death. Within vaccination villages, vaccinated dogs had higher survivorship than unvaccinated dogs. Dog population growth, however, was similar in all the villages suggesting village characteristics and ownership practices likely have a greater impact on overall dog population dynamics than vaccination. Free-roaming domestic dogs in rural communities exist in the context of their human owners as well as the surrounding wildlife. Our results did not reveal a clear effect of vaccination programs on domestic dog population dynamics. An investigation of the role of dogs and their care within these communities could provide additional insight for planning and implementing rabies control measures such as mass dog vaccination."

In this study, we investigated the degradation of β-cypermethrin (β-CY) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) by co-culture of Bacillus licheniformis B-1 and Aspergillus oryzae M-4, as well as the influences of β-CY and 3-PBA metabolites on their degradation and the growth of strains B-1 and M-4. Our results indicated that 100 mg/L β-CY was degraded by 78.85%, and 3-PBA concentration was 0.05 mg/L after 72 h. Compared with using only strain B-1, the half-life (t1/2) of β-CY by using the two strains together was shortened from 84.53 h to 38.54 h, and the yield coefficient of 3-PBA was decreased from 0.846 to 0.001. At 100 mg/L of 3-PBA and gallic acid, β-CY and 3-PBA degradation were only 17.68% and 40.45%, respectively. As the toxic intermediate derived from co-metabolic degradation of β-CY by strain B-1, 3-PBA was efficiently degraded by strain M-4, and gallic acid, as the toxic intermediate from co-metabolic degradation of 3-PBA by strain M-4, was efficiently degraded by strain B-1. These results provided a promising approach for efficient biodegradation of β-CY and 3-PBA."

The mechanisms mediating this are complex, incompletely understood and may be sexually dimorphic, but include developmentally inappropriate apoptosis, inflammation and a disruption to cognitively salient gene expression. We investigated the effects of a 6h isoflurane exposure on cell death, microglial activation and gene expression in the male neonatal piglet brain. Piglets (n = 6) were randomised to: (i) naive controls or (ii) 6h isoflurane. Cell death (TUNEL and caspase-3) and microglial activation were recorded in 7 brain regions. Changes in gene expression (microarray and qPCR) were assessed in the cingulate cortex. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded throughout. Isoflurane anesthesia induced significant increases in cell death in the cingulate and insular cortices, caudate nucleus, thalamus, putamen, internal capsule, periventricular white matter and hippocampus. Dying cells included both neurons and oligodendrocytes. Significantly, microglial activation was observed in the insula, pyriform, hippocampus, internal capsule, caudate and thalamus. Isoflurane induced significant disruption to the expression of 79 gene transcripts, of these 26 are important for the control of transcription and 23 are important for the mediation of neural plasticity, memory formation and recall. Our observations confirm that isoflurane increases apoptosis and inflammatory responses in the neonatal piglet brain but also suggests novel additional mechanisms by which isoflurane may induce adverse neural and cognitive development by disrupting the expression of genes mediating activity dependent development of neural circuits, the predictive adaptive responses of the brain, memory formation and recall."

However, the mechanisms underlying AnkG regulation of Na+ transport were unknown. Here we report that AnkG expression directly regulates Na+ transport by altering ENaC activity in the apical membrane. Increasing AnkG expression increased ENaC activity while depleting AnkG reduced ENaC-mediated Na+ transport. These changes were due to a change in ENaC directly rather than through alterations to the Na+ driving force created by Na+/K+-ATPase. Using a constitutively open mutant of ENaC, we demonstrate that the augmentation of Na+ transport is caused predominantly by increasing the number of ENaCs at the surface. To determine the mechanism of AnkG action on ENaC surface number, changes in rates of internalization, recycling, and membrane delivery were investigated. AnkG did not alter ENaC delivery to the membrane from biosynthetic pathways or removal by endocytosis. However, AnkG did alter ENaC insertion from constitutive recycling pathways.

Detection of abnormal methylation at specific loci by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been developed to enable high-throughput cancer screening. For tests that combine the results of multiple PCR replicates into a single reportable result, both individual PCR cutoff and weighting of the individual PCR result are essential to test outcome. In this opportunistic screening study, we tested samples from 1133 patients using the triplicate Epi proColon assay with various algorithms and compared it with the newly developed single replicate SensiColon assay that measures methylation status of the same SEPT9 gene sequence. The Epi proColon test approved by the US FDA (1/3 algorithm) showed the highest sensitivity (82.4%) at a lower specificity (82.0%) compared with the Epi proColon 2.0 CE version with 2/3 algorithm (75.1% sensitivity, 97.1% specificity) or 1/1 algorithm (71.3% sensitivity, 92.7% specificity). No significant difference in performance was found between the Epi proColon 2.0 CE and the SensiColon assays. The choice of algorithm must depend on specific test usage, including screening and early detection. These considerations allow one to choose the optimal algorithm to maximize the test performance. We hope this study can help to optimize the methylation detection in cancer screening and early detection."

We evaluated the clinical impact of CDK2 overexpression on a series of 21 high-grade osteosarcoma (OS) samples profiled by using cDNA microarrays. We also assessed the in vitro efficacy of the CDKs inhibitor roscovitine in a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant human OS cell lines. OS tumour samples showed an inherent overexpression of CDK2, and high expression levels at diagnosis of this kinase appeared to negatively impact on clinical outcome. CDK2 expression also proved to be relevant for in vitro OS cells growth. These findings indicated CDK2 as a promising candidate therapeutic marker for OS and therefore we assessed the efficacy of the CDKs-inhibitor roscovitine in both drug-sensitive and -resistant OS cell lines. All cell lines resulted to be responsive to roscovitine, which was also able to increase the activity of cisplatin and doxorubicin, the two most active DNA damaging drugs used in OS chemotherapy. Our results indicated that combined treatment with conventional OS chemotherapeutic drugs and roscovitine may represent a new candidate intervention approach, which may be considered to enhance tumour cell sensitivity to DNA damaging drugs."

To synthesize telomeric repeats, the catalytic subunit telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) uses the RNA subunit (TER) as a template.

Generally, telomeric DNA is composed of simple sequence repeats arranged as a tract of duplex repeats followed by a single-stranded 3′ overhang (3Stewart J.A. Chaiken M.F. Wang F. Price C.M.

The accessibility of strand termini is strictly regulated, and as a consequence, the 3′ overhang has a fixed length range in any given species.

To compensate for incomplete telomere replication by conventional DNA polymerases, most eukaryotes rely on the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) telomerase (8Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Szostak J.W.

Each telomeric repeat array is maintained in a dynamic equilibrium of attrition from genome replication and telomerase-mediated de novo synthesis. Telomerase acts by reverse transcribing the integral RNA component, TER, with the catalytic telomerase reverse transcriptase protein, TERT (9Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

By copying a short template sequence within its RNA moiety, telomerase synthesizes the guanosine-rich telomeric DNA strand (G-strand) running 5′ to 3′ toward a chromosome terminus (e.g. repeats of TTGGGG in the ciliate Tetrahymena or TTAGGG in vertebrates). TERT and TER assembled in a heterologous cell extract can reconstitute repeat synthesis activity; therefore, an RNP with these two subunits is considered the minimal recombinant RNP (11Weinrich S.L.

Telomerase binds a chromosome 3′ overhang in competition, and also coordination, with other single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins (17Hockemeyer D. Collins K.

Telomeric repeat ssDNA is also bound, at least transiently, by the general ssDNA-binding RPA heterotrimer of ∼70-kDa Rpa1, ∼30-kDa Rpa2, and ∼15-kDa Rpa3. RPA serves essential roles in DNA replication and repair, recruiting myriad cellular factors to bound ssDNA with specificities that are incompletely understood (22Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R.

Replication protein A: single-stranded DNA's first responder.Bioessays. 2014; 36: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The RPA heterotrimer has six OB-fold domains, four of which contact DNA: domains A, B, and C in the large subunit Rpa1 and domain D in the middle subunit Rpa2 (Fig. 1A). DNA-binding domains A and B initially engage 8–10 nt of ssDNA, and then subsequent DNA binding by domains C and D extends the footprint to ∼30 nt (23Chen R. Wold M.S.

Characteristics and concepts of dynamic hub proteins in DNA processing machinery from studies of RPA.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2015; 117: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Domains A–D are oriented from 5′ to 3′ on ssDNA, with interdomain contacts and linker structuring induced by DNA binding (25Fan J. Pavletich N.P. Structure and conformational change of a replication protein A heterotrimer bound to ssDNA.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Despite high DNA binding affinity from this interdomain cooperation, RPA can diffuse along a bound DNA by a series of individual domain dissociations (23Chen R. Wold M.S.

Telomeric repeat ssDNA is also bound by the RPA-like CST complex, which is composed of large subunit Cdc13 (in budding yeast), CTC1 (in vertebrate cells), or p75 (in Tetrahymena; see below) as well as the middle and small subunits Stn1 and Ten1, respectively. CST has evolutionarily variable ssDNA binding properties and variable biological roles linked to a high degree of large subunit divergence (18Lloyd N.R. Dickey T.H. Hom R.A. Wuttke D.S.

Lingner J. The human CST complex is a terminator of telomerase activity.Nature. 2012; 488: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Budding yeast CST function is telomere-specific; it stimulates C-strand fill-in and contributes to chromosome end-capping, and, when disassembled in S-phase, its Cdc13 subunit recruits telomerase holoenzyme (18Lloyd N.R.

Remarkably, the Tetrahymena telomerase holoenzyme contains another RPA-like heterotrimer in addition to CST: the TEB heterotrimer composed of Teb1, Teb2, and Teb3 (34Jiang J. Chan H. Cash D.D.

In cells, high affinity ssDNA binding by Teb1 is a major determinant of telomerase association to telomeres. Teb1C mutations that disrupt p50 interaction do not reduce Teb1 binding to telomeric DNA, but Teb1 interaction with p50 is required for robust telomere association of the rest of the telomerase holoenzyme (40Upton H.E.

Teb1 alone or TEB heterotrimer dramatically increases telomerase repeat addition processivity (RAP), but for proteins expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), TEB mediates this stimulation more effectively than Teb1 (34Jiang J.

Together, these observations raise the hypothesis that Teb2 and Teb3 could be shared subunits of telomerase holoenzyme and RPA. To test this hypothesis and to better understand the function(s) of Teb2 and Teb3 in cells, we investigated their endogenous interaction partners by purification of cellular complexes. These studies and complementary ssDNA-binding assays performed with purified recombinant heterotrimers establish that Teb2 and Teb3 are subunits of telomerase holoenzyme and Tetrahymena RPA complexes. Curiously, the same proteins make different functional contributions to different heterotrimers. Understanding the complexity of RPA and RPA-like complexes in Tetrahymena provides a precedent for studies of alternative RPA subunits in other organisms, including humans (41Rider Jr., S.D. Zhu G.

Several innovative interventions are being recommended to detect the remaining 'missed' TB cases. One such intervention involved expanding contact investigation to the community using the Xpert MTB/RIF test.This was a before and after intervention study involving retrospective record review. Passive case finding and household contact investigation was routinely done in the pre-intervention period July 2011-June 2013. Four districts with a high concentration of slums were selected as intervention areas; Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Islamabad. Here, in the intervention period, July 2013-June 2015, contact investigation beyond household was conducted: all people staying within a radius of 50 metres (using Geographical Information System) from the household of smear positive TB patients were screened for tuberculosis. Those with presumptive TB were investigated using smear microscopy and the Xpert MTB/RIF test was performed on smear negative patients. All the diagnosed TB patients were linked to TB treatment and care.A total of 783043 contacts were screened for tuberculosis: 23741(3.0%) presumptive TB patients were identified of whom, 4710 (19.8%) all forms and 4084(17.2%) bacteriologically confirmed TB patients were detected. The contribution of Xpert MTB/RIF to bacteriologically confirmed TB patients was 7.6%. The yield among investigated presumptive child TB patients was 5.1%. The overall yield of all forms TB patients among investigated was 22.3% among household and 19.1% in close community. The intervention contributed an increase of case detection of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis by 6.8% and all forms TB patients by 7.9%.Community contact investigation beyond household not only detected additional TB patients but also increased TB case detection.

In this study, we show that inactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1) signaling in postnatal neurons induces reactive astrogliosis in mice. Ablation of Raptor (an mTORC1-specific component) in postmitotic neurons abolished mTORC1 activity and produced neurons with smaller soma and fewer dendrites, resulting in microcephaly and aberrant behavior in adult mice. Interestingly, extensive astrogliosis without significant astrocyte proliferation and glial scar formation was observed in these mice. The inhibition of neuronal mTORC1 may activate astrogliosis by reducing neuron-derived fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), which might trigger FGF receptor signaling in astrocytes to maintain their nonreactive state, and FGF-2 injection successfully prevented astrogliosis in Raptor knock-out mice. This study demonstrates that neuronal mTORC1 inhibits reactive astrogliosis and plays an important role in CNS pathologies. Astrocytes respond to CNS insults through reactive astrogliosis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we show that inactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1) signaling in postnatal neurons induces reactive astrogliosis in mice.

In this study we identified two novel biased ligands for the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 and characterized their functional properties. We showed that J113863 and its enantiomer UCB35625, initially identified as high affinity antagonists for CCR1 and CCR3, also bind with low affinity to the closely related receptors CCR2 and CCR5. Binding of J113863 and UCB35625 to CCR2 or CCR5 resulted in the full or partial activation of the three Gi proteins and the two Go isoforms. Unlike chemokines, the compounds did not activate G12 Binding of J113863 to CCR2 or CCR5 also induced the recruitment of β-arrestin 2, whereas UCB35625 did not. UCB35625 induced the chemotaxis of L1.2 cells expressing CCR2 or CCR5. In contrast, J113863 induced the migration of L1.2-CCR2 cells but antagonized the chemokine-induced migration of L1.2-CCR5 cells. We also showed that replacing the phenylalanine 3.33 in CCR5 TM3 by the corresponding histidine of CCR2 converts J113863 from an antagonist for cell migration and a partial agonist in other assays to a full agonist in all assays. Further analyses indicated that F3.33H substitution strongly increased the activation of G proteins and β-arrestin 2 by J113863. These results highlight the biased nature of the J113863 and UCB35625 that act either as antagonist, partial agonist, or full agonist according to the receptor, the enantiomer, and the signaling pathway investigated."

Recent evidence suggests that dysregulation of iron regulatory proteins may play a role in cancer pathophysiology. We use public data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to study the association between survival and expression levels of 61 genes coding for iron regulatory proteins in patients with World Health Organization Grade II-III gliomas. Using a feature selection algorithm we identified a novel, optimized subset of eight iron regulatory genes (STEAP3, HFE, TMPRSS6, SFXN1, TFRC, UROS, SLC11A2, and STEAP4) whose differential expression defines two phenotypic groups with median survival differences of 52.3 months for patients with grade II gliomas (25.9 vs. 78.2 months, p< 10-3), 43.5 months for patients with grade III gliomas (43.9 vs. 87.4 months, p = 0.025), and 54.0 months when considering both grade II and III gliomas (79.9 vs. 25.9 months, p < 10-5)."
https://openalex.org/W2558541533,"Background In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, an estimated 80% of newly-identified antiretroviral therapy (ART)-eligible patients are not engaged in ART. Delayed ART uptake ultimately translates into high rates of HIV morbidity, mortality, and transmission. To enhance HIV testing receipt and subsequent treatment uptake in Guangxi, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) executed a cluster-randomized trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a streamlined HIV testing algorithm (the One4All intervention) in 12 county-level hospitals. Objective To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the One4All intervention delivered at county hospitals in Guangxi, China, compared to the current standard of care (SOC). Perspective Health System. Time Horizon 1-, 5-and 25-years. Methods We adapted a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model to simulate HIV transmission and progression in Guangxi, China and identify the economic impact and health benefits of implementing the One4All intervention in all Guangxi hospitals. The One4All intervention algorithm entails rapid point-of-care HIV screening, CD4 and viral load testing of individuals presenting for HIV screening, with same-day results and linkage to counselling. We populated the model with data from the One4All trial (CTN-0056), China CDC HIV registry and published reports. Model outcomes were HIV incidence, mortality, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the One4All intervention compared to SOC. Results The One4All testing intervention was more costly than SOC (CNY 2,182 vs. CNY 846), but facilitated earlier ART access, resulting in delayed disease progression and mortality. Over a 25-year time horizon, we estimated that introducing One4All in Guangxi would result in 802 averted HIV cases and 1629 averted deaths at an ICER of CNY 11,678 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis revealed that One4All remained cost-effective at even minimal levels of effectiveness. Results were robust to changes to a range of parameters characterizing the HIV epidemic over time. Conclusions The One4All HIV testing strategy was highly cost-effective by WHO standards, and should be prioritized for widespread implementation in Guangxi, China. Integrating the intervention within a broader combination prevention strategy would enhance the public health response to HIV/AIDS in Guangxi."

This work represents a maiden effort to develop a robot-assisted mechanical therapy (RAMT) device to objectively address the significance of mechanical physiotherapy on poststroke outcomes. Wistar rats were subjected to right hemisphere middle-cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. After 24 h, rats were split into control (RAMT-) or RAMT+ groups (30 min daily RAMT over the stroke-affected gastrocnemius) and were followed up to poststroke d 14. RAMT+ increased perfusion 1.5-fold in stroke-affected gastrocnemius as compared to RAMT- controls. Furthermore, RAMT+ rats demonstrated improved poststroke track width (11% wider), stride length (21% longer), and travel distance (61% greater), as objectively measured using software-automated testing platforms. Stroke injury acutely increased myostatin (3-fold) and lowered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression (0.6-fold) in the stroke-affected gastrocnemius, as compared to the contralateral one. RAMT attenuated the stroke-induced increase in myostatin and increased BDNF expression in skeletal muscle. Additional RAMT-sensitive myokine targets in skeletal muscle (IL-1ra and IP-10/CXCL10) were identified from a cytokine array. Taken together, outcomes suggest stroke acutely influences signal transduction in hindlimb skeletal muscle. Regimens based on mechanical therapy have the clear potential to protect hindlimb function from such adverse influence.-Sen, C.

Under these conditions, it is difficult for a person to locate and access useful information for making decisions. To address this problem, there are information filtering systems, such as the personalized recommendation system (PRS) considered in this paper, that assist a person in identifying possible products or services of interest based on his/her preferences. Among available approaches, collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most widely used recommendation techniques. However, CF has some limitations, e.g., the relatively simple similarity calculation, cold start problem, etc. In this context, this paper presents a new regression model based on the support vector machine (SVM) classification and an improved PSO (IPSO) for the development of an electronic movie PRS. In its implementation, a SVM classification model is first established to obtain a preliminary movie recommendation list based on which a SVM regression model is applied to predict movies' ratings. The proposed PRS not only considers the movie's content information but also integrates the users' demographic and behavioral information to better capture the users' interests and preferences. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by a series of experiments based on the MovieLens benchmark data set."

We established the impact of intervention on food intake, body weight, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass; plasma, lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), liver enzymes, and adipokines; glucose and insulin during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test; and Glut4 and ApoE expression in VAT. HFD feeding induced more weight gain and higher plasma lipids in APOE3 compared to APOE4 mice (P < 0.05), along with a 2-fold higher insulin and impaired glucose tolerance. Supplementing APOE3, but not APOE4, animals with dietary n-3 PUFAs decreased body-weight gain, plasma lipids, and insulin (P < 0.05) and improved glucose tolerance, which was associated with increased VAT Glut4 mRNA levels (P < 0.05).

Objectives To determine whether patients at low to moderate risk of death contribute to geographic variation in ICU admission. Methods Retrospective cohort of hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries (age > 64 years) admitted for ten common medical and surgical diagnoses (2004 to 2009). We examined population-adjusted rates of ICU admission per 100 hospitalizations in 304 health referral regions (HRR), and estimated the relative risk of ICU admission across strata of regional ICU and risk of death, adjusted for patient and regional characteristics. Measurement and Main Results ICU admission rates varied nearly two-fold across HRR quartiles (quartile 1 to 4: 13.6, 17.3, 20.0, and 25.2 per 100 hospitalizations, respectively). Observed mortality for patients in regions (quartile 4) with the greatest ICU use was 17% compared to 21% in regions with lowest ICU use (quartile 1) (p<0.001). After adjusting for patient and regional characteristics, including regional differences in ICU, skilled nursing, and long-term acute care bed capacity, individuals’ risk of death modified the relationship between regional ICU use and an individual’s risk of ICU admission (p for interaction<0.001). Region was least important in predicting ICU admission among patients with high (quartile 4) risk of death (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.22–1.31, for high versus low ICU use regions), and most important for patients with moderate (quartile 2; RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.53–1.72, quartile 3; RR 1.56 95% CI 1.47–1.65) and low (quartile 1) risk of death (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.41–1.59). Conclusions There is wide variation in in ICU use by geography, independent of ICU beds and physician supply, for patients with low and moderate risks of death."

The respective roles of alcohol and drug use in premature death among people with HIV in Russia have not been described. Criminalization and stigmatization of substance use in Russia may also contribute to mortality. We explored whether alcohol, drug use and risk environment factors are associated with short-term mortality in HIV-infected Russians who use substances. Secondary analyses were conducted using prospective data collected at baseline, 6 and 12-months from HIV-infected people who use substances recruited between 2007–2010 from addiction and HIV care settings in a single urban setting of St. Petersburg, Russia. We used Cox proportional hazards models to explore associations between 30-day alcohol hazardous drinking, injection drug use, polysubstance use and environmental risk exposures (i.e. past incarceration, police involvement, selling sex, and HIV stigma) with mortality. Among 700 participants, 59% were male and the mean age was 30 years. There were 40 deaths after a median follow-up of 12 months (crude mortality rate 5.9 per 100 person-years). In adjusted analyses, 30-day NIAAA hazardous drinking was significantly associated with mortality compared to no drinking [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) 2.60, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.24–5.44] but moderate drinking was not (aHR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.35–2.59). No other factors were significantly associated with mortality. The high rates of short-term mortality and the strong association with hazardous drinking suggest a need to integrate evidence-based alcohol interventions into treatment strategies for HIV-infected Russians."

Recent epidemiological studies have assessed the relationship between vitamin D and multiple outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. However, this evidence is limited and inconclusive. Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the association between dietary vitamin D intake and cardiovascular disease risk in adult Mexican population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with the baseline data from 6294 men and women aged 20–80 years participating in the Health Workers Cohort Study. Data on sociodemographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors were collected with a self-administered questionnaire. Dietary intake was evaluated by using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Cardiovascular disease risk was calculated using a recalibration of the Framingham heart disease prediction score. To evaluate the association between vitamin D intake and 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 6294 subjects (1820 men and 4474 women) with a mean age of 42 years, were included. Of these, subjects in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake presented lower levels of triglycerides 14.6 mg/dL (P for trend = 0.001); 2.0 cm less in waist circumference (P for trend = 0.001) and 0.8 points less in the Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score (P for trend = 0.002) compared with the subjects in the lower quintile of vitamin D intake. Additionally, participants in the highest quintile of vitamin D consumption were less likely to develop elevated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, compared with those in the lowest quintile (OR = 0.51; 95%CI: 0.33, 0.77; P for trend = 0.007).

A growing body of literature suggests increasingly complex coupling among classically defined pathways. Given this apparent complexity, it is difficult to predict where, when, or even whether crosstalk occurs. Here, we investigated pairs of morphogenic pathways, previously reported to have multiple points of crosstalk, which either do not share (TGFβ and Wnt/β-catenin) or share (TGFβ and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)) core signaling components. Crosstalk was measured by the ability of one morphogenic pathway to cross-activate core transcription factors and/or target genes of another morphogenic pathway. In contrast to previous studies, we found a surprising absence of crosstalk between TGFβ and Wnt/β-catenin. Further, we did not observe expected cross-pathway inhibition in between TGFβ and BMP, despite the fact that both use (or could compete) for the shared component SMAD4. Critical to our assays was a separation of timescales, which helped separate crosstalk due to initial signal transduction from subsequent post-transcriptional feedback events. Our study revealed fewer (and different) inter-morphogenic pathway crosstalk connections than expected; even pathways that share components can be insulated from one another."

Therefore, it is critical to identify the molecular mechanisms that function within both the PGCs and SGPs to promote gonad morphogenesis. We have characterized the phenotypes of two genes, longitudinals lacking (lola) and ribbon (rib), that are required for the coalescence and compaction of the embryonic gonad in Drosophila melanogaster. rib and lola are expressed in the SGPs of the developing gonad, and genetic interaction analysis suggests these proteins cooperate to regulate gonad development. Both genes encode proteins with DNA binding motifs and a conserved protein-protein interaction domain, known as the Broad complex, Tramtrack, Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain. Through molecular modeling and yeast-two hybrid studies, we demonstrate that Rib and Lola homo- and heterodimerize via their BTB domains. In addition, analysis of the colocalization of Rib and Lola with marks of transcriptional activation and repression on polytene chromosomes reveals that Rib and Lola colocalize with both repressive and activating marks and with each other. While previous studies have identified Rib and Lola targets in other tissues, we find that Rib and Lola are likely to function via different downstream targets in the gonad. These results suggest that Rib and Lola act as dual-function transcription factors to cooperatively regulate embryonic gonad morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2559367271,"The notion of ""mixtures"" has become pervasive in behavioral and cognitive sciences, due to the success of dual-process theories of cognition. However, providing support for such dual-process theories is not trivial, as it crucially requires properties in the data that are specific to mixture of cognitive processes. In theory, one such property could be the fixed-point property of binary mixture data, applied-for instance- to response times. In that case, the fixed-point property entails that response time distributions obtained in an experiment in which the mixture proportion is manipulated would have a common density point. In the current article, we discuss the application of the fixed-point property and identify three boundary conditions under which the fixed-point property will not be interpretable. In Boundary condition 1, a finding in support of the fixed-point will be mute because of a lack of difference between conditions. Boundary condition 2 refers to the case in which the extreme conditions are so different that a mixture may display bimodality. In this case, a mixture hypothesis is clearly supported, yet the fixed-point may not be found. In Boundary condition 3 the fixed-point may also not be present, yet a mixture might still exist but is occluded due to additional changes in behavior. Finding the fixed-property provides strong support for a dual-process account, yet the boundary conditions that we identify should be considered before making inferences about underlying psychological processes."

We analyzed DM risk by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.The patients who underwent SGBIIA demonstrated a lower cumulative incidence of DM compared with the control cohort (log-rank test, P < .001 and 6.73 vs 12.6 per 1000 person-y). The difference in the DM risk between patients with and without SGBIIA increased gradually with the follow-up duration. Age and sex did not affect the subsequent risk of developing DM, according to the multivariable Cox regression model. Nevertheless, the SGBIIA cohort exhibited a lower DM risk after we adjusted for the comorbidities of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40-0.78). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of DM in the SGBIIA cohort was lower than that in the control cohort for all age groups (age ≤ 49 y, IRR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.16-0.99; age 50-64 y, IRR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.96; age ≧ 65 y, IRR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.91). Moreover, the IRR of DM was significantly lower in the SGBIIA cohort with comorbidities (IRR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31-0.78) compared with those without a comorbidity (IRR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.40-1.04).The findings of this population-based cohort study revealed that SGBIIA was associated with a reduced risk of DM development, and the inverse association was greater in the presence of a comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2558018687,"Since 2002, France has been strengthening legislation on road traffic. This study is intended to evaluate the changes in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) incidence and mortality resulting from Road Traffic Collision (RTC) in the two 6-year periods before and after 2002.We used a Registry of all RTC casualties in the Rhône Department of France. Each casualty was coded according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). The study describes changes in demographic variables, TBI (AIS ≥ 2) incidence and mortality, other body lesions (AIS ≥ 3) associated with TBI, road user types, seatbelt and helmet wearing.RTC casualty occurrences decreased by 21% (from 64,312 to 50,746) during the period after 2002. TBI occurrence accounted for 8.6% and 6.7% of all RTC in both periods. This corresponds to a reduction of TBI casualty incidence (-42%), which was much more pronounced than RTC casualty incidence (-25%) (p < 0.0001). Severe and critical TBI (AIS-4 and -5) incidences were reduced by half as much (-21%), compared to TBI incidence. TBI mortality rate (among population) and lethality (among TBI related to RTC casualties) decreased 56% and 23%, respectively. This reduction particularly affected car occupants and victims who deceased. TBI incidence decreased 43% in all 10-year age classes until 60 on average, this decrease declining with age in the period after 2002. After adjustment for age, sex, road user types, and severity of lesions at the head and other body regions, logistic regression analysis displayed a protective effect of the period following 2002, on the risk of death after RTC-related TBI.The greater reductions in the incidence, severity and mortality of TBI when compared with the reduction of casualty incidence have mainly affected car users. These results should be attributable to the improvements in standards of care, primary safety of the car fleet and general road architecture safety. However, the increased reduction in the TBI epidemics in France, when compared to those observed in other developed countries for the same periods, suggests that the effects should be strongly attributable to changes in road user behaviour induced by law enforcement. The at-risk groups for TBI after RTC are now two-wheel users (motorized or not) and individuals over 60 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W2558935544,"In this paper, a numerical exposure assessment method is presented for a quasi-static analysis by the use of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. The proposed method is composed of scattered field FDTD method and quasi-static approximation for analyzing of the low frequency band electromagnetic problems. The proposed method provides an effective tool to compute induced electric fields in an anatomically realistic human voxel model exposed to an arbitrary non-uniform field source in the low frequency ranges. The method is verified, and excellent agreement with theoretical solutions is found for a dielectric sphere model exposed to a magnetic dipole source. The assessment method serves a practical example of the electric fields, current densities, and specific absorption rates induced in a human head and body in close proximity to a 150-kHz wireless power transfer system for cell phone charging. The results are compared to the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the IEEE standard guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2557499141,"Objective Chronic synovial inflammation causes primary osteoarthritis, but it is unknown whether chronic systemic inflammation does, too. Patients with cirrhosis have chronic systemic inflammation and therefore we examined the association between cirrhosis and primary osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. Methods In Danish healthcare databases we identified all residents over 60 years diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1994–2011, and for each of them we sampled five age- and gender-matched reference persons from the general population. We excluded everyone with risk factors for secondary osteoarthritis and computed incidence rates of primary osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. We used stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios of primary osteoarthritis for cirrhosis patients vs. reference persons in strata defined by gender, age, cirrhosis etiology, and ascites vs. no ascites. We also computed separate HRs for primary osteoarthritis of the hips or knees. Results We identified 10,049 cirrhosis patients. Their median age was 67 years, and 65% were men. Among the cirrhosis patients the crude incidence rate of primary osteoarthritis was 8.40 (95% CI: 7.30–9.63) per 1000 person-years. The rate was similar in the reference persons: 8.76 (95% CI: 8.43–9.12) per 1000 person-years. Accordingly, the hazard ratio for primary osteoarthritis for cirrhosis patients vs. reference persons was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.85–1.16), and we found the same null association in all patient strata and in both joints. Conclusion Cirrhosis, and thus chronic systemic inflammation, is not a risk factor for primary osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2558111478,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by liver steatosis and inflammation. Currently, the underlying mechanisms leading to hepatic inflammation are not fully understood and consequently, therapeutic options are poor. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and atherosclerosis share the same etiology whereby macrophages play a key role in disease progression. Macrophage function can be modulated via activation of receptor-ligand binding of Notch signaling. Relevantly, global inhibition of Notch ligand Delta-Like Ligand-4 (DLL4) attenuates atherosclerosis by altering the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response. However, the specific contribution of macrophage DLL4 to hepatic inflammation is currently unknown. We hypothesized that myeloid DLL4 deficiency in low-density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (Ldlr-/-) mice reduces hepatic inflammation. Irradiated Ldlr-/- mice were transplanted (tp) with bone marrow from wild type (Wt) or DLL4f/fLysMCre+/0 (DLL4del) mice and fed either chow or high fat, high cholesterol (HFC) diet for 11 weeks. Additionally, gene expression was assessed in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) of DLL4f/fLysMCreWT and DLL4f/fLysMCre+/0 mice. In contrast to our hypothesis, inflammation was not decreased in HFC-fed DLL4del-transplanted mice. In line, in vitro, there was no difference in the expression of inflammatory genes between DLL4-deficient and wildtype bone marrow-derived macrophages. These results suggest that myeloid DLL4 deficiency does not contribute to hepatic inflammation in vivo. Since, macrophage-DLL4 expression in our model was not completely suppressed, it can't be totally excluded that complete DLL4 deletion in macrophages might lead to different results. Nevertheless, the contribution of non-myeloid Kupffer cells to notch signaling with regard to the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis is unknown and as such it is possible that, DLL4 on Kupffer cells promote the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2554741184,"Biologists regularly create phylogenetic trees to better understand the evolutionary origins of their species of interest, and often use genomes as their data source. However, as more and more incomplete genomes are published, in many cases it may not be possible to compute genome-based phylogenetic trees due to large gaps in the assembled sequences. In addition, comparison of complete genomes may not even be desirable due to the presence of horizontally acquired and homologous genes. A decision must therefore be made about which gene, or gene combinations, should be used to compute a tree. Deflated Cladistic Information based on Total Entropy (dCITE) is proposed as an easily computed metric for measuring the cladistic information in multiple sequence alignments representing a range of taxa, without the need to first compute the corresponding trees. dCITE scores can be used to rank candidate genes or decide whether input sequences provide insufficient cladistic information, making artefactual polytomies more likely. The dCITE method can be applied to protein, nucleotide or encoded phenotypic data, so can be used to select which data-type is most appropriate, given the choice. In a series of experiments the dCITE method was compared with related measures. Then, as a practical demonstration, the ideas developed in the paper were applied to a dataset representing species from the order Campylobacterales; trees based on sequence combinations, selected on the basis of their dCITE scores, were compared with a tree constructed to mimic Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) combinations of fragments. We see that the greater the dCITE score the more likely it is that the computed phylogenetic tree will be free of artefactual polytomies. Secondly, cladistic information saturates, beyond which little additional cladistic information can be obtained by adding additional sequences. Finally, sequences with high cladistic information produce more consistent trees for the same taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2559176010,"How does group size influence behavior in online trust dilemmas? We investigate cooperation in groups of 4 to 100 players. While overall levels of cooperation are stable across group sizes, we find significant gender differences: women increase cooperation with group size and cooperate significantly more than men in large groups. These results are robust when controlling for risk aversion, age, and other individual differences. They highlight the importance of studying behavior and gender differences in large groups."
https://openalex.org/W2559427236,"Radical environmental groups and their members have a wide and varied agenda which often encompasses both local and global issues. In their efforts to call attention to environmental problems, communicate with like-minded groups, and mobilize support for their activities, radical environmental organizations also produce an enormous amount of text, which can be used to estimate the complex communications and task-based networks that underlie these organizations. Moreover, the tactics employed to garnish attention for these groups' agenda can range from peaceful activities such as information dissemination to violent activities such as fire-bombing buildings. To obtain these varied objectives, radical environmental organizations must harness their networks, which have an important spatial component that structures their ability to communicate, coordinate and act on any given agenda item. Here, we analyze a network built from communications and information provided by the semi-annual ""Do or Die"" (DoD) magazine published in the UK over a 10 year period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. We first employ structural topic model methods to discover violent and nonviolent actors within the larger environmental community. Using this designation, we then compare the spatial structure of these groups, finding that violent groups are especially likely to engage in coordination and/or communication if they are sufficiently close, but exhibit a quickly decreasing probability of interaction over even a few kilometers. Further, violent and nonviolent groups each have a higher probability of coordination with their own group than across groups over even short distances. In these respects, we see that violent groups are especially local in their organization and that their geographic reach is likely very limited. This suggests that nonviolent environmental groups seek each other out over both large and short distances for communication and coordination, but violent groups tend to be highly localized."

However, the fate and potential significance of these lobes remained unexplored for decades. Now, neighbouring endodermal cells are shown to sever and digest these lobes, in an unexpected process of 'intercellular cannibalism', which could play an important part in regulating primordial germ cells."
