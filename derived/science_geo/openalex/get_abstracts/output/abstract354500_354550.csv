https://openalex.org/W2143826692,"Fluorescence light microscopy allows multicolor visualization of cellular components with high specificity, but its utility has until recently been constrained by the intrinsic limit of spatial resolution. We applied three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to circumvent this limit and to study the mammalian nucleus. By simultaneously imaging chromatin, nuclear lamina, and the nuclear pore complex (NPC), we observed several features that escape detection by conventional microscopy. We could resolve single NPCs that colocalized with channels in the lamin network and peripheral heterochromatin. We could differentially localize distinct NPC components and detect double-layered invaginations of the nuclear envelope in prophase as previously seen only by electron microscopy. Multicolor 3D-SIM opens new and facile possibilities to analyze subcellular structures beyond the diffraction limit of the emitted light."

In an effort to identify catalysts based on less expensive and more available metals, density functional calculations were performed that identified relations in heats of adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules and fragments on metal surfaces. This analysis not only verified the facility of known catalysts but identified nickel-zinc alloys as alternatives. Experimental studies demonstrated that these alloys dispersed on an oxide support were selective for acetylene hydrogenation at low pressures."

However, their relevance for the vulnerability to compulsively seek and take drugs, which is a hallmark feature of addiction, is unknown. We report here that, whereas high reactivity to novelty predicts the propensity to initiate cocaine self-administration, high impulsivity predicts the development of addiction-like behavior in rats, including persistent or compulsive drug-taking in the face of aversive outcomes. This study shows experimental evidence that a shift from impulsivity to compulsivity occurs during the development of addictive behavior, which provides insights into the genesis and neural mechanisms of drug addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2032351859,"Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) has a number of uses in catalysis, photochemistry, and sensing that are linked to the reducibility of the oxide. Usually, bridging oxygen (O br ) vacancies are assumed to cause the Ti 3d defect state in the band gap of rutile TiO 2 (110). From high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we propose that Ti interstitials in the near-surface region may be largely responsible for the defect state in the band gap. We argue that these donor-specific sites play a key role in and may dictate the ensuing surface chemistry, such as providing the electronic charge required for O 2 adsorption and dissociation. Specifically, we identified a second O 2 dissociation channel that occurs within the Ti troughs in addition to the O 2 dissociation channel in O br vacancies. Comprehensive density functional theory calculations support these experimental observations."

However, little is known about the sorting mechanism of p62 to autophagic degradation. Here we identified a motif of murine p62 consisting of 11 amino acids (Ser334-Ser344) containing conserved acidic and hydrophobic residues across species, as an LC3 recognition sequence (LRS). The crystal structure of the LC3-LRS complex at 1.56Å resolution revealed interaction of Trp340 and Leu343 of p62 with different hydrophobic pockets on the ubiquitin fold of LC3. In vivo analyses demonstrated that p62 mutants lacking LC3 binding ability accumulated without entrapping into autophagosomes in the cytoplasm and subsequently formed ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies as in autophagy-deficient cells. These results demonstrate that the intracellular level of p62 is tightly regulated by autophagy through the direct interaction of LC3 with p62 and reveal that selective turnover of p62 via autophagy controls inclusion body formation.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a major pathway for intracellular bulk degradation by the lysosome/vacuole, and its molecular machinery is highly conserved among eukaryotes. In the autophagic process, a small membrane sac (called isolation membrane) elongates to enwrap cytoplasmic materials, including organelles, and subsequently the extended membrane closes to form a double-membrane structure termed autophagosome. The autophagosome fuses with the lysosome/vacuole where the sequestered cytoplasmic contents within the autophagosome are degraded by hydrolases of the lysosome/vacuole (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev.

This system is required to execute turnover of cytosolic proteins and for removal of unwanted organelles (e.g. called as pexophagy, mitophagy, and reticulophagy). Genetic and molecular studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified 18 ATG (autophagy-related genes) essential for autophagosome formation (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Among them, eight ATG products include two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems essential for autophagy (3Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Atg12 is a ubiquitin-like protein covalently linked to Atg5 by catalytic reactions of Atg7 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and Atg10 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) (5Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Atg12-Atg5 interacts with Atg16, resulting in oligomerization of Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 (6Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Another ubiquitin-like protein, Atg8 conjugates to a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). 3The abbreviations used are:PEphosphatidylethanolamineLRSLC3 recognition sequenceLC3microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3GABARAPγ-aminobutyric acid, type A, receptor-associated proteinGATE-16Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDaMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDoxdoxycyclinePB1Phox and Bem1p. Atg8, synthesized as a precursor form with extra amino acid residues, is processed by Atg4 cysteine protease, which exposes a glycine residue at its C terminus (7Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H.

The processed Atg8 is conjugated to PE by Atg7 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and Atg3 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) (8Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that Atg12-Atg5 conjugate functions as a ubiquitin ligase-like enzyme for Atg8 lipidation reaction (9Hanada T. Noda N.N. Satomi Y. Ichimura Y. Fujioka Y. Takao T. Inagaki F. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37298-37302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Finally, the C-terminal glycine of Atg8 covalently conjugates to an amino group of PE (8Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Atg8-PE mediates membrane tethering and hemifusion involving the formation of autophagosomal membrane, and its level correlates with autophagosome formation (10Nakatogawa H. Ichimura Y. Ohsumi Y. Cell. 2007; 130: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The mammalian Atg8 homologs, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), and Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16), are also conjugated to PE via the same ubiquitin-like system to Atg8 lipidation (11Kabeya Y.

In recent years, it has become clear that autophagy plays an important role in a variety of physiological responses as follows: starvation, development, differentiation, tumorigenesis, immunity, and neurodegeneration (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Autophagy, particularly that responsive to starvation, is generally considered a nonselective degradation (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). This large scale degradation enables cells to survive during starvation by recycling of the degradation products for sources of energy production and macromolecule synthesis. In addition to the starvation-induced adaptive autophagy, growing lines of evidence point to the importance of basal autophagy that operates constitutively at low rates even under a nutrient-rich environment and plays a vital role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (14Hara T.

Indeed, studies using mouse genetics have indicated that autophagy-deficient mice exhibit remarkable accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates followed by hepatocytic and neuronal cell death irrespective of nutrient stresses (14Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have found recently that p62 is a preferred target for autophagy, and intracellular levels of p62 are constantly controlled by constitutive autophagy (21Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. Hamazaki J. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Yanagawa T. Uwayama J. Warabi E. Yoshida H. Ishii T. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Yue Z.

Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies revealed that p62 directly interacts with LC3, an autophagosome marker protein (21Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. Hamazaki J. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Yanagawa T. Uwayama J. Warabi E. Yoshida H. Ishii T. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Yue Z. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3339) Google Scholar). However, little is known molecularly about how p62 is sorted into autophagosomes. In addition to this issue, although we showed that homeostatic levels of p62 control ubiquitin-positive inclusion body formation at the cytoplasm in hepatocytes and neurons of autophagy-deficient mice (21Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. Hamazaki J. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Yanagawa T. Uwayama J. Warabi E. Yoshida H. Ishii T. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Yue Z. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Cell. 2007; 131: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether inclusion formation is only because of deficiency in p62 turnover. In other words, the molecular relationship between autophagic removal of p62 and inclusion body formation remains to be uncovered. This study was designed to shed light on the aforementioned issues related to p62, LC3, autophagosome, inclusion formation, and autophagy. We report the identification of LC3 recognition sequence (LRS) of p62, which includes 11 amino acids (Ser334-Ser344), and the crystal structure of LC3-LRS complex, clarifying the interaction mode at the molecular level. Further biochemical and genetic analyses using autophagy- and/or p62-deficient mouse cells demonstrated that autophagic degradation of p62 absolutely depends on the interaction of LC3, and that the impairment of the physical interaction leads to the formation of cytosolic inclusion bodies. The results indicate that p62 is essential for inclusion body formation associated with impaired autophagy. Plasmid Construction—Maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused p62 (MBP-p62), and its deletion mutant (MBP-p62M7) expression plasmids have been described previously (21Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. Hamazaki J. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Yanagawa T. Uwayama J. Warabi E. Yoshida H. Ishii T. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Yue Z. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Cell. 2007; 131: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). To construct p62M7 variants, a series of deletions of p62M7 were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers and cloned into the MBP fusion expression plasmid, pMALp2 (New England Biolabs). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused LC3B expression plasmid has been described previously (13Sou Y.S. Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3017-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Point mutations were inserted by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing with BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems). Purification of Recombinant Proteins for Pulldown Experiments—MBP-tagged p62 and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) by induction of 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 16 h. The cells were lysed in bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) at room temperature for 10 min. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min by microcentrifuge. The cell extracts were diluted 1:5 into TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) at 4 °C for 2 h. The MBP fusion protein-bound amylose resins were washed three times with TBS. The MBP-p62 and mutants were eluted with TBS containing 10 mm maltose. The purity was confirmed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining (SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen)). GST-tagged LC3, its mutants GABARAP and GATE-16, were purified in a manner similar to that described above except for affinity purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). For removal of the GST region, PreScission protease cleavage was performed (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Pulldown Assay—MBP-p62 and its mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3), and the cell extracts were prepared by bacterial protein extraction reagent. The cell extracts were diluted 5-fold with TBS and incubated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs). The MBP-p62 and its mutants immobilized amylose resin were washed extensively with TBS. The resulting immobilized amylose resins containing about 5 μg of MBP fusion proteins were incubated with 15 μg of LC3 family proteins (LC3, GABARAP, or GATE-16) in 50 μl of TBS on ice for 1 h, and then washed three times with 500 μl of TBS. Bound proteins with amylose resins were suspended into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. GST pulldown was performed through the same procedures described above, except that GST fusion was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and MBP-p62M7 was introduced in this assay. Protein Expression and Purification for Crystal Structure—GST-tagged LC3 was expressed from pGEX6P plasmid in BL21 (RIPL). The protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and cation exchange chromatography. The GST moiety was proteolytically removed by PreScission protease. The protein solution was concentrated to 18.6 mg/ml by ultrafiltration in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The concentrated LC3 was mixed with LRS peptide representing residues 334SGGDDDWTHLS344 from p62 with equal molar ratio and incubated for 3 h. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of LC3-LRS peptide complex were obtained at 15 °C by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, with a mixture of 2.0 μl of protein and the same volume of reservoir solution (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 25% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350). Although crystals formed in 2 days, they were not sufficient for crystal structure determination. Initial crystals were used to generate larger crystals by microseeding. During the microseeding experiments, the concentration of the precipitant was varied. Single crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction measurement were finally obtained with reservoir conditions consisting of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 23% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350. Crystals were transferred to cryoprotective solution containing 10% v/v glycerol, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 23% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 for 30 s. Diffraction data sets for the LC3-p62 complex were collected at 100 K on beamline BL44XU (SPring-8, Japan). Data processing and reduction were carried out with the DENZO/SCALE-PACK (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystal forms of LC3-p62 complex belong to the P21 space group and two molecules in the asymmetric unit.

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). Manual building was then carried out using the program XtalView (38Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and altered with several cycles of refinement using the program REFMAC5 (39McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The final refined model consists of residues 2-122 and residues 1-122 of the molecules in the asymmetric unit. For the p62 peptide, the density allowed building 10 residues complexed to one molecule and 7 residues complexed to the second molecule. Phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. There were no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Structure figures were generated using CCP4MG (40Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Generation of Tet-On Cells—Immortalized p62- and Atg7/p62-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were established by infecting MEFs with a recombinant retrovirus carrying a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T antigen (42Delano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Tetracycline-mediated p62-expressing cell lines were generated using the reverse tetracycline-regulated retroviral vector (43Lee G.H. Ogawa K. Drinkwater N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1811-1822PubMed Google Scholar). A cassette consisting of the gene-encoding packaging signal (ψ), the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA), the internal ribosome entry site from the encephalo-myocarditis virus, the blasticidin S deaminase, a heptamerized tetracycline operator sequence (tetO), the minimal human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter designated Phcmv*-1 (CMV), and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused mouse p62 cDNA or various p62 mutants (p62W340A, p62L343A, p62D338A/D339A, and p62D337A/D338A/D339A) were cloned into a Moloney murine leukemia virus retroviral vector pLXSN backbone (43Lee G.H. Ogawa K. Drinkwater N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1811-1822PubMed Google Scholar). Retrovirus packaging cells, PLAT-E (44Watsuji T. Okamoto Y. Emi N. Katsuoka Y. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), transfected with the vectors were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. After changing the medium, the virus producing PLAT-E was further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The viral supernatant was collected and used immediately for infection. The immortalized p62- and Atg7/p62-deficient MEFs were plated on 35-mm dishes in 3 ml of growth medium at 24 h before infection. Just before infection, the medium was replaced with undiluted viral supernatant with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Twenty four hours later, the cells were introduced into the selection medium containing 5 μg/ml of blasticidin S (Invitrogen). The cells remaining after 5 days were used in the experiments. To induce the expression of p62, the cells were treated with 250 μg/ml of doxycycline (Dox, Sigma) for 24 h. Immunological Analysis—MEFs were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 2% Triton X-100).

To determine the minimal region of p62M7-(168-391) required for the interaction with LC3, we performed pulldown assay experiments using a series of deletion mutants of p62M7. Initially, we examined six mutants of truncated p62M7 (M71-M76) (Fig. 1A). Each MBP-fused p62M7 mutant (M71-M76), which was immobilized on amylose resins, was incubated with recombinant LC3B (hereafter referred to as LC3), washed extensively, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. LC3 was clearly detected in pulldown products with p62 mutants harboring the M76 region (334-391) but not the M72 region (168-333), suggesting that p62M76-(334-391) is sufficient for the interaction with LC3 (Fig. 1B). To shorten the interaction domain, we subsequently prepared a deletion series of p62M76 (M77-M82) for MBP pulldown assay. These pulldown assays revealed that p62M82, which includes 11 amino acids (334-344), is essential and sufficient for LC3 interaction (Fig. 1B). p62M82, which we named LRS (LC3 recognition sequence), contains two conserved motifs across species as follows: acidic cluster (337-339) DDD (or DEE) and hydrophobic residues (340 and 343) WXXL (or WXXV) involved in protein-protein interaction (Fig. 1C and see also Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Structure of the LC3-p62 peptide complex.

https://openalex.org/W2026829672,"The phospholipids that form the membranes of modern cells present a formidable barrier to polar and charged molecules, necessitating complex channels and pumps to permit the exchange of molecules with the external environment. This presents a problem when trying to imagine what a primitive cell would have looked like earlier in the evolution of life. With no transport machinery, how could simple cells take in complex nutrients? A possible answer comes in the form of a model 'protocell' produced by a team at Harvard. Fatty acids and their derivatives are attractive candidates as components of early protocell membranes as they are simple amphiphiles that form bilayer membrane vesicles. A proto-cell equipped with such a membrane is found to be able to take in charged molecules such as nucleotides, while retaining longer genetic polymers made from them inside. The membranes of modern cells are made of phospholipids, which are formidable barriers to the uptake of polar and charged molecules, a challenge to our understanding of the origins of cellular life. Membranes made of simple amphiphiles, such as fatty acids, allow the passage of charged molecules (such as nucleotides), while retaining longer genetic polymers made from them inside such protocells. Primitive cells could thus have acquired complex nutrients from their environment in the absence of any transport machinery. Contemporary phospholipid-based cell membranes are formidable barriers to the uptake of polar and charged molecules ranging from metal ions to complex nutrients. Modern cells therefore require sophisticated protein channels and pumps to mediate the exchange of molecules with their environment. The strong barrier function of membranes has made it difficult to understand the origin of cellular life and has been thought to preclude a heterotrophic lifestyle for primitive cells. Although nucleotides can cross dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes through defects formed at the gel-to-liquid transition temperature1,2, phospholipid membranes lack the dynamic properties required for membrane growth. Fatty acids and their corresponding alcohols and glycerol monoesters are attractive candidates for the components of protocell membranes because they are simple amphiphiles that form bilayer membrane vesicles3,4,5 that retain encapsulated oligonucleotides3,6 and are capable of growth and division7,8,9. Here we show that such membranes allow the passage of charged molecules such as nucleotides, so that activated nucleotides added to the outside of a model protocell spontaneously cross the membrane and take part in efficient template copying in the protocell interior. The permeability properties of prebiotically plausible membranes suggest that primitive protocells could have acquired complex nutrients from their environment in the absence of any macromolecular transport machinery; that is, they could have been obligate heterotrophs."

Recent studies of the Andes indicate that their elevation remained relatively stable for long periods (tens of millions of years), separated by rapid (1 to 4 million years) changes of 1.5 kilometers or more. Periodic punctuated surface uplift of mountain belts probably reflects the rapid removal of unstable, dense lower lithosphere after long-term thickening of the crust and lithospheric mantle."

Reaching this regime has usually required both strong elastic and weak inelastic interactions because the latter produce losses. We show that strong inelastic collisions can actually inhibit particle losses and drive a system into a strongly correlated regime. Studying the dynamics of ultracold molecules in an optical lattice confined to one dimension, we show that the particle loss rate is reduced by a factor of 10. Adding a lattice along the one dimension increases the reduction to a factor of 2000. Our results open the possibility to observe exotic quantum many-body phenomena with systems that suffer from strong inelastic collisions."
https://openalex.org/W1992974611,"Following the discovery of superconductivity near and above 50 K in oxypnictide compounds, the hunt is on for the mechanism of this unconventional superconductivity. The first measurements of the superconducting gap in the high temperature superconductor SmFeAsO0.85F0.15 give some clues. This is a crucial physical quantity, encoding qualitative and quantitative information about the nature of the superconducting state and the pairing interactions that lead to it. Chen et al. report the observation of a single gap in this superconductor. The size and detailed temperature dependence of the gap are close to that expected of a conventional 'BCS' single gap, s-wave superconductor, in contrast to the d-wave pseudogap features found in high-Tc cuprates and the two-gap structure observed in MgB2. The observation of a single gap in the superconductor SmFeAsO0.85F0.15 is reported. The gap value, its decrease with temperature and vanishing at Tc are all consistent with the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer predictions, but dramatically different from that of the pseudogap behaviour in the copper oxide superconductors. The results are not compatible with models involving antiferromagnetic fluctuations, strong correlations, t-J model, and the like, originally designed for the high-Tc copper oxides. Since the discovery of superconductivity in the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxides two decades ago, it has been firmly established that the CuO2 plane is essential for superconductivity and gives rise to a host of other very unusual properties. A new family of superconductors with the general composition of LaFeAsO1-xF x has recently been discovered1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and the conspicuous lack of the CuO2 planes raises the tantalizing question of a different pairing mechanism in these oxypnictides. The superconducting gap (its magnitude, structure, and temperature dependence) is intimately related to pairing. Here we report the observation of a single gap in the superconductor SmFeAsO0.85F0.15 with Tc = 42 K as measured by Andreev spectroscopy. The gap value of 2Δ = 13.34 ± 0.3 meV gives 2Δ/kBTc = 3.68 (where kB is the Boltzmann constant), close to the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) prediction of 3.53. The gap decreases with temperature and vanishes at Tc in a manner consistent with the BCS prediction, but dramatically different from that of the pseudogap behaviour in the copper oxide superconductors. Our results clearly indicate a nodeless gap order parameter, which is nearly isotropic in size across different sections of the Fermi surface, and are not compatible with models involving antiferromagnetic fluctuations, strong correlations, the t-J model, and the like, originally designed for the high-Tc copper oxides."
https://openalex.org/W2007941919,"In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the female. The noncoding Xist gene initiates silencing of the X chromosome, whereas its antisense partner Tsix blocks silencing. The complementarity of Xist and Tsix RNAs has long suggested a role for RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we report that murine Xist and Tsix form duplexes in vivo. During XCI, the duplexes are processed to small RNAs (sRNAs), most likely on the active X (Xa) in a Dicer-dependent manner. Deleting Dicer compromises sRNA production and derepresses Xist. Furthermore, without Dicer, Xist RNA cannot accumulate and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation is blocked on the inactive X (Xi). The defects are partially rescued by truncating Tsix. Thus, XCI and RNAi intersect, down-regulating Xist on Xa and spreading silencing on Xi."

These include CNPs that are likely to be under positive selection, most notably high-frequency duplications encompassing toxin-response genes. The locations and frequencies of CNPs are strongly shaped by purifying selection, with deletions under stronger purifying selection than duplications. Among duplications, those overlapping exons or introns, as well as those falling on the X chromosome, seem to be subject to stronger purifying selection."

Genetic screens uncovered a potential palmitoylacyltransferase (PAT) for Shh, Hhat, but the molecular mechanism of Shh palmitoylation remains unclear. Here, we have developed and exploited an in vitro Shh palmitoylation assay to purify Hhat to homogeneity. We provide direct biochemical evidence that Hhat is a PAT with specificity for attaching palmitate via amide linkage to the N-terminal cysteine of Shh. Other palmitoylated proteins (e.g. PSD95 and Wnt) are not substrates for Hhat, and Porcupine, a putative Wnt PAT, does not palmitoylate Shh. Neither autocleavage nor cholesterol modification is required for Shh palmitoylation. Both the Shh precursor and mature protein are N-palmitoylated by Hhat, and the reaction occurs during passage through the secretory pathway. This study establishes Hhat as a bona fide Shh PAT and serves as a model for understanding how secreted morphogens are modified by distinct PATs."
https://openalex.org/W2070814193,"In Drosophila ovarian stem cells, one daughter cell self-renews continuously while the other undergoes a limited number of divisions, stops to proliferate mitotically and differentiates. Ovarian stem cells are regulated by an extracellular signal from the surrounding stem cell niche. After division, one daughter cell looses niche contact. It undergoes four transit amplifying divisions to form a cyst of 16 interconnected cells which reduce their rate of growth and stop to proliferate mitotically. This paper shows that the Trim-NHL protein Mei-P26 restricts growth and proliferation in the ovarian stem cell lineage. In mei-P26 mutants transit amplifying cells are larger and proliferate indefinitely leading to the formation of an ovarian tumour. In addition, mei-P26 regulates nucleolar size and can induce differentiation in Drosophila neuroblasts, suggesting that these genes act through the same pathway. They also show Mei-P26 binds to Argonaute-1, a component of the RISC complex, and they show that Mei-P26 acts by inhibiting the microRNA pathway. This work establishes Trim-NHL proteins as regulators of stem cell proliferation. This paper shows that the Trim-NHL protein Mei-P26 restricts growth and proliferation in the ovarian stem cell lineage. In mei-P26 mutants, transit-amplifying cells are larger and proliferate indefinitely, leading to the formation of an ovarian tumour. Drosophila neuroblasts1 and ovarian stem cells2,3 are well characterized models for stem cell biology. In both cell types, one daughter cell self-renews continuously while the other undergoes a limited number of divisions, stops to proliferate mitotically and differentiates. Whereas neuroblasts segregate the Trim–NHL (tripartite motif and Ncl-1, HT2A and Lin-41 domain)-containing protein Brain tumour (Brat) into one of the two daughter cells4,5,6, ovarian stem cells are regulated by an extracellular signal from the surrounding stem cell niche. After division, one daughter cell looses niche contact. It undergoes 4 transit-amplifying divisions to form a cyst of 16 interconnected cells that reduce their rate of growth and stop to proliferate mitotically. Here we show that the Trim–NHL protein Mei-P26 (refs 7, 8) restricts growth and proliferation in the ovarian stem cell lineage. Mei-P26 expression is low in stem cells but is strongly induced in 16-cell cysts. In mei-P26 mutants, transit-amplifying cells are larger and proliferate indefinitely leading to the formation of an ovarian tumour. Like brat, mei-P26 regulates nucleolar size and can induce differentiation in Drosophila neuroblasts, suggesting that these genes act through the same pathway. We identify Argonaute-1, a component of the RISC complex, as a common binding partner of Brat and Mei-P26, and show that Mei-P26 acts by inhibiting the microRNA pathway. Mei-P26 and Brat have a similar domain composition that is also found in other tumour suppressors and might be a defining property of a new family of microRNA regulators that act specifically in stem cell lineages."

Protection of telomeres 1 (Pot1) binds to the telomeric G-rich overhang, thereby protecting telomeres and regulating telomerase.

Tpz1 binds to Ccq1 and the previously undiscovered protein Poz1 (Pot1-associated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe ), which protect telomeres redundantly and regulate telomerase in positive and negative manners, respectively. Thus, the Pot1-Tpz1 complex accomplishes its functions by recruiting effector molecules Ccq1 and Poz1. Moreover, Poz1 bridges Pot1-Tpz1 and Taz1-Rap1, thereby connecting the single-stranded and double-stranded telomeric DNA regions. Such molecular architectures are similar to those of mammalian shelterin, indicating that the overall DNA-protein architecture is conserved across evolution."

The effect was independent of IGF binding, and was mediated by canonical Wnt signalling. IGFBP-4 physically interacted with a Wnt receptor Frizzled 8 (Frz8) and a Wnt co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and inhibited Wnt3A binding to Frz8 and LRP6. This paper provides the first molecular link between IGF signalling and Wnt signalling. The research could thus pave the way towards understanding how anomalies in this process give rise to congenital heart defects and could potentially yield new strategies to repair tissue damaged by heart attacks.

Although some of the actions of IGFBPs have been reported to be independent of IGFs, the precise mechanisms of IGF-independent actions of IGFBPs are largely unknown1,2. Here we report a previously unknown function for IGFBP-4 as a cardiogenic growth factor. IGFBP-4 enhanced cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro, and knockdown of Igfbp4 attenuated cardiomyogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The cardiogenic effect of IGFBP-4 was independent of its IGF-binding activity but was mediated by the inhibitory effect on canonical Wnt signalling. IGFBP-4 physically interacted with a Wnt receptor, Frizzled 8 (Frz8), and a Wnt co-receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and inhibited the binding of Wnt3A to Frz8 and LRP6. Although IGF-independent, the cardiogenic effect of IGFBP-4 was attenuated by IGFs through IGFBP-4 sequestration. IGFBP-4 is therefore an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signalling required for cardiogenesis and provides a molecular link between IGF signalling and Wnt signalling."

Our recent study showed that ITC binding to intracellular proteins may be an important initiating event for the induction of apoptosis. However, the specific protein target(s) and molecular mechanisms were not identified. In this study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of human lung cancer A549 cells treated with radiolabeled PEITC and SFN revealed that tubulin may be a major in vivo binding target for ITC. We examined whether binding to tubulin by ITCs could lead to cell growth arrest. The proliferation of A549 cells was significantly reduced by ITCs, with relative activities of BITC > PEITC > SFN. All three ITCs also induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis with the same order of activity. We found that ITCs disrupted microtubule polymerization in vitro and in vivo with the same order of potency. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that cysteines in tubulin were covalently modified by ITCs. Ellman assay results indicated that the modification levels follow the same order, BITC > PEITC > SFN.

Naturally occurring ITCs found in cruciferous vegetables, including benzyl-ITC (BITC), phenethyl-ITC (PEITC), and sulforaphane (SFN) (Fig. 1A), have demonstrated cancer preventive activity in animals, and increased dietary intake of ITCs has been shown to be associated with a reduced cancer risk in humans (1WHO (2004) IARC Handbook on Cancer Prevention, Vol. 9, pp. 43-171, Lyon, FranceGoogle Scholar).

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4632-4639PubMed Google Scholar). As electrophiles, ITCs readily form conjugates with thiols, including the thiols in GSH and cellular proteins; this conjugation reaction is reversible (5Jiao D. Conaway C.C. Wang M.H. Yang C.S. Koehl W. Chung F.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In fact, the facile reaction between ITCs and cellular thiols is a driving force for enriching intracellular ITC levels up to millimolar levels (4Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4632-4639PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown, using 14C-PEITC and 14C-SFN, that the initial conjugation predominantly occurs with cellular GSH, but with increasing time, protein binding gradually becomes the major reaction, at least in part because of dissociation of ITC from ITC-GSH conjugates (6Mi L. Wang X. Govind G. Hood B.L. Veenstra T.D. Conrads T.P. Saha D.T. Goldman R. Chung F.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6409-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Eventually, proteins are the major binding sites of ITCs inside cells; for example, PEITC-protein conjugates account for 87% of total cellular uptake after 4 h of treatment. Most importantly, the time course of this protein binding correlated well with the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis, providing preliminary evidence suggesting that modification of cellular proteins via direct covalent binding to ITCs may be an early event for apoptosis induction. These results prompted us to identify which specific proteins are ITC binding targets in vivo, to determine how these proteins interact with ITCs, and to begin characterizing the functional consequences of these reactions. The studies described here are important because they not only define the chemical basis of ITC-induced cell growth inhibition, they also identify structural information that will enable the rational design of new, more specific and more potent ITC-related compounds for cancer prevention and treatment studies. Here we report that tubulin was identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as a potential protein target of ITCs. Tubulin-containing microtubules form one of three main cytoskeletons in eukaryotic cells and play a pivotal role in a variety of cellular processes, involving cell division, motility, and intracellular trafficking (7Nogales E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 277-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The dynamics of α- and β-tubulin polymerization and depolymerization, from heterodimers, is required to form mitotic spindles, which are needed to segregate replicated chromosomes to the two daughter cells. Thus, anti-microtubule or anti-mitosis drugs have gained much attention in anti-cancer drug discovery efforts (8Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the role of tubulin binding in cell growth arrest effects by BITC, PEITC, and SFN. Cells and Chemicals—The human lung cancer cell line A549 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. SFN was provided by Dr. Stephen Hecht (University of Minnesota). 14C-SFN (50 mCi/mmol) was a gift from Dr. Shantu Amin (Pennsylvania State University, Hershey). 14C-PEITC (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Pure (>99%) porcine tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Boulder, CO). Sequencing-grade trypsin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). PEITC, BITC, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), N-methyl phenethylamine (NMPEA), vinblastine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and all other reagents were the highest grade available from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell growth curves were measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), assay using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well (200 μl). Twenty four hours after plating, cells were treated with different doses of each ITC for 24 h. Then 20 μl of the MTS solution was added. After 2 h, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a Synergy HT fluorescent microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The rate of growth inhibition was calculated based on the control wells, which were treated with vehicle only (0.1% v/v DMSO) and taken as 100% growth, and wells with cell-free medium were taken as base line. The data are presented as the average of triplicate wells. NMPEA, a PEITC structural analog, was used as an inhibition negative control. Cell Staining for Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were treated with 10 μm BITC, 10 μm PEITC, 10 and 30 μm SFN for up to 24 h. After the ITCs were added to the media, aliquots of cells were taken every 4 h for 24 h and fixed with ice-cold 80% ethanol, treated with 500 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma), and subsequently stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma). Cell Staining for Mitosis Marker—Cells were fixed and stained according to a modified protocol (9Widrow R.J. Laird C.D. Cytometry. 2000; 39: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, after being fixed in 80% ice-cold ethanol for 2 h at -20 °C, cells were washed once with 1% BSA in PBS, permeated in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. After blocking with PBS containing 1% BSA, 10% normal goat serum on ice for 1 h, 5 μg of anti-phosphorylated histone H3 antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Upstate Biotechnology) was added to each sample. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C, then washed twice with 5 ml of 1% BSA in PBS and resuspended in 180 μl of PBS containing 1% BSA, 10% normal goat serum. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) and PI were added (7 and 2 μg per sample, respectively). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS, cells were centrifuged and treated with 500 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min. Flow Cytometry—Cell cycle distributions were measured by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was done on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and PI were excited with a 488 nm laser, and data were collected through 530- and 630-nm bandpass filters, respectively. Caspase-3 Activity—The assay was performed according to assay kit manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were treated with 10 μm BITC, 10 μm PEITC, 10 and 30 μm SFN for 24 h. Cells were harvested at 4-h intervals by scraping, and lysed by freezing and thawing three times in 100 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.4). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Ten μl of cell lysate supernatant was mixed with 70 μl of assay buffer and 20 μl of 50 μm Ac-DEVD-rhodamine 110 (R110) substrate (Roche Applied Science). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h. The release of rhodamine from the substrate was monitored with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 528 nm every 10 min with a Synergy HT fluorescent microplate reader. The unit of activity for caspases-3 is expressed as nanomoles of R110 released per min per mg of protein. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The procedures used were performed according to established protocols (10Simpson R.J. Proteins and Proteomics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 143-218Google Scholar). Cells at 50% confluency were treated with 30 μm 14C-PEITC or 14C-SFN for 1 h. Cells were then lysed in 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 1% ASB-14, 0.2% carrier ampholytes 4–7, 40 mm Tris, 0.0002% bromphenol blue, 1× protease inhibitor mix (GE Healthcare) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min to remove the insoluble matter. The supernatant, concentration adjusted to 0.5 mg of protein in 450 μl, was applied to an IPG drystrip of 24 cm at pH 4–7 (Bio-Rad). After 12 h of in-gel rehydration at 50 V, isoelectric focusing was performed in isoelectric focusing cells (Amersham Biosciences) with the following voltage gradients: (i) 0–500-V gradient in 1 h; (ii) 500–10,000-V gradient in 8 h; and (iii) 10,000-V constant until 80,000 V-h. IPG strips were equilibrated in 50 mm BisTris-Cl, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 6.5. Each strip was loaded on top of a 5–20% gradient BisTris SDS-polyacrylamide gel slab (20 × 26 cm, 1 mm thick), and electrophoresis was performed in 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm BisTris, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, at a constant power of 30 watts for 30 min and 100 watts for 6 h or until the dye front reached the gel bottom. The proteins were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (11Candiano G. Bruschi M. Musante L. Santucci L. Ghiggeri G.M. Carnemolla B. Orecchia P. Zardi L. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), and proteome images were acquired by an Expression 1680 flatbed scanner (Epson). The radioactivity images of gels were obtained by exposing air-dried gels to BioMax MR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for up to 2 months at -80 °C. Tubulin in Vitro Polymerization Assay—Purified tubulin was dissolved in the general tubulin buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm GTP, pH 6.9). The tubulin solution (3.0 mg/ml) was then incubated with 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm BITC, PEITC, and SFN for 10 min on ice. The polymerization was initiated, and the measurement of the absorbance at 340 nm began when the 96-well plate was put into a pre-warmed (37 °C) Synergy HT fluorescent microplate reader. The measurements took 1 h. Tubulin of the same concentration was treated with vehicle (DMSO) and 1 μm vinblastine as negative and positive controls for the polymerization inhibition assay. NMPEA was also used as a negative control. Tubulin in Vivo Polymerization Assay by Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The assay was performed according to a published method (12Mi L. Fischer S. Chung B. Sundelacruz S. Harden J.L. Biomacromolecules. 2006; 7: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 104 cells were cultured on microscope cover glass (12 mm diameter; Fisher) placed in individual wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate (BD Biosciences) for 24 h before being treated with 5 or 10 μm BITC, PEITC, and SFN for 30 min and 1, 2, 4, and 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed sequentially with 3% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10 min) and 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (20 min), quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, and permeabilized for 30 min with 1% BSA, 0.075% saponin in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-human tubulin IgG1 (1:400; Sigma, clone DM1A), rinsed three times with 0.1% BSA, 0.075% saponin in PBS, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:800; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Once the labeling was complete, the cover glasses were rinsed twice with PBS and mounted onto microscope slides with a small drop of ProLong AntiFade reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). The samples were viewed, and images were taken with a Fluoview-FV300 Laser Scanning Confocal System (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Detection of in Vitro Adduct between Tubulin and ITCs—Purified porcine tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was dissolved in PBS buffer at 0.5 mg/ml. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 60 min in the presence of 100 μm BITC, PEITC, and SFN, or with same volume of carrier solvent DMSO (untreated). The protein was purified by SDS-PAGE after the reactions. Gel slices from the ∼50-kDa migration position were sent for mass spectrometry analysis. Detection of in Vivo Adduct between Tubulin and BITC—A549 cells were treated with 20 μm BITC for 1 h. Treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 20 min before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed first by RIPA buffer (once) and then by water (twice) and finally resuspended in 200 μl of water. The resuspension mixture was incubated with DNase I (0.5 μg, Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature before being centrifuged at 300 × g through a 20% sucrose cushion. The recovered pellet was dissolved in 2% SDS and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel slices at ∼50 kDa were sent for mass spectrometry analysis. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein spots of interest from the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments were analyzed by in-gel digestion and nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography (nanoRPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as described (13Conrads T.P. Tocci G.M. Hood B.L. Zhang C.O. Guo L. Koch K.R. Michejda C.J. Veenstra T.D. Keay S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 49: 37836-37843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of the products formed from the ITC reaction with tubulin was carried out as follows. An aliquot of tubulin was mixed with an equal volume of 100 mm NH4HCO3, digested with 2 μg of trypsin at 37 °C for 2 h, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid, and desalted by C-18 Zip-Tip microcolumns (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Samples were lyophilized, reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) MS and nanoRPLC-MS/MS as described previously (4Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4632-4639PubMed Google Scholar, 13Conrads T.P. Tocci G.M. Hood B.L. Zhang C.O. Guo L. Koch K.R. Michejda C.J. Veenstra T.D. Keay S.K. J. Biol.

Proteomic. 2004; 4: 3401-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tandem MS spectra from the nanoRPLC-MS/MS analysis were compared with entries in the UniProt porcine proteomic data base from the European Bioinformatics Institute using SEQUEST software (ThermoElectron) with dynamic modifications of 149, 163, and 177 on cysteine. Measurement of Free Thiols in Tubulin—The number of free thiols in tubulin was determined by Ellman assay (15Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Lyophilized porcine tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. An aliquot of tubulin solution (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated with 80 and 160 μm BITC, PEITC, and SFN (the ratios of compound to tubulin cysteine were 1:1 and 2:1, respectively) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. After incubation, tubulin samples were diluted in 4 m guanidine HCl and 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured by a UV-1700 UV/visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). A standard curve was generated using N-acetylcysteine (Sigma). The calculated extinction coefficient for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate dianion at 412 nm was 14,300 m-1 cm-1. Structural Characterization of Tubulin Treated with ITCs—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) over the wavelength range of 250 to 190 nm using a 10-mm path length cell and then averaged over three scans. Spectra were recorded on samples containing 2 μm tubulin in 20 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8, before and after addition of 40 μm BITC (the ratio of BITC to tubulin cysteine was 2:1). The fraction of helices was estimated from ellipticity at 222 nm using an empirical method (16Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were performed on a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) equipped with the peltier temperature control. The change of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of 2 μm tubulin in PIPES buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) by compounds was monitored with λ(excitation) = 295 nm and λ(emission) = 329 nm. To avoid photo-bleaching of the samples, the shutter was open for 5 s per min for 35 min. The data were analyzed using software Felix32 based on the mono-exponential decay model. Western Blotting—A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of BITC, PEITC, and SFN for 4 h. Treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer on ice for 20 min before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as the soluble fraction, whereas the pellets were re-dissolved in SDS buffer (65 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and used as the insoluble fraction. Twenty micrograms of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed by incubating the membrane with a mouse α-tubulin antibody (1:2000, clone DM1A; Sigma) and a β-tubulin antibody (1:1000, clone TUB2.1; Sigma) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000; GE Healthcare). The targeted proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). β-Actin, detected by an antibody (1:10,000, clone AC-74; Sigma), was used as a loading control in this experiment. BITC, PEITC, and SFN Inhibited Cell Proliferation—Incubation of A549 cells with BITC, PEITC, and SFN for 24 h at a concentration range of 1–100 μm caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). The IC50 values were 13.5, 18.3, and 43.0 μm for BITC, PEITC, and SFN, respectively. In contrast, NMPEA, a structural analog of PEITC without the ITC functionality, did not significantly inhibit cell growth except at the highest concentration tested. These results indicate that the ITC functional group is essential for inhibiting cell growth, and the alkyl or arylalkyl side chain moiety dictates the inhibitory potency. These findings are consistent with the cell morphology (Fig. 1C). Significant changes in cell morphology were observed after treatment with BITC and PEITC at 10 μm. At this concentration, however, SFN caused little change. Similar effects were only observed with SFN only at 30 μm or greater concentrations. It should be noted that 10 μm of PEITC is a clinically attainable concentration. 4L. Liebes, S. S. Hecht, and F.-L. Chung, unpublished results. BITC, PEITC, and SFN Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis—We next examined the effects of ITCs on cell cycle regulation using flow cytometry. When cells were treated with 10 μm BITC and 10 μm PEITC for 24 h, the proportions of cells residing in the G1 phase decreased from 41 to 13 and 25%, respectively (Fig. 2A); the proportions of cells residing in the S phase decreased from 42 to 23 and 30%, and the cell populations in the G2/M phase markedly increased from 10 to 63 and 48%, respectively. After 12-h treatments, BITC caused a higher percentage of cells to be arrested in G2/M than PEITC. Unlike BITC and PEITC, the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase was essentially unaffected with 10 μm SFN treatment, although the percentage of cells in S phase was decreased, and the percentage of cells arrested in G1 phase increased to 64% in the G1 phase after 24 h of treatment compared with 41% at the start. Interestingly, 30 μm SFN increased the G2/M arrest population to 57%. To determine whether the G2/M arrest occurs in the G2 or mitosis phase, we used immunofluorescence to detect phosphorylated histone 3, a mitotic biomarker. Fig. 2B shows the sorting results of cells treated with ITCs. Gate 3 is the assay positive zone, containing cells with duplicated DNA and high levels of phosphor-H3. Compared with 1.4% of mitotic cells in the control sample (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO), BITC and PEITC at 10 μm induced increases to 10.1 and 13.2% in Gate 3, respectively, after 24 h of treatment. In contrast, 10 μm SFN did not significantly increase the Gate 3 population (only 1.9%) and had no effect on the condensed cell population in the diploid DNA region (Gate 1). However, 30 μm SFN caused 14.5% of the cells to be arrested in the mitotic phase. These results are consistent with the cell cycle findings shown in Fig. 2A and clearly show that ITC treatments caused cells to arrest in the mitotic phase. To examine whether apoptosis could be involved in the cell morphology changes observed (Fig. 1C) and the reduced numbers of viable cells measured after ITC treatments, two different apoptosis assays were used. In the first assay, Fig. 2C (left), we followed the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 fraction for 72 h of ITC treatment, 48 h longer than needed to detect the mitotic arrest with 10 μm BITC or PEITC, or 30 μm SFN. Each of these treatments caused a sharp increase in the sub-G1 population. These results indicate that apoptosis induced by ITCs is likely a consequence of the mitotic arrest. In contrast, treatment with 10 μm SFN did not show these effects. Apoptosis, as measured by caspases-3 activity, also increased dramatically only when cells were arrested in mitosis (Fig. 2C, right). The relative potency of the ITC compounds in both of these apoptosis assays, BITC > PEITC > SFN, are the same as found for the cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest assays. Tubulin Is a Major ITC Binding Target in Vivo—Next, we identified the protein targets of ITCs. For this we used proteins extracted from A549 cells treated with 14C-PEITC and 14C-SFN and then analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. After superimposing the colloidal Coomassie Blue protein staining pattern with the pattern of radioactivity, obtained from x-ray films, it was clear that only a few proteins contained radioactivity, presumably resulting from selective binding with PEITC or SFN, via thiocarbamation (Fig. 3). The MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis of proteins extracted from the major radioactive-containing gel spots identified several proteins, including multiple human tubulin isoforms (Table 1). These results suggest that both α- and β-tubulins are potential ITC targets and thus carriers of radioactivity, i.e. they may have been modified covalently by the radioactive ITCs. Similar, but not identical, results were obtained with both ITCs.TABLE 1Peptides of tubulin were identified by mass spectrometry through radiolabeled-two-dimensional gel electr"
https://openalex.org/W1986618045,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides most cellular energy. As part of this process, cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to the generation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. During acute inflammation, as in sepsis, aerobic metabolism appears to malfunction and switches to glycolytic energy production. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) has been shown to play a central role in inflammation. We hypothesized that TNFα-triggered cell signaling targets CcO, which is a central enzyme of the aerobic energy metabolism and can be regulated through phosphorylation. Using total bovine and murine hepatocyte homogenates TNFα treatment led to an ∼60% reduction in CcO activity. In contrast, there was no direct effect of TNFα on CcO activity using isolated mitochondria and purified CcO, indicating that a TNFα-triggered intracellular signaling cascade mediates CcO inhibition. CcO isolated after TNFα treatment showed tyrosine phosphorylation on CcO catalytic subunit I and was ∼50 and 70% inhibited at high cytochrome c concentrations in the presence of allosteric activator ADP and inhibitor ATP, respectively. CcO phosphorylation occurs on tyrosine 304 as demonstrated with a phosphoepitope-specific antibody. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in H2.35 cells in response to TNFα. Concomitantly, cellular ATP was more than 35 and 64% reduced in murine hepatocytes and H2.35 cells. We postulate that an important contributor in TNFα-mediated pathologies, such as sepsis, is energy paucity, which parallels the poor tissue oxygen extraction and utilization found in such patients.

TNFα is associated with various diseases such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, and hepatic failure and initiates its biological effects by binding to high affinity cell surface receptors (TNF receptor types 1 and 2) (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar). Receptor ligation in different types of cells is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is well documented that TNFα increases ROS in the mitochondria and that it does so in the cytoplasm in a NADPH-dependent fashion. Mitochondria are considered an early target in TNFα-induced cytotoxicity, because they appear swollen with a reduction in cristae membrane structure in the early course of endotoxinemia and sepsis (2Brealey D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that early mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system play a pivotal role in impaired O2 utilization during inflammatory processes (2Brealey D. Brand M. Hargreaves I. Heales S. Land J. Smolenski R. Davies N.A. Cooper C.E. Singer M. Lancet. 2002; 360: 219-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 4Singer M. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 33: S539-S542Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). During endotoxinemia and sepsis, glycolytic ATP production was increased (5Berg S. Sappington P.L. Guzik L.J. Delude R.L. Fink M.P. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 31: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Apparently, OxPhos was inhibited, although increased tissue oxygen levels suggest cellular availability of O2 (6Rosser D.M. Stidwill R.P. Jacobson D. Singer M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1995; 79: 1878-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating a decrease of oxygen utilization (7Kreymann G. Grosser S. Buggisch P. Gottschall C. Matthaei S. Greten H. Crit.

Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The formation of the cellular energy carrier ATP is the result of both anaerobic and aerobic processes. Anaerobic ATP generation is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase, and GTP is produced by succinyl coenzyme A synthetase. However, ∼95% of cellular energy is generated through the aerobic pathway, the mitochondrial OxPhos process that includes an elaborate electron transport chain (ETC), in which O2 functions as the terminal electron acceptor and is reduced to water. The flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the ETC is coupled to the pumping of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which creates a transmembrane electrochemical potential (ΔΨm). Through this process, a proton-motive force is generated that is utilized by ATP synthase to produce ATP from ADP and phosphate. As a byproduct of the OxPhos process, an estimated 1-2% of cellular O2 is converted into superoxide anions (O2⋅¯) (9Richter C. Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). OxPhos is regulated at various sites by numerous factors, including the ATP/ADP ratio (10Napiwotzki J. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kadenbach B. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), PO2, and the amount of ROS and nitric oxide (11Palacios-Callender M. Quintero M. Hollis V.S.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO, complex IV) is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain. CcO accepts electrons from cytochrome c and transfers them to molecular oxygen, which is reduced to water. At the same time protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane leading to the generation of the mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨm. CcO exhibits the three characteristic regulatory means known to act on key metabolic enzymes: isoform expression, allosteric control, and reversible phosphorylation. There are three liver and heart type isoform pairs of subunits VIa, VIIa, and VIII (reviewed in Ref. 14Hüttemann M. Lee I. Liu J. Grossman L.I. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5737-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in addition to a lung-specific isoform of CcO subunit IV, a testes-specific isoform of subunit VIb, and a third isoform of subunit VIII (15Hüttemann M. Kadenbach B. Grossman L.I. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Hüttemann M. Jaradat S. Grossman L.I. Mol. Reprod.

Arnold S. Hüttemann M. Lee I. Kadenbach B. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); and there is clear evidence that CcO can be phosphorylated (19Bender E.

We have recently shown that CcO is targeted for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation on tyrosine 304 of catalytic subunit I in vivo, which leads to strong enzyme inhibition (23Lee I. Salomon A.R. Ficarro S. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6094-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition the substrate of CcO, cytochrome c, can be phosphorylated in vivo on tyrosine 97, which also leads to an inhibition of the reaction with CcO (24Lee I. Salomon A.R. Yu K. Doan J.W. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9121-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The complex regulation of CcO suggests an important role for CcO in the overall regulation of aerobic energy production. This hypothesis is supported by several recent studies suggesting that metabolic flux in the ETC is tightly coupled to CcO under physiological conditions, which assigns the role of the rate-limiting step to CcO (25Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol.

We hypothesized that TNFα mediates an early inhibitory effect on the OxPhos system and specifically inhibits CcO, because oxygen utilization is impaired in conditions involving TNFα. We predicted that CcO inhibition in turn leads to a decrease in ΔΨm and, consequently, reduced ATP levels. We here investigated the effect of TNFα on mammalian liver CcO in cell homogenates, isolated mitochondria, and purified CcO. We found that CcO activity was consistently reduced in bovine and murine liver cell homogenates in response to TNFα, whereas CcO activity of isolated mitochondria and isolated CcO in response to TNFα treatment did not change. This indicates that an intact cellular infrastructure is required for signal transduction from the cell surface, triggered by TNFα receptors, to the mitochondria and subsequently to CcO as a terminal target of this pathway. In addition, we show that TNFα treatment leads to reduced ΔΨm and ATP levels. We propose a model in which TNFα-mediated CcO inhibition leads to tissue dysoxia, which suppresses aerobic ATP production and causes a shift to the glycolytic pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Bovine and Murine Mitochondria—The chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Fresh C57BL/6 mouse liver tissue (2 g) was chopped into small pieces using scissors, whereas frozen cow liver tissue (200 g) was passed through a meat grinder, leaving most cells intact. The samples were supplemented with five volumes of buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm KF, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF) and incubated for 5 min in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml TNFα at room temperature. Mitochondria were isolated under conditions that preserve the physiological phosphorylation status as previously described (23Lee I. Salomon A.R. Ficarro S. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6094-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24Lee I. Salomon A.R. Yu K. Doan J.W. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9121-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, using 200 g of tissue, mitochondria were isolated at 4 °C, and buffer A was supplemented with unspecific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate (1 mm) for all subsequent steps. The samples were further homogenized with a commercial blender using a 5-fold volume of buffer A. After centrifugation (650 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was collected through cheesecloth. The pellet was homogenized and centrifuged to increase mitochondrial yield. Combined supernatants were centrifuged (16,300 × g, 20 min), and mitochondria were resuspended in 200 ml of buffer A using a Teflon homogenizer (150 rpm, four strokes), and buffer A was added to a volume of 2.5 L and centrifuged at low speed (370 × g for 5 min) to remove contaminants. The supernatant was centrifuged (16,300 × g, 20 min) to collect mitochondria, which were washed one more time by resuspension and centrifugation as described above. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in buffer A and adjusted to a final protein concentration of 20 mg/ml.Isolation of CcO—CcO isolation starting from purified cow liver mitochondria was performed as previously described (23Lee I. Salomon A.R. Ficarro S. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6094-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Per 1 ml of isolated mitochondria, 250 μl of buffer B (1 m KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm KF, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate) were added. Mitochondrial proteins were solubilized by dropwise addition of 1 ml of 20% Triton X-114/1 g of mitochondrial protein under stirring. The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 195,000 × g and resuspended with a Teflon glass homogenizer after addition of 100 ml of buffer C (200 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm KF, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate). The sample was centrifuged for 25 min at 195,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of buffer D (200 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 5% Triton X-100, 10 mm KF, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) as above, followed by centrifugation (20 min at 195,000 × g). The CcO-containing supernatant was collected, and CcO was further extracted from the pellet by repeating the previous step two times. The supernatants were combined and diluted with 3 volumes of dH2O. The sample was applied to 300 ml of DEAE Sephacel (fast flow; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer E (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was washed with 800 ml of buffer E, and the proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 50 mm to 1 m KH2PO4 (pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100). Eluted fractions were analyzed by spectrophotometer, and CcO-containing fractions were combined. Sodium cholate was added (1% w/v) with stirring and pH was adjusted to pH 7.4. Fractionations were performed with 28% ammonium sulfate for 14 h, 37% for 1 h, and 45% for 5 min; the proteins were collected after each step by centrifugation for 15 min at 27,000 × g. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA and stored at -80 °C after spectrophotometric determination of CcO concentration (29von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1972; 24: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and purity (30Kadenbach B. Stroh A. Ungibauer M. Kuhn-Nentwig L. Buge U. Jarausch J.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 6329-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CcO was dialyzed in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP and a 40-fold molar excess of cardiolipin in 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 1% Tween 20, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm KF. CcO activity was analyzed in a closed 200-μl chamber equipped with a micro Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygraph system; Hansatech). Measurements were performed in the presence of 5 mm ADP, an allosteric activator of CcO, or 5 mm ATP, an allosteric inhibitor of CcO, after incubation with an ATP regenerating system as described (23Lee I. Salomon A.R. Ficarro S. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6094-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out with 2 μm CcO at 25 °C in the presence of 20 mm ascorbate and increasing amounts of cow heart cytochrome c from 0-40 μm. Oxygen consumption was recorded on a computer and analyzed with the Oxygraph plus software. Turnover number is defined as oxygen consumed (μmol)/(s·CcO (μmol)). Mitochondria, tissue, and cell homogenates were incubated in the presence or absence of TNFα in incubation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm KF, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μm oligomycin). CcO activity measurements were performed in 10 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4), 40 mm KCl, 1% Tween 20, 2 μm oligomycin, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm KF, 2 mm EGTA using the same experimental setup as above after washing, sonication, and centrifugation of the samples as described (23Lee I.

Murine hepatocytes were freshly obtained from mice. Protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).Cell Culture—H2.35 murine hepatocytes were grown in modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1000 units penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For CcO activity measurements, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by scraping in the presence of 10 ml of PBS, collected by centrifugation (50 × g, 5 min), and washed once more with PBS.Antibody Production—Customized rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against the phosphotyrosine 304 epitope of CcO subunit I by Abgent (San Diego, CA). Two rabbits were immunized with the cysteine-conjugated synthetic peptide GMDVDTRApYFTSAC according to the vendor's protocol. Antibodies recognizing the unphosphorylated peptide were removed by affinity absorption against column-bound cysteine-conjugated synthetic GMDVDTRAYFTSAC peptide. Antibodies were tested on the synthetic phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides, on Tyr304-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CcO (23Lee I. Salomon A.R. Ficarro S. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Grossman L.I. Hüttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6094-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and phosphotyrosine-conjugated BSA by Western analysis, revealing a specific signal for the phosphorylated peptide and Tyr304-phosphorylated CcO subunit I in the expected size.Western Analysis—SDS-PAGE with purified liver CcO or isolated mitochondria was carried out as described previously (33Kadenbach B. Jarausch J. Hartmann R. Merle P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Protein transfer time on a nitrocellulose membrane was 60 min to facilitate efficient transfer of larger CcO subunits. Antiphosphoserine and -threonine antibodies were sets of four (1C8, 4A3, 4A9, and 16B4) and three (1E11, 4D11, and 14B3) individual monoclonal antibodies (Calbiochem), respectively, whereas a single antiphosphotyrosine antibody was used (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology). CcO subunit IV isoform 1 was detected with a monoclonal antibody (10G8; Molecular Probes). In addition, a customized CcO subunit I phosphotyrosine 304 specific antibody was used. Western analysis was performed with a 1:5000 dilution of primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000 dilution; GE Healthcare), and signals were detected using the ECL plus Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare).In-gel Tryptic Digest and Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—The tryptic digest was performed as described (34Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7765) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bands were excised from Coomassie-stained gels, cut into 1-mm cubes, and incubated in 50 μl of acetonitrile (Merck) for 10 min. Acetonitrile was removed, and gel particles were swollen in 150 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol (Merck), 10 mm NH4HCO3 (Merck) and incubated for 1 h at 60 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was replaced by 150 μl of 50 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark with occasional vortexing. The solution was removed, and gel pieces were washed with 150 μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3, which was replaced by acetonitrile to dehydrate gel pieces, which were dried under vacuum. Trypsin (bovine, sequencing grade; Roche Applied Science) was diluted in digestion buffer (10 mm NH4HCO3) to 0.1 μg/μl. Gel pieces were covered with digestion buffer and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a tube, and gel pieces were incubated for 10 min with occasional mixing in 50 μl of elution buffer (50% CH3CN/50% HCOOH; Merck). Elution was repeated two more times, and supernatants were combined and dried under vacuum. For further cleavage of peptides, tryptic fragments were incubated with 10% cyanogen bromide (w/v) in 100 μl of 70% formic acid (Merck) overnight at room temperature in the dark. 300 μl of dH2O were added, and the samples were dried under vacuum. The peptide mixture was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/dH2O (Applied Biosystems) and separated by reversed phase HPLC on a Phenomenex 150 × 1-mm column with a flow rate of 0.16 ml/min. The gradient used was 0-60% buffer B in 60 min, 80% buffer B in 70 min (buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/dH2O; buffer B, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis of the tryptic/CNBr HPLC peaks was performed on a Bruker mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. For mass fingerprint analysis, each raw spectrum was opened in Bruker Xtof (version 5.1.5) applying advanced baseline correction and noise removal. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with calibration II standard (Bruker Daltonics), nine peptides (m/z 757.3992, 1046.5418, 1296.6848, 1347.7354, 1619.8223, 1758.9326, 2093.0862, 2465.1983, and 3174.4710; quadratic mode). Filter peak list for monoisotopic masses only was enabled; the peak detection threshold was manually adjusted above background. Peak lists were analyzed with the Mascot public interface and searched against NCBInr data base (parameters: trypsin and CNBr were selected, with one potential missed cleavage; Mascot mass fingerprint matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization was selected as the instrument type, oxidized methionine was selected as variable modification, and carbamidomethylated cysteine was selected as fixed modification; MH+ monoisotopic masses and peptide tolerance were 100 ppm; taxonomy field was set as “other mammalia,” because of the bovine origin of the samples). The results were scored using probability-based Mowse score (protein score) is defined as 10 × log(p), where p is the probability that the observed match is a random event. Only significant protein scores were chosen.ATP Assay—Fresh mouse liver tissue (50 mg) was partially disrupted in 800 μl of incubation buffer with a Teflon microtube pestle by applying 10 strokes. The suspension was incubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml TNFα. H2.35 cells were collected by scraping after applying similar incubation conditions and immediately stored in aliquots at -80 °C until measurement. ATP was released using the boiling method, by adding 300 μl of boiling buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.75, 4 mm EDTA) and immediate transfer to a boiling water bath for 2 min. The samples were put on ice and sonicated. The samples were diluted 300-fold, and 50 μl were utilized to determine the ATP concentration using the ATP biolumescence assay kit HS II (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The experiments were performed in triplicates, and the data were standardized to the protein concentration using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential ΔΨm—Cultured H2.35 cells were grown to 75% confluence. To assess relative changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), the cells were collected after trypsinization and washed once with PBS. The cells were incubated for 5 min with 20 ng/ml TNFα or 10 μm valinomycin in PBS at 37 °C. After incubation the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 1 μm JC-1 (Molecular Probes). JC-1 is able to selectively enter mitochondria, occurs as a monomer at low concentration or at low membrane potential, and emits green fluorescence (35Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). At higher membrane potential JC-1 forms aggregates that show red fluorescence. Mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨm was measured with a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) flow cytometer equipped with a 488-nm argon ion laser, and the data obtained were analyzed with the Cell Quest software. Fluorescence was measured using a 585 ± 42-nm band-pass filter, and 10,000 events were analyzed in each run.RESULTSTNFα Leads to Strong Cytochrome c Oxidase Inhibition in Bovine Hepatocytes—TNFα activates several pathways such as inflammatory, apoptotic, and survival pathways. Several recent studies suggested that TNFα may target mitochondria. However, most of these studies addressed late effects of TNFα, such as increased apoptosis and decreased ETC activity that was observed after 24-48 h (36Zhu J. Liu M. Kennedy R.H. Liu S.J. Cytokine. 2006; 34: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Lopez-Armada M.J. Carames B. Martin M.A. Cillero-Pastor B. Lires-Dean M. Fuentes-Boquete I. Arenas J. Blanco F.J.

TNFα may also exert early effects in the cell at the level of the mitochondrial OxPhos system. Because CcO is the terminal and possibly rate-liming enzyme in the ETC, we investigated the early effect of TNFα on CcO activity. As a model system, we first tested the effect of TNFα on chunky cow liver homogenates. Under those conditions most of the cells present are intact, allowing signal transduction in a physiological cellular context. Both optimal incubation time and the concentration of TNFα were determined in a series of preliminary tests (not shown). Five min of incubation at a concentration of 20 ng/ml TNFα was found to produce a strong and consistent response and was applied during all experiments. CcO activity was measured by adding increasing amounts of substra"

https://openalex.org/W2091994022,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a serious health problem linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. To investigate the biological outcome and therapeutic potential of hepatic fatty acid uptake inhibition, we utilized an adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference technique to knock down the expression of hepatic fatty acid transport protein 5 in vivo prior to or after establishing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice. Using this approach, we demonstrate here the ability to achieve specific, non-toxic, and persistent knockdown of fatty acid transport protein 5 in mouse livers from a single adeno-associated virus injection, resulting in a marked reduction of hepatic dietary fatty acid uptake, reduced caloric uptake, and concomitant protection from diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Importantly, knockdown of fatty acid transport protein 5 was also able to reverse already established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, resulting in significantly improved whole-body glucose homeostasis. Thus, continued activity of hepatic fatty acid transport protein 5 is required to sustain caloric uptake and fatty acid flux into the liver during high fat feeding and may present a novel avenue for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

In obese individuals, chronically elevated serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and high insulin levels lead to both increased FFA uptake by the liver and increased synthesis of lipids, resulting in hepatic triglycerides (TG) accumulation, typically accompanied by hepatic insulin desensitization (1Clark J.M.

Current pharmacological treatment strategies for NAFLD focus principally on increasing hepatic fatty acid oxidation (4Laurin J. Lindor K.D. Crippin J.S. Gossard A. Gores G.J. Ludwig J. Rakela J.

However, none of these treatment methods reduce hepatic uptake of dietary fats, and novel therapeutics that specifically aim at reversing NAFLD in the context of obesity would be highly desirable. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease adeno-associated virus stabilized double-stranded AAV fatty acid transport protein free fatty acid triglycerides short hairpin RNA phosphate-buffered saline viral particles after injection scrambled control high fat normal diet sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c knockout. Based on the premises that obesity-associated NAFLD is primarily driven by the continuous protein-mediated uptake of fatty acids by the liver and that NAFLD is a contributing factor to whole-body insulin desensitization, we argued that blocking proteins responsible for hepatic fatty acid uptake should prevent or reverse hepatic steatosis, thus improving insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Two members of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) family, FATP2 and FATP5, are robustly expressed in liver (6Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and are thought to be involved in the early steps of long-chain fatty acid uptake/activation (7Doege H. Stahl A. Physiol.

We recently demonstrated the importance of FATP5 in hepatic lipid metabolism by showing that deletion of FATP5 partially protected mice from developing high fat diet-induced obesity and improved insulin-sensitivity (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E. Stahl A.

To explore the consequences of hepatic FATP5 ablation in the context of NAFLD for hepatic fatty acid uptake and whole-body lipid fluxes, we took advantage of a recently developed stabilized double-stranded (sds) adeno-associated virus (AAV) 8-mediated delivery method for liver-directed small hairpin (sh) RNA expression (11Grimm D. Streetz K.L. Jopling C.L. Storm T.A. Pandey K. Davis C.R. Marion P. Salazar F. Kay M.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we could achieve specific silencing of endogenous FATP5 in mice after a single delivery of sdsAAV-shRNA expression constructs, resulting in the protection/reversal of NAFLD and hyperglycemia in diet-induced obesity mice. Antibodies and Reagents—BODIPY fatty acid (C1-BODIPY-C12) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [14C]Oleic acid was purchased from ARC, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antisera against the C termini of FATP2, -4, and -5 were raised as described previously (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E.

AAV-shRNA Constructs—Oligonucleotides against FATP5 were designed as suggested (14Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar) and did not share any significant homology with other genes in the mouse genome. All shRNAs used in vitro were expressed from the human H1 promoter (pSUPERIOR-based expression construct; OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). Loop sequence was 5′-TTCAAGAGA-3′. Stabilized double-stranded (sds) AAV vectors for persistent and efficient expression of shRNAs in the liver were derived from elements from AAV serotypes 2, 4, and 8 (11Grimm D. Streetz K.L. Jopling C.L. Storm T.A. Pandey K. Davis C.R. Marion P. Salazar F. Kay M.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Viral particles were generated, purified, and titered as described by Grimm et al. (15Grimm D. Kay M.A. Kleinschmidt J.A. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Uptake Assay in HEK293 Cells—Fatty acid uptake assays were performed as described previously (12Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R.E. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Patel S. Kotler M. Raimondi A.

General Animal Procedures—C57BL/6 or Swiss Webster mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and acclimated for 1 week after arrival before they were used for experiments. Animals were maintained on regular lab chow (5P75, LabDiet, Richmond, IN) or on a special diet (see below), receiving food and water ad libitum, and kept at 22 °C on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. FATP5 knock-out mice were generated and maintained as described previously (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E. Stahl A. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All study groups had comparable initial ages and weights. Intravenous sdsAAV8 deliveries (5 × 1010 or 3 × 1011 viral particles (v.p.), total volume 250 μl in PBS) were performed by tail vein injections using established methods (16Nakai H. Fuess S. Storm T.A. Muramatsu S. Nara Y. Kay M.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For diet studies, separately housed 8-week-old male mice were fed ad libitum a high fat diet containing 60% fat (D12492, Research Diets, NJ) or a low fat diet (D12450) containing 10% fat. Weight was measured weekly, and food intake was measured twice a week. Standard glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests as well as lipid gavages were performed as described previously (17Wu Q. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Doege H. Feingold K.R. Stahl A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3455-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute and the University of California Berkeley Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hepatocyte Preparation—Mouse livers were cannulated through the portal vein and an incision was made in the inferior vena cava. Liver perfusion with digestion and perfusion media and isolation of hepatocytes was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) followed by long-chain fatty acid uptake assays as described (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E. Stahl A. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Tissue Lipid Analysis—Samples from various tissues were powdered in liquid nitrogen, and total lipids were extracted by the method of Folch et al. (18Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total triglycerides were assayed using a colorimetric kit (Sigma Diagnostics). Liver Morphology—Cryosections obtained from livers of FATP knockdown or knock-out animals and the respective controls were stained with either Masson's trichrome reagent or hematoxylin and eosin. Neutral lipid droplets were stained with BODIPY493/503 (Molecular Probes). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of FATP5 knockdown or FATP5 knock-out phenotypes versus scrambled control (SCR) or wild-type controls was done by Student's t test or analysis of variance test as appropriate. S.E. values are shown. p < 0.05 was considered significant. shRNA-mediated Knockdown of Hepatic Fatty Acid Transporters in Vitro—We generated (14Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar) eight FATP5 shRNA expression construct, and an SCR with no complementarities to any known gene sequence in the mouse genome (supplemental Fig. 1) and assessed the impact of the shRNA constructs on FATP expression and FFA uptake by co-transfecting them into HEK293 cells with FATP5 expression plasmids. Two days following transfection, FFA uptake and FATP protein levels were determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorter-based assays (12Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R.E. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Patel S. Kotler M. Raimondi A. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) and immunoblots (Fig. 1B), respectively. Both assays identified two constructs (FATP5-2, FATP5-3) capable of triggering a robust RNA interference effect. We did not observe any effect for the other shRNA constructs or the SCR control when compared with cells transfected with the respective FATP expression vectors only. Specific and Non-toxic Knockdown of Hepatic Fatty Acid Transport Protein 5 in Vivo—To translate our in vitro results to an in vivo system of diet-induced NAFLD, we used optimized viral vehicles (11Grimm D. Streetz K.L. Jopling C.L. Storm T.A. Pandey K. Davis C.R. Marion P. Salazar F. Kay M.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar) to package and express our in vitro validated target sequences for FATP5 and the SCR control, resulting in the sdsAAV vectors sdsAAVFATP5-2, sdsAAVFATP5-3, and sdsAAVSCR. Two different mouse strains, C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster mice, were injected via the tail vein with the different viral constructs at two different concentrations (5 × 1010 and 3 × 1011 v.p.). Four weeks after injection (a.i.), hepatic protein expression of FATP5 was analyzed by Western blotting. FATP5 expression was considerably blunted (>95% inhibition) in the sdsAAVFATP5-2-injected animals, but not in the sdsAAV-FATP5-3-injected animals (Fig. 1C). Clearly, more research is needed to determine the factors that ultimately determine in vivo efficacy of shRNA constructs. The functional construct will be referred to from hereon as “AAVFATP5.” Robust FATP5 knockdown was achieved at the lowest viral dose tested (5 × 1010 v.p.), which is considerably less than in previous studies using 1 × 1012 v.p (11Grimm D. Streetz K.L. Jopling C.L. Storm T.A. Pandey K. Davis C.R. Marion P. Salazar F. Kay M.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Importantly, we did not detect any nonspecific effects of FATP5 knockdown on the expression levels of other liver proteins (Fig. 1C), including the highly related FATP2 and FATP4 (43%/33% identity with FATP2/FATP4). Based on serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels and liver histology, shRNA expression and FATP knockdown caused no hepatotoxicity after viral transduction (data not shown). Thus, using this sdsAAV-based in vivo RNA interference approach, we were able to achieve specific and non-toxic protein knockdown of endogenous FATP5. To quantify the magnitude by which loss of FATP5 would reduce FFA uptake, we performed ex vivo uptake assays with freshly isolated hepatocytes from ad libitum chow-fed mice 4 weeks after viral transduction as described before (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E. Stahl A. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although there was no difference in the fatty acid uptake capacity between hepatocytes from the AAVSCR and PBS group, our experiments demonstrated a robust (40%) reduction in long-chain fatty acid uptake after knockdown of FATP5 (Fig. 1D). The remaining uptake activity either may be due to other hepatic FATPs such as FATP2 and -4 and/or may represent protein-independent uptake. Loss of Hepatic FATPs Redirects Dietary Lipid Fluxes—To characterize changes in the postprandial clearance of lipids in AAVSCR and AAVFATP5 mice, we performed oil gavages containing [14C]oleate tracer after an overnight fast using C57BL/6 mice fed a normal chow 4 weeks a.i. Initial appearance of 14C in serum was comparable among all groups (Fig. 2A), indicative of normal absorption in all animals. However, 14C counts (Fig. 2A) as well as serum TG and FFA (data not shown) were elevated for prolonged periods in the FATP5 knockdown group, hinting at impaired lipid clearance from the circulation, presumably due to loss of hepatic FATP function. Four hours after gavage, we found decreased absorption by the livers of FATP5 knockdown animals with increased lipid deposition in heart, skeletal muscle, and fat (Fig. 2B). These data are consistent with the observed changes of liver total TG content following chronic high fat feeding (see Fig. 4B) and suggest that loss of hepatic FATPs causes a redirection of lipids away from the liver to tissues relying on other FATP paralogues, such as FATP6, -1, and -4. Taken together, these findings strongly support the notion that FATP5 plays a critical role in hepatic fatty acid uptake and in the compartmentalization of postprandial lipids.FIGURE 4Reversal of obesity-induced NAFLD in vivo.

Weight gain and food consumption by FATP5KO and AAVFATP5-injected animals started to deviate significantly from the wild-type and AAVSCR-injected controls 2 weeks a.i. to similar extents. This resulted by the end of the study in a 40% weight reduction and significantly improved serum TG levels for both hypomorphic groups when compared with their respective controls (Fig. 3, A and B). Although livers of PBS- and AAVSCR-injected control mice showed typical characteristics of macrovascular steatosis, both AAVFATP5-injected mice and FATP5KO mice (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1259-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) displayed a significant protection with a marked decrease in lipid infiltration (Fig. 3C) and significant reduction in total liver TG content (AAVSCR, 35.4 ± 1.1 μmol/g; FATP5KO, 21.9 ± 4.2 μmol/g). In summary, these results demonstrate that a single sdsAAV-mediated delivery of shRNA expression constructs results in phenotypes that are highly comparable with that of genetically engineered knock-out animals and that AAV-mediated loss of FATP5 protects animals from the development of diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Knockdown of FATP5 Reverses Hepatic Steatosis—To test the feasibility of hepatic shRNA-mediated FATP knockdown to reverse already established NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed for 6 weeks a HF diet or a nutrient-matched low fat diet (ND) followed by AAVshRNA injection and were then kept on the respective diets for an additional 7 weeks. Mice were injected with either PBS or 5 × 1010 v.p. of AAVSCR or AAVFATP5 to achieve in vivo knockdown. We chose a 6-week pretreatment period as preliminary studies showed that 6 weeks of HF diet feeding induce hepatic steatosis with marked lipid droplet accumulation inside of hepatocytes and a significant increase in liver TG (supplemental Fig. 2). However, even after 13 weeks of HF feeding, liver enzymes remained at normal levels (supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that this model more closely resembles mild forms of NAFLD. AAV-injected and control groups kept on the ND did not show any signs of abnormalities throughout the study (not shown). Although transduction of animals with the AAVSCR control resulted in phenotypes indistinguishable from PBS-injected mice (not shown), we found that the single injection of AAVFATP5 resulted in complete, specific, and persistent ablation of hepatic FATP5 in both HF-fed (Fig. 4A) and ND-fed animals (data not shown). As before, basic liver function was unimpaired by the shRNA-mediated knockdowns as serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels were similar to control animals (supplemental Fig. 3). Importantly, when compared with controls (PBS or AAVSCR injections), livers from AAVFATP5-transduced animals showed a significant improvement of NAFLD symptoms, including normalized morphology lacking signs of macrovesicular steatosis (Masson's trichrome, Fig. 4C), diminished neutral lipid droplet deposition (as assessed by BODIPY493/503 staining, Fig. 4D), and reduced total hepatic TG content (SCR, 80.9 ± 10.1 μmol/g; FATP5, 28.1 ± 2.99 μmol/g; Fig. 4B). Taken together, our results show that targeting hepatic FATPs via sdsAAV-shRNA-mediated RNA interference can significantly improve established obesity-associated hepatic steatosis even in the continued presence of high caloric diets. shRNA-mediated Reversal of NAFLD Improves Whole-body Energy Homeostasis—HF-fed AAVFATP5-injected mice showed a significant decrease in body weight when compared with controls (area under curve, 293 versus 401; p = 0.047) starting at week 3 a.i. and approaching the values for the ND study groups by week 5 a.i. The reduced weight gain observed in the AAVFATP5-injected HF groups was, at least in part, due to a reduced caloric intake, which significantly deviated from the control group at 3 weeks a.i. (Fig. 5B). A similar reduction of HF chow consumption was observed in FATP5KO mice (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E. Stahl A. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Differences in body weight were reflected by significantly smaller epididymal fat pads in FATP5 knockdown animals (71% reduction, when compared with SCR control); in contrast, both heart (SCR, 0.5 ± 0.1 g versus FATP5, 0.7 ± 0.1 g) and livers (SCR, 3.5 ± 1.8 g versus FATP5, 6.9 ± 1.6 g) were significantly enlarged. Organs from PBS-injected animals remained indistinguishable from the AAVSCR control group throughout the study. Following the initial 6 weeks of HF feeding, all mice developed hyperglycemia. Knockdown of FATP5 led to a rapid (2-3 weeks a.i.) reduction in serum glucose levels, which reached normoglycemia by week 5 a.i. (Fig. 5C). This improvement in glucose homeostasis was also reflected in glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test profiles 7 weeks a.i. showing profiles for HF-fed FATP5 knockdown mice (insulin tolerance test HF FATP5 versus HF SCR area under curve mean difference 12004, p < 0.001) that were indistinguishable from ND-fed animals (Fig. 5, D and E). A prior study of AAV8-shRNA vectors that differed in shRNA length and loop sequence, directed against transgenes, revealed that 36 out of 49 shRNA/vector combinations resulted in dose-dependent liver injury caused by perturbation of microRNA biosynthesis(11Grimm D.

Importantly, optimized construct sequences, promoters, and transduction conditions that proved to be non-toxic were also identified (11Grimm D. Streetz K.L. Jopling C.L. Storm T.A. Pandey K. Davis C.R. Marion P. Salazar F. Kay M.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar) and adapted by us for the stable, non-toxic, and liver-directed in vivo knockdown of FATP5. A single injection of sdsAAV-shRNA viruses sufficed to suppress expression of FATP5, resulting in phenotypes that were largely comparable with those of classical knock-out models while being substantially less time- and work-consuming. Further, major advantages of AAV-mediated gene knockdown over previously reported methods aiming at gene hypomorphism, such as antisense oligonucleotide injections (19Yu X.X. Murray S.F. Pandey S.K.

Metab. 2005; 90: 2804-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and high fat diets cause NAFLD in humans and animals (25Samuel V.T. Liu Z.X. Qu X. Elder B.D. Bilz S. Befroy D. Romanelli A.J.

Although diet-derived lipids are likely to significantly contribute to the etiology of obesity-associated NAFLD, de novo synthesis can also play an important role as overexpression of SREBP-1c results in hepatic steatosis (26Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In contrast, a liver-specific knock-out of SREBP-1c in obese ob/ob mice resulted in a marked decrease in liver TG (27Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Ide T. Yoshikawa T. Amemiya-Kudo M. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

The role of proteins in hepatic fatty acid uptake has been appreciated for over a decade (28Stremmel W. J. Hepatol. 1989; 9: 374-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the identity of the components of this uptake system has only recently been addressed genetically, demonstrating an important role of FATP5 (7Doege H. Stahl A. Physiol. (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We argued that if obesity-associated NAFLD is primarily driven and maintained by the continuous protein-mediated uptake of fatty acids by the liver, suppression of FATP5 function should at least partially revert hepatic steatosis. Indeed, we found that knockdown of FATP5 reduced established hepatic steatosis and hyperglycemia of mice fed a high fat diet. We identified two mechanisms that may underlie these beneficial effects. Firstly, loss of FATP5 reduces hepatic fatty acid uptake rates, as shown with isolated hepatocytes, and decreases hepatic postprandial fatty acid deposition following oil gavages. Decreasing hepatic lipid load is likely to improve insulin sensitivity in this organ (3Samuel V.T. Liu Z.X. Wang A. Beddow S.A. Geisler J.G. Kahn M. Zhang X.M. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inverse lipid distribution pattern was observed in previous studies with another FATP family member expressed by extrahepatic tissues showing that loss of FATP1 activity led to a decrease in fat pad and muscle TG and increase in liver lipids (17Wu Q. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Doege H. Feingold K.R. Stahl A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3455-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the activity and tissue distribution of FATPs play a critical role in determining the metabolic fate and organ-specific impact of dietary fatty acids. Importantly, exogenous dietary fatty acids not only contribute directly to hepatic TG accumulation but can also stimulate endogenous fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Particularly, saturated fatty acids have been found to increase hepatic levels of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1β, which in turn leads to increased SREBP- and liver X receptor-dependent transcriptional activity, resulting in elevated TG, cholesterol, and very low density lipoprotein synthesis (29Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 120: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting of hepatic FATPs may be preferable over down-stream targets in lipid metabolism such as DGAT2. Indeed, although suppression of hepatic DGAT2 via antisense oligonucleotides led to reduced hepatosteatosis in obese mice, it neither improved insulin sensitivity nor body weight (19Yu X.X. Murray S.F. Pandey S.K. Booten S.L. Bao D. Song X.Z. Kelly S. Chen S. McKay R. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and hepatic DGAT overexpression resulted in steatosis but not insulin resistance (30Monetti M. Levin M.C. Watt M.J. Sajan M.P. Marmor S. Hubbard B.K. Stevens R.D. Bain J.R. Newgard C.B. Farese Sr., R.V. Hevener A.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This is in clear contrast to our findings here for FATP5 knockdown, which leads to a reversal of obesity-induced NAFLD and improves whole-body glucose homeostasis. A likely second contributor to the improved hepatic steatosis and glucose homeostasis following FATP5 knockdown is the reduction in caloric uptake and body weight. The mechanism behind this interesting phenotype is poorly understood. As reduced food uptake upon FATP5 knockdown was only observed when animals were fed a high fat diet (Fig. 5B) and postprandial clearance of FFA from the circulation was delayed in FATP5 KO animals (9Doege H. Baillie R.A. Ortegon A.M. Tsang B. Wu Q. Punreddy S. Hirsch D. Watson N. Gimeno R.E. Stahl A.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1259-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), one possible explanation could be that the elevated postprandial serum fatty acid levels themselves serve as a satiety signal (31Lam T.K. Schwartz G.J. Rossetti L. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Taken together, we have made three important observations. Firstly, we demonstrate that AAV-mediated shRNA expression is an efficient tool for the suppression of hepatic genes in normal and steatotic livers. This is an important finding as this is the first report of non-toxic, liver-specific transduction and RNA interference induction utilizing stabilized double-stranded serotype 8 AAV particles and should allow for future experiments to dissect the molecular components underlying hepatic lipid fluxes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Secondly, we show that AAV-mediated knockdown of FATP5 protects from high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and redirects postprandial lipid fluxes away from the liver. Lastly, suppression of FATP5 is sufficient to reverse established NAFLD in our diet-induced obesity model and to improve whole body glucose homeostasis. Thus, reduction of hepatic FATPs either via gene therapy or via small molecular inhibitors is a novel tool to dynamically redirect lipid fluxes and may provide novel approaches for the treatment of NAFLD and insulin resistance.

However, empirical tests have been confined to fine spatiotemporal scales and have rarely included plants. Using data from 89,365 forest survey plots covering peninsular Spain, we explored, for each of 34 common tree species, the relationship between probability of occurrence and the local cover of remaining forest. Twenty-four species showed a significant negative response to forest loss, so that decreased forest cover had a negative effect on tree diversity, but the responses of individual species were highly variable. Animal-dispersed species were less vulnerable to forest loss, with six showing positive responses to decreased forest cover. The results imply that plant-animal interactions help prevent the collapse of forest communities that suffer habitat destruction."

Cell sorting, microarrays, and targeted molecular manipulations were used to analyze cardiac cell migration in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis . The heart network regulates genes involved in most cellular activities required for migration, including adhesion, cell polarity, and membrane protrusions. We demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor signaling and the forkhead transcription factor FoxF directly upregulate the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoDF, which synergizes with Cdc42 to contribute to the protrusive activity of migrating cells. Moreover, RhoDF induces membrane protrusions independently of other cellular activities required for migration. We propose that transcription regulation of specific effector genes determines the coordinated deployment of discrete cellular modules underlying migration."

In addition, FoxM1 is essential for the transcription of Skp2 and Cks1, which encode subunits of the Skp-Cullin 1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the CDK inhibitor proteins p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 for degradation during the G1/S transition (12Wang I.C.

Therefore, FoxM1-deficient cells accumulate nuclear levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, contributing to decreased entry into the S phase (16Petrovic V. Costa R.H. Lau L.F. Raychaudhuri P. Tyner A.L. J.

The JNK (also known as stress-activated protein kinases, SAPK) gene family is induced by extracellular stimuli (e.g. cytokines, mitogens, morphogens) and stresses (e.g. DNA damage, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, γ-radiation, heat shock)(17Minden A.

Of the three JNK isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2 are expressed in most cell types, whereas JNK3 is specific to nerve cells. JNK-mediated signaling pathways control multiple aspects of cellular function, including cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, differentiation, and the immune response (19Hall J.P. Merithew E.

Upon activation via phosphorylation by MKK4 or MKK7, JNKs phosphorylate their downstream targets, including the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF-2, Elk-1, Smad4, nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFAT4), NF-ATc1, and p53, thus triggering the activation of gene transcription (21Gupta S.

JNKs bind to the c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain and phosphorylate it on serine 63 and serine 73, leading to c-Jun activation and heterodimerization with members of the Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) or Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) families or to ATF-2 to form the AP-1 transcription factors (23Leaner V.D.

In this study, we show that FoxM1 directly activates transcription of JNK1 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and both FoxM1 and JNK1 are necessary for cell cycle progression, tumor cell migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Expression of JNK1 efficiently rescues the G1/S cell cycle block in FoxM1-depleted cells, indicating that JNK1 functions as the pivotal mediator of FoxM1 functions in the G1/S transition. Furthermore, FoxM1 regulates the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, which is associated with tumor cell migration and invasion, through JNK1-independent and -dependent pathways, respectively. These findings identify JNK1 as a crucial transcriptional target of FoxM1 that contributes to FoxM1-regulated G1/S transition, tumor cell migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth.

The primers used to amplify the following human gene promoter fragments were annotated with the binding position upstream of the transcription start site, annealing temperature (Ta) and whether in the sense (S) or antisense (AS) orientation: JNK1–1770S: 5′-ACC ATC AAC TTT GTG CTC AGC C-3′ and JNK1–1670 AS: 5′-CAT TTA TCC TGG AAA CTG GGT CAG-3′, (Ta, 58 °C); ATF2–4340S: 5′-TGG ATG CCT TCA TTT CTT GAG C-3′ and ATF2–4151AS: 5′-CTG TAT GTA AGT TCC CAC CCA CG-3′, (Ta, 61.2 °C). Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—U2OS cells were harvested 72 h following FoxM1 siRNA transfection, whereas FoxM1–/– MEFs were harvested at passage 4. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-FoxM1 antibodies (1:5000), or mouse anti-β-actin (AC-15; 1:5000; Sigma), anti-cyclin A (H-432; 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-JNK (1:1000), rabbit anti-c-Jun (1:1000), rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63; 1:1000), rabbit anti-ATF-2 (20F1; 1:1000), rabbit anti-phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71; 1:1000; Cell signaling) as described (12Wang I.C.

EMSA—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from U2OS cells and used to bind a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe spanning –1275/–1248 of the human JNK1 promoter (5′-TTTCCTGTTTAGTTTTGTTTATTTTTAA-3′) that was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase as described (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Poly(dI-dC) was added as a nonspecific DNA competitor (1 μg/ml). Where indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotides (100-fold excess) were added to the nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice before addition of radiolabeled probes. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (5%) ran in 0.5× TBE buffer, followed by autoradiography. Flow Cytometry—U2OS cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA, with or without pHA-JNK1 (30Keum Y.S. Owuor E.D. Kim B.R. Hu R. Kong A.N. Pharm. Res. 2003; 20: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and then fixed and stained for flow cytometry 72 h thereafter (12Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 μm JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 (Calbiochem) for 48 h prior to flow cytometry. Cell Proliferation Assay—U2OS cells were either left untreated, or transfected with siFoxM1 or siJNK1(31Dai Y. Rahmani M. Pei X.Y. Khanna P. Han S.I. Mitchell C. Dent P. Grant S. Blood. 2005; 105: 1706-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), or treated with SP600125 (10 μm). Viable cells were harvested at 1, 2, or 4 days, and cell numbers were measured using the Cell Titer-Glow luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega). For BrdU incorporation, cells were serum-starved with 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 48 h and restimulated with 10% FBS for 16 h with a 1-h pulse of BrdU. Cells were fixed and immunostained with the BrdU Labeling and Detection Kit II (Roche Applied Science). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and both BrdU-positive and -negative cells were counted in 10 random fields (200×). Experiments were performed in triplicates; shown are average numbers of cells ± S.D. Soft Agar Assay—U2OS cells were transfected siRNA (12Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) or treated with 10 μm SP600125 in triplicate, and cells were harvested and plated on soft agar 24 h after treatment as described (7Kalinichenko V.V. Major M.L. Wang X. Petrovic V. Kuechle J. Yoder H.M. Dennewitz M.B. Shin B. Datta A. Raychaudhuri P. Costa R.H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 830-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 9Kalin T.V.

The culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or 10 μm SP600125 was replaced every 3 days. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were scored after 2 weeks. Cell Invasion and Migration Assay—Cell invasion assay was performed by using the Matrigel-coated transwell invasion chamber (BD Bioscience) using the vendor's protocol. Briefly, cells were pretreated with siRNAs or JNK inhibitor for 48 h and were trypsinized and resuspended into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then added to the upper chambers at 2.5 × 104 cell per well. DMEM containing 5% FBS was added to the lower chambers as chemoattractant. After 18 h, the invaded cells on the membrane's undersurface were stained with Giemsa's solution and counted in 5 fields per well. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated twice. In Vitro Wound Closure Assay—U2OS cells were either treated with JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or transfected with indicated siRNAs. Cells were plated 48 h after treatment onto 24-well plates (3 × 105 cells per well) and allowed to grow into confluent monolayers. Scrape wounds were generated using a micro tip, and cell media were replaced. 5 h after wounding, cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa's solution. Phase-contrast images of the cells were taken at 0 and 5 h after wounding, and the average wound closure rate was measured. Experiments were done in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was calculated by the Student's t test using the Prism statistics software. Statistically significant changes (p values <0.05) are indicated with asterisks. Coordinate Expression of FoxM1 and JNK1—Although FoxM1 is known to regulate a genetic program essential for mitotic progression, how it controls the G1/S transition is not completely understood (12Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the expression of FoxM1 in serum-starved, quiescent mouse fibroblasts stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by serum addition. In MEFs immortalized by the expression of GSE56, a dominant negative suppressor of p53 (32Zou X. Ray D. Aziyu A. Christov K. Boiko A.D. Gudkov A.V. Kiyokawa H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2923-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Skeen J.E. Bhaskar P.T. Chen C.C. Chen W.S. Peng X.D. Nogueira V. Hahn-Windgassen A. Kiyokawa H. Hay N. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), FoxM1 mRNA levels increased by 8-fold within 8 h upon serum stimulation (Fig. 1A). The expression of JNK1 followed similar kinetics, suggesting that FoxM1 might regulate JNK1 expression. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of FoxM1 depletion by RNAi. Transfection of U2OS osteosarcoma cells with siFoxM1, but not control siRNA, effectively depleted FoxM1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Knockdown of FoxM1 resulted in the reduction of JNK1 mRNA by 60%, whereas JNK2 mRNA was not affected (Fig. 1B). The level of ATF-2 mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin A (25Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp.

A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was also significantly reduced in FoxM1-depeleted cells. Knockdown of FoxM1 also significantly decreased the levels of JNK1 and ATF-2 proteins (Fig. 1C). JNK1 is known to phosphorylate and activate c-Jun and ATF-2, which promote entry into S-phase (37Sabapathy K. Hochedlinger K. Nam S.Y. Bauer A. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Consistent with the diminished JNK1 expression, FoxM1-depleted cells showed reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 (Fig. 1C). The expression of cyclin A2, a known transcription target of c-Jun (27Katabami M. Donninger H. Hommura F. Leaner V.D. Kinoshita I. Chick J.F. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16728-16738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was also diminished by 50% (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, JNK1 expression was significantly reduced in FoxM1–/– MEFs compared with FoxM1+/+ or FoxM1+/– MEFs (Fig. 1D). Thus, consistent with the notion that FoxM1 regulates JNK1, FoxM1 deficiency leads to reduced JNK1 mRNA and protein, curtailed phosphorylation of the JNK1 substrates c-Jun and ATF2, and diminished expression of the c-Jun target gene cyclin A2. FoxM1 Transcriptionally Activates the JNK1 Promoter—The FoxM1 mRNAs are differentially spliced into three isoforms: FoxM1b, which is the predominant isoform and the isoform detected in our studies; FoxM1c, which contains an additional exon in the DNA binding domain; and the transcriptionally inactive FoxM1a (38Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 39Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found three consecutive consensus FoxM1 binding sites (38Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19827-19836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) between –1275 and –1251 bp and a fourth site between –330 and –316 bp of the human JNK1 promoter, suggesting the possibility that JNK1 is a direct transcriptional target of FoxM1. We used EMSA to address whether these consensus FoxM1 binding sites indeed bind nuclear factors. Nuclear extracts of U2OS cells bound labeled oligonucleotides of the sequence from –1275/–1248 bp of the JNK1 promoter to form a protein-DNA complex, which was efficiently competed by cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 2A). To test the transcriptional activity of FoxM1 upon the JNK1 promoter, we cotransfected U2OS cells with a FoxM1b expression construct (pCMV-FoxM1b) and a reporter plasmid containing 1.3 kb of the human JNK1 promoter driving luciferase expression. Overexpression of FoxM1b resulted in an 11-fold increase in JNK1 promoter activation, whereas depletion of FoxM1 using siRNA abrogated transcriptional activation of the JNK1 promoter (Fig. 2B). To determine whether FoxM1 binds directly to the human JNK1 promoter, we performed ChIP assays using PCR primers to DNA sequences (–1770/–1670 bp) in the vicinity of the potential FoxM1 binding sites (–1275/–1251 bp). Indeed, ChIP assays showed that FoxM1 protein is directly bound to the human JNK1 promoter region (Fig. 2C). Moreover, knockdown of FoxM1 by siRNA obliterated the binding of FoxM1 and RNA polymerase II to the JNK1 promoter (Fig. 2C). Because the CBP coactivator can be recruited by a number of other transcription factors, depletion of FoxM1 did not greatly diminish the recruitment of CBP to the promoter. We also found five FoxM1 consensus binding sites between –4419 and –3806 bp of the human ATF-2 promoter region. As shown by ChIP assay, FoxM1 protein is also associated with the human ATF-2 promoter, an association that is abrogated by siRNA depletion of FoxM1 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that FoxM1 binds directly to the human JNK1 promoter and transcriptionally activates JNK1 expression. FoxM1 also binds the ATF-2 promoter and is required for ATF-2 expression (Figs. 1B and 2C), suggesting that FoxM1 may transcriptionally regulate ATF-2 as well. FoxM1-induced JNK1 Is Essential for the G1/S Transition—We have previously shown that FoxM1 depletion inhibits cell cycle progression at both the G1/S and G2/M boundaries (12Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To determine whether FoxM1 is required for the re-entry of serum-deprived cells into the cell cycle after re-stimulation with serum, untreated or siFoxM1-transfected U2OS cells were maintained in 0.1% FBS for 48 h to drive cells into a G0/G1 state (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated with 10% FBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis at various times thereafter (Fig. 3A). Upon serum starvation, the percentages of cells with G1 DNA content in untransfected and siFoxM1-transfected cells accumulated to 62 and 59%, respectively, suggesting that most of these cells were synchronized in G0/G1 (Fig. 3A). Within 14 h after serum stimulation, the percentage of untransfected cells with G1 DNA con"

On the basis of x-ray binaries, a unified scenario describing the disc/jet coupling has evolved and been extended to many accreting objects. The only major exceptions are thought to be cataclysmic variables: Dwarf novae, weakly accreting white dwarfs, show similar outburst behavior to x-ray binaries, but no jet has yet been detected. Here we present radio observations of a dwarf nova in outburst showing variable flat-spectrum radio emission that is best explained as synchrotron emission originating in a transient jet. Both the inferred jet power and the relation to the outburst cycle are analogous to those seen in x-ray binaries, suggesting that the disc/jet coupling mechanism is ubiquitous."
https://openalex.org/W2168418092,"The growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induces angiogenesis and promotes endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. Affymetrix gene array analyses show that VEGF stimulates the expression of a cluster of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, suggesting a role for VEGF in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. We show that the serine threonine kinase Akt3 specifically links VEGF to mitochondrial biogenesis. A direct comparison of Akt1 vs. Akt3 gene silencing was performed in ECs and has uncovered a discrete role for Akt3 in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis. Silencing of Akt3, but not Akt1, results in a decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and mtDNA content. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene transcripts are also found to decrease when Akt3 expression is silenced. Concurrent with these changes in mitochondrial gene expression, lower O(2) consumption was observed. VEGF stimulation of the major mitochondrial import protein TOM70 is also blocked by Akt3 inhibition. In support of a role for Akt3 in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, Akt3 silencing results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC-1alpha, and a reduction in known PGC-1alpha target genes. Finally, a subtle but significant, abnormal mitochondrial phenotype is observed in the brain tissue of AKT3 knockout mice. These results suggest that Akt3 is important in coordinating mitochondrial biogenesis with growth factor-induced increases in cellular energy demands."

This reversible redox post-translational modification consists of the formation of a mixed disulfide between a free thiol on a protein and a molecule of glutathione.

Glutathione is a tripeptide (γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) of 307 Da found in almost all living organisms. Glutathione synthesis occurs in two steps and requires two enzymes: γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. It is the most abundant free soluble thiol in cells, widely considered to constitute a redox buffer. Indeed, it exists in two different forms: the reduced form (GSH), which is the major form, and the oxidized form (GSSG). 2The abbreviations used are: GSSG, oxidized glutathione; ICL, isocitrate lyase; CrICL, C. reinhardtii isocitrate lyase; GRX, glutaredoxin; A4-GAPDH, A4-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TAP, Tris acetate phosphate medium; DTT, dithiothreitol; PRX, peroxiredoxin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; ACCase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; TRX, thioredoxin. Glutathione is involved in various cellular processes in photosynthetic organisms, including detoxification of reactive oxygen species, xenobiotics and heavy metals, G1/S cell cycle transition, cell differentiation, flowering, anthocyanin accumulation, and programmed cell death, but also resistance toward pathogens (reviewed in Refs. 1Foyer C.H.

Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Glutathione is also involved in a reversible post-translational modification, named glutathionylation, consisting of the formation of a mixed disulfide between an accessible free thiol on a protein and a molecule of glutathione. The one or more exact mechanisms leading to protein glutathionylation remain to be determined, but this modification seems to occur under oxidative stress conditions. Protein glutathionylation can protect cysteine residues from irreversible oxidation but can also regulate either positively or negatively the activity of many proteins (reviewed in Refs. 4Dalle-Donne I.

To date, this modification has been mainly studied in nonphotosynthetic organisms where proteomic studies allowed identification of ∼150 targets, whereas very little is known in photosynthetic organisms. Indeed, the first proteins reported to undergo glutathionylation in plants were two glutathione S-transferases (7Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol.

Glutathionylation targets have also been identified in Arabidopsis cell cultures using biotinylated glutathione (12Dixon D.P. Skipsey M. Grundy N.M. Edwards R.

Due to technical difficulties, only 11 targets were identified in vivo. Using the same approach, 72 putative targets were identified in vitro, but only a few were chloroplastic, probably due to the use of dark-grown cells (12Dixon D.P. Skipsey M. Grundy N.M. Edwards R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2233-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, considering that in photosynthetic organisms chloroplasts are the main sites of reactive oxygen species production in the light, regulation by glutathionylation could play an important role in this cellular compartment. To investigate glutathionylation in vivo, we adapted to Chlamydomonas the methods developed for identification of S-thiolated proteins in human cells (14Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This method is based on the use of [35S]cysteine to label the glutathione pool in light-grown cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a photosynthetic unicellular eukaryote, while protein translation is inhibited. After performing an oxidative stress treatment, radiolabeled proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. We report here the first large scale study of S-thiolation targets on photosynthetically competent cells. This method allowed the identification of 25 targets, and glutathionylation was confirmed in vitro for three of them. Reagents—Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Chlamydomonas Cultures—A cw15 cell wall-less strain of Chlamydomonas was grown in Tris acetate phosphate medium (TAP) prepared as described previously (16Rochaix J.D. Mayfield S.P. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Erickson J. Plant Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL, Oxford1988: 253-275Google Scholar), with up to 5 × 106 cells/ml under illumination at 100 μE.m-2.s-1 and at 25 °C. Glutathione Measurements—Total and oxidized glutathione were measured as described previously (17Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar) starting from a minimum of 5 × 109 cells obtained by centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Cells were broken in acid extraction buffer using an automatic grinder (MM 300, Retsch). Labeling of Thiolated Proteins and Protein Extraction—Protein labeling was performed at 25 °C, under constant stirring in 1 liter of a Chlamydomonas culture at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Protein translation was inhibited by the addition of 10 μg/ml (w/v) cycloheximide and 200 μg/ml (w/v) chloramphenicol in the growth medium. After a 15-min incubation, cells were pelleted and resuspended in a 1/100 volume of TAP medium, 20 μg/ml (w/v) cycloheximide, and 400 μg/ml (w/v) chloramphenicol (TAP plus inhibitors medium). After an additional 15-min incubation with the two inhibitors, cells were incubated with 1 mm [35S]cysteine (50 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in the same volume of TAP plus inhibitors medium before incubation with 1 mm diamide for 15 min. Cells were washed once with the TAP plus inhibitors medium and resuspended in the same volume of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Total soluble proteins were extracted by two freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), centrifuged, and successively washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (three times), 5 mm NH4HCO3, and distilled water. The pellets were vacuum-dried and resolubilized in 600 μl of urea buffer (8 m urea, 4% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 0.2% ampholytes, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Isoelectric focusing was performed on dry immobilized pH gradient strips (pH range, non-linear 3–10 or linear 4–7, 17-cm length) as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad), in the absence of reducing agents. In the second dimension, proteins were separated in 12% polyacrylamide gels with a Protean II XL system (Bio-Rad) and detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, with no reducing treatment. Deglutathionylation treatments were performed on the polyacrylamide gels and consisted of successive baths at room temperature in 40% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid (16 h); water (2 × 10 min); 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (10 min); 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT (3 × 40 min), when necessary; and water (3 × 10 min) prior to protein staining. Radioactivity was analyzed by fluorography with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) after drying. Protein Identification—Spots were excised and destained, and proteins were digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted as described (18Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Meyer Y. Miginiac-Maslow M. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Decottignies P. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2696-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and submitted to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis on a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Proteins were identified using the search program Mascot reducing the NCBI data base to the Viridiplantae. Two missed cleavage sites, oxidation of methionine, modification of cysteines by iodoacetamide, and a 50-ppm tolerance in mass values were considered in searches. Plasmid Construction for Expression of CrICL in Escherichia coli—The cDNA-encoding C. reinhardtii isocitrate lyase (CrICL) was obtained by PCR on the expressed sequence tag clone AV622994 obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan), using a forward primer introducing an NdeI restriction site (underlined) at the start codon (bolded): 5′-CGTCGTCCATATGGCCTCCAACGGCGCTG-3′; and a reverse primer introducing a BamHI restriction site (underlined) downstream of the stop codon: 5′-CGCCGGATCCTCAGTGGTGGAACTGCTCCT-3′. CrICL was cloned in a modified pET-3c vector containing additional codons upstream of the NdeI site to express a His-tagged protein with seven N-terminal histidines. The sequence was checked by sequencing. Protein Purification—Recombinant CrICL was produced using the pET-3c-HIS/BL21 expression system. Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, and the production was induced with 200 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 27 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2, broken using a French press (6.9 × 107 Pa), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied onto a Ni2+ HiTrap chelating resin (HIS-Select® nickel affinity gel, Sigma) pre-equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. The recombinant protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass and purity of the protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after dialysis against 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2. The isocitrate lyase (ICL) concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 64540 m-1.cm-1. Chloroplastic 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (PRX) from Chlamydomonas was produced and purified as described in a previous study (19Goyer A. Haslekas C. Miginiac-Maslow M. Klein U. Le Maréchal P. Jacquot J.P. Decottignies P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recombinant and native HSP70B from Chlamydomonas was produced and purified as previously described (20Liu C. Willmund F. Whitelegge J.P. Hawat S. Knapp B. Lodha M. Schroda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Willmund F. Schroda M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Glutathionylation Treatments—In vitro glutathionylation assays were performed by treating 0.7 mg/ml HSP70B purified from Chlamydomonas or 1.2 mg/ml recombinant HSP70B or 67 μm 2-Cys PRX or 219 μm ICL with 5 mm GSSG for 16 h or with 0.1 mm H2O2 plus 0.5 mm GSH for 2 h. Glutathione and H2O2 were removed by dialysis before MALDI-TOF mass spectra analysis. Enzyme Assays—ICL activity was assayed according to a previous study (22Rua J. Soler J. Busto F. de Arriaga D. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2002; 35: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm threo-dl-isocitrate, 4 mm phenylhydrazine, and enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml. Isocitrate cleavage was measured at 30 °C by the change in absorbance at 324 nm associated with the formation of glyoxylate phenylhydrazone. We adapted a method developed on human cells (14Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E.

Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) for identifying glutathionylated proteins in the green alga Chlamydomonas using radiolabeled cysteine. The first step consists of inhibition of protein synthesis in both cytosol and organelles, followed by the addition of radiolabeled cysteine that can enter the cell and be incorporated into glutathione molecules. Subsequently, diamide, a thiol-specific oxidant, known to promote efficiently glutathionylation in non-photosynthetic eukaryotes without reactive oxygen species production, is added to perform an oxidative stress and trigger protein glutathionylation. To characterize the effect of a 1 mm sub-lethal concentration of diamide, we measured the pools of total and oxidized glutathione. The total glutathione pool was found to be increased compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1), revealing an increased glutathione synthesis during the whole stress treatment that will favor the labeling of the glutathione pool. Nevertheless, the GSH/GSSG ratio was only slightly decreased (Fig. 1) indicating that Chlamydomonas cells undergo a moderate oxidative stress during the treatment, leading to cell adaptation but not to cell death. Identification of S-Thiolated Proteins—Following protein extraction, two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed, and radiolabeled proteins were revealed by fluorography (Fig. 2). Control gels were treated with DTT to remove the radiolabeled S-thiol adducts (Fig. 2, B and D). The two Coomassie-stained gels exhibit very similar patterns (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas fluorography reveals important differences (Fig. 2, C and D). Indeed, several proteins are radiolabeled, and this label disappears or is strongly decreased for most proteins after DTT treatment, consistent with the presence of S-thiol adducts on these proteins. Three proteins are labeled with and without DTT treatment (spots 3, 4, and 10 in Fig. 2, C and D). These proteins could require enzymatic deglutathionylation that is not mimicked by DTT, although it cannot be completely ruled out that this labeling is due to residual protein synthesis. All radiolabeled proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using protein databases as well as Chlamydomonas expressed sequence tag and genome sequences for one of them. This allowed the identification of 25 different targets involved in various cellular processes (Table 1). Among these proteins, 18 are predicted to be localized in chloroplasts, 2 in the cytosol, 2 in flagella, 1 in mitochondria, and 1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. The identification of mainly chloroplastic proteins among S-thiolation targets is consistent with the idea that the chloroplast is the main site of reactive oxygen species production in the light. Indeed, glutathionylation could play an important role in regulating protein activity in this subcellular compartment in the light and thereby allow adaptation of the cell metabolism to different light intensities and qualities (23Lemaire S.D. Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Curr. Genet. 2007; 51: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because glutathione represents >95% of total non-protein thiols, glutathionylation is considered to be the prevalent S-thiolation reaction in cells. Moreover, because an increase in glutathione synthesis is observed during the stress treatment, the glutathione pool will be significantly radiolabeled due to the incorporation of [35S]cysteine (Fig. 1). However, the method we have used to detect S-thiolated proteins did not allow discriminating between proteins modified by S-cysteinylation or by S-glutathionylation. Consequently, we will refer to the modified proteins as S-thiolated proteins, although it is likely that most of them have been glutathionylated. Consistent with a modification by S-thiolation, all the proteins identified possess at least one cysteine. Moreover, in most cases, some of the cysteines present in Chlamydomonas proteins are either conserved in other photosynthetic organisms or present in all organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes (supplemental Fig. S1). This could reflect a similar behavior of these proteins, suggesting that glutathionylation could play an important role in the regulation of their activity and/or in their protection.TABLE 1S-Thiolation targets identified in C. reinhardtii Accession numbers correspond to NCBI database numbers.

Phosphoglycerate kinase has also been identified as a putative glutaredoxin (GRX) target in plants (26Rouhier N. Villarejo A. Srivastava M. Gelhaye E. Keech O. Droux M. Finkemeier I. Samuelsson G.

A. 2002; 99: 3505-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sequence of phosphoglycerate kinase is highly conserved among organisms, including two partially conserved cysteine residues, and its activity has been reported to be affected by thiol derivatization in several organisms, probably because the modification affects the catalytic cysteine (27Kovari Z. Flachner B. Naray-Szabo G. Vas M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8796-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Kuntz G.W. Krietsch W.K.

This suggests that glutathionylation could affect phosphoglycerate kinase activity under oxidative stress conditions. Two other Calvin cycle enzymes have been previously identified as glutathionylation targets: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (13Ito H. Iwabuchi M. Ogawa K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and A4-GAPDH (11Zaffagnini M. Michelet L. Marchand C. Sparla F. Decottignies P. Le Maréchal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Noctor G. Trost P. Lemaire S.D. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Loss of activity upon glutathionylation has been reported for the latter. Interestingly, glutathionylation of f-type TRX has also been reported (9Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Marchand C. Collin V. Decottignies P. Tsan P. Lancelin J.M. Trost P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Noctor G. Lemaire S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16478-16483Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This chloroplastic TRX is involved in light regulation of carbon metabolism enzymes, in particular in the activation of Calvin cycle enzymes in the light. Glutathionylation of this protein affects its reduction, and it can consequently affect the regulation of all its targets. All these data suggest that glutathionylation could allow a regulation of the Calvin cycle under oxidative stress conditions (6Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Massot V. Keryer E. Vanacker H.

The two-dimensional gels we have employed, although being adapted to most proteins, do not allow recovery of proteins with a low molecular weight and high pI such as TRX f. The absence of A4-GAPDH may be linked to the use of diamide for the oxidative stress treatment. Indeed, in mammalian cells, GAPDH is the major target for modification following treatment with hydroperoxides, whereas this enzyme is unaffected following cellular exposure to diamide (30Shenton D.

We also identified two other proteins involved in photosynthesis. OEE1 has been already identified as a putative TRX target by proteomics in photosynthetic organisms (18Marchand C. Le Maréchal P.

https://openalex.org/W2066448413,"Endocannabinoids are involved in synaptic signaling and neuronal protection; however, our understanding of the mechanisms by which endocannabinoids protect neurons from harmful insults remains elusive. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endogenous cannabinoid and a full agonist for cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), is a substrate for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and can be metabolized by COX-2. Here we show, however, that 2-AG is also capable of suppressing elevation of hippocampal COX-2 expression in response to proinflammatory and excitotoxic stimuli. 2-AG prevents neurodegeneration from toxic assaults that elevate COX-2 expression and inhibits the COX-2 elevation-enhanced excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The action of 2-AG on suppression of COX-2 appeared to be mediated via the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled CB1 receptor and MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Our results reveal that 2-AG functions as an endogenous COX-2 inhibitor protecting neurons from harmful insults by preventing excessive expression of COX-2, which provides a mechanistic basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches for protecting neurons from inflammation- and excitotoxicity-induced neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2001966304,"The 26S proteasome plays an essential role in regulating many cellular processes by the degradation of proteins targeted for breakdown by ubiquitin conjugation. The 26S complex is formed from the 20S core, which contains the proteolytic active sites, and 19S regulatory complexes, which bind to the 20S core to activate it and confer specificity for ubiquitinated protein substrates.

In our reconstructions the crystallographic structure of each of the subunits of the 20S core can be unambiguously docked by direct recognition of each of their densities. Our results show for the first time that binding of the 19S regulatory particle results in the radial displacement of the adjacent subunits of the 20S core leading to opening of a wide channel into the proteolytic chamber.

We suggest locations for some of the 19S regulatory particle subunits. The eukaryotic 26S proteasome is a multisubunit protein complex responsible for controlled degradation of a wide range of targeted intracellular proteins (1Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), typically labeled by the covalent attachment of a Lys-48 linked poly ubiquitin chain. It has a particularly significant role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The 26S proteasome is composed of a 20S proteolytic core particle (20S-CP) 2The abbreviations used are:20S-CP20S core particle19S-RP19S regulatory particle. 2The abbreviations used are:20S-CP20S core particle19S-RP19S regulatory particle. associated with 19S regulatory particles (19S-RPs). Although purified proteasome samples that target polyubiquitinated substrates are generally called 26S proteasome preparations, these are commonly mixtures of 20S-CP particles associated with one or two 19S-RPs (sedimentation coefficients of 26S and 30S, respectively). 20S core particle 19S regulatory particle. 20S core particle 19S regulatory particle. X-ray crystallographic studies show that the 20S-CP has a barrel-like structure made up of four stacked heptameric rings (2Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes the outer rings are each formed from seven highly homologous subunits, α1-7, whereas the two inner rings are each formed from seven highly homologous subunits, β1-7, with a molecular 2-fold axis located at the interface between the two β rings. The β rings form a central chamber in which proteolysis is catalyzed by the N-terminal Thr residues of β1, β2, and β5 (3Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). Substrate translocation into this proteolytic chamber takes place via a narrow axial channel in the α rings that admits only peptides and unfolded proteins (4Groll M. Bajorek M. Köhler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Although the eukaryotic 20S-CP contains the catalytic sites for proteolysis, it only becomes fully active upon binding of regulatory complexes (5Kohler A. Bajorek M. Groll M. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 19S-RP is itself made up of two subcomplexes, base and lid (6Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), which together consist of at least 18 individual subunits responsible for specific polyubiquitinated substrate recognition, de-ubiquination, unfolding, and translocation into the proteolytic core. ATP dependence of the 26S proteasome is associated with six homologous but distinct AAA-ATPase subunits, Rpt1-6, located in the base subcomplex adjacent to the α ring of the 20S-CP (6Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Three further subunits, Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn10, are also assigned to the base of the 19S-RP, whereas the remaining subunits make up the lid. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of the human 26S proteasome, doubly capped with 19S-RPs, determined by single particle analysis of electron microscopy images. In the resulting structure we can unambiguously dock the 20S-CP crystallographic structure, which allowed us to directly observe, for the first time, a novel mechanism by which the binding of 19S-RPs opens the gate into the proteolytic core by subunit displacement within the 20S-CP. A parallel analysis of human single-capped 26S proteasome complexes confirmed our observations. Electron Microscopy—Samples of human 26S proteasome were obtained from Biomol International, Exeter, UK. The samples were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP to a final concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml, applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated grids, and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Low-dose images (∼20 electrons Å-2) were recorded on Kodak SO163 film in a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at 100-kV accelerating voltage and at a calibrated magnification of 35,000×. Image Analysis, Three-dimensional Reconstruction, and Coordinate Docking—Electron microscopy films were digitized using a Nikon 9000 ED Coolscan film scanner at a step size of 6.35 μm to produce 16-bit gray scale images. The images were resampled by averaging patches of 3 × 3 pixels to give a final sampling of 5.44 Å/pixel at the specimen level. As a preliminary step in image processing, data sets of molecular images of proteasome complexes were subjected to automated alignment and classification procedures using the EMAN refine2d program (7Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Subsequently to this preliminary evaluation, all image analysis and further processing was carried out using a combination of Imagic (8van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and Spider (9Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar) programs. Three-dimensional reconstructions were visualized with Pymol, which was also used for creation of structure diagrams. Automated docking of crystallographic coordinates was performed with the software URO (10Navaza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Alvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Creation of Particle Image Data Sets—Electron microscope images of negatively stained human 26S proteasome samples on carbon support film reveal a variety of molecular shapes. Overall the protein molecular images appear to consist predominantly of a mixture of side views with characteristic rod-like shapes together with views with approximately circular profile (Fig. 1). The side views can be recognized by their characteristic shape as a mixture of double-capped and single-capped 26S proteasome complexes present in approximately equal amounts. In the case of the views with circular profile these have a radius consistent with end-on views of proteasome complexes. However, the end views of the 20S-CP, 26S single-capped, and 26S double-capped complexes are all quite similar in appearance and, therefore, are not readily distinguishable. Therefore, to assemble data sets corresponding to molecular species clearly of the same composition, side views only were carefully selected manually to give a data set of 9,823 images of double-capped and a second data set of 10,568 images of single-capped 26S proteasome complexes. Calculation of a Reference Model and Refinement of the Three-dimensional Structures—The first step in the analysis of the image data set of the double-capped 26S proteasome was to subject it to fully automated rounds of iterative alignment and classification procedures. This provided an unbiased evaluation of the different molecular views present in the data set. A selection of class averages resulting from this preliminary procedure is shown in Fig. 2. Within this selection it is possible to identify molecular projections with 2-fold rotational symmetry (Fig. 2, A and B) and mirror symmetry (Fig. 2C) together with asymmetric image class averages (e.g. Fig. 2D). The 2-fold and mirror symmetric projections are characteristic of orthogonal views of a three-dimensional object with C2 point group symmetry (i.e. 2-fold rotational symmetry), which is the known symmetry of the 20S-CP and, therefore, the expected symmetry of the double-capped 26S proteasome, assuming both 19S-RP have the same conformation in the complex. In this context asymmetric class averages would correspond to intermediate views to those with 2-fold and mirror symmetries. The clear identification of the C2 symmetry provides a frame of reference for the assignment of projection angles, with angles corresponding to rotations of 0°, 90°, and 180° around the long axis of the proteasome being assigned to the symmetric class averages (Fig. 2, A, C, and B, respectively). An initial three-dimensional model was generated with these angular assignments by the exact-filtered back-projection algorithm using C2 symmetry. The initial three-dimensional model, low pass-filtered to attenuate the intrinsic distortions associated with the use of a very restricted number of molecular views, was used as the starting point for the image analysis. From this starting model progressively refined three-dimensional structures were calculated by successive rounds of multireference alignment, classification by multivariate statistical analysis, angular assignment by projection matching, and back-projection for the calculation of the three-dimensional volumes, exploiting the C2 symmetry of the double-capped 26S proteasome. Forward projections of the three-dimensional maps calculated for each iterative round were used as references for the next round of alignment. For the last few rounds of the refinement procedure a total of 3000 class averages was calculated, of which about 1000 classes were selected for the three-dimensional reconstructions based on their signal-to-noise ratio, overall internal details, and consistency with the corresponding forward projections of the three-dimensional map, which is a direct indication that indeed those classes correspond to different views of the same complex. At this stage of the analysis a number of end views were also included for completeness of the dataset. This involved careful selection from the original micrographs of end views of double-capped 26S proteasomes identified by their agreement with reprojections of the three-dimensional map. The final three-dimensional structure presented here was calculated from 834 class averages. Apart from a small number of end-on-views, these 834 class averages were predominantly side views well distributed around the long axis of the proteasome complex to which projection angles were assigned with a mean value of 7.47° for the tilt about the proteasome short axis. The results from this analysis are illustrated in Fig. 3A, which shows examples of the final class averages used in the three-dimensional reconstruction and the corresponding surface representations of the three-dimensional map and forward projections. The resolution of the three-dimensional analysis of the double-capped 26S proteasome estimated from Fourier shell correlation is within 18-28 Å, depending on the resolution criteria considered (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that three-dimensional structures determined as presented here can in principle give rise to one of two mirror-related variants that are not readily distinguished in the absence of other information. However, for the current analysis the correct variant (presented here) was unambiguously recognized by its agreement with the crystal structure of the 20S-CP (see below). The three-dimensional structure of the double-capped 26S proteasome generated as described above was used to produce a reference structure for analysis of the single-capped 26S proteasome data set by removal of the densities corresponding to one of the 19S regulatory particles by appropriate masking followed by re-centering and low pass Fourier filtering of the resulting three-dimensional map. Structural analysis of the single-capped 26S proteasome images was then carried out as described for the double-capped 26S proteasome data but with no symmetry imposed, i.e. using C1 point group symmetry. Selected class averages from the 1080 classes contributing to the final three-dimensional map are shown in Fig. 3B together with corresponding surface representations of the three-dimensional map and their forward projections. The map of the single-capped 26S proteasome is recognizably noisier than that of the doubly-capped 26S proteasome, which is a consequence of the use of approximately the same number of molecular views but without symmetry imposition. The resolution of the three-dimensional map of the single-capped 26S proteasome estimated from Fourier shell correlation is 20-29 Å (Fig. 3C). Three-dimensional Structures of Double- and Single-capped 26S Proteasomes—The final three-dimensional structures of the 26S proteasomes are illustrated as surface representations in Fig. 4, panels A and B, respectively. For representation purposes these are contoured to give molecular volumes corresponding to ∼2.6 MDa for the double-capped and ∼1.7 MDa for the single-capped 26S proteasome maps, assuming a protein density of 0.844 Da Å-3. These molecular masses were estimated from the sequence of individual subunits expected to be present in the human 26S proteasome. In both structures the region corresponding to the 20S-CP (Fig. 4, gray) is readily identified by its four rings of density and in the 19S-RPs the base and lid regions can also be recognized (blue, magenta, and yellow in Fig. 4). A major feature of the base (Fig. 4, blue) is a disc-shaped density adjacent to and approximately parallel with the 20S-CP α ring. Additionally there is an arced density (Fig. 4, magenta) that extends from this disc in a tangential direction. The base of the 19S-RP appears connected to the adjacent α ring by three linker densities running parallel to the proteasome long axis (see Fig. 4 and 6, see below). In addition, the double-capped complex is characterized by a prominent L-shaped connection from the base of the 19S-RP to the α ring of the 20S-CP (Figs. 4A and 6, see below); in the single-capped complex this density is incompletely recovered (Fig. 4B). The lid of the 19S-RP (Fig. 4, yellow) consists of a number of apparent subunit densities, and it is approximately of similar size to the base.FIGURE 6Links between the 19S-RPs and the 20S-CP of the double-capped 26S proteasome.

Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the 20S-CP is characterized by C2 symmetry (Fig. 5A), where a molecular 2-fold symmetry axis relates via a 180° rotation each pair of adjacent α and β rings, which form half of the 20S-CP, with the second α and β pair (2Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). The same symmetry axis is defined by the C2 symmetry of the double-capped 26S proteasome presented here. Thus, to preserve the common symmetry axis of the 20S-CP and 26S complex, there are only two ways in which the coordinates of the 20S-CP can be docked into the 26S proteasome map. These alternatives correspond to 180° rotations of the 20S-CP coordinates about the long axis of the 26S proteasome, resulting in viewing the 20S-CP along its symmetry axis but from opposite directions. Due to symmetry considerations, any other rotation of the 20S-CP coordinates around the long axis of the 26S proteasome would result in each of the α rings interacting differently with its adjacent 19S-RP. Of the only two possible orientations of the 20S-CP, the correct orientation is clearly identified in our three-dimensional map from the agreement between the individual densities observed for each of the α and β subunits and their counterparts in the crystal structure (Fig. 5, Bi and Ci). This agreement is not observed if the alternative orientation for the 20S-CP coordinates is taken (Fig. 5D), which results in the subunits being systematically located between rather than within the protein density lobes. The accuracy of the symmetry-based docking was confirmed using the automated docking program URO, which gave near identical results when using the 20S-CP crystal structure as a rigid body. URO fits model electron densities into electron microscope reconstructions using reciprocal space algorithms, thereby avoiding bias introduced when defining the boundaries of the target density (10Navaza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Alvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The agreement between the densities of our three-dimensional structure and fitted coordinates is particularly apparent in the α subunit rings (Fig. 5Bi). The α subunits, although homologous to each other, are characterized by detailed differences in their three-dimensional structure. This is reflected in the three-dimensional map of the double-capped 26S proteasome presented here, where the density corresponding to each α subunit matches its individual molecular envelope (Fig. 5Bi). This also provides a clear indication that the handedness of the maps presented here is correct. Docking the 20S-CP coordinates into the single-capped proteasome map, despite its higher level of noise, gives rise to the same orientation to that in the double-capped 26S proteasome and also illustrates good overall agreement between the 20S-CP subunit shapes in the reconstruction and those in the crystal structure (see Fig. 7). This unambiguous docking of the 20S-CP coordinates into the 26S proteasome maps allows, for the first time, the location of each 20S-CP subunit within the 26S complex to be established. Subunit Rearrangements within the 20S-CP—Despite the good overall agreement between the densities for the 20S-CP in our three-dimensional maps and its x-ray crystallographic structure, close inspection reveals that in our double-capped 26S proteasome reconstruction, the 20S-CP subunits appear to be at rather higher radius than those in the atomic coordinates; this effect is particularly clear for the α subunits (Fig. 5Bi). To assess this observation, the location of the 28 individual subunits of the 20S-CP was investigated by refining the docking of the 20S-CP coordinates with URO software but allowing the coordinates of each individual subunit to be fitted independently, with no symmetry constraints, starting from the 20S-CP crystallographic structure docked as single unit. It should be noted that this fitting procedure depends solely on the densities of the map and is independent of any imposed molecular envelope. The result of this independent docking of the 20S-CP subunits (Fig. 5, A, iii and iv, Bii, and Cii), although broadly similar to that of the 20S-CP fitted as a single rigid body, matches the molecular envelope of 26S proteasome three-dimensional reconstruction much more closely. Here the most significant movements of the individual 20S-CP subunits correspond to displacements to higher radius than in the crystallographic coordinates (Fig. 5, Biii and Ciii). The average radial displacement for the α and β subunits is 6 and 5.4 Å, respectively. Although there are also some small lateral displacements and rotations, there are virtually no shifts along the proteasome long axis. This is a clear indication that the displacements observed are real and not just a consequence of inaccurate scaling factors, as these would expand the three-dimensional map in all directions and not just radially. Interestingly, the most substantial radial displacements occur in one segment of the α rings (Fig. 5Biii) formed by α1, α4, α5, α6, and α7 (mean radial displacement 7.3 Å), whereas the α2 and α3 subunits are only slightly displaced (mean radial displacement 2.8 Å). Likewise, in the β rings (Fig. 5Ciii) a group of 5 subunits, β1, β2, β5, β6, and β7 shows substantially greater radial displacements (mean radial displacement of 6.5 Å) than the remaining two subunits, β3 and β4 (with a mean radial displacement of 2.6 Å). The observation that the segments of the α and β rings characterized by larger displacements are overall located on the same side of the 20S-CP suggests that a coordinated subunit rearrangement occurs. These radial displacements appear to leave the 20S-CP subunits still in close contact with their respective neighbors, although the α ring no longer appears to completely enclose the proteolytic core, and an aperture becomes evident near the proteasome long axis (Fig. 5Bii). Likewise, radial displacement of the β ring subunits leads to an apparent reduction in the constriction leading to the inner proteolytic chamber (Fig. 5Cii). The observation that the segment of the α rings showing the most significant displacements is where the links to the 19S-RP running parallel to the proteasome long axis are bound (Fig. 6, links I, II, and III) indicates a direct association between the binding of the 19S regulatory complex and the 20S-CP subunit rearrangements. In the single-capped 26S proteasome, it is possible to compare the organization of the 20S-CP subunits located closer to the 19S-RP with those at its uncapped end, allowing us to directly assess the effect of 19S-RP binding on the 20S-CP subunit organization. To this end individual subunits of the 20S-CP were independently docked with URO in the same way as described above for their docking into the double-capped 26S proteasome map. The resulting agreement between the docked 20S-CP subunits and the molecular envelope of the single-capped 26S proteasome reconstruction is apparent (Fig. 7). It is noted that the docked positions for the α subunits in the 20S-CP ring adjacent to the 19S-RP (Fig. 7, A and B) are very similar to those for the double-capped 26S proteasome (Fig. 5Bii), with the formation of an aperture close to the center of this α ring. Remarkably the subunits in the uncapped α ring of the 20S-CP are also displaced to higher radius, but in this case the average radial shift is considerably lower, and the apparent opening of the 20S-CP is not observed (Fig. 7, A and C). This is in agreement with the corresponding region of the three-dimensional map of the single-capped 26S proteasome, which is characterized by a continuous density (Fig. 4Bv and 7, A and C). The positions of the β subunits after independent docking into the single-capped 26S proteasome map are also characterized by radial shifts compared with those of the 20S-CP crystallographic structure. The average radial displacement observed here was also more significant for the β ring subunits closest to the 19S-RP (average displacement of 7.3 Å) than that for the β ring furthest from the cap (average displacement of 4.7 Å). We describe here the three-dimensional structural analysis by electron microscopy and image processing methods of the human 26S proteasome, where a complex formed by a 20S-CP associated with two 19S-RPs was analyzed exploiting its intrinsic C2 point group symmetry. The level of detail in the final three-dimensional map is sufficient to accurately dock the crystallographic structures of each of the 20S-CP subunits independently. In the resulting structure the α subunits are radially displaced when compared with the crystallographic coordinates of the mammalian 20S-CP (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), revealing a novel mechanism for the opening of a gate into the 20S-CP proteolytic core by the attachment of 19S-RPs. Previous three-dimensional reconstructions and models of Drosophila double-capped 26S proteasomes from electron microscopy data have been obtained (12Walz J. Erdmann A. Kania M. Typke D. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Nickell S. Beck F. Korinek A. Mihalache O. Baumeister W. Plitzko J.M.

Commun. 2007; 353: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but no functional implications have been described in these previous studies. Overall the three-dimensional maps presented here are in general agreement with the more recent of these structures calculated by cryoelectron tomography (14Nickell S. Mihalache O. Beck F. Hegerl R. Korinek A. Baumeister W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and single particle analysis of cryoelectron microscopy images (13Nickell S. Beck F. Korinek A. Mihalache O. Baumeister W. Plitzko J.M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2751-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Subunit Assignment within the Three-dimensional Maps of the Human 26S Proteasome—In the structures of both double- and single-capped human 26S proteasomes described here, the regions corresponding to the 20S-CP and 19S-RPs can be readily recognized (Fig. 4). The unambiguous docking of the mammalian 20S-CP crystal structure (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) into our three-dimensional maps allows for the first time the explicit identification of each of the α and β subunits of the 20S-CP within the 26S proteasome (Figs. 5 and 7). In comparison, the absence of high resolution structural data for individual 19S-RP subunits and the current resolution of our three-dimensional analysis impair their definitive assignment. Nevertheless, it is possible to suggest locations for some of those subunits based on information available from earlier studies. Within the 19S-RP base the disc-like density adjacent to the α ring of the 20S-CP complex (Fig. 4, blue) is likely to correspond to the six AAA-ATPase subunits, Rpt1-6, in line with their previously suggested location (6Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), which is also consistent with that of the archaeal ATPase PAN complex, a homologue of Rpt1-6, when bound to the 20S-CP (15Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We found that the 19S-RP base binds the 20S-CP via a prominent L-shaped link which runs between the putative AAA-ATPase densities and the side of the α2 subunit of the 20S-CP (Figs. 4A and 6). It is interesting to note that this density is not recovered in the analysis of the single-capped proteasome complex (Fig. 4B). However, the fact that in this three-dimensional map the 20S-CP is well defined and that the overall architecture of the 19S-RP remaining densities resemble those in the double-capped complex indicates that the loss of these densities is not a consequence of inaccurate image analysis. It is, therefore, possible to suggest that the subunit corresponding to this L-shaped density may dissociate from the 26S proteasome as a precursor for the full 19S-RP disassembly. In the double-capped 26S proteasome three additional links appear to run parallel to the proteasome long axis, from the putative AAA-ATPase region to the 20S-CP subunits α5 and α6 and the interface between α7 and α1 (Fig. 6, links I, II, and III). The links to α5 and the interface between α7 and α1 are also clearly present in the single-capped proteasome three-dimensional map, although the link to α6 is only partially recovered. Interestingly, a recent study of the effects of Rpt1-6 C-terminal peptides on the mammalian 20S-CP activity suggested that the C terminus of Rpt2, Rpt5, and possibly Rpt1 interact with subunits within the α ring of the 20S-CP and are involved in gate opening and proteasome activation (16Smith D.M. Chang S.-C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We, therefore, suggest that these three links may correspond to the C-terminal regions of these Rpt subunits. Apart from the Rpt1-6, the 19S-RP base is also thought to contain the Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn10 subunits (6Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Rpn1 and Rpn2 are each relatively large (∼100 kDa) and sequence analysis by the Phyre server (17Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J.E. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) indicates they are substantially composed of armadillo repeats. Armadillo repeats frequently adopt a curved and elongated conformation (18Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The arced density (Fig. 4, magenta) found at a higher radius to the putative AAA-ATPase region appears to be of appropriate size and shape to correspond to one of these subunits. Both Rpn1 and Rpn2 have been predicted to be made up of curved α/α solenoids (19Kajava A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49791-49798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although in this earlier work toroidal models were proposed. A higher resolution analysis and specific subunit labeling are required to confirm the assignments proposed here and to establish the full subunit organization within the 19S-RP. Rearrangements in the 20S-CP α Rings Induced by 19S-RP Binding—The three-dimensional maps of double- and single-capped 26S proteasomes show evidence of rearrangements in the 20S-CP subunits from the crystal structure of the free mammalian 20S-CP. In the single-capped 26S proteasome this rearrangement is most prominent in the α ring adjacent to the 19S-RP (Fig. 7). The positions of individually fitted α subunits, adjacent to 19S-RPs, are characterized by shifts to a higher radius and the creation of a clear open channel close to the central axis of the 20S-CP (Figs. 5Bii and 7. A proteasome axialgated channel has been previously identified as resulting from the rearrangement of N-terminal strands of α2,α3, α4, and α5, without any overall subunit displacement in the crystal structure of 20S-CP in complex with PA26, an 11S regulator (20Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a complex formed between one PA200 cap, another 11 S regulator, and the 20S-CP has also been determined by cryoelectron microscopy and single particle analysis (21Ortega J. Heymann J.B. Kajava A.V. Ustrell V. Rechsteiner M. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As for the PA26 (20Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), the PA200 appears to induce the opening of an axial channel within the adjacent α ring without apparent radial displacement of the α subunits. Therefore, the rearrangement we observe in the α rings associated with the attachment of 19S-RPs appears to differ from those induced by 11 S regulators in that it involves not just a local loop reorganization but the radial movement of each of the α subunits, leading to a wider and more prominent channel into the proteolytic core. Such a channel is required for translocation of the target protein substrate, recognized and unfolded by the 19S-RP, into the proteolytic chamber of the 20S-CP. It is interesting to note that from the group of α subunits appearing to be most substantially displaced by the 19S-RP, namely α1, α4, α5, α6, and α7 (Fig. 5Biii), the subunits α5, α6, and the interface α1-α7 appear to be joined to the base of the 19S-RP by the links running parallel to the long axis of the proteasome (Fig. 6, links I, II, and III), described above as putative C-terminal ends of Rpt2, Rpt5, and possibly Rpt1 (16Smith D.M. Chang S.-C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It is, thus, tempting to suggest that these links and, therefore, the association with the 19S-RP, are coupled to the 20S-CP rearrangements associated with channel opening. The channel in the α rings adjacent to 19S-RPs should function as entry ports into the proteolytic chamber for protein chains unfolded by the 19S-RP and possibly also exit ports for cleaved peptides. The biological role of 11 S regulators is less well established. The 11 S regulators PA28 and PA200 are known to bind to the 20S-CP and activate its proteolysis of model peptides, but they do not recognize ubiquitinated proteins or hydrolyze ATP (22Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the 11 S regulators may form hybrid structures with one 20S-CP and a single 19S-RP (22Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P.

In this perspective it seems reasonable to suppose that a wider channel, as that shown here induced by 19S-RP binding, would be required for the entry of unfolded proteins compared with that required for exit of cleaved peptides, as originated by 11 S regulator binding. In this light it is interesting to note that Smith et al. (16Smith D.M. Chang S.-C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) concluded, from biochemical evidence, that the 20S-CP gate opening mechanisms differ for caps with ATPase subunits, such as the 19S-RP, compared with 11 S regulators. The three-dimensional map of the single-capped 26S proteasome (Figs. 4B and 7) constitutes an internal control to establish if the wider 20S-CP gate opening found in our double-capped proteasome three-dimensional map is indeed a consequence of the 19S-RP binding. Here, the subunit location in the 20S-CP rings adjacent to the 19S-RP can be compared with that at the free side of the 20S-CP (Fig. 7). This analysis revealed that indeed the fitted locations of the α subunits adjacent to the 19S-RP are equivalent to those observed in the double-capped 26S proteasome leading to a substantial aperture close to the 20S-CP central axis. Conversely, fitted positions for the α subunits at the opposite, free end of the 20S-CP are characterized by a significantly reduced radial displacement. In this region of the three-dimensional map there is no apparent axial aperture of the 20S-CP (Fig. 4Bv and 7, A and C). These observations demonstrate that the 20S-CP subunit reorganization observed in our maps indeed results from 19S-RP binding. Furthermore, although it is possible that conformational effects of the binding of a 19S-RP to the 20S-CP may extend to the α ring at the opposite uncapped end of the 20S-CP, any aperture formed at this end is more characteristic of the proposed exit port induced by 11 S regulator binding than the more substantial entry port in 20S-CP α rings bound to 19S-RP. Rearrangement in the β Subunit Rings—Independent fitting of the 20S subunits into the double- and single-capped 26S proteasome maps led to the β subunits being displaced to higher radius, although to a lesser extent than the α subunits (Fig. 5, B and C). The β rings of the uncapped 20S-CP form two relatively narrow apertures into the proteolytic inner chamber (11Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The 19S-RPs-induced radial shifts observed in the β subunits increase the radius of this aperture and may, therefore, serve to make the inner proteolytic sites more accessible to the unfolded substrate proteins. Such rearrangements may contribute to the enhanced proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome. As in the case of the α rings, one segment of the β rings (β1, β2, β5, β6, and β7) is substantially more displaced than the remaining two subunits (β3 and β4) (Fig. 5, Biii and Ciii). The observation that this region of the β rings is adjacent to that segment in the α rings showing the largest displacement is an indication of a coordinated effect of the 19S-RP on the whole 20S-CP. In this context it is interesting to note that communication between the β subunit ring and the 19S-RP has previously been suggested on the basis of stabilization of the interaction between 19S-RP and the 20S-CP induced by the inhibitor bortezomid, which binds to the β subunit proteolytic sites (23Kleijnen M.F. Roelofs J. Park S. Hathaway N.A. Glickman M. King R.W. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1180-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Consequences of Subunit Rearrangement—The overall effect of the subunit rearrangements shown here would be to facilitate substrate entry into the 20S-CP and to enhance its access to the β subunit proteolytic sites. It should be noted that the simple rigid body movements of the α and β subunits used to fit the current maps would alter interactions between the subunits and might, therefore, lead to reduced interaction energy. On the other hand, energy lost in this way may well be compensated by the binding energy of the 19S-RP to the 20S-CP. Furthermore, it is likely that these rigid body movements are accompanied by conformational rearrangements within the subunits which may serve to maintain much of their interaction geometry as seen in the crystal structure of the 20S-CP. Interestingly the magnitude of the subunit displacements found on the 20S-CP upon binding of the 19S-RP is quite similar to those observed in GroEL complexes on ATP hydrolysis (24Ranson N.A. Clare D.K. Farr G.W. Houldershaw D. Horwich A.L. Saibil H.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Conclusions—Our three-dimensional structural analysis of the human 26S proteasome shows for the first time that the binding of the 19S-RP itself causes a wide opening of a proteolytic gate in the 20S-CP, required for translocation of unfolded substrates into the proteolytic chamber. We show that the nature of this opening resides mostly in radial displacements of the α subunits of the 20S-CP adjacent to 19S-RPs but also that this may be transmitted further into the 20S-CP structure with the displacement of the β subunits, allowing wider access to the proteolytic sites. The analysis of an asymmetric proteasome complex formed by a 20S-CP associated with a single 19S-RP served as a control to demonstrate that the observed rearrangements were indeed associated with the binding of the regulatory cap, as in such complex the displacement of the 20S-CP subunits, compared with its crystallographic coordinates, are much less evident at the uncapped end of the complex. The new three-dimensional maps of the 26S proteasome presented here also serve as a basis for a preliminary exploration of the organization of some of the 19S-RP subunits.

The unique, carbocationic reaction mechanism of these enzymes can form multiple products from a single prenyl diphosphate substrate. Two maize genes were isolated that encode very similar sesquiterpene synthases, TPS6 and TPS11, which both produce β-bisabolene, a common monocyclic sesquiterpene, and β-macrocarpene, an uncommon bicyclic olefin. Investigation of the reaction mechanism showed that the formation of β-macrocarpene proceeds via a neutral β-bisabolene intermediate and requires reprotonation by a proton that may ultimately be abstracted from water. This reprotonation is dependent on the pH and the presence of a Mg2+ cofactor. Mutational analysis of the enzyme demonstrated that a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the active center of the enzymes is important for the protonation process. TPS6 and TPS11 are transcribed both in leaves and roots of maize, but the respective terpene products were only detected in roots. The expression in roots was up-regulated by herbivore damage to the leaves, suggesting a long distance signal transduction cascade between leaves and roots.

Terpenes form the largest group of plant secondary metabolites and are known to have a plethora of different functions both within the plant and in communication with other organisms. Most of the structural diversity among terpenes can be attributed to the terpene synthases, a large enzyme class that catalyzes the conversion of the ubiquitous prenyldiphosphates geranyldiphosphate (GPP), 2The abbreviations used are: GPP, geranyldiphosphate; FPP, farnesyldiphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyldiphosphate; TEAS, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame. 2The abbreviations used are: GPP, geranyldiphosphate; FPP, farnesyldiphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyldiphosphate; TEAS, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame. farnesyldiphosphate (FPP), or geranylgeranyldiphosphate (GGPP) into a large number of basic terpene skeletons (1Gershenzon J. Kreis W. Biochemistry of Plant Secondary Metabolism: Annual Plant Reviews. 2. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, UK1999: 222-299Google Scholar). A unique feature of terpene synthases is their capability to produce multiple products with different carbon skeletons from a single prenyldiphosphate substrate (2Croteau R. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 929-954Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3Cane D.E. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1089-1103Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). For example, δ-selinene synthase and γ-humulene synthase from Abies grandis synthesize 34 and 52 different sesquiterpenes from their farnesyl diphosphate substrate, respectively (4Steele C.L. Crock J. Bohlmann J. Croteau R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2078-2089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This unusual behavior is due to an electrophilic reaction mechanism common to all terpene synthases, which is initiated by elimination of the allylic diphosphate from the prenyl diphosphate substrate. The resulting highly reactive carbocationic intermediate undergoes a series of cyclizations, hydride shifts, and other rearrangements until the reaction is terminated by proton loss or the addition of a nucleophile (5Cane D.E. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1999: 155-200Google Scholar).In addition to highly active, carbocationic intermediates, sesquiterpene synthases like 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) from tobacco were also shown to produce stable, enzyme-bound intermediates (6Cane D.E. Prabhakaran P.C. Oliver J.S. McIlwaine D.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 3209-3210Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Facchini P.J. Chappell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11088-11092Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The structural elucidation of this sesquiterpene synthase provided insight into the reaction mechanism and structure-function relationships in the active center (8Starks C.M. Back K.W. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The reaction starts with the dephosphorylation and ionization of the (E,E)-FPP substrate to form a farnesyl cation, which undergoes a 1,10-cyclization to form a stable, enzyme-bound germacrene A intermediate (3Cane D.E. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1089-1103Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of TEAS, a catalytic triad consisting of a central tyrosine residue (Tyr520) and two aspartate residues (Asp444 and Asp525) was proposed to be involved in the protonation of the germacrene A intermediate (8Starks C.M. Back K.W. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In this model, a proton, which is abstracted from carbon atom 13 of the germacrenyl cation to form the neutral intermediate germacrene A, is transferred via the carboxyl group of aspartate 525 and hydroxyl group of tyrosine 520 back to a different position (C6) on the same carbon skeleton to form a second germacrenyl cation (8Starks C.M. Back K.W. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). An electrophilic attack on C2 results in a second cyclization and a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of a methyl group to form the eudesmane-type skeleton. Mutagenesis of tyrosine 520 to phenylalanine resulted in an enzyme that released only germacrene A (9Rising K.A. Starks C.M. Noel J.P. Chappell J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1861-1866Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A similar protonation of an intermediate was postulated for the 5-epi-aristolochene synthase from Capsicum annuum (10Back K.

To investigate all of these aspects of terpene production, we have been isolating and characterizing a family of terpene synthases in maize, a genetically tractable organism. Maize produces complex, tissue-specific blends of terpenes that have multiple roles in defense against herbivore enemies both above and below ground (13Rasmann S. Kollner T.G. Degenhardt J.

Here, we describe the very similar sesquiterpene synthases TPS6 and TPS11, which both produce β-bisabolene and β-macrocarpene. The formation of the unusual bicyclic sesquiterpene β-macrocarpene proceeds via a neutral β-bisabolene intermediate. The reprotonation requires a proton that may be ultimately abstracted from water and is transferred directly or indirectly via another proton donor to the substrate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant and Insect Material—Plants of the maize (Zea mays L.) variety B73 (KWS seeds, Einbeck, Germany) were grown in commercially available potting soil in a climate-controlled chamber with a 16-h photoperiod, 1 mmol (m2)–1 s–1 of photosynthetically active radiation, a temperature cycle of 22 °C/18 °C (day/night), and 65% relative humidity. 12–15-day-old plants (20–30 cm high, 4–5 expanded leaves) were used in all experiments. Eggs of Spodoptera littoralis Boisd. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were obtained from Aventis (Frankfurt, Germany) and were reared on an artificial wheat germ diet (Heliothis mix; Stonefly Industries, Bryan, TX) for about 10–15 days at 22 °C under an illumination of 750 μmol (m2)–1 s–1. For the S. littoralis treatments, three third instar larvae were enclosed on the middle portion of each plant in a cage made out of two halves of a Petri dish (9-cm diameter) with a circle cut out of each side and covered with gauze to allow for ventilation (16Degenhardt J. Gershenzon J. Planta. 2000; 210: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Isolation of the Maize Terpene Synthase cDNAs—Sequences with high similarity to plant terpene synthases were identified in BLAST searches of the Plant Genome Database PlantGDB (available on the World Wide Web). Two of these expressed sequence tags showing a high sequence similarity to each other were cloned, sequenced, and extended toward the 5′-end by the Marathon RACE procedure (Clontech) with a cDNA library from herbivore-induced leaves of the maize cultivar B73. The resulting sequences were amplified with the primers H8fwd (TATGGCTGCCCCAACACTAACTACAGA) and H10rev (GATCCTTCACATGAGTAC CGGCTTCACATAAAG) from a cDNA and introduced into the sequencing vector pCR®4-TOPO® (Invitrogen). Sequence alignments were performed with the DNASTAR suite of programs (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The cDNA sequences contained open reading frames of 1647 bp and were deposited in GenBank™ with the accession numbers AY518315 (tps6-B73) and EU716166 (tps11-B73).cDNA RACE Library Construction—10-day-old maize plants of the cultivar Delprim were subjected to herbivory by S. littoralis for 4 h. 1 g of leaf material was ground in a mortar to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and added to 10 ml of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The mixture was treated with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematika AG, Switzerland) for 1 min and incubated for 3 min on ice. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. From about 80 μg of total RNA, the mRNA was isolated utilizing poly(T)-coated ferromagnetic beads (Dynal, Sweden). The mRNA was transcribed into cDNA while constructing a Marathon RACE library according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech).Mapping of Terpene Synthase Genes—The method of Burr and Burr (17Burr B. Burr F.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 55-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was utilized to map the genes tps6 and tps11 in a population of 48 CM37xT232 and 41 Tx303xCO159 recombinant inbred lines kindly provided by R. Burr. Genomic Southern blots from all individuals of the population were probed with a 1200-bp fragment of tps6-B73 that cross-reacted with tps11 (for a detailed description of the probe, see the Northern blotting procedure below).Protein Overexpression and Enzyme Assay—For expression in Eschericha coli, the open reading frames (ORFs) of tps6 and tps11 were amplified with the primers H24fwd (ATGGTAACCTGCA TTAGCGCATGGCTGCCCCAACACTAACTA) and H25rev (ATGGTAACCTGCATTATATCACATGAGTACCGGCTTCACATAAAG) and cloned as BspMI fragments into the expression vector pASK-IBA7 (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). The constructs were introduced into the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced to avoid errors introduced by DNA amplification. Liquid cultures of the bacteria harboring the expression constructs were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Expression was induced by the addition of anhydrotetracycline (IBA GmbH) to a final concentration of 200 μg/liter. After a 20-h incubation at 18 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by a 4 × 30-s treatment with a sonicator (Bandelin UW2070, Berlin, Germany) in chilled extraction buffer (50 mm Mops, pH 7.0, with 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was desalted into assay buffer (10 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) by passage through a Econopac 10DG column (Bio-Rad).To determine the catalytic activity of the recombinant proteins, enzyme assays containing 20 μl of the bacterial extract and 80 μl of assay buffer with 10 μm substrate (either GPP, (E,E)-FPP, (Z,E)-FPP, or GGPP), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NaWO4, and 0.1 mm NaF in a Teflon-sealed, screw-capped 1-ml GC glass vial were performed. A SPME (solid phase microextraction) fiber consisting of 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (SUPELCO, Belafonte, PA) was placed into the headspace of the vial for 30 min of incubation at 30 °C. For analysis of the adsorbed reaction products, the SPME fiber was directly inserted into the injector of the gas chromatograph.For product identification by NMR, four assays each containing 300 μl of bacterial extract, 218 μg of (E,E)-FPP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NaWO4, and 0.1 mm NaF in a total volume of 600 μl of assay buffer were overlaid with 500 μl of n-pentane and incubated for 5 h at 25°C. The reaction products were extracted three times by mixing with each 500 μl of n-pentane. The n-pentane phases were merged and passed through a silica column to remove traces of farnesol and other oxygenated extraction products.For the determination of substrate Km values, an assay containing 10 μm [1-3H]geranyl or [1-3H](E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (37 GBq mol–1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.05 mm MnCl2 in 100 μl of assay buffer was used. The assay was overlaid with 1 ml of n-pentane to trap volatile products and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by mixing, and 0.5 ml of the n-pentane layer was taken for measurement of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting in 2 ml of Lipoluma mixture (Packard Bioscience, Groningen, The Netherlands) using a Packard Tricarb 2300TR liquid scintillation counter (3H efficiency = 61%). The Km values for the cofactors Mg2+ and Mn2+ and the influence of different metal ion cofactors on enzyme activity were measured with 10 μm (E,E)-FPP. The Km values were determined using seven substrate concentrations with four repetitions each. Assay results are reported as the mean of three independent replicate assays, and each experiment was repeated 2–3 times with similar results. The enzyme activity was linear for at least 30 min and stable for at least 1 year when stored at –80 °C.To analyze the protonation reaction, 100-μl aliquots of E. coli extract containing recombinant TPS6 were desalted in assay buffer, lyophilized, and dissolved in 100 μl of D2O (Merck) or 100 μl of H2O, respectively. The freshly dissolved protein samples were immediately analyzed in enzyme assays containing 100 μl of extract, 10 μm (E,E)-FPP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The assays were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were collected by SPME and analyzed by GC-MS.Gas Chromatography—A Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph was employed with the carrier gas helium at 1 ml min–1, splitless injection (injector temperature 220 °C, injection volume 1 μl), a DB-WAX column (polyethylene glycol, 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness; J & W, Folsom, CA) or a Chrompack CP-SIL-5 CB-MS column ((5% phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane, 25 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness; Varian), and a temperature program from 40 °C (3-min hold) at 5 °C min–1 to 240 °C (3-min hold). The coupled mass spectrometer was a Hewlett-Packard model 5973 with a quadrupole mass selective detector, transfer line temperature 230 °C, source temperature 230 °C, quadrupole temperature 150 °C, ionization potential 70 eV, and a scan range of 40–350 atomic mass units. Products were identified by comparison of retention times and mass spectra with authentic reference compounds as described by Köllner et al. (18Kollner T.G. Schnee C. Gershenzon J. Degenhardt J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1115-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed with the trace of a flame ionization detector operated at 250 °C. A nonyl acetate internal standard was utilized to determine the average and S.E. of 3–6 independent samples.The enantiomers of β-bisabolene were separated and identified by GC-MS using a heptakis (2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-cyclodextrin (35% in OV1701, w/w) column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.125-μm film; BGB Analytik, Adliswil, Switzerland) operated with helium (2 ml min–1) as carrier gas, splitless injection (220 °C, 2-μl volume), and a column temperature of 115 °C. A racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-β-bisabolene was prepared by dehydration of racemic α-bisabolol at 140 °C with acidic aluminum oxide as catalyst (19Konig W.A. Rieck A. Hardt I. Gehrcke B. Kubeczka K.H. Muhle H. J. High Resolut. Chromatogr. 1994; 17: 315-320Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The β-bisabolene enantiomers were identified by comparison with the bergamot (Citrus bergamia) essential oil, which contains only the (S)-enantiomer. The β-macrocarpene was kindly provided as an authentic standard by L. Cool (20Cool L.G. Phytochemistry. 2005; 66: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The enantiomers of β-macrocarpene were separated and identified by GC-MS performed with a Hewlett Packard HP6890 gas chromatograph interfaced to a MasSpec 2 magnetic sector mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) using a heptakis (2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-cyclodextrin (35% in OV1701, w/w) column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.125-μm film; BGB Analytik). Helium was used as a carrier gas (constant flow 1 ml min–1), and samples were injected split (1 ml) at 200 °C. Compounds were eluted with a temperature program: 40 °C for 2 min, heated at 3 °C/min to 200 °C with 5-min hold. Electron ionization-MS data were recorded in positive ion mode using 70 eV ionization energy.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—1H NMR, 1H,1H COSY, HMBC, and HMQC spectra were measured at 300 K on a Bruker Avance 500 NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) using a cryogenically cooled 5-mm TXI 1H{13C} probe.

The PCR-based mutagenesis protocol was performed with the tps11-B73 cDNA cloned into the expression vector pASK-IBA7 and primers containing the desired mutations (Y522F-fwd, CTGTAGACTACATGTTCAAGGAAGCTGATAAG; Y522F-rev, CTTATCAGCTTCCTTGAACATGTAGTCTACAG; D526N-fwd, CATGTACAAGGAAGCTAATAAGTACACTGTCTC; D526N-rev, GAGACAGTGTACTTATTAGCTTCCTTGTACATG). The mutagenized constructs were fully sequenced.RNA Hybridization—Plant RNA was prepared with the RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according the manufacturer's instructions. A 1200-bp fragment was used as a probe, generated by linear PCR with the primer 5′-CACCAGTGTACCTCCAATGCTTATGAGT-3′ and the complete ORF as a template. The probe was labeled with [32P]adenosine triphosphate using the Strip-EZ PCR procedure (Ambion, TX). Blotting on a Nytran-Plus nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), hybridization, and washing were carried out following standard procedures. The blots were exposed to BioMax MS1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen.Terpene Extraction—The plant material was harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder in a mortar. 3 g of tissue were extracted with 10 ml of n-pentane for 1 h at room temperature with constant rotation. After centrifugation at 1800 × g for 5 min to sediment the tissue, 800 ng of nonyl acetate were added to the n-pentane supernatant as an internal standard, and the solution was cleared with 25 mg of activated charcoal. The n-pentane was concentrated under a stream of nitrogen to a volume of 200 μl and stored at –20 °C overnight to remove waxes and other high molecular weight lipids by precipitation. The n-pentane phase containing the terpenes was analyzed by GC-MS and GC-flame ionization detection.RESULTSIsolation of the Maize Terpene Synthase Genes tps6 and tps11—The identification and biochemical characterization of terpene synthases in maize is crucial to our understanding of terpene-based plant defense reactions in this species. We have already characterized tps1, tps4, tps5, tps10, and tps23 (14Schnee C. Kollner T.G. Held M. Turlings T.C.J. Gershenzon J. Degenhardt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2049-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To identify additional terpene synthases, we screened the public maize sequence data base PlantGDB for sequences with similarity to these genes. Two of the identified sequences were extended by RACE PCR to obtain the complete ORFs. The resulting ORFs (1,647 nucleotides each) were amplified from cDNA of the maize inbred line B73 and designated tps6-B73 and tps11-B73. The genes have 96% nucleotide identity to each other (Fig. 1). The gene tps6-B73 also shares 99% nucleotide identity with umi2, a gene with unknown function previously isolated from the maize variety Early Golden Bantam (22Basse C.W. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Most likely, tps6-B73 and umi2 are alleles of each other. The deduced amino acid sequences of TPS6 and TPS11 contain the highly conserved terpene synthase sequence elements DDXXD (residues 302–306) and RXR (residues 265–267) (Fig. 1). No signal peptide was apparent in the N-terminal region of the proteins, indicating that both enzymes are located in the cytoplasm and likely to be sesquiterpene synthases (1Gershenzon J. Kreis W. Biochemistry of Plant Secondary Metabolism: Annual Plant Reviews. 2. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, UK1999: 222-299Google Scholar). Mapping of tps6 and tps11 within a population of T232xCM37 and CO159xTx303 inbred lines (17Burr B. Burr F.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 55-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) displayed only one segregating band in all individuals, indicating that tps6 and tps11 are in close proximity to each other. The genes were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 10 near the marker npi105A (Fig. 2A). No recombination was observed between both genes and another pair of terpene synthases, tps4 and tps5 (98% nucleotide identity to each other), which map to the same region (18Kollner T.G. Schnee C. Gershenzon J. Degenhardt J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1115-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Since there is about 58% sequence identity among the pairs (tps6 and tps11 versus tps4 and tps5) (Fig. 2B), there may have been at least two duplication events in this region of the chromosome.FIGURE 2The terpene synthases tps6 and tps11 are located in close proximity to tps4 and tps5 on chromosome 10. A, mapping with recombinant inbred lines shows one locus for tps6 and tps11 as well as tps4 and tps5 on maize chromosome 10. Likelihood of the odds (LOD) scores of the closest marker loci are shown. 10S and 10L indicate the short and long arm of chromosome 10, respectively. B, the dendrogram represents the amino acid sequence relationships of seven terpene synthases from maize. Sequence alignment was performed by the ClustalW method with default settings in the program module MegAlign of the DNASTAR package. Bootstrap values (n = 1000) are indicated as percentages. The accession numbers of the sequences are AAO18435 (TPS1), AAS88571 (TPS4), AAS88572 (TPS5), AAX99146 (TPS10), and EU259634 (TPS23).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TPS6 and TPS11 Both Produce the Bicyclic Sesquiterpene (–)-β-Macrocarpene—To determine the catalytic activity of the putative terpene synthases TPS6 and TPS11, we expressed both ORFs in E. coli. The partial purified recombinant enzymes were incubated with the potential substrates GPP, FPP, and GGPP. Although no enzymatic activity was observed in the presence of GGPP, both proteins were able to convert GPP and FPP into monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively (Fig. 3). In the presence of FPP, both TPS6 and TPS11 produced an uncommon sesquiterpene hydrocarbon as the major product along with the minor products, β-bisabolene and (E)-β-farnesene (Fig. 3A). Spectra of the major TSP6 product showed a well pronounced molecular [M]· +ion at m/z 204 with two unusual neutral losses of 56 Da (C4H8) and 68 Da (C5H8) formed by retro-Diels-Alder reactions. Catalytic hydrogenation using 10% platinum on carbon for 1 h formed a mixture of two monoenes, and extended hydrogenation for 6 h resulted in one saturated major product ([M]· +at m/z 208). The necessity of extended hydrogenation indicated two triply or quadruply substituted C=C double bonds in the TPS6 product. To fully identify this compound, a large scale enzyme assay was performed, and ∼1 mg of the reaction product was analyzed by NMR. The 1H NMR spectrum displayed characteristic signals of two geminal methyl groups (δ 0.915 and 0.919), a broad singlet (δ 1.65) of a methyl group on a double bond, and broad singlets attributable to the two olefinic protons (δ 5.46 and 5.42). Starting from these signals, 1H,1H-homocorrelation (1H,1H COSY) and 1H,13C-heterocorrelation NMR experiments (HSQC, HMBC) were used to assign the structure of the bicyclic sesquiterpene as 4′,5,5-trimethyl-1,1′-bi(cyclohexane)-1,3′-diene. A compound of this structure, named (S)-β-macrocarpene, was recently reported from Cupressus macrocarpa (20Cool L.G. Phytochemistry. 2005; 66: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The 1H NMR data of an authentic sample of this compound matched those of our sample isolated from maize. Enantiomeric analysis of the β-macrocarpene product (Fig. 4) and the β-bisabolene product (Fig. 5) revealed that the (S)-enantiomer was almost exclusively present in both cases. In the presence of GPP, both TPS6 and TPS11 catalyzed the formation of the acyclic monoterpenes, β-myrcene and linalool, along with minor amounts of the cyclic compounds limonene, α-thujene, sabinene, and α-terpinolene (Fig. 3, B and C).FIGURE 3Terpene products of the terpene synthases TPS6 and TPS11 measured in vitro. The enzymes were expressed in E. coli, extracted, and incubated with the substrates GPP and FPP. The resulting terpene products were identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W2085747651,"Recent studies show that earthquake faults may rupture at speeds exceeding the shear wave velocity of rocks. This supershear rupture produces in the ground a seismic shock wave similar to the sonic boom produced by a supersonic airplane. This shock wave may increase the destruction caused by the earthquake. We report that supershear earthquakes are characterized by a specific pattern of aftershocks: The fault plane itself is remarkably quiet whereas aftershocks cluster off the fault, on secondary structures that are activated by the supershear rupture. The post-earthquake quiescence of the fault shows that friction is relatively uniform over supershear segments, whereas the activation of off-fault structures is explained by the shock wave radiation, which produces high stresses over a wide zone surrounding the fault."

However, silencing RhoA alone or RhoA and RhoC did not completely suppress the stress fibers suggesting a residual “Rho-like” activity. RhoB, the third member of the Rho subclass, is a shortlived protein barely detectable in basal conditions. In various cell types, the silencing of RhoA induced a strong up-regulation of both total and active RhoB protein levels that were rescued by re-expressing RhoA and related to an enhanced half-life of the protein. The RhoA-dependent regulation of RhoB does not depend on the activity of RhoA but is mediated by its GDP-bound form. The stabilization of RhoB was not dependent on isoprenoid biosynthesis, Rho kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 mitogen-activated kinase, or phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase pathways but required RhoGDIα. The forced expression of RhoGDIα increased RhoB half-life, whereas its knock-down antagonized the induction of RhoB following RhoA silencing. Moreover, a RhoA mutant (RhoAR68E) unable to bind RhoGDIα was significantly less efficient as compared with wild-type RhoA in reversing RhoB up-regulation upon RhoA silencing. These results suggest that, in basal conditions, RhoGDIα is rate-limiting and the suppression of RhoA makes it available to stabilize RhoB.

Our results highlight RhoGDIα-dependent cross-talks that regulate the stability of RhoGTPases. The small GTPases of the Rho family are at the cross-roads of signaling pathways initiated by receptors to diffusible biological mediators and those depending on cell-adhesion receptors. They are key signaling molecules regulating a plethora of biological pathways (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases shuttle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Their level of activation is regulated by three classes of factors: the guanine-nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze the exchange of GDP to GTP, the GAPs that increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of the RhoGTPase, and the RhoGDIs that inhibit the exchange of GDP to GTP. However, their mechanism of action may not be solely restricted to activation of downstream signaling cascades when GTP-loaded (2Arozarena I. Matallanas D. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21878-21884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In mammals, RhoGDIs constitute a family encompassing three members: RhoGDIα, the ubiquitously expressed archetypal member of the family; Ly/D4-GDI or RhoGDIβ, which has a hematopoietic tissue-specific expression pattern; and RhoGDI-3 or -γ, which is membrane-anchored and preferentially expressed in brain, pancreas, lung, kidney, and testis. RhoGDIs are usually perceived as “static” inhibitors preventing the activation of the downstream effectors by the RhoGTPases. Accumulative evidences suggest that RhoGTPase-RhoGDI complexes are highly dynamic. Phosphorylation of RhoGDIα by various kinases that decreases its affinity for RhoGTPases is one mechanism used by receptors to activate specific Rho-GTPases (3DerMardirossian C. Schnelzer A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4DerMardirossian C. Rocklin G. Seo J.Y. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4760-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By contrast, phosphorylation of the RhoGTPases themselves seems to increase their affinity for RhoGDIα thus leading to signal termination (5Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Beliveau R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J.

Res. 2005; 96: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a novel function has been attributed to RhoGDIα in the activation of NADPH oxidase by its capacity to present the RhoGTPase to the appropriate effectors in a way that potentiates efficient activation (8Carol R.J. Takeda S. Linstead P. Durrant M.C. Kakesova H. Derbyshire P. Drea S. Zarsky V. Dolan L. Nature. 2005; 438: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 9Di-Poi N. Faure J. Grizot S. Molnar G. Pick E. Dagher M.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10014-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that a Rac1 mutant displaying an increased affinity for RhoGDIα stimulated the activity of RhoA suggesting that RhoGDI is a key intermediate in the cross-talks between RhoA and Rac1 (10Wong K.W. Mohammadi S. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40379-40388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Among the RhoGTPase family, the Rho subclass includes RhoA, its closely related homolog RhoC, and RhoB. By contrast to RhoA and RhoC, RhoB is a short-lived protein displaying anti-tumorigenic properties (11Ridley A.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In various solid tumors, RhoB expression diminished in parallel with tumor progression (12Adnane J. Muro-Cacho C. Mathews L.

Cancer Gene Ther. 2008; 15: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoB was reported to be an essential component of the anti-tumoral response triggered by farnesyl transferase inhibitors as well as of the apoptotic response of transformed cells to DNA damaging agents (16Du W. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5492-5496PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu A. Cerniglia G.J. Bernhard E.J. Prendergast G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating RhoB expression and stability is of great importance for the optimization of potential anti-cancer strategies. In this report, we targeted RhoGTPases by using a siRNA 4The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HSF, human skin fibroblast; p38MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase; ROCK, Rho kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. -based approach. This technology that recently allowed us to highlight the regulation operated by Cdc42 on matrix metallo-protease-1 (18Deroanne C.F. Hamelryckx D. Ho T.T. Lambert C.A. Catroux P. Lapiere C.M.

Beside a higher specificity, siRNA suppresses both GDP- and GTP-bound forms allowing to better evaluate the contribution of either form in the global function of individual RhoGTPase. Silencing RhoA led to an increased RhoB expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism extending the half-life of the protein. Our results demonstrated that this regulation is mediated by RhoA-GDP. Investigation of various intracellular signaling pathways suggested a role of a RhoGDIα-dependent mechanism in this process.

For the 28 S rRNA, the efficiency of the RT-PCR was controlled by a synthetic RNA co-transcribed and co-amplified with the same primers as the endogenous RNA to yield an amplification product of slightly larger size. The RT-PCR conditions were described elsewhere (18Deroanne C.F. Hamelryckx D. Ho T.T. Lambert C.A. Catroux P. Lapiere C.M. Nusgens B.V. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ng of total RNA and a known copy number of the standard synthetic RNA were reverse transcribed (70 °C for 15 min). Then, RNA-DNA heteroduplexes were denatured for 2 min at 94 °C and amplification was carried out for 22 cycles (RhoA and mRhoA) or for 17 cycles (28 S rRNA) at 94 °C for 15 s, 66 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s (10 s for 28 S rRNA). The RT-PCR products were quantified after electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and staining (Gelstar, FMC BioProducts) using a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells 48 h after transfection with siRNA using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). 100 ng of total RNA were reversed transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of cDNA (corresponding to 10 ng of total RNA for RhoB amplification and corresponding to 0.1 ng of total RNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification), 300 nm of each primer and 10 μl of the qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR® Green (Eurogentec) in the Abi Prism 7000 Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems). The results were normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. PCR was performed with the following primers: RhoB, forward, 5′-GCCACGCGCGCCGCGCTGCA-3′, reverse, 5′-CCGGCAGGGGCAGGCGCGAC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: forward, 5′-CCTGGCCAAGGTCATCCATGACA-3′, reverse, 5′-GGGATGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTT-3′. Creation of the Various Expression Vectors and Cell Transfection—The entire coding sequence of human RhoA was amplified by RT-PCR. The amplification product was mutated by means of a PCR-based approach with mutated primers. Five silent mutations were introduced in the sequence targeted by the 1st siRhoA to make it resistant to this siRNA. The mutated RhoA cDNA (mRhoA) was cloned into pcDNA3 and pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). Sequencing confirmed that the five expected mutations were introduced into the cDNA. Rescue experiments with HS578T cells were carried out as previously described (18Deroanne C.F. Hamelryckx D. Ho T.T. Lambert C.A. Catroux P. Lapiere C.M. Nusgens B.V. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first transfected with 6 nm siScr or 6 nm siRhoA for 14–16 h following the protocol described above. Immediately after washing, each pool of cells was trypsinized and seeded in two wells of 6-well plates. Three hours later, 1 μg of pcDNA4/TO or pcDNA4/TO/mRhoA were transfected into cells for 20–24 h with 3 μl of Genejuice™ (Novagen). Cells were washed and cultured for a further 24 h before being processed for immunoblotting analysis. Rescue experiments were also carried out with PC-3 cells engineered to express mRhoA in a tetracycline-dependent way. For this purpose, PC-3 cells were first transfected with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) and selected in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml blasticidin. A clone expressing a high level of tetracycline repressor (PC-3/TR) was isolated. PC-3/TR cells were transfected with either the empty pcDNA4/TO or the pcDNA4/TO/mRhoA and selected in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml blasticidin + 200 μg/ml Zeocin. 3 clones of cells transfected with pcDNA4/TO (PC-3/TR/control) and 3 clones of cells transfected with pcDNA4/TO/mRhoA (PC-3/TR/mRhoA) were isolated and amplified. For rescue experiments, the PC-3/TR/control and the PC-3/TR/mRhoA clones were seeded at subconfluence in medium without blasticidin and Zeocin. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with 6 nm siScr or 6 nm siRhoA for 14–16 h following the procedure described above. Immediately after washing, each pool of transfected cells was trypsinized and separated in two parts, the first was cultured with normal medium and the second with medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. 48 h later, cells were processed for immunoblotting analysis and a measure of the expression level of both endogenous and mutated RhoA mRNA by RT-PCR. The entire coding sequence of human RhoA was amplified by RT-PCR. A point mutation was introduced in the amplification product by means of a PCR-based approach with mutated primers to generate a cDNA encoding RhoAN19, the dominant negative form of RhoA. The entire sequence was cloned into pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). Sequencing confirmed that the expected point mutation was introduced into the cDNA. PC-3/TR cells were transfected with the pcDNA4/TO/RhoAN19 and selected in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml blasticidin + 200 μg/ml Zeocin. 3 clones (PC-3/TR/RhoAN19) expressing in a tetracycline-dependent way a dominant-negative RhoA were isolated and amplified. The functionality of the dominant-negative RhoA was tested with a GTPase assay as described below. To generate the RhoAR68E mutant, 4 mutations were introduced in the mRhoA cDNA. A HA-tagged RhoB was generated by amplifying the whole human RhoB cDNA with a forward primer including the sequence coding for the HA-FLAG plus a start codon (MYPYDVPDYA) upstream of the first 22 nucleotides of the human RhoB coding sequence and a classical reverse primer hybridizing at the end of the coding sequence. To generate the HA-tagged RhoBR68E, 3 mutations were introduced in the HA-RhoB sequence by a PCR-based approach. These three cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA4/TO. The entire coding sequence of human RhoGDIα was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pcDNA3 (pcDNA3_RhoGDIα). The integrity of the four cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing. For plasmid transfection, HS578T cells were seeded in 6-well plates. 3 h after seeding, a total amount of 1 μg of plasmid was transfected into cells for 20–24 h with 3 μl of Genejuice™ (Novagen). Rho Translocation Assay—A Rho translocation assay was performed as described previously (22Chaplet M. Detry C. Deroanne C. Fisher L.W. Castronovo V. Bellahcene A. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Yoshida M. Sawada T. Ishii H. Gerszten R.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Yasukochi Y. Numano F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HS578T cells were incubated with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant corresponding to the cytosol fraction was collected and the pellet resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant corresponding to the membrane fraction was collected. GTPase Assays—The assay was carried out as previously described (24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 25Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were chilled on ice and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged for 8 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. An aliquot of each supernatant collected before freezing was denatured in SDS-PAGE lysis buffer to measure the total RhoGTPase content by Western blotting. For pull-down assays, supernatants were incubated for 30 min with 30 μg of GST-PBD protein containing the Cdc42 and Rac binding region of PAK-1B, or GST-RBD protein containing the Rho binding region of rhotekin affinity linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 4 times in lysis buffer and boiled in 60 μl of SDS-PAGE lysis buffer. Determination of RhoB Protein Stability—48 h after transfection with siRNA or 24 h after transfection with plasmids cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide, at a concentration that effectively blocked synthesis of the RhoB protein (26Stamatakis K. Cernuda-Morollon E. Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49389-49396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the RhoB protein levels were analyzed by Western blot at various time points after cycloheximide addition. Cytoskeleton Labeling—For fibrillar actin labeling, HS578T cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The samples were blocked with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min and incubated with 50 ng/ml of phalloidin-TRITC and with 50 ng/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 30 min. Fluorescence was analyzed with a Leica DMRB microscope. A minimum of 100 cells in each condition tested were analyzed to determine the percentage of cells displaying stress fibers. Silencing RhoA and RhoC Does Not Completely Suppress the Actin Stress Fibers—RhoA is a key determinant in the organization of actin cytoskeleton and cell shape. However, its specific repression, up to 95%, in various cell types with two different sets of siRNA did not alter the cell morphology of either actin stress fibers formation (Refs. 18Deroanne C.F. Hamelryckx D. Ho T.T. Lambert C.A. Catroux P. Lapiere C.M. Nusgens B.V. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and 21Deroanne C. Vouret-Craviari V. Wang B. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). According to the data published by Simpson and co-workers (27Simpson K.J. Dugan A.S. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8694-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), this lack of morphological alteration could be due to a compensatory mechanism between RhoA and RhoC. We tested this hypothesis by a double silencing of RhoA and RhoC. Although the morphology of human breast adenocarcinoma cell HS578T was somewhat altered by this double knock-down, stress fibers were still visible, suggesting a residual “Rho-like” activity (Fig. 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that it might be related to the activity of the third member of the Rho subclass, RhoB. This RhoGTPase is indeed able to activate effectors such as ROCK and to induce the formation of actin stress fibers. RhoA-dependent Regulation of RhoB—RhoB is a short-lived and inducible protein that is barely detectable as observed by Western blot analysis of whole lysate of mock-transfected cells or of cells transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 2). The knockdown of RhoA in HS578T cells induced a significant up-regulation of the RhoB protein level (Fig. 2). RhoB concentration was also slightly increased upon RhoC silencing, whereas the double silencing of RhoA and RhoC induced its dramatic increase as compared with the single silencing of RhoA (Fig. 2). The negative regulation of RhoB operated by RhoA and RhoC was also observed in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, A2058 melanoma cells, in primary HSF (Fig. 2), and in human prostate PC-3 adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 4B) suggesting that it represents a wide spread mechanism. Similar results were observed by using a second siRNA targeting another sequence of RhoA or RhoC mRNA (Fig. 3A). To further validate our observations, we designed control siRNA with two nucleotide changes from the target sequence (CtrRhoA and CtrRhoC) as recommended in Ref. 28Pulverer B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar. As illustrated in supplementary Fig. S1, the use of these controls confirmed the negative regulations operated by RhoA and RhoC on RhoB but also the specificity of the cross-regulations between RhoA and RhoC. By contrast, the silencing of Rac1 or Cdc42 with our previously published siRNA sequences (18Deroanne C.F. Hamelryckx D. Ho T.T. Lambert C.A. Catroux P. Lapiere C.M. Nusgens B.V. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) did not affect RhoB protein level (Fig. 3A). The induction of RhoB following RhoA silencing was observed at a concentration of siRNA as low as 0.2 nm (Fig. 3B). To definitively ascertain the specificity of the negative regulation operated by RhoA on RhoB expression, the silencing of RhoA was rescued by re-expressing a RhoA mRNA resistant to the first siRNA targeting RhoA by introducing five neutral mutations impairing the silencing by this siRNA (mRhoA) (Fig. 4). HS578T cells were first transfected with scrambled siRNA or the first siRNA targeting RhoA. Immediately after washing and trypsinization, each pool of transfected cells was separated in two halves and transfected either with empty pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/mRhoA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transient re-expression of RhoA reversed at least partly the overexpression of RhoB (Fig. 4A). The residual RhoB (40%) could be due to the presence of some cells that were not transfected by pcDNA3/mRhoA. The strong (more than 10 times the physiological level) and transient (∼24 h) re-expression of RhoA is obviously not the most appropriate manner to rescue silencing. To reverse more adequately RhoA silencing, we transfected PC-3 cells stably expressing a repressor sensitive to tetracycline (PC-3/TR) with an empty inducible vector (pcDNA4/TO) or with the same vector encoding mRhoA (pcDNA4/TO/mRhoA) to generate, respectively, control clones (PC-3/TR/control) or clones expressing mRhoA in a tetracycline-dependent way (PC-3/TR/mRhoA). Three clones of PC-3/TR/control cells and 3 clones of PC-3/TR/mRhoA cells were isolated. These clones were transfected with 6 nm scrambled siRNA or 6 nm siRhoA. Immediately after washing and trypsinization, each pool of transfected cells was separated in two halves and cultured for 2 days either in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were then processed for Western blot or RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4B). RT-PCR analysis revealed that endogenous RhoA was similarly repressed in the absence or presence of tetracycline, whereas the mutated RhoA was significantly induced by tetracycline. The re-expression of the RhoA protein in these conditions nearly completely reversed the overexpression of RhoB, whereas treatment of PC-3/TR/control cells with tetracycline did not affect the RhoB protein level. These results definitively confirm the negative regulation operated by RhoA on RhoB. It should be noted that the re-expression of RhoA also reversed the up-regulation of RhoC upon RhoA silencing (supplementary Fig. S2).FIGURE 4The rescue of RhoA silencing reverses RhoB overexpression. A, representative Western blot analysis with specific antibodies to RhoA, RhoB, or ERK1,2 of whole cell lysates of HS578T transfected with 6 nm of an irrelevant siRNA (siScr) or 6 nm of the first siRNA targeting RhoA (siRhoA) and 1 μg of empty pcDNA3 (vector) or pcDNA3/mRhoA (mRhoA).

The pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS variant is up-regulated by ceramide and down-regulated by protein kinase C through specific cis-acting exonic elements, one of which is bound by SAP155. Splicing to the Bcl-xS 5 ′ splice site is also enforced by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F/H proteins and by Sam68 in cooperation with hnRNP A1. Here, we have characterized exon elements that influence splicing to the 5 ′ splice site of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL isoform. Within a 86-nucleotide region (B3) located immediately upstream of the Bcl-xL donor site we have identified two elements (ML2 and AM2) that stimulate splicing to the Bcl-xL 5 ′ splice site. SRp30c binds to these elements and can shift splicing to the 5 ′ splice site of Bcl-xL in an ML2/AM2-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. The B3 region also contains an element that represses the use of Bcl-xL. This element is bound by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and contains two 5 ′ splice sites that can be used when the Bcl-xL 5 ′ splice site is mutated or the ML2/AM2 elements are deleted. Conversely, mutating the cryptic 5 ′ splice sites stimulates splicing to the Bcl-xL site. Thus, SRp30c stimulates splicing to the downstream 5 ′ splice site of Bcl-xL, thereby attenuating the repressive effect of upstream U1 snRNP binding sites. Alternative 5 ′ splice site selection allows Bcl-x to produce two isoforms with opposite effects on apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS variant is up-regulated by ceramide and down-regulated by protein kinase C through specific cis-acting exonic elements, one of which is bound by SAP155.

Alternative splicing is used by most metazoans from plants to vertebrates to expand the repertoire of proteins produced from a limited set of genes (1Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 2Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Humans in particular make ample use of this process since nearly 70% of our multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced (3Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z. Loerch P.M. Armour C.D. Santos R. Schadt E.E. Stoughton R. Shoemaker D.D. Science. 2003; 302: 2141-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). A great diversity of factors are implicated in the control of splice site selection. In mammals, hnRNP 2The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s); RT, reverse transcription. and SR proteins form two families of RNA binding proteins that play a variety of functions in this process (4Black D.L.

PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For example, the binding of hnRNP A1 and hnRNP H in introns can stimulate intron definition or promote exon skipping (6Martinez-Contreras R. Fisette J.F. Nasim F.U. Madden R. Cordeau M. Chabot B. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Chabot B. LeBel C. Hutchison S. Nasim F.H. Simard M.J. Jeanteur P. Regulation of alternative splicing. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 59-88Google Scholar), a situation that may be relevant to the mechanism of action of other hnRNP-like proteins such as Nova-1 (8Ule J. Stefani G. Mele A. Ruggiu M. Wang X. Taneri B. Gaasterland T. Blencowe B.J. Darnell R.B. Nature. 2006; 444: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding of SR proteins in alternative exons often promotes exon inclusion by antagonizing the repressing activity of nearby-bound hnRNP proteins (5Sanford J.R. Longman D. Caceres J.F. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2003; 31: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SR proteins can also have dual functions in splicing control. For example, although the interaction of SRp30c in the alternative exons of SMN2 and gonadotropin-release hormone stimulates its inclusion (9Park E. Han J. Son G.H. Lee M.S. Chung S. Park S.H.

Immunol. 2004; 4: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the functional impact of the multitude of splice variants is still poorly documented. The contribution of alternative splicing to protein function has been studied in more detail in the field of apoptosis where splicing variants for receptors (e.g. Fas, LARD), adaptors (e.g. TRAF2), and several caspases display antagonistic functions (21Schwerk C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Bcl-x remains a popular example because alternative splicing produces a long anti-apoptotic splice variant (Bcl-xL) and a short pro-apoptotic isoform (Bcl-xS). The relative proportion of the Bcl-x splice isoforms is often altered in cancer cells (22Tu Y. Renner S. Xu F. Fleishman A. Taylor J. Weisz J. Vescio R. Rettig M. Berenson J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C.

The U2 snRNP protein SAP155 was shown to associate with CRCE1, and its genetic depletion improved the production of Bcl-xS (32Massiello A. Roesser J.R. Chalfant C.E. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1680-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cytokines also affect the ratio of the Bcl-x isoforms, and an intronic region downstream of the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site has been implicated in mediating these effects (33Li C.Y. Chu J.Y. Yu J.K. Huang X.Q. Liu X.J. Shi L. Che Y.C. Xie J.Y. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Sam68 by Fyn favors the production of Bcl-xL in cooperation with hnRNP A1 (34Paronetto M.P. Achsel T. Massiello A. Chalfant C.E. Sette C. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified an element in exon 2 (SB1) that represses splicing to the downstream Bcl-xS 5′ splice site (35Revil T. Toutant J. Shkreta L. Garneau D. Cloutier P. Chabot B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8431-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The repressor activity of SB1 requires active protein kinase C in 293 cells. Finally, we also observed that the Bcl-xS 5′ splice site is stimulated by downstream G-rich elements bound by hnRNP F/H proteins (36Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The same study also reported that deleting a 86-nt portion (B3) upstream of the 5′ splice site of Bcl-xL decreased the production of Bcl-xL in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that B3 contains three elements that modulate the Bcl-x splicing ratio. Two elements stimulate the production of Bcl-xL, and their activity is mediated specifically by SRp30c. The third element contains two 5′ splice site sequences and has an opposite effect on Bcl-xL usage. Our results highlight the combinatorial nature of the B3 element and the complexity of effectors controlling the alternative splicing of Bcl-x. Plasmids—pS2.13, pX2.13, and ΔB3 derivatives have been described previously (36Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). pS2.13ΔAM results from a religation after cleavage of pS2.13 with AccI and MscI and Klenow treatment. pS2.13ΔML was produced by amplifying with oligos HincII and XL+MscI. Products were cleaved with HincII and MscI and reintroduced in pS2.13 cut with the same enzymes. Most of the other deletion mutants were produced in a similar way; the sense oligo carrying the mutation was paired with oligo HincII, whereas in a second reaction the antisense oligo carrying the mutation was paired with the NcoI oligonucleotide (supplemental Table 1). Both PCR products derived from these sets of oligos were mixed for a second round of amplification with the terminal oligos. The resulting fragments were cut with HincI and NcoI and ligated in pS2.13 cut with the same enzymes. The individual mutations were transferred in the pX2.13 background by purifying the XhoI (Klenow-filled)-XbaI fragments and inserting it at the EcoRV and XbaI sites of pX2.13. pVSBA and pVSBAΔB3 were constructed by amplifying the Bcl-x portion (from exon 2 to 52 bp of intron sequence) using either pX2.13 or pX2.13ΔB3 with primers XNF (GCTGGCTAGCGTTTAAACTTAAGCTTA) and XAR (TAGACGTGCAGGTGGATCTCTGACCAGAG). Plasmid pSPAd and primers AXAF (TCAGAGATCCACCTGCACGTCTAGGGCGCAG) and A3R (TAATCTAGAGGCCGAGGGTTTCCGATCCAA) were used for amplification of 3′ adenovirus portion that contained 77 and 66 bp of adenovirus intron and exon sequences, respectively. The final PCR product was amplified using the first and second PCR fragments and primers XNF and A3R. Insertion of final PCR products into NheI-blunted pcDNA3+ vector produced plasmids pVSBA and pVSBAΔB3. Primers T1187-203F (CTGTGCGTGGAAAGCG) and A3R were used on pVSBA and pVSBAΔB3 to amplify fragments that were inserted into SacII/XbaI sites of pKS, thereby providing a shortened exon 2 fragment that lacked the 5′ splice site for Bcl-xS. The SmaI-linearized plasmids pKVSBAnoS and pKVSBAΔB3noS were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. All plasmids were extensively digested with restriction enzymes and sequenced for confirmation. Plasmids used for the production of recombinant SRp30c have been described previously (12Simard M.J. Chabot B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4001-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transfection Assays—Plasmid transfections were carried out with polyethyleneimide (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Five μg of polyethyleneimide were mixed with 1 μg of DNA in 200 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). The mixture was applied to cells for 6 h at 37°C. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (Wisent, St-Bruno, Québec, Canada) was then added, and the cells incubated for 24 to 48 h. In all cases RNA was extracted from cells or transfected cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) using the procedure described by the manufacturer. Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR. Reverse transcription was carried out with oligonucleotide RT3, and PCR was carried out with oligonucleotides X3 and RT2. In Vitro Transcription—Pre-mRNA substrates for in vitro splicing assays were prepared by PCR amplification using the polymerase Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligos AvT3 and X2B (0.1 μg/μl) on plasmid S2.13 and derivatives. The PCR fragments were gel-purified and transcribed using homemade T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of traces of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using standard protocols (37Chabot B. Higgins S.J. Hanes B.D. RNA Processing; A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-30Google Scholar). Transcripts were fractionated on denaturing acrylamide gels and gel-purified. Transcripts were resuspended at a final concentration of 2 fmol/μl. In some cases transcripts were prepared by direct transcription from the plasmid, and the RNA was purified as above. For the B3+ transcript and its derivative, PCR fragments were produced using oligos T3B3 (bearing the T3 promoter sequence) and X-5L and plasmid S2.13 or its 2xΔ derivative. Hot transcripts were produced from these templates using [α-32P]UTP as described in Chabot (1994). RNAs were resuspended at 100,000 cpm/μl. In Vitro Splicing—Two fmol of transcript were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in a mixture containing 5 μl of HeLa nuclear extract (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), 2.5 μl of polyvinyl alcohol 13%, 0.5 μl of ATP 12.5 mm, 0.5 μl of MgCl2 80 mm, 0.25 μl of RNAguard, 0.25 μl of dithiothreitol 100 mm, 0.5 μl of creatine phosphate 0.5 m, and 0.5 μlof creatine kinase 2 units/μl (Roche Applied Science). After incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding 450 μl of sodium acetate 0.3 m and 0.1% SDS. After an extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 35 μg of glycogen. The final pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of water. To monitor splicing, 2 μl of the above final RNA mixtures were reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37°C with the Omniscript reverse transcriptase in a final volume of 10 μl using the Qiagen kit (Qiagen Corp., Valencia, CA), oligo X2B, and RNAguard. One μl of the mixture was then incubated with 0.5 μl each of oligos X2 and X3 (0.1 μg/μl), 0.2 μlof Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl), 2.5 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 500 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), 20 μlofH2O, 0.2 μl of a mixture of dNTPs at 10 mm each, and 0.1 μlof[α-32P]dCTP 3000 Ci/mmol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR cycle consisted in a denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The incubation was terminated with 3 min at 72 °C. Samples were fractionated on a native acrylamide gel which was exposed for 2 h on a film with a screen. The gel was also analyzed on a PhosphorImager Storm 860 (GE Healthcare) for quantification. Gel-shift Assay—RNA oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were 5′ end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the labeled material was purified on a MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Healthcare). Recombinant SRp30c (in D buffer) was incubated with 5000 cpm of the labeled RNAs, as in splicing mixtures in a total volume of 6.25 μl. After an incubation of 5 min on ice, we added 1.75 μl of a mixture containing heparin (25 μg/μl), 25% glycerol, 0.5 m EDTA and 0.2% of bromphenol blue was added. The material was loaded on a native 5% acrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine, and 5% glycerol that was pre-run for 30 min at 130 V. The gel was exposed on XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For complex formation analysis, native gels were run as described previously (39Chabot B. Frappier D. La Branche H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5197-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and treatment with the anti-snRNA oligonucleotides were carried out as described (40Gendron D. Carriero S. Garneau D. Villemaire J. Klinck R. Abou Elela S. Damha M.J. Chabot B. BMC Biotechnol. 2005; 6: 5Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Fifty thousand cpm of B3+ transcript or derivative were incubated in an in vitro splicing mixture (without RNAguard) for 10 min at 30 °C. The sample was then submitted to 500 mJ of UV radiation using the UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). We then proceeded to an RNase A digestion (1 μg/μl) for 30 min at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by adding 2.5 μlof anti-SRp30c antibody (13Paradis C. Cloutier P. Shkreta L. Toutant J. Klarskov K. Chabot B. RNA. 2007; 13: 1287-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) followed with 50 μl of activated protein A CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare) and by washing four times in a NET2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). All samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). Gels were exposed 72 h on XAR film. Affinity Chromatography—The midAM RNA oligo was coupled to agarose-adipic acid beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty-five μl of these beads were then incubated in 93.75 μlof in vitro splicing mixture including the nuclear extract but without polyvinylalcohol for 10 min at 30 °C. To assess the role of U1 snRNP, the nuclear extract was incubated with a 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ end of U1 snRNA. The beads were eluted twice with 200 μl of buffer D then washed twice in 400 μlofthe same buffer. The elution and washing steps were repeated with increasing amounts of KCl (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 m) followed by a final elution in Laemmli buffer. The eluted proteins were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was silver-stained, and the bands of interest were cut out and destained. In-gel trypsin digestion and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the Genome Quebec Innovation Center at McGill University. The B3 Element Acts as an Enhancer for the 5′ Splice Site of Bcl-xL—We have shown previously that the deletion of a 86-nt region upstream of the 5′ splice site of Bcl-xL decreases the use of this splice site in vivo and in vitro (36Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We constructed a variety of deletion mutants (Fig. 1, A and B) to identify regions within B3 that are responsible for this activity in vitro and in vivo. Transcripts were produced (S2.13 and derivatives) and incubated in a HeLa nuclear extract for 2 h at 30°C. Using RT-PCR to assess the production of the xS and xL splice isoforms, we confirmed that B3 is important for Bcl-xL usage in a HeLa extract since its removal shifts splicing to the Bcl-xS 5′ splice site (Fig. 1C, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Removing the 3′ half of B3 (ΔML) had an effect that was almost as strong as ΔB3 (Fig. 1C, compare lane 6 with lane 4). Deleting the upstream and downstream halves of ML (ΔML1 and ΔML2, respectively) indicated that ML2 was the active portion that enforced splicing to the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site (lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, removing the first half of B3 (ΔAM) did not affect Bcl-x splicing (Fig. 1C, lane 5). However, although removing the upstream portion of AM (ΔAM1) had no effect, removing the downstream half (ΔAM2) slightly decreased the relative level of Bcl-xL (lane 8). A deletion encompassing AM2 and the inactive ML1 region (ΔmidB3, lane 11) confirmed the positive contribution of AM2 to Bcl-xL splicing. Deleting both ML2 and AM2 (2xΔ) almost completely eliminated splicing to the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site in vitro (Fig. 1D, lane 5). The deletion of midAM did not decrease the relative production of Bcl-xL (Fig. 1D, lane 6), whereas ΔmidMID did (lane 7), suggesting that the active portion in AM2 is at the 3′ end of this element. The most active portion of ML2 also appeared to be near its 3′ end since the magnitude of the effect of ΔmidML was not as important as that observed with ΔML2 (Fig. 1, D, lane 8, and C, lane 10, respectively). The impact of these deletions on Bcl-x splicing was verified in vivo by transfecting CMV promoter-driven minigenes in HeLa cells (Fig. 1E). The parent minigene X2.13 contains the same Bcl-x portion as the S2.13 transcript used in vitro. Although transcripts produced from the parent minigene are spliced preferentially to the Bcl-xs 5′ splice site (36Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the deletion of B3 abrogates the production of Bcl-xL, an outcome also observed with ΔML and ΔML2 (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 4, and 8). The in vitro impact of all the other deletions was confirmed in vivo except for ΔAM1 and ΔmidAM, which stimulated the use of Bcl-xL (Fig. 1E, lanes 5 and 11), a situation not observed in vitro (Fig. 1C, lane 7, and D, lane 6). This result suggests the existence of a silencer element (see below). A silencer in the AM1-midAM region could explain why deleting AM (which removes the AM2 enhancer) had no effect (Fig. 1E, lane 3). Thus, three regions in B3 contribute to splicing control. Although we cannot differentiate between effects on Bcl-xL or Bcl-xS donor sites, the argument of proximity would suggest that ML2 and the downstream portion of AM2 stimulate splicing to the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site, whereas a sequence in midAM represses this event. To confirm the overall enhancer activity of B3 on the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site, we tested if B3 could stimulate complex formation on a simple pre-mRNA carrying the 5′ splice site of Bcl-xL. Because complex formation is more easily observed with a strong 3′ splice site, we produced hybrid pre-mRNAs carrying the 3′ splice site of the adenovirus major late transcript. As seen in Fig. 2, deletion of B3 eliminated the U2 snRNP-dependent assembly of splicing complex A. This result, therefore, indicates that B3 can stimulate early spliceosome assembly on the 5′ splice site of Bcl-xL. A Role for SRp30c in the Activity of B3—We noted that AM2 and ML2 share the sequence CUUGGAU. However, this sequence does not appear essential because mutating the GG in the ML2 site had no effect on Bcl-x splicing in vitro (GG1 224 CC; Fig. 1D, lane 9). Another feature of ML2 is that its downstream portion contains the sequence AGGAG, a sequence that we recently identified as an optimal binding site for SRp30c (13Paradis C. Cloutier P. Shkreta L. Toutant J. Klarskov K. Chabot B. RNA. 2007; 13: 1287-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Changing this AGGAG for AUUAG decreased splicing to the Bcl-xL site in vitro (Fig. 1D, lane 10), consistent with a role for SRp30c in the activity of B3. A potential role for SRp30c was further supported by binding assays. GST-tagged SRp30c could bind to a small RNA oligonucleotide containing the ML2 sequence, and binding was compromised by the GG→UU mutation (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10). Recombinant SRp30c also bound to AM2 (lane 8) even though it lacks a perfect match to AGGAG. To ask whether SRp30c could bind to these elements in splicing conditions, we carried out a UV cross-linking assay in a HeLa extract incubated with a uniformly labeled RNA transcript (B3+) containing the B3 element and the Bcl-xL splice site. The cross-linking profile was compared with that of an RNA molecule lacking the AM2 and ML2 regions (2xΔB3+). Increasing amounts of recombinant His-SRp30c were added, and a cross-linking product was detected with B3+ at the position expected for His-SRp30c (Fig. 3B, lane 1–3). The intensity of this band was reduced considerably when the 2xΔB3+ RNA was used, and this was the only difference noted in the cross-linking profile (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6). The identity of this band was confirmed by performing an immunoprecipitation with anti-SRp30c antibodies on the cross-linked material (Fig. 3C, lane 5). When B3+ was incubated in an extract not supplemented with His-SRp30c, we observed a band migrating slightly faster than His-SRp30c (Fig. 2C, lane 1). This band is weaker or is absent when the assay is performed with 2xΔB3+ (lane 3). The immunoprecipitation assay indicates that a product with this behavior is recovered with the anti-SRp30c antibody (lanes 4 and 6). Thus, both recombinant and endogenous SRp30c proteins can interact with B3, and this interaction requires the AM2 and ML2 elements. Next, we tested the role of SRp30c in the activity of B3 in vitro. Two concentrations (2.5 and 5.0 μm) of His-SRp30c were added to the extract. The lowest amount corresponds approximately to the amount found in 5 μl of extract (one splicing reaction) (Fig. 4B). The addition of His-SRp30c to the wild-type S2.13 pre-mRNA increased the production of Bcl-xL (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–5), whereas it had a moderate effect when ML2 was deleted (lanes 6–8), possibly reflecting AM2-mediated activity. Indeed, removing both ML2 and AM2 nearly completely eliminated the stimulation offered by the supplementation with SRp30c (2xΔ; Fig. 4A, lanes 9–11). Notably, in this experiment, the double deletion (2xΔ) promoted the use of a cryptic 5′ splice site (xM1) mapping in the midAM portion of B3 (see below). We also tested the addition of equivalent amounts of hTra2β, an SR-related protein often associated with splicing enhancer activity (41Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Nasim M.T.

Genet. 2004; 13: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). hTra2β did not significantly affect Bcl-x splicing in vitro, although it did stimulate the use of a distal 5′ splice site on an unrelated reporter pre-mRNA (Fig. 4C). We also tested the impact of exogenously expressing SRp30c in HeLa cells. SRp30c increased the production of the Bcl-xL RNA isoform derived from the X2.13 minigene (Fig. 5, A and B). No improvement in Bcl-xL usage was detected when SRp30c was co-expressed with the variant lacking B3. The stable expression of a tagged SRp30c in HeLa and 293 cells was also associated with an increase in endogenous Bcl-xL levels (data not shown). Thus, SRp30c can stimulate the use of the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site in a B3-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. We also tested the activity of the SR protein ASF/SF2, which is 74% identical to SRp30c (47Goren A."
https://openalex.org/W2001687980,"Saturn's narrow F ring exhibits several unusual features that vary on timescales of hours to years. These include transient clumps, a central core surrounded by a multistranded structure and a regular series of longitudinal channels associated with Prometheus, one of the ring's two 'shepherding' satellites. Several smaller moonlets and clumps have been detected in the ring's immediate vicinity, and a population of embedded objects has been inferred. Here we report direct evidence of moonlets embedded in the ring's bright core, and show that most of the F ring's morphology results from the continual gravitational and collisional effects of small satellites, often combined with the perturbing effect of Prometheus. The F-ring region is perhaps the only location in the Solar System where large-scale collisional processes are occurring on an almost daily basis."

Wnt antagonism of Dkk requires the binding of the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of Dkk to the Wnt coreceptor, LRP5/6.

The Dkk family has at least four members (2Krupnik V.E. Sharp J.D. Jiang C. Robison K. Chickering T.W. Amaravadi L. Brown D.E. Guyot D. Mays G. Leiby K. Chang B. Duong T. Goodearl A.D. Gearing D.P.

We previously found that the C-terminal domain of human DKK1 and 2, which contains the second cysteine-rich region, is sufficient for antagonism of Wnt activity in mammalian cells (4Li L. Mao J.H. Sun L. Liu W.Z. Wu D.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The same was also found to be true in Xenopus; the C-terminal domain of Dkk1 and 2 is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit Wnt-stimulated induction of secondary axis development and transcriptional activation of the Siamois promoter, cooperate with a dominant-negative BMP4 receptor to induce head structure development, and physically associate with LRP5/6 (5Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6100-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 6Mao B. Niehrs C. Gene. 2003; 302: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this report, we defined the structure of the Dkk functional domain, the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of mouse Dkk2 (amino acids Met172-Ile259) (Dkk2C), and elucidated its interactions with the extracellular β-propeller domains of LRP5/6. Our structural studies suggest that, comparing with other β-propeller domains, the third β-propeller domain of LRP5/6 binds to Dkk2C with greatest affinity. Such differential binding affinity is likely to play an essential role in Dkk function in the canonical Wnt pathway. Furthermore, this finding not only increases our understanding of the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling by Dkk but also may expand the range of options for innovative targeted therapies. Dkk2C-mediated Inhibition of Wnt Activity—The recombinant protein Dkk2C (amino acids Met172-Ile259 of mouse Dkk2) was expressed and purified from an Escherichia coli system as described previously (11Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T. Srinivas S. Zhang W. Liu B. Li L. Wu D. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein contained an N-terminal S tag and a thrombin cleavage site between the S tag and Dkk2C. The purified recombinant Dkk2C contained only one single band in SDS-PAGE. NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well and transfected with a LEF-1 luciferase reporter plasmid, an enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid, and LacZ plasmid (total 0.5 μg of DNA/well) by using Lipofectamine and Plus (Invitrogen), as suggested by the manufacturer. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with Wnt3a conditioned medium and different dosages of purified Dkk2C for 6 h. Cells were treated with Wnt3a and vehicle as the control for 6 h. Then cells were lysed, and luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured as described previously (12Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. McMahon A. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Luminescence intensity, which represents Wnt activity, was normalized against the fluorescence intensity of enhanced green fluorescent protein. S-protein Pulldown Experiments and Western Blotting Analysis—For preparation of the first β-propeller domain of mouse LRP5 with HA tag (LRP5-PD1-HA)-containing conditioned medium, HEK cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well. The conditioned medium was collected 30 h after transfection by centrifugation. S-protein-agarose was obtained from Novagen, and the pulldown experiments were conducted in accordance with a standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, for each pulldown experiment, 300 μl of S-tagged Dkk2C (5 μm) was incubated with 200 μl of S-protein-agarose at room temperature for 2 h with gentle agitation to allow the binding of S-tagged Dkk2C to S-protein-agarose, followed by washing four times to remove the unbound Dkk2C by centrifugation. Then, the S-tagged Dkk2C-charged agarose was incubated with the LRP5-PD1-HA conditioned medium in indicated concentrations at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. After the agarose was washed three times with buffer, it underwent SDS-PAGE and then Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis was performed following a standard protocol by using mouse monoclonal IgG3 against an HA tag (from Millipore) as the primary antibody and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (from Cell Signaling Technology) as the secondary antibody. Finally, the membrane was incubated in SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) at room temperature for 5 min, and the results were developed on the film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Structural Determination of the Solution Structure of Dkk2C—The method used to determine the solution structure of Dkk2C is similar to those described previously (11Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T.

Briefly, the 13C/15N double-labeled protein was produced in an E. coli system, and the N-terminal S tag was removed by thrombin. Typical NMR samples consisted of 1 mm 15N/13C-Dkk2C in 5 mm D4-acetic acid (pH 5.0) buffer with 10% (v/v) D2O. All NMR experiments were performed with Bruker 600- and 800-MHz NMR spectrometers at 25 °C. NMR spectra were processed and displayed by the NMRPipe (14Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) software package. The program XEASY (15Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) was used for data analysis and structure assignment. Backbone assignment was based mainly on HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. Side chain proton resonance was assigned by using 15N HSQC-TOCSY and HCCH-TOCSY. Aromatic side chain proton resonance was assigned with CB(CGCD)HD and CB(CGC-DCE)HE experiments. NOE distance constraints were obtained from NOE peaks in two-dimensional 1H-1H NOE spectroscopy, three-dimensional 15N HSQC-NOE spectroscopy, and three-dimensional 13C HSQC-NOE spectroscopy experiments. Intensities of NOE peaks were calibrated and converted to distance constraints by the program CALIBA (16Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). CYANA2.1 (17Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar) software was used for structure calculations, which were based on 1,879 proton-proton distance constraints and 112 dihedral angle restraints. Through the space proximity, the five disulfide bridges within the structure could be clearly identified in the earlier structural calculations. Based on such information, 30 disulfide distance constraints (three upper limits and three lower limits for each disulfide bridge) were added in the final structural calculation. The superimposition of backbone atoms of 20 conformers with smallest target function values among 200 calculated structures yielded a root mean square deviation of 0.36 ± 0.11 Å relative to the average structure, and the average target function value of ensemble structures was 1.57 ± 0.15 Å2 with no distance violations >0.2 Å or dihedral angle violations >5°.

Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), NIH3T3 cells were transfected with LEF-1 luciferase reporter plasmids and 1 day later were treated with Wnt3a conditioned medium and Dkk1 or Dkk1 mutants conditioned medium prepared from HEK cells for 6 h. Then luciferase activity was measured as described above. To measure the binding of Dkk1 and its mutants to LRP6, HEK cells were transfected with LRP6 plasmids and 1 day later were incubated on ice with wild-type or mutant Dkk1-alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion protein conditioned medium for 2 h (10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Then the cells were washed and lysed, and AP activity in cell lysate was measured by using a Tropix luminescence AP assay kit as described previously (10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the Complex of LRP5 Bound with Dkk—The software package ICM (Molsoft) was used to build the structures of the first three β-propeller domains of LRP5 (termed as LRP5-PD1, PRP5-PD2, and LRP5-PD3) using the crystal structure of the low density lipoprotein receptor YWTD β-propeller domain (Protein Data Bank code 1IJQ (18Jeon H. Meng W.Y. Takagi J. Eck M.J. Springer T.A. Blacklow S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) as the template. The initial homology model structures were refined and evaluated by using software package AMBER8 (19Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6519) Google Scholar). In this step, a 5-ns molecular dynamic simulation with 2 femtoseconds/step was performed by placing the individual propeller domain in a TIP3P water box. The docking studies used the HADDOCK (20Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar) program. First, the homology model of the third β-propeller domain of LRP5 (LRP5-PD3) and the solution structure of Dkk2C were used as starting structures. Mutation of the Tyr719, Glu721, Arg764, Trp780, Asp887, and Phe888 residues of LRP5-PD3 had an effect of >10% on Dkk-mediated inhibition of Wnt activity. These residues were defined as active residues, and the neighboring surface residues (Arg652, Ala653, Val694, Lys697, Asp718, Gln737, Gly738, Asn762, Gly781, Pro784, Arg805, Trp863, His866, and Met890) were defined as passive residues. In Dkk2C, mutation of His198 (His210 in Dkk1), Lys205 (Lys217), Arg230 (Arg242), and His254 (His267) strongly disrupted both Dkk-mediated Wnt inhibition and LRP6 binding; these residues were defined as active residues. Passive residues were neighboring surface residues Glu179, Phe199, Trp200, Thr201, Leu203, Pro206, Glu212, Val213, Lys216, Gln217, Glu226, Ile227, Gln229, Val241, Thr246, Ser249, Arg252, and Leu253. The flexible interface was defined as active and passive residues ±2 sequential residues for the purpose of docking. Ambiguous interaction restraints used in the docking process were defined as an ambiguous distance between all active and passive residues shown to be involved at the interaction interface. The docking calculation was initiated with two proteins separated by 150 Å with random starting orientations. Three stages of docking solutions (rigid-body docking, semi-flexible simulated annealing, and a final refinement in water) were executed sequentially by energy minimization. Complex structures were sorted according to the intermolecular interaction energy (the sum of intermolecular van der Waals and electrostatic energies and restraint energies). In the last water refinement stage, the 100 docking structures with the lowest intermolecular interaction energies were generated and clustered on the basis of a 1.0-Å backbone root mean square deviation tolerance at the binding interface. The final docking complex structure was the structure that had the lowest intermolecular interaction energy within the cluster with the lowest average intermolecular interaction energy. Using an E. coli expression system, we expressed and purified the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of mouse Dkk2 (Dkk2C) (residues Met172-Ile259). The purified recombinant Dkk2C contained only one single band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The Dkk2C possessed a significant inhibitory activity on canonical Wnt signaling; it inhibited Wnt3a activities with an IC50 value around 8 nm in the Wnt reporter gene assay (Fig. 1B), indicating the protein we produced is fully functional. Furthermore, in vitro pulldown experiments showed that Dkk2C directly bound to the first propeller domain of LRP5 (LRP5-PD1), further confirming that the protein we produced is well folded and functional (Fig. 1C). Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the solution structure of Dkk2C (Fig. 2A). The structure was well defined except for one loop region and the N-terminal region (Fig. 2B and Table 1), and the five disulfide bonds were clearly identified. Within the structure of Dkk2C are two subdomains sharing very similar topology; each has a central anti-parallel β-sheet region consisting of three β strands (β1-β3 in subdomain 1 and β4-β6 in subdomain 2) and two finger-shaped loops linking the three β strands (Fig. 2C). The second subdomain has longer and flexible “finger loops” and is thus much larger than the first one. The flexibilities of the two finger loops in the second subdomain are clear in the relaxation data. The steady-state heteronuclear 15N[1H] NOE values versus the residue number of Dkk2C are shown in Fig. 3. Because the lengths of the N-H bonds are fixed, the 15N[1H] NOE values report information about the dynamics of N-H bonds and are used to determine the motion of a particular residue (21Wong H.C. Liu G. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Zheng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15874-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Typically, the value for the heteronuclear 15N[1H] NOE of folded residues is ∼1-0.7, and the NOE for a flexible loop is <0.5. The dynamic study showed that the first finger loop in the second subdomain (loop β4-β5) is most flexible. The study also showed that the folded Dkk2C should start at Gly177.FIGURE 3Plot of backbone amide heteronuclear 15N[1H] NOE values versus residue number for the Dkk2C. The steady-state heteronuclear 15N[1H] NOE value is plotted versus the residue number measured with a Bruker 600-MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. The secondary structure elements and disulfide brides in the Dkk2C are indicated at the top; amino acids that contact the third β-propeller domain of LRP5 in the docked model are indicated by the red dots. Because the lengths of the N-H bonds are fixed, the 15N[1H] NOE provides information about the dynamics of N-H bonds that can be used to determine whether a particular amide is in a well folded or a flexible region of a protein. The arrow indicates the starting residue, Gly177, of the folded Dkk2C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Within each subdomain are two disulfide bonds to stabilize the β-core region; one connects the first and second β-sheets (Cys183-Cys195 connecting β1 and β2 in the subdomain 1 and Cys214-Cys239 connecting β4 and β5 in subdomain 2), and another (Cys189-Cys204 and Cys233-Cys256) connects the third β sheet (β3 and β6, respectively) to the first finger loop (loop β1-β2 and loop β4-β5, respectively). The fifth disulfide bond (Cys194-Cys231) links the two subdomains together. The five dihedral angles in each of five disulfide bonds in the solution structure of Dkk2C are well within the range of the established stereochemical preferences of a single disulfide bridge (22Sali A. Overington J.P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1582-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Among the five disulfide bonds in the Dkk2C structure, only the first one (Cys183-Cys195) has the right-handed conformation; the rest of the four disulfide bonds are all in the left-handed conformation (23Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Analysis with DALI (24Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) software showed that the Dkk2C structure shares some features with those of colipase (Protein Data Bank code 1PCN) (25van T.H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and MIT1 (mamba intestinal toxin 1) (Protein Data Bank code 1IMT) (26Boisbouvier J. Albrand J.P. Blackledge M. Jaquinod M. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Marion D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which belong to a family of proteins lacking extensive secondary structures and stabilized by abundant disulfide bridges (27van T.H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carriere F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All three can be described as an assembly of protruding fingers, held together at one end by a network of five disulfide bridges. However, only the two central β-core regions of Dkk2C, colipase, and MIT1 are similar, and the connectivity patterns of disulfide bridges among the three proteins share a highly conserved feature (23Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sequence identity shared by Dkk2C with the two proteins (24% with colipase and 29% with MIT1) is concentrated in the two central β-core regions, all of the finger-loop regions of Dkk2C are unique, and each has a different length and conformation. The C-terminal cysteine-rich domains of Dkk1/2 interact with LRP5/6 (5Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6100-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whose extracellular region contains four well defined YWTD repeat domains that have a typical symmetrical six-bladed β-propeller fold (28Springer T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 29Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although each of the first three β-propeller domains can interact with Dkk1/2, only the third is required for Dkk1/2-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling, presumably because it binds favorably to Dkk1/2 (10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the residues involved in Dkk-mediated Wnt inhibition in the third β-propeller domain of LRP5 (LRP5-PD3) were found by alanine substitution mapping (10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to be clustered on a concave, amphitheatre-shaped surface centered on the pseudo-6-fold axis atop the β-propeller (10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This amphitheatre-shaped ligand binding site is likely to be the common feature among these β-propeller domains (supplemental Fig. 1) (30Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 31Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because of the network of hydrogen bonds within the β-propeller domains and the nature of the concave surface, the ligand binding sites of the β-propeller domains are rigid (30Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Typical ligands of these the β-propeller domains are rigid as well (30Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 31Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The rigidity of the ligands and receptors minimizes loss of entropy upon binding and promotes a high affinity (30Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The rigidity also makes it possible to model the complex by docking ligands to β-propeller domains. For example, at CAPRI, different groups successfully docked laminin to the β-propeller of nidogen successfully (32Gray J.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Mendez R. Leplae R. Lensink M.F. Wodak S.J. Proteins. 2005; 60: 150-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We therefore conducted a docking study to examine the interaction between Dkk2C and LRP5-PD3. To maximize the accuracy of this study, we used the program HADDOCK (20Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar) to incorporate data from mutagenesis studies of the binding of Dkk1/2 to LRP5/6. The mutation E721A on the amphitheatre surface of LRP5-PD3 that binds to Dkk had the strongest effect on Dkk1-mediated inhibition of Wnt1 activity (∼70% reduction) and abolished binding of LRP5-PD3 to Dkk1 (10Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because the corresponding residue in nidogen, Glu994, forms a salt bridge with a lysine residue in bound laminin (30Takagi J. Yang Y. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2056165940,"Influenza A virus infection activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by binding influenza A virus NS1 protein to the p85β regulatory subunit of PI3K. In this study, we report that NS1 binds to the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of p85β. Mutational analyses on p85β iSH2 domain defined that Val-573 is the critical amino acid (AA) that mediates NS1 and p85β interaction. In reciprocal gain of function experiments with p85α, we demonstrated that mutation to Val at Met-582 leads to NS1 binding and increased PI3K activity. Molecular modeling based on our experimental results suggested that, in addition to the interaction interface between the NS1 SH3 binding motif 1 (AA 164-167) and p85β Val-573, AA 137-142 in NS1 might interact with p85β. Indeed, mutations of AA 141 and 142 in NS1 disrupted the interaction between NS1 and p85β. Mutant virus PR8-NS1-141/142 was not able to activate Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, PI3K assays demonstrated that, in wild-type virus-infected cells, p85β-associated PI3K activity was increased significantly. In contrast, in the mutant virus-infected cells containing mutant NS1 unable to interact with p85β, the p85β-associated PI3K activity up-regulation was not seen, suggesting that PI3K up-regulation is dependent upon the interaction between NS1 and p85β. Competition experiments and the immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that NS1, p85β, and p110 form a complex in cells. Finally, the mechanism by which binding of NS1 to p85β regulates PI3K activity was discussed based on a predicted structural model of NS1-p85-p110 complex. Influenza A virus infection activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by binding influenza A virus NS1 protein to the p85β regulatory subunit of PI3K. In this study, we report that NS1 binds to the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of p85β. Mutational analyses on p85β iSH2 domain defined that Val-573 is the critical amino acid (AA) that mediates NS1 and p85β interaction. In reciprocal gain of function experiments with p85α, we demonstrated that mutation to Val at Met-582 leads to NS1 binding and increased PI3K activity. Molecular modeling based on our experimental results suggested that, in addition to the interaction interface between the NS1 SH3 binding motif 1 (AA 164-167) and p85β Val-573, AA 137-142 in NS1 might interact with p85β.

Class I PI3Ks are further divided into class IA and class IB PI3Ks. Class IA enzymes consist of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110). Three distinct genes encoding class IA PI3K regulatory subunits exist in mammals: Pik3r1 (p85α), Pik3r2 (p85β), and Pik3r3 (p55PIK) (2Terauchi Y. Tsuji Y. Satoh S. Minoura H. Murakami K. Okuno A.

There are three class IA catalytic subunits: p110α, p110β, and p110δ. Any of the three isoforms can bind any of the p85-related regulatory subunits (5Miled N. Yan Y. Hon W.C. Perisic O. Zvelebil M.

The p85 subunit has five domains: a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a domain with homology to breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein, and two SH2 domains (nSH2 and cSH2) separated by an inter-SH2 (iSH2) (6Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : E1Google Scholar). The p110α subunit also has five domains: an N-terminal adaptor binding domain (ABD), the Ras binding domain, the putative membrane binding domain C2, a helical domain of unknown function, and a kinase catalytic domain (7Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar, 8Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). The iSH2 domain of p85 subunit is responsible for tight binding to the ABD domain of the p110 catalytic subunit (9Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, p85 serves two functions on p110: conformational inhibition of its lipid kinase activity and stabilization against the thermal denaturation of p110 (11Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In activated cells, p85 uses its SH2 domains to bind phosphotyrosine residues within activated tyrosine kinases, including BCR/ABL and NPM/ALK or adaptor proteins such as Shc, c-Cbl, Crk-L, and Gab2 (12Ren S.Y. Bolton E. Mohi M.G. Morrione A. Neel B.G. Skorski T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8001-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This results in the translocation of the p85-p110 heterodimer to the plasma membrane and causes steric changes within p85 to release the inhibitory effect on p110 (13Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After activation, PI3K phosphorylates the lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (14Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K.

Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate then serves as a lipid second messenger and is able to regulate phosphorylation of a number of kinases, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Akt is activated via phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 (17Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Akt plays a central role in modulating diverse downstream signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and the prevention of apoptosis (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 19Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have demonstrated that influenza A virus infection leads to PI3K/Akt pathway activation by interaction of the viral NS1 protein with the p85β subunit of PI3K (20Hale B.G.

Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we identified a polyproline motif PXXP, which is located at amino acids (AA) 164-167 in NS1 (designated SH3 binding motif 1), is essential for mediating NS1-p85β interaction and the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mutant viruses containing SH3 motif 1 mutation in NS1 cannot bind to p85β, and thus are unable to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. These mutant viruses formed much smaller plaques and grew to 1-1.5 log lower titers than the wild-type (WT) virus (20Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H. Lamb R.A. Randall R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, specific inhibitors for PI3K can strongly suppress influenza A virus replication (23Ehrhardt C. Marjuki H. Wolff T. Nurnberg B. Planz O. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Shin Y.K. Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that the influenza A virus-induced PI3K/Akt pathway is pivotal in supporting virus replication. Studies using mutant viruses and WT virus plus PI3K inhibitors also showed that PI3K/Akt functions to suppress virus-induced apoptosis (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 5719-5727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) recently reported the NS1 protein of the 1918 influenza virus and a representative avian H7N3 strain contained a functional SH3 binding motif that mediates binding to the N-terminal SH3 domain of the adapter proteins Crk and CrkL. This binding is associated with enhanced PI3K signaling (26Heikkinen L.S. Kazlauskas A. Melen K. Wagner R. Ziegler T. Julkunen I. Saksela K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5719-5727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), further supporting the importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway in regulating influenza A virus replication and pathogenesis. In this study, we further characterized the domains and amino acids on p85β that are required for mediating NS1-p85β interaction. Our data showed that the minimal essential region for NS1 binding on p85β is the iSH2 region (AA 420-615); within this region, Val at AA 573 is critical for NS1-p85β interaction. Mutation of the corresponding AA in p85α from Met to Val led to binding of NS1 to mutated p85α. In addition, AA 141-142 in NS1 was found to be another domain involved in the NS1-p85β interaction. Binding of NS1 to the iSH2 domain of p85β did not compete with p110 for binding with p85β and resulted in the up-regulation of PI3K activity. A molecular model of NS1-p85-p110 suggested binding of NS1 to p85 may sterically interfere with the kinase domain and/or helical domain of p110. Alternatively, binding of NS1 to p85 may disrupt the interactions of C2 region of p110 with p85, thus altering the regulatory effect of p85 on p110. Our data suggested a molecular mechanism by which influenza A virus infection up-regulates PI3K activity. Cells and Virus—A549 cells (human lung carcinoma cells) and 293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), mutant virus PR8-SH3-mf-1 were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs as described previously (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Plasmids—Plasmids pGEX-4T3-p85β, pcDNA4-HisMax-mp85β, and pcDNA3.1-NS1 have been described previously (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein constructs, cDNA fragments corresponding to each domains of mouse p85β SH3 (AA 1-106), BCR (AA 82-322), nSH2 (AA 297-432), iSH2 (AA 420-615), and cSH2 (AA 598-722) were PCR-amplified from pGEX-4T3-p85β and cloned into pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare) at EcoRI/XhoI sites. The same domains were then excised by EcoRI/NotI from the above GST constructs and cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA4HisMax-C (Invitrogen), generating pcDNAHisMax-mp85β-SH3, pcDNAHisMax-mp85β-BCR, pcDNA-HisMax-mp85β-nSH2, pcDNAHisMax-mp85β-iSH2, and pcDNAHisMax-mp85β-cSH2. The chimeric constructs of p85α and p85β iSH2 domain were generated by overlapping PCR using mouse p85β and bovine p85α (27Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48607-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as templates, the chimeric cDNA was inserted into pcDNA4HisMax-C vector at EcoRI/XhoI sites. Chimera-1 contains AA 420-454 from p85β and AA 464-623 from p85α (equivalent to AA 455-615 in p85β). Chimera-2 contains AA 420-555 from p85β and AA 565-623 from p85α (equivalent to AA 556-615 in p85β). Chimera-3 contains AA 429-463 from p85α (equivalent to AA 420-454 in p85β) and AA 455-615 from p85β. Chimera-4 contains AA 429-564 from p85α (equivalent to AA 420-555 in p85β) and AA 556-615 from p85β. A series of point mutations in the iSH2 region of p85β, where the AA were replaced by their equivalent AA in p85α, were introduced into pcDNAHisMax-mp85β-iSH2 by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Full-length bovine p85α was cloned into pcDNA4HisMax-C vector at BamHI/EcoRI sites, resulting in pcDNA4HisMax-bp85α. Met-582 was replaced by Val in pcDNA4HisMax-bp85α by site-directed mutagenesis, generating pcDNA4-HisMax-bp85α-M582V. Similarly, Val-573 was mutated to Met in pcDNA4-HisMax-mp85β, generating pcDNA4-HisMax-mp85β-V573M. To generate FLAG-tagged mouse p85β, cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pCMV-3xFLAG vector (constructed by Dr. Q. Liu) at HindIII/EcoRI; the resulting plasmid pCMV-3xFLAG-mp85β encodes full-length mouse p85β with three FLAG epitopes fused at its N terminus. pFLAG3-p85α encodes full-length bovine p85α (27Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R.

Human p110α cDNA was amplified from pBABEpuro-HA-p110alpha (purchased from Addgene) and cloned into pcDNA3.1-HA-XbaI vector (constructed by Dr. Q.

This plasmid encodes full-length p110α with two HA epitopes fused at its N terminus. pcDNA3.1-NS1-137/138 carries mutations at AA 137 and 138 where original Asn and Phe were replaced by Ala. pcDNA3.1-NS1-139/140 carries mutations at AA 139 and 140 where original Asp and Arg are replaced by Ala. Similarly, pcDNA3.1-NS1-141/142 bears mutations at AA 141 and 142 where the original Leu and Glu were replaced by Ala. The mutations were introduced into pcDNA3.1-NS1 by site-directed mutagenesis. For rescuing the mutant virus, mutations of L141A and E142A were introduced into pHW198-NS1 (28Hoffmann E. Krauss S. Perez D. Webby R. Webster R.G. Vaccine. 2002; 20: 3165-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in plasmid pHW198-NS-141/142. The coding regions of all plasmids were completely verified by DNA sequencing to ensure that no unwanted changes were introduced during PCR on mutagenesis. All PCR primers are available upon request. Generation of NS1 Mutant Virus—NS1 mutant virus, PR8-NS1-141/142, was generated by using an eight-plasmid reverse genetics system described by Hoffmann et al. (29Hoffmann E. Neumann G. Kawaoka Y.

Webster, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and pHW-NS-141/142 were used for transfection. The rescued virus was propagated in 9- to10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and characterized by sequencing of the reverse transcription-PCR product derived from the NS segment. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal NS1 was generated in our laboratory (24Shin Y.K. Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Monoclonal mouse anti-His antibody was purchased from GE Healthcare. Anti-PI3K p85 (anti-p85pan rabbit antiserum) and anti-PI3K p85, N-SH3, clone AB6 (anti-p85α, does not recognize p85β, mouse monoclonal IgG1κ) were purchased from Upstate. Monoclonal PI3K p85β (T15, non-cross reactive with p85α), sc56934 antibody and monoclonal HA-probe (F-7), and sc-7392 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Shin Y.K. Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 30 μg of total protein or a portion of precipitated protein was resolved on SDS-10% PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding with Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.9% NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% skim milk (for NS1) or Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. For examination of NS1, membranes were probed with NS1 (1:2,000) antibody followed by an incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti rabbit IgG (1:10,000). The immunoblots were then visualized by incubating with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium premix solution (Sigma). For examination of His6-tagged p85α, His6-tagged p85β, FLAG-tagged p85β, HA-tagged p110α, endogenous p85pan, p85α, p85β, pAkt, and Akt, a primary antibody was diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer according to the manufacturer's suggestion and applied for 2 h at room temperature. Infrared dye-linked secondary antibody (1:15,000) was then added at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoblots were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system. The levels of band density were quantified by using the Odyssey application software, version 2.0. Data are representative of one of three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated. Transfection and Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis—293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 106/well. DNA constructs (1 μg per construct unless specified) were transfected using CaCl2 according to a protocol described previously (30Jackel-Cram C. Babiuk L.A. Liu Q. J. Hepatol. 2007; 46: 999-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, cell lysates were prepared as described above and subjected to specific assays. The generation of whole cell lysates and lysates suitable for immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 600 μg of cell lysates was precleared by either 3 μg of rabbit IgG or mouse IgG and protein G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Three micrograms of specific antibody or IgG control was immobilized to protein G-Sepharose beads and then incubated with precleared cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes, the precipitated proteins were subjected to either SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with specific antibodies or PI3K assay. GST and Ni-NTA-Sepharose Bead Pulldown Assay—The GST fusion protein was expressed and prepared as described previously (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 250 μg of each GST fusion protein lysates was bound to 25 μl of a 50% pre-equilibrated glutathione-agarose bead slurry (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) containing a 1× protease inhibitors mixture, Complete (Roche Applied Science). 100 μl of lysates (1 μg/μl) from infected A549 cells or transfected 293T cells was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads-GST fusion protein complexes in phosphate-buffered saline. After 2-h incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed five times in radioimmune precipitation assay. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using a specific antibody. 200 μl of cell lysates (0.5 μg/μl) was incubated with 50 μl of 50% nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) slurry. The reaction volume was made up to 500 μl with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After five washes, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with specific antibody or Coomassie Blue staining. PI3K Assay—PI3K assay was performed as described previously (27Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48607-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Samples were immunoprecipitated using p85pan, p85α, or p85β antibodies (3 μg), respectively. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with each of the following: wash 1 (phosphate-buffered saline), wash 2 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm LiCl), and wash 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Excess liquid was removed from the immunoprecipitates. Lipid micelles were generated by sonicating phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol in PI3K assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2) in a sonicating water bath for 20 min. Each sample was incubated with lipid micelles (5 μg of phosphatidylserine plus 2.5 μg of phosphatidylinositol) in PI3K assay buffer and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 50 μl for 15 min at 20 °C while gently rocking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl (to 1.7 m). Lipids were extracted into chloroform:methanol (1:1) and further washed with methanol, 1 n HCl (1:1). Reaction products were dried down, resuspended in chloroform:methanol (1:1), and spotted onto a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60, VWR Canlab). Samples were developed in 1-propanol, water, acetic acid (17.4: 7.9:1) in a chromatography chamber for 3 h, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. Results were visualized and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Molecular Modeling—Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys) was used for the modeling study and structure analysis. The crystal coordinates used are p110 ABD/p85 iSH2 (Protein Data Bank code 2V1Y), p110α/p85 iSH2 (Protein Data Bank code 2RD0), and NS1 dimer (Protein Data Bank code 2GX9). To calculate the potential interaction domains between p85β iSH2 and NS1, crystal coordinates of p85 iSH2 (Protein Data Bank code 2V1Y) was used as the templates, after manual replacement of Met-582 in p85α by Val as suggested by our experiments described in the text, the local structure of the mutated residue and its neighbors was optimized using the MODELER program. NS1 was manually docked around this site. Interaction of p85 iSH2 and NS1 was minimized and determined using the ZDOCK program. NS1 Binds to the iSH2 Domain of p85β—We and others have previously shown that the influenza A virus NS1 protein interacts with p85β resulting in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. To identify the region of p85β that interacts with NS1, different domains of p85β were fused to GST (Fig. 1A). A549 cells were mock infected or infected with WT virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1. Cell lysates were prepared at 6 h post infection (h.p.i.) and were incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Pulled down proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal NS1 antibody. Fig. 1B shows the iSH2 domain of p85β interacted with NS1 as efficiently as did the full-length p85β (lane 8 versus 10). GST alone and other p85β domains did not interact with NS1. Similar amounts of the GST and GST-p85β fusion proteins were used, as demonstrated by Coomassie Blue staining of the samples resolved by SDS-PAGE. To examine whether NS1 unaccompanied by other viral components would interact with p85β iSH2 domain, 293T cells were transfected with empty vector or pcDNA3.1-NS1 (22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared at 24 h post transfection and were subjected to a GST pulldown assay. Fig. 1C shows that iSH2 domain of p85β bound to NS1 protein, which was derived from an expression plasmid (lane 8). To verify whether the observed interactions would take place in mammalian cells, we cloned each individual domain of p85β into pcDNA4-HisMax vector, resulting in His6-tagged p85β domains (Fig. 1A) that are driven by a CMV promoter. Thus, 293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-NS1 and pcDNA4HisMax-p85β-SH3, pcDNA4HisMax-p85β-BCR, pcDNA4HisMax-p85β-nSH2, pcDNA4HisMax-p85β-iSH2, or pcDNA4HisMax-p85β-cSH2 constructs or the pcDNA4-HisMax vector. At 24 h post transfection, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with Ni-NTA-Sepharose beads. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with NS1 or His antibodies. As seen in Fig. 1D, in agreement with the in vitro GST pulldown assay results using infected and transfected cells, the iSH2 domain of p85β interacted with NS1 (lane 14) in mammalian cells. No interactions were detected between the pcDNA4HisMax vector encoded His6 protein and NS1 (lane 4). The amount and integrity of the His6-tagged p85β and its domains present in the same precipitated samples were also monitored. Valine 573 in p85β Is the Determinant Residue That Is Essential for NS1-p85β Interaction—It is well known that p110α binds to the iSH2 domain of p85 (10Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I.

The observation that NS1 binds to iSH2 domain of p85β prompted us to examine the binding site of NS1 on iSH2 in more detail. We first made three truncation constructs of the p85β iSH2 domain (remaining AA 420-485, 420-550, and 485-615, respectively) that were fused to GST. GST pulldown assay with virus-infected cell lysates indicated that none of these truncated p85β iSH2 domains could interact with NS1 (data not shown), indicating that the entire iSH2 domain is required for the interaction. Given that (i) binding of NS1 requires that iSH2 retain its folded structure and (ii) NS1 does not bind to iSH2 of p85α (20Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H. Lamb R.A. Randall R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2014517905,"Members of the seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR) superfamily are sequestered from the plasma membrane following stimulation both to limit cellular responses as well as to initiate novel G protein-independent signaling pathways. The best studied mechanism for 7TMR internalization is via clathrin-coated pits, where clathrin and adaptor protein complex 2 nucleate and polymerize upon encountering the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) to form the outer layer of the clathrin-coated vesicle. Activated receptors are recruited to clathrin-coated pits by beta-arrestins, scaffolding proteins that interact with agonist-occupied 7TMRs as well as adaptor protein complex 2 and clathrin. We report here that following stimulation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR), a prototypical 7TMR, beta-arrestins bind phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) Ialpha, a PIP(2)-producing enzyme. Furthermore, beta-arrestin2 is required to form a complex with PIP5K Ialpha and agonist-occupied beta2-AR, and beta-arrestins synergize with the kinase to produce PIP(2) in response to isoproterenol stimulation. Interestingly, beta-arrestins themselves bind PIP(2), and a beta-arrestin mutant deficient in PIP(2) binding no longer internalizes 7TMRs, fails to interact with PIP5K Ialpha, and is not associated with PIP kinase activity assayed in vitro. However, a chimeric protein in which the core kinase domain of PIP5K Ialpha has been fused to the same beta-arrestin mutant rescues internalization of beta2-ARs. Collectively, these data support a model in which beta-arrestins direct the localization of PIP5K Ialpha and PIP(2) production to agonist-activated 7TMRs, thereby regulating receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1999792508,"A mutation in the alpha1-subunit (A322D) of GABA(A)Rs is responsible for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in a large Canadian family. Previous work has identified that this mutant affects the cell expression and function of recombinant GABA(A)Rs, expressed in HEK293 cells. Here we have extended these observations by showing that the mutation promotes association with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin and accelerates the degradation rate of the subunits approximately 2.5-fold. We also find that the mutation causes the subunit to be degraded largely by a lysosomal-dependent process. Furthermore, we find that the mutation results in receptors that are inserted into the plasma membrane but are more rapidly endocytosed by a dynamin and caveolin1-dependent mechanism. These results suggest that the mutant subunit can form functional receptors, but that these have a shorter lifetime on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1975251927,"Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) controls intracellular levels of cGMP through its regulation of cGMP hydrolysis. Hydrolytic activity of the C-terminal catalytic domain is increased by cGMP binding to the N-terminal GAF A domain. We present the NMR solution structure of the cGMP-bound PDE5A GAF A domain. The cGMP orientation in the buried binding pocket was defined through 37 intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects. Comparison with GAF domains from PDE2A and adenylyl cyclase cyaB2 reveals a conserved overall domain fold of a six-stranded beta-sheet and four alpha-helices that form a well defined cGMP binding pocket. However, the nucleotide coordination is distinct with a series of altered binding contacts. The structure suggests that nucleotide binding specificity is provided by Asp-196, which is positioned to form two hydrogen bonds to the guanine ring of cGMP. An alanine mutation of Asp-196 disrupts cGMP binding and increases cAMP affinity in constructs containing only GAF A causing an altered cAMP-bound structural conformation. NMR studies on the tandem GAF domains reveal a flexible GAF A domain in the absence of cGMP, and indicate a large conformational change upon ligand binding. Furthermore, we identify a region of approximately 20 residues directly N-terminal of GAF A as critical for tight dimerization of the tandem GAF domains. The features of the PDE5 regulatory domain revealed here provide an initial structural basis for future investigations of the regulatory mechanism of PDE5 and the design of GAF-specific regulators of PDE5 function."
https://openalex.org/W1985607813,"Many viruses subvert the host ubiquitin-proteasome system to optimize their life cycle. We recently documented such a mechanism for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr protein, which promotes cell cycle arrest by recruiting the DCAF1 adaptor of the Cul4A-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase, a finding now confirmed by several groups. Here we examined the impact of Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 on Vpr stability. We show that the Vpr(Q65R) mutant, which is defective in DCAF1 binding, undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation at a higher rate than wild-type Vpr. DCAF1 overexpression stabilizes wild-type Vpr and leads to its cytoplasmic accumulation, whereas it has no effect on the Vpr(Q65R) mutant. Conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of DCAF1 decreases the steady state amount of the viral protein. Stabilization by DCAF1, which is conserved by Vpr species from human immunodeficiency virus type 2 and the SIVmac strain, results in increased G2 arrest and requires the presence of DDB1, indicating that it occurs through assembly of Vpr with a functional Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 complex. Furthermore, in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells, the Vpr protein, issued from the incoming viral particle, is destabilized under DCAF1 or DDB1 silencing. Together with our previous findings, our data suggest that Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 acts at a dual level by providing Vpr with the equipment for the degradation of specific host proteins and by counter-acting its proteasome targeting by another cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protection mechanism may represent an efficient way to optimize the activity of Vpr molecules that are delivered by the incoming virus before neosynthesis takes place. Targeting the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction might therefore present therapeutic interest. Many viruses subvert the host ubiquitin-proteasome system to optimize their life cycle.

Targeting the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction might therefore present therapeutic interest. Numerous proteins from various pathogens have been shown to direct the destruction of specific host cell proteins, as first exemplified by the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein, which targets p53 to the proteasome (1Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar).

The covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules to a target protein is a prerequisite for its recognition and proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome.

A major family of E3 ubiquitin ligases is represented by the cullin-ring ubiquitin ligase (CRUL) class. These multi-subunit enzymes share a modular organization in which a catalytic core containing the invariant Roc1 ring finger protein and a cullin family member is associated with various adaptor proteins responsible for substrate recognition (3Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). For example, cullin 1 (Cul1) associates with Skp1 and a member of the F-box protein family to form an SCF (Skp1-cullin 1-F-box) complex (3Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar), whereas cullin 4A (Cul4A) assembles with DDB1 (damaged DNA-binding protein 1) and a member of the DCAF (DDB1-cullin 4-associated-factor) family (4Lee J. Zhou P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 775-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). When usurping the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway, pathogens most often target the E3 ubiquitin ligase component to trigger the abnormal degradation of specific cellular proteins (5Barry M. Früh K.

In this process, the viral protein acts as an adaptor between an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a cellular protein, which is subsequently ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation by the proteasome. The HIV virus extensively uses this strategy because three of its auxiliary proteins have been shown to target a CRUL. Vpu induces the degradation of the CD4 viral receptor by recruiting βTrCP, the F-box component of the SCFβTrCP complex (7Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D.

The HIV-1 Vpr gene has orthologs in the genomes of HIV-2 and the related SIVmac viruses (15Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Vpr protein, which is about 100 amino acids long, is encapsidated in the produced virions (16Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strongly suggests a role of Vpr in the early steps of the viral life cycle, which occur in the absence of viral protein synthesis and which eventually lead to integration into the host genome of the proviral DNA competent for transcription (17Poon B. Grovit-Ferbas K. Stewart S.A. Chen I.S. Science. 1998; 281: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Whether Vpr-induced G2 arrest provides a direct advantage for the virus or is merely the consequence of a more upstream event has not yet been clarified. In any event, recruitment by Vpr of the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase is most likely functionally significant. Remarkably, little is known as to the fate of the viral protein itself in the documented examples of viral proteins that operate through the recruitment of an E3 ligase. To address this question, we took advantage of our previous isolation of a Vpr mutant, which is defective in DCAF1 binding (11Le Rouzic E. Belaidouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.-C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 ligase does not sense Vpr as a substrate and instead prevents its recognition by another E3 ligase responsible for its constitutive targeting to the proteasome. Plasmid Constructs—The pCS2-Myc construct expressing Cul1 was kindly provided by Peter Jackson. The sequence coding for a dominant-negative form of Cul1 (the N-terminal region of Cul1 from residues 1 to 328) was subcloned into the same vector. pAS1B constructs encoding HA-tagged Vpr from HIV-1 Lai and HA-Vpr-Q65R, the vector expressing FLAG-tagged DCAF1-iso2 (Gen-Bank™ accession number BC022792), and pCS2 vector expressing Myc-tagged DCAF1-WD domain have been described previously (11Le Rouzic E.

Cell Culture and Transfection Procedures—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid and siRNA transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) and DharmaFECT reagent (Dharmacon), respectively.

Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown in 6-well plates were lysed in 200 μl/well M-PER buffer (Pierce) containing 150 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors (Sigma). Proteins from cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and revealed by immunoblot analysis using a chemiluminescent procedure (ECL, GE Healthcare). Where indicated, signals were acquired by a LAS-3000 apparatus (Fuji) for further quantification using the provided software. Monoclonal antibodies directed against HA (3F10), Myc (9E10), and GFP were obtained from Roche, and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-DCAF1/VprBP rabbit polyclonal antibody was distributed by Gentaur and anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody by BD Transduction Laboratories. The p24 HIV-1 capsid protein was revealed using a rabbit anti-p24 polyclonal antibody provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were scraped and fixed with 70% ethanol 48 h post-transfection. Following RNase A treatment and propidium iodide staining, cells expressing the internal membrane-anchored GFP were analyzed for their DNA content using a Cytomics FC500 cell analyzer (Beckman Coulter). At least 10,000 GFP-positive cells were analyzed for their distribution in the different phases of cell cycle using the Multicycle software. Immunofluorescence Assays—HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 100 ng of HA-Vpr-expressing vector and 400 ng of FLAG-DCAF1 plasmid per well. Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed again in PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 15 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20 prior to incubation for 1 h with rabbit anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) diluted to 1:500. Following three washes in PBS/Tween buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20), cells were incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies (1:300) and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-HA antibodies (1:300). After three washes in PBS/Tween buffer and mounting in medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield), cells were examined by direct fluorescence microscopy. Generation of HIV-1 Virus Particles—293T cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were cotransfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA deficient for Vpr expression (pNL4-3ΔVpr) along with two plasmids coding for the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and HA-tagged Vpr in a ratio of 4:1:4. The culture supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, and released viral particles were filtered through 0.45-μm pore filters. Viral titers were determined using P4R5 Magi indicator cells. Viral Entry Assays—Forty-eight h after siRNA treatment, P4R5 cells (2 × 105 cells) were incubated for 2 h with virus particles (multiplicity of infection ∼ 1). Cells were then washed with PBS and treated once with 0.5% trypsin/EDTA to remove virus from the cell surface and further incubated for 6 h in culture medium. Cells were then harvested, lysed in M-PER buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. DCAF1 Binding Regulates Vpr Stability—In the course of our previous study of Vpr-mediated G2 arrest (11Le Rouzic E. Belaidouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.-C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we reproducibly observed that the Vpr(Q65R) mutant, which is defective in DCAF1 binding, was expressed at a slightly lower steady state level than its wild-type counterpart. To accurately assess their relative stabilities, Vpr(Q65R) and Vpr WT were coexpressed with GFP as an internal control in cells treated or not with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Western blot analysis followed by quantification of the Vpr/GFP ratios confirmed that Vpr(Q65R) accumulated at a lower level than Vpr WT (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 1 and Fig. 1B). MG132 treatment increased the amount of both Vpr WT and Vpr(Q65R), the latter being stabilized three times more than wild-type Vpr (Fig. 1C). These observations indicate that Vpr is degraded via the proteasome pathway and that the Q65R mutation leads to enhanced targeting of the protein to the proteasome. This raised the issue that the previously shown defect of Vpr(Q65R) in G2 arrest activity reflects its enhanced turnover rather than its inability to recruit DCAF1. To address this point, the amounts of transfected expression vectors were adjusted to achieve equivalent expression of Vpr(Q65R) and Vpr WT (Fig. 1D, see Western blot and quantification panels). Under such conditions, Vpr(Q65R) still failed to induce G2 arrest in contrast to Vpr WT(Fig. 1E). Altogether, these data suggested that both the activity and the stability of Vpr depend on its ability to bind DCAF1 and that its degradation depends on a different ubiquitin ligase. Schröfelbauer et al. (19Schrofelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) reported that besides Cul4A, Cul1 could coimmunoprecipitate Vpr, which prompted us to examine the potential role of the Cul1-based E3 ligases in Vpr degradation. We used a truncated form of Cul1 (Cul1-DN), which acts as a dominant-negative mutant by competing with full-length Cul1 for the binding of its adaptors and substrates. As expected, expression of Cul1-DN led to the stabilization of endogenous β-catenin, a well known substrate of the Cul1-Skp1-βTrCP complex (20Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G.

In contrast, Cul1-DN did not enhance the pool of the unstable Vpr(Q65R) mutant, ruling out a role of Cul1-based CRULs in targeting Vpr for proteasome-mediated degradation.FIGURE 2Vpr turnover is independent of the Cul1-based E3 ubiquitin ligases. HeLa cells were cotransfected with HA-Vpr(Q65R) and GFP expression constructs along with the indicated Cul1 expression constructs. Empty vector is represented by ∅. Treatment with MG132 and Western analysis of cell lysates were carried out as described in the Fig. 1 legend. Expression of endogenous β-catenin, a known substrate of the Cul1-Skp1-βTrCP E3 ligase, was used to assess the effect of Cul1-DN expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Supporting our hypothesis that Vpr stability depends on its ability to bind DCAF1, overexpression of full-length DCAF1 (DCAF1-iso1) led to increased accumulation of Vpr WT (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3) but did not affect the pool of Vpr(Q65R) (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 7). As a control, we checked that DCAF1 overexpression increases the bulk level of DCAF1 (supplementary Fig. S2). MG132 treatment restored identical levels of Vpr WT and Vpr(Q65R), in the absence or in the presence of DCAF1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8), indicating that differences in Vpr and Vpr(Q65R) expression levels result from differences in protein stability. These differences are abolished when the proteasome is inactivated. We next conducted similar experiments using two other DCAF1 derivatives previously shown to bind Vpr (11Le Rouzic E. Belaidouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.-C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), namely DCAF1-iso2 that lacks a 460-amino acid region as compared with DCAF1-iso1 and DCAF1-WD, which encompasses the WD40 repeat domain of the protein (Fig. 3A). Both DCAF1-iso2 and DCAF1-WD stabilized Vpr but not Vpr(Q65R) (Fig. 3, C and D, compare lanes 3 and 1 and lanes 7 and 5). These results suggested that the abundance of DCAF1 molecules available for Vpr binding impacts on the viral protein pool. In support of this conclusion, siRNA-mediated depletion of DCAF1 decreased steady state levels of Vpr WT but not of Vpr(Q65R) (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 2 and 1 and lanes 4 and 3, and Fig. 3F). DCAF1-mediated Stabilization of Vpr Is Conserved in Other Primate Lentiviral Lineages—The region surrounding the Gln65 residue in Vpr from HIV-1, which is critical for DCAF1 binding, is highly conserved in Vpr proteins from other primate lentiviruses (11Le Rouzic E. Belaidouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.-C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that DCAF1-Vpr interaction would be conserved across these lentiviral species. Confirming this prediction, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed a strong interaction between DCAF1 and Vpr from SIVmac, HIV-2, and SIVagm (supplementary Fig. S1). We next investigated whether DCAF1 also modulated the stability of these Vpr species. The results shown in Fig. 4, A and B, indicate that the HIV-2 and SIVmac Vpr proteins behave similarly to the HIV-1 Vpr protein. Their turnover is dependent on the proteasome pathway as shown by their increased accumulation following a 6-h treatment with MG132, and overexpression of DCAF1 enhanced their steady state levels by decreasing their degradation rate (see quantification in Fig. 4B). By contrast, Vpr from SIVagm shows a higher intrinsic stability because its accumulation was affected neither by MG132 treatment nor by overexpression of DCAF1. In this respect, SIVagm Vpr was more similar to the related Vpx protein than to the other Vpr species (data not shown). We also note that Vpr from SIVagm shows no detectable interaction with uracil-N-glycosylase 2, in contrast to Vpr species from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVmac (supplementary Fig. S1), and that it fails to induce G2 arrest in HeLa cells (data not shown and Ref. 21Zhu Y. Gelbard H.A. Roshal M. Pursell S. Jamieson B.D. Planelles V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3791-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Vpr Redistributes into the Cytoplasm upon Stabilization by DCAF1—To confirm DCAF1-mediated stabilization of Vpr at the cellular level, we performed immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 5). In cells expressing exogenous FLAG-DCAF1, a stronger staining was observed for HA-Vpr WT and the viral protein accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). By contrast, the Vpr(Q65R) mutant was detected with similar intensity regardless of DCAF1 coexpression and remained nuclear (Fig. 5B). Our finding that overexpression of DCAF1 leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of Vpr WT is consistent with previous observations reported by Zhang et al. (22Zhang S. Feng Y. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene. 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In light of the currently proposed mechanism of Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest (11Le Rouzic E. Belaidouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.-C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), it might suggest that ubiquitination of Vpr targets occurs in the cytoplasm following recruitment of the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 complex. Vpr Is Stabilized within an Active Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 Complex—Stabilization of Vpr might merely result from an association with free DCAF1 that could mask the recognition site of another E3 ubiquitin ligase. Alternatively, it might require Vpr assembly with a functional Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase. To address this question, we coexpressed Vpr and DCAF1 in cells where DDB1 was depleted by siRNA treatment. As expected, DCAF1-mediated Vpr stabilization still occurred in cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, DDB1 silencing decreased steady levels of Vpr WT and prevented Vpr stabilization by DCAF1 overexpression (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4). That Vpr stabilization was dependent on DDB1 suggested that the whole Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase is required to protect Vpr from proteasomal degradation. In agreement with this hypothesis, DCAF1 overexpression significantly enhanced Vpr-mediated G2 arrest (Fig. 6B). Virion-associated Vpr Is Protected from Degradation within the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 Complex—Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1-mediated Vpr stabilization might represent a way to optimize the activity of Vpr molecules that are delivered by the incoming virus before neosynthesis takes place. To address this question, we analyzed Vpr expression in cells first treated with DCAF1 or DDB1 siRNA and then transduced with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein pseudotyped HIV-1ΔVpr viruses containing the HA-Vpr protein (Fig. 7A). In this system, the detected Vpr protein could only come from the incoming viral particle. In agreement with our hypothesis, both DDB1 and DCAF1 silencing decreased the levels of the incoming Vpr protein (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 2 and 1 and lanes 3 and 1). The main finding of our study is that the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 CRUL, which is usurped by HIV-1 Vpr to promote cell cycle arrest, protects the viral protein from proteasomal degradation by another E3 ubiquitin ligase. This mechanism can take place in the early steps of the viral cell cycle when the virion-associated protein has just been delivered to the infected cell. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented example of a mechanism in which a viral protein exploits a host E3 ligase both to mediate its activity and to extend its half-life, thus creating a positive feedback loop. A more general feature of viral proteins that act by hijacking a host E3 ligase appears to be their escape from the ubiquitination process catalyzed by the recruited enzyme. Thus, we recently demonstrated that HIV-1 Vpu is not targeted for degradation by the CRUL that it recruits although it binds to the βTrCP adaptor through the very motif, which normally labels proteins as substrates. Instead another as yet non-identified ligase ensures proteasome targeting of the viral protein (23Estrabaud E. Le Rouzic E. Lopez-Verges S. Morel M. Belaidouni N. Benarous R. Transy C. Berlioz-Torrent C. Margottin-Goguet F. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A similar process is likely to occur for the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, whose fate as adaptors or substrates involves separable domains of the viral protein (24Kehmeier E. Ruhl H. Voland B. Stoppler M.C. Androphy E. Stoppler H. Virology. 2002; 299: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Gonzalez S.L. Stremlau M. He X. Basile J.R. Munger K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7583-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, E7 targets the Rb protein for degradation through the use of a cullin 2 CRUL (26Huh K. Zhou X. Hayakawa H. Cho J.Y. Libermann T.A. Jin J. Harper J.W. Munger K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 9737-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and is itself degraded by a Skp2-containing Cul1 CRUL (27Oh K.J. Kalinina A. Wang J. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Bagchi S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5338-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Another example documented by Precious et al. (28Precious B.L. Carlos T.S. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. Virology. 2007; 368: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is the SV5 V protein, which induces STAT1 degradation through the use of the Cul4A-DDB1 core ligase. These authors elegantly underscore a catalytic process, where a small pool of V protein is recycled to degrade a large excess of STAT1. How an E3 ligase discriminates substrates from adaptors regardless of their viral or host origin is an intriguing question that is still a matter of debate (for a review, see Ref. 29Wu J.T. Chan Y.R. Chien C.T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 362-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In any event, protection of its own constituents is a requisite for an E3 ligase to achieve a catalytic ubiquitination process as opposed to a rather inefficient stoichiometric process. Only a few studies have addressed the stability of Vpr WT protein. Kewalramani and Emerman (30Kewalramani V.N. Emerman M. Virology. 1996; 218: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported a half-life of ∼20 h for HIV-1 Vpr, in marked contrast with a much shorter half-life of HIV-2 Vpr, estimated to 90 min. We did not observe such a difference between the turnover of HIV-1 Vpr and that of HIV-2 and SIVmac Vpr species. Moreover, based on the 2-3-fold stabilization of Vpr by a 6-h MG132 treatment, we estimate a Vpr half-life of ∼3 h, close to the 4 h reported in the study of Schröfelbauer et al. (19Schrofelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The latter study also showed stabilization of Vpr by MG132 in agreement with a proteasome-mediated degradation process. That a relatively short half-life is conserved across Vpr species from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVmac despite the well known plasticity of retroviral genomes argues for a functional constrain. Among possible hypotheses, mutational inactivation of the Vpr degron might be incompatible with the preservation of its activity, or it might confer an increased toxicity disadvantageous for the virus. The distinctive higher stability of SIVagm Vpr together with its lack of interaction with uracil-N-glycosylase 2 and of cell cycle arrest activity may raise questions as to its classification as a Vpr ortholog. In this respect, it is interesting to note that prior to the phylogenetic study of Tristem et al. (15Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the Vpr-like protein encoded by SIVagm was actually classified as Vpx. Stabilization of Vpr by the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 is reminiscent of DDB1-mediated stabilization of the HBx protein encoded by human hepatitis B virus (31Bergametti F. Bianchi J. Transy C. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Leupin O. Bontron S. Strubin M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6274-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, that HBx uses the DDB1-Cul4 ligase to induce the degradation of host proteins has not yet been addressed. In the case of Vpr, which is packaged in the virion (16Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such a protection mechanism may represent an efficient way to optimize the activity of Vpr molecules that are delivered by the incoming virus before neosynthesis takes place. So far, no cell culture system has revealed a severe defect in HIV replication in the absence of Vpr. However, the functional importance of Vpr is strongly suggested by its conservation by the HIV-1 and SIVmac/HIV-2 lentiviral lineages as well as by the in vivo reversion events occurring in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys (33Lang S.M. Weeger M. Stahl-Hennig C. Coulibaly C. Hunsmann G. Muller J. Muller-Hermelink H. Fuchs D. Wachter H. Daniel M.M. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 902-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous demonstration that Vpr acts by recruiting the DCAF1 component of the Cul4A CRUL (11Le Rouzic E. Belaidouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.-C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) together with our present finding of Vpr stabilization by this ligase point to the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction as a new potential therapeutic target.

Here we establish a new mode of interaction of these two pathways and propose Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)-1 as an essential player in mediating cross-talk. We observed that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and SOCS1 form an intracellular complex through an interaction, which required the SH2 domain of SOCS1 and the ligand binding domain of GR. Furthermore, GC stimulation was found to increase the nuclear level of SOCS1. SOCS1 binding to the GR did not require ligand binding of the receptor; however, it was abolished after long term GC stimulation, suggesting a functional role of the interaction for the early phase of GC action. The interaction between GR and SOCS1 appeared to negatively influence the transcription of the two GR-regulated genes, FKBP5 and MKP1, because the GC-dependent expression of these genes was inhibited by the SOCS1 inducer IFNgamma and enhanced in SOCS1-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts as compared with IFNgamma treated wild-type cells. Our results suggest a prominent role of SOCS1 in the early phase of cross-talk between GR and cytokine signaling."

In nature, the liberation of HCN serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores and microbial attack in a large variety of plants (1Conn E.E. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E.

In vitro, the (reverse) cyanohydrin synthesis reaction is favored (4Klempier N. Griengl H. Hayn M.

One problem was the limitation in crystallographic resolution for the complexes. Another problem was posed by the “stickiness” of the active site, which resulted in unwanted complexes at high resolution with histidine (used as a buffer in the first samples (12Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) or glycerol (used as a cryoprotectant (13Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Hence, no truly “native” cryotemperature structure to high resolution with an empty active site has been available to which those complexes could be compared. Here we present the analysis of four atomic resolution structures of Hb-HNL: native and in complex with acetone, isopropyl alcohol (synthesis substrate and substrate analog), and thiocyanate (inhibitor). We primarily focus on the subtleties of ligand binding revealed from the contact patterns in the active site and from complementary ab initio modeling of the protonation state on those highly accurate protein models. From the structures, we deduce the subtleties of substrate recognition and protein-substrate interaction as well as the importance of the structural flexibility of this enzyme. Analysis of the thiocyanate structure provides information on the protonation state and the electron distribution in the binding site. In combination with the structures of the acetone and isopropyl alcohol complexes, we could model the relative positioning of the two substrates in the protein. The combination of accurate structural data and ab initio quantum chemical calculations aided in under-standing the mechanism of active site adaptation, the requirements for catalysis, and the influence of pH. Sample Preparation and Crystallization—Hb-HNL was obtained from the company DSM and purified as described elsewhere (17Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5884-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A solution of Hb-HNL with a concentration of 12 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 was used for crystallization by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Crystallization drops were set up in Linbro plates on siliconized glass coverslides. The wells were sealed with immersion oil. The reservoir solution contained 2% polyethylene glycol 400 and 2 m ammonium sulfate in 100 mm Hepes-Na buffer at pH 7.5. Drops of 4 μl of protein solution mixed with 4 μl of reservoir solution were equilibrated against 1000 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Streak seeding using a cat's whisker was applied ∼2 h after setting up the drops. This was essential for producing high quality crystals, which appeared within a few days and rapidly grew to an average size of 350 × 200 × 100 μm3. The ligands for complexes, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and thiocyanate (a known inhibitor) were added by soaking. Of the volatiles acetone and isopropyl alcohol, 20 μl were added directly to the reservoir solution. After 10 h of equilibration, another 50 μl were added to the reservoir for overnight equilibration. For the thiocyanate soak, a 500 mm solution of NaSCN was prepared in reservoir solution. 1 μl of this solution was then added directly to the drop containing native crystals. These crystals were left to incubate for 24 h. In contrast to previous methods (18Wagner U.G. Schall M. Hasslacher M. Hayn M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and in order to avoid the formation of unwanted complexes with glycerol, the crystals were briefly transferred into a cryoprotectant of 15-20% polyethylene glycol 200 in reservoir solution prior to data collection and shock-frozen to 100 K directly on the beamline goniostat in the nitrogen stream. Data Collection and Processing—Crystallographic data were collected on the EMBL Hamburg beamlines equipped with a single axis goniostat and Marresearch 165-mm CCD and 345-mm image plate detectors. The data collection was carried out in two passes to a high resolution cut-off of 0.9 and 2 Å. For the low resolution passes, the exposure time was adjusted to avoid overloads. The final, merged data sets were 100% complete and extended to 1.25 Å for the complex with acetone and to 1.05 Å for the other three structures. Data were processed using the HKL suite (19Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar).

Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13811) Google Scholar). This was followed by cycles of isotropic refinement with REFMAC against structure factor amplitudes and automatic solvent building using ARP/wARP (22Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Corrections to the model and the addition of alternate conformers were carried out manually using the graphics program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystal-logr. Sect.

Further refinement was performed with SHELXL (24Sheldrick G.M. SHELXL-97. University of Gottingen, Gottingen Germany1997Google Scholar) against diffraction intensities. At this stage, hydrogen atoms at their calculated positions were included. Finally, the models were refined with individual anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. This procedure was applied to all structures and resulted in final R-values between 0.10 and 0.13 (Table 1). The coordinate error estimates were calculated using SFCHECK (25Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The coordinates and diffraction data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 3C6X (NAT), 3C6Y (ACET), 3C6Z (ISOP), and 3C70 (SCN). Quantum Chemical (QC) Calculations—Ab initio calculations were done using the GAMESS (26Schmidt M.W. Baldridge K.K. Boatz J.A. Elbert S.T. Gordon M.S. Jensen J.H. Koseki S. Matsunaga N. Nguyen K.A.

A 6-31G** basis set and a Hückel model for the construction of the initial orbitals was used in Hartree-Fock type calculations. In order to minimize the number of atoms, the amino acids involved in substrate contact were modeled as follows: His235 as imidazole, Asp207 as acetic acid, Ser80 as methanol, and Lys236 as aminoethane. Their protonation states were varied and are listed in Fig. 2. The coordinates for these residues and the ligands acetone and thiocyanate/isothiocyanic acid were taken from the refined crystal structures. In order to mimic the predetermined placement of these residues in a larger molecule, some of the coordinates were fixed in space. This was done by constraining those distances (one per residue) that were not interfering with the contacts of interest. In case of multiple conformers, the one with the higher occupancy (corresponding to the ligand-bound state by analysis of contacts) was used. Model runs were set up using a combination of the structures with thiocyanate and acetone, in an attempt to mimic the substrate interaction. For these calculations, the sulfur atom was removed from thiocyanate to model the natural substrate cyanide (hydrocyanic acid). Acetone was placed into the thiocyanate structure from an overlay of the two crystal structures. Various protonation states were tried for all models (Fig. 2). We determined four structures of Hb-HNL to atomic resolution: native (NAT) and complexes with acetone (ACET), isopropyl alcohol (ISOP), and thiocyanate (SCN) (Table 1). In all cases, the electron density was of very high quality, permitting the assignment of atom types, unambiguous determination of side chain orientations, and estimation of occupancies for residues with static disorder. In the structures determined to 1.05 Å, numerous hydrogen atoms were visible even in the first maps; however, they showed mostly on the main chain and aliphatic side chains. A few residues showed two distinct main chain conformers. Side chain disorder occurred primarily in surface lysines and glutamates, whereas only very few other residues showed distinct multiple conformers. Among the latter were Ser80 in the ACET and SCN structures and His235 in ISOP, both residues of the catalytic triad. In addition to the ligands in the active site in the structures ACET, ISOP, and SCN, several sulfate ions from the crystallization buffer were found in all structures on the protein surface and in intermolecular contact regions. In ACET, NAT, and ISOP, additional residual density was found that was attributed to a polyethylene glycol molecule from the crystallization buffer. Also, Cys94 appeared to be modified by attachment of β-mercaptoethanol in those structures. Overall, the four structures superimpose almost perfectly with r.m.s. deviations that are of the same order of magnitude as the coordinate variations (Tables 1 and 2), but the arrangement of the active site residues shows distinct and significant shifts upon ligand binding. Most pronounced are the changes in distances between Ser80 Oγ and Cys81 Sγ, Ser80 Oγ and His235 Nϵ2, and Lys236 Nζ and His235 Nϵ2 (Table 3). Interestingly, in the NAT, ISOP, and ACET structures, the distance between Ser80 Oγ and His235 Nϵ2 is too long for a hydrogen bond, in contrast to other catalytic triads commonly found in a variety of hydrolases (Table 3).TABLE 2r.m.s. deviation values (Å) for the superposition of the protein structures (all protein atoms)NATISOPACETSCNNAT00.060.090.05ISOP00.090.06ACET00.08SCN0 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Contact distances (Å) and their variations (r.m.s. deviation from mean) in the HNL active siteAsp207-His235, Oδ1-Nϵ2His235-Ser80, Nϵ2-OγSer80-Cys81, Oγ-SγCys81-Thr11, Sγ-Oγ1Glu79-Lys236, Oϵ2-NζLys236-His235, Nζ-Nϵ2ÅÅÅÅÅÅNAT2.703.774.083.812.714.67ISOP2.783.234.503.772.744.50ACET2.663.734.153.812.724.56SCN2.703.004.603.922.734.74r.m.s. deviation0.050.380.260.060.010.11 Open table in a new tab The active site lies in a deep cavity that is only accessible through a very narrow tunnel formed by the residues of the so-called cap domain (Fig. 3) and thus is well protected from the solvent, as was also reported earlier (12Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It features a catalytic triad consisting of Ser80, His235, and Asp207. These residues are always very well defined in the electron density in single conformation, with the two exceptions mentioned above. Further residues within contact range to the triad are Lys236, Thr11, and Cys81. In the native structure, the active site contains a small cluster of very well defined water molecules. All except one of these waters are replaced by the ligands in the other structures. This remaining water is located in a pocket just underneath the catalytic His235 (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Active site overlay.

They are held in place by Ser80 of the catalytic triad and nearby Thr11 through hydrogen bonding contacts to the oxygen atom of the ketone or alcohol functional groups (Figs. 4 and 5). In the ISOP structure, His235 occurs in two conformations, although the bound isopropyl alcohol molecule is fully occupied. In the ACET and SCN structures, Ser80 appears in two conformations. In ACET, this seems to correlate with the total occupancy of 0.80 for the acetone ligand, which itself appears in two conformations with occupancies of 0.50 and 0.30 (adding up to 0.80). We think that the conformer of Ser80 with the occupancy of 0.80 relates to a “loaded” state, since it points to the acetone molecule and makes a well defined hydrogen bonding contact. The conformer with the occupancy of 0.20 would then correspond to an “open” state and indicates elevated flexibility of that residue. The two conformers of acetone are rotated by a small amount with respect to each other around an axis perpendicular to the molecule plane but leaving the oxygen atom position the same. Rhodanide binds deeper in the active site pocket and makes contacts to both Lys236 and His235 via its nitrogen end. The nitrogen atom occupies a position taken by a water molecule in the NAT and ACET structures. The sulfur atom occupies the position taken by the central carbon atoms of acetone or isopropyl alcohol in the ACET and ISOP structures (Fig. 4). The electron density for thiocyanate clearly shows the very short bond of 1.16 Å between the carbon and nitrogen atom, whereas the sulfur atom is well separated in the map at a distance of 1.74 Å from the carbon. This indicates that of the two possible isoelectronic forms (Fig. 6), the one with the triple C≡N bond and the single C-S bond occurs in the crystal structure. With the exception of His235 in NAT, which by its appearance in the electron density seemed to be in the deprotonated state, no hydrogen atoms could be directly observed in the active site, neither on the ligands nor on the active site residues. We thus used the hydrogen bonding geometry and contact distances (Table 3) for a first assessment of the protonation state around the SCN ligand. The electron density suggests that the S-C≡N configuration with two clear contacts from the SCN nitrogen atom to Lys236 and His235 at angles of 136 and 106 degrees to the CN bond, and at 109° to each other. The four parent atoms (Nζ of Lys236, Nϵ2ofHis235, and C and N of SCN) are in a roughly planar arrangement (Fig. 5). We investigated the imidazol ring geometry in the active site histidine His235 and compared it with the Engh and Huber (27Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar) parameters for unprotonated and protonated histidine rings. Our four structures can be divided into two categories corresponding to protonated and deprotonated stereochemistry. In the NAT and ISOP structures, His235 seems deprotonated, whereas in the SCN and ACET structures, it looks protonated (Fig. 7). Ab Initio QC Calculations—The different possible protonation states were tried in ab initio calculations (Fig. 2). For the SCN structure, a state with the ligand-deprotonated hydrogen bonding to a protonated His235 and a deprotonated Ser80 reproduces the crystal structure with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.01 Å (QC1 in Table 4).TABLE 4Results from the ab initio calculations with the ligand SCN in the active site compared with the SCN crystal structureSCNQC1QC2QC3QC4QC5QC6Crystal structureSCNSscn-Cscn1.737 (1.16)1.651 (1.31)1.669 (1.22)1.692 (1.30)1.548 (1.97)1.604 (1.59)1.74Cscn-Nscn1.159 (2.56)1.158 (2.49)1.250 (1.69)1.264 (1.64)1.209 (1.76)1.161 (2.18)1.16Nscn-HscnNPaProton-shifted between His and SCN (i.e. Hscn = Hϵ2); for the H-SCN His-H+ cases, additional proton at 0.90 Å at appropriate dihedral angle.NPNP1.004 (0.89)1.005 (0.83)NP0.90Nscn-Hϵ22.070 (0.08)2.088 NAbNP, not present in this setup.1.025 (0.86)2.896 NA2.402 NA1.041 (0.63)0.90/2.07cNA, included but not available.His235Nϵ2-Hϵ20.913 (0.79)0.999 (0.79)2.262 NA1.006 (0.87)0.994 (0.84)1.691 (0.12)0.90/2.07cNA, included but not available.Nϵ2-Nscn2.982 NA3.087 NA3.145 NA3.611 NA3.282 NA2.731 NA2.97Lys236Hζ1-Nscn2.241 NA2.110 (0.07)2.199 NA1.756 (0.15)2.160 NA2.862 NA2.24Hζ1-Nζ0.903 (0.78)1.012 (0.78)1.084 (0.56)1.042 (0.70)1.016 (0.78)1.024 (0.73)0.89Ser80Hγ-OγNP0.942 (0.87)NPNP0.944 (0.86)0.944 (0.86)0.82Oγ-Cscn3.131 NA3.170 NA3.443 NA3.243 NA3.198 NA3.385 NA3.13Asp207Oϵ1-Hδ11.807 (0.17)1.948 NA2.059 NA2.123 NA0.968 (0.74)1.445 (0.22)1.80Oϵ1-Nδ12.723 NA2.945 NA3.047 NA3.120 NA2.780 NA2.532 NA2.70Overall r.m.s. deviation to crystal structureNonhydrogen atoms0.0120.1290.2290.3500.1560.286NPCommentMatchSmall shiftsLarge shiftsLarge shiftsSmall shiftsLarge shiftsNPa Proton-shifted between His and SCN (i.e. Hscn = Hϵ2); for the H-SCN His-H+ cases, additional proton at 0.90 Å at appropriate dihedral angle.b NP, not present in this setup.c NA, included but not available. Open table in a new tab In a subsequent model run, CN- was created from the SCN- ion by removing the sulfur atom, and this model was then subject to the same set of calculations (Table 5). Here the r.m.s. deviations to the crystal structure are generally higher than for the SCN structures (Table 4), indicating that the active site may need to adapt to the CN- ligand with subtle shifts. In a setting with HCN (not CN-) as the ligand, a protonated His235, and a deprotonated Ser80, the proton shifts from HCN onto the serine (QC4 in Table 5), indicating that the contacts to this residue permit such transfer. Generally, it seems that a proton on Ser80 is in any case vital for retaining a stable arrangement of residues similar to that in the crystal structure (QC2, QC5, and QC6 in Table 5).TABLE 5Results from the ab initio calculations with CN as a ligand and compared with the SCN crystal structureCNQC1QC2QC3QC4QC5QC6Crystal structureCNCcn-NcnNAaNP, not present in this setup.1.161 (2.60)NA1.177 (2.41)1.280 (1.57)1.178 (2.26)1.16Ncn-HcnNPbNA, included but not available.NPNA1.268 (0.30)1.029 (0.88)NP0.90Ncn-Hϵ2NA2.106 (0.08)NA2.170 (NA)2.073 (0.12)1.013 (0.72)0.90/2.07cProton-shifted between His and SCN (i.e. Hscn = Hϵ2); for the H-SCN His-H+ cases, additional proton at 0.90 Å at appropriate dihedral angle.His235Nϵ2-Hϵ2NA1.005 (0.78)NP1.002 (0.78)1.014 (0.74)2.093 (0.07)0.90/2.07cProton-shifted between His and SCN (i.e. Hscn = Hϵ2); for the H-SCN His-H+ cases, additional proton at 0.90 Å at appropriate dihedral angle.Nϵ2-NcnNA3.110 (NA)NA3.135 (NA)3.084 (NA)3.105 (NA)2.97Lys236Hζ1-NcnNA1.745 (0.16)NA2.276 (NA)2.073 (0.08)2.261 (NA)2.24Hζ1-NζNA1.042 (0.69)NA1.012 (0.77)1.018 (0.79)1.010 (0.80)0.89Ser80Hγ-OγNP0.949 (0.812)NP1.177dNo proton originally attached to Ser80; proton abstracted from ligand.

Open table in a new tab For the next model run, the SCN and ACET structures were overlaid, and the acetone molecule from the ACET structure was added to the (H)CN complex in an attempt to model the two ligands in the active site together and to determine which state of the active site favors catalysis. This setup required Ser80 to be protonated (QC2, QC5, and QC6 in Table 6), since this is the only polar contact the acetone molecule makes in the protein apart from the second hydrogen bond to Thr11 (Fig. 2 and Table 6). Settings with a protonated His235 (QC2 and QC5 in Table 6) seem favorable and result in a structure that contains a cyanohydrin molecule closely linked to Ser80 via a hydrogen bridge. Thus, the acetone molecule, which in the overlay of structures lay with its plane roughly perpendicular to the SCN ligand, now flips over to form a tetrahedral structure with a strong covalent bond to the CN moiety (Fig. 8 and QC5 in Table 6). On the other hand, in a setting with SCN-H and a deprotonated His235 (QC6 in Table 6), the original ligands HCN and acetone are retained, and the cyanohydrin does not form during the course of the calculations, indicating a pivotal role of the correct protonation state of His235. These results show that the ligands in the SCN and ACET structures occupy the positions required for catalysis an"

Dimerization of the TREX enzymes generates a central extended β-sheet across the entire molecule and positions the active sites toward opposite outer edges on the same face of the enzyme. Additional structural elements unique to TREX1 and TREX2 are found flanking the active sites and positioned near the dimer interface. The presence of two related TREX genes is only seen in mammalian genomes (23Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14718-14727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas other metazoans, including amphibians and insects, have a single TREX gene. The presence of two related TREX genes in mammals and not in other species suggests the need in higher organisms for distinct dimeric 3′-deoxyribonucleases with modified unique elements to provide for specific cellular functions.Mutations in the human TREX1 gene cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome mediated through immune dysfunction (24Crow Y.J.

TREX1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and relocates into the nucleus along with the SET complex in response to DNA-damaging conditions. In the nucleus TREX1 is proposed to participate in a cell death pathway by acting with the NM23-H1 endonuclease to degrade the genomic DNA (27Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P.C. Zhang D. Sung J.S.

Cells lacking this ability show a high incidence of cancers (33Goldsby R.E. Lawrence N.A. Hays L.E. Olmsted E.A. Chen X. Singh M. Preston B.D. Nat.

Similarities to the proofreading exonucleases and the preference for frayed DNA ends lead to the proposal that the TREX enzymes might serve an extrinsic function to proofread errors generated by DNA polymerases that lack intrinsic exonuclease activities (5Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19655-19660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There is some genetic evidence for extrinsic proofreading by some exonucleases of DNA polymerases (35McElhinny S.A.N.

Hubscher U. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 364-375Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although direct genetic evidence for a TREX2 role in mammalian DNA maintenance is lacking, cells deleted of TREX2 exhibit increased levels of chromosomal rearrangements suggesting a role in genome stability (38Chen M.J.

The severe consequences of 3′-deoxyribonuclease loss of function in cells highlight the need to understand the precise mechanisms of these exonucleases in DNA metabolic processes.The nature of efficient catalysis at DNA 3′ termini was revealed in the TREX2 structure, and mutagenesis confirmed contributions of key residues on a disordered loop positioned adjacent the active sites (20Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A flexible loop region containing three Arg residues is appropriately positioned to bind a nucleic acid polymer substrate and control entry into the active site. The sequence of the loop region in TREX2 is distinguished from that of TREX1. The kinetic studies presented here address the 3′-deoxyribonuclease action of the TREX2 enzyme by precisely quantifying contributions of key residues within TREX2 to catalysis of deoxyribonucleotide polymers. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that each of the three arginines positioned on the α6–α7 loop, which is disordered in the crystal structure, all contribute to nucleic acid binding. Studies presented here provide evidence that there is direct communication between the TREX2 active sites within the dimer despite the considerable distance separating these sites. These data indicate that the dimer structure of the TREX enzymes has both catalytic and biologic implications.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide 5′-ATACGACGGTGACAGTGTTGTCAGACAGGT-3′ and the same oligonucleotide with 5′-fluorescein (FAM) 3The abbreviations used are: FAM, 5′-fluorescein; BD, binding density; WT, wild type; MUT, mutant; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. were from Operon.Enzyme Preparation—The plasmid constructs used to express the human TREX2 enzyme and variants in Escherichia coli and purification of the enzymes have been described (20Perrino F.W.

The TREX2 variant plasmid constructs were produced using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis strategy (40Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Variant TREX2 heterodimers were prepared using a procedure similar to that described for preparation of TREX1 heterodimers (29Lee-Kirsch M.A. Chowdhury D. Harvey S. Gong M. Senenko L. Engel K. Pfeiffer C. Hollis T. Gahr M. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Hubner N. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, a variant and a wild-type copy of TREX2 were cloned on separate plasmids for coexpression in E. coli. The TREX2R163A,R165A,R167A and TREX2H188A variant genes were cloned into the pLM303X plasmid lacking a polyhistidine sequence retaining the rhinovirus 3C protease recognition site between the maltose-binding protein and TREX2. The WT TREX2 gene was cloned as a fusion of the His-tagged NusA with TREX2 in the pCDFDuet-1 plasmid (Novagen). The pLM303X-TREX2 variants and pCDFDuet-1-TREX2-WT plasmids were co-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) resulting in the possible formation of WT/WT homodimers, WT/MUT heterodimers, and MUT/MUT homodimers. The WT/WT TREX2 homodimers and WT/MUT TREX2 heterodimers were recovered using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The WT/MUT TREX2 heterodimers were recovered by subsequent chromatography using an amylose resin. The His-tagged NusA and maltose-binding proteins were removed from the fusion by treatment with PreScission Protease™ (GE Biosciences), and the TREX2 enzyme was purified using a phosphocellulose column.Exonuclease Assays-Time Course Reactions—The exonuclease time course reactions (210 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 nm FAM-30-mer oligonucleotide, and 380 pm TREX2 protein. Incubations were at 25 °C. At the indicated times, the samples were removed, quenched by addition of 3 volumes of cold ethanol, and dried in vacuo. Pellets were resuspended in 6 μl of formamide, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and separated on 23% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescent-labeled bands were visualized and quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The amount of dNMP excised in a reaction was quantified as described (39Perrino F.W. Krol A. Harvey S. Zheng S.L. Horita D.A. Hollis T. Meyers D.A. Isaacs W.B. Xu J.F. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2004; 44: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Steady-state Reactions—The exonuclease reactions (10 μl) to determine Km and kcat values for the variant TREX2 proteins were as described above with the concentrations of FAM-30-mer oligonucleotide and TREX2 proteins indicated in the figure and table legends. The reactions to determine Km and kcat values for the wild-type TREX2 were 50 μl. Incubations were at 25 °C for 20 min. Reaction products were quantified to determine the amount of dNMP excised as described above. All enzyme dilutions were prepared on ice in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The steady-state kinetic data were fit to a hyperbolic equation to calculate the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters. The Km and kcat values and standard errors for TREX2 and variant proteins were determined by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 8.02 (SPSS Science, Inc.).Equilibrium DNA Binding Analysis—The DNA binding reactions (30 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 10 nm FAM-30-mer plus unlabeled 30-mer to yield the indicated final oligonucleotide concentration and TREX2 protein. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements to quantify TREX2 binding to the FAM-30-mer were obtained at 25 °C from reaction samples (20 μl) in microtiter plates using a Tecan Safire2TM with fluorescence polarization module using excitation and emission wavelengths of 470 and 525 nm, respectively. The observed relative fluorescence anisotropy (relative Aobs) is presented as follows: relative Aobs = (An - Ao)/Ao, where An is the anisotropy at point n in the titration, and Ao is the anisotropy of the DNA in the absence of TREX2. The maximum relative Aobs in TREX2 titrations using 10 nm FAM-30-mer and Ca2+ is 15 ± 0.6.A modification of the macromolecular competition titration method described by Bujalowski and co-workers (41Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 42Bujalowski W. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 556-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used to quantify TREX2 binding to the 30-mer DNA. A series of titrations was performed with increased amounts of TREX2 and 10 nm FAM-30-mer plus unlabeled 30-mer to yield the indicated final DNA concentrations. Binding of TREX2 to the unlabeled 30-mer competes with binding to the FAM-30-mer. The average binding density (BD) to the 30-mer and the concentration of free TREX2, TREX2F, were calculated using the mass conservation (Equations 1 and 2) (42Bujalowski W. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 556-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), BD=(TREX2Total2−TREX2Total1)(DNATotal2−DNATotal1) (Eq. 1) and TREX2F=(DNATotal1×TREX2Total2−DNATotal2×TREX2Total1)(DNATotal1−DNATotal2) (Eq. 2) Model-independent binding isotherms were generated for TREX2 and variants by relating the dependence of the observed relative fluorescence anisotropy to the calculated BD and TREX2F from DNA binding curves measured at five different DNA concentrations between 300 and 1500 nm. The TREX2 DNA titration data were analyzed using Equations 13–15 from Jezewska et al. (44Jezewska M.J. Galletto R. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5955-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to obtain the intrinsic binding constant K and cooperativity parameter ω for TREX2 binding to the 30-mer DNA. The binding data were fit to the indicated equations using SigmaPlot 8.02 (SPSS Science, Inc.).Single Turnover Reactions—Single turnover kinetic assays were performed using a Biologic SFM-400 (Bio-Logic USA, LLC, Knoxville, TN) configured for quench-flow and the same reaction buffer as the steady-state experiments except the bovine serum albumin was replaced with 10% glycerol. An aliquot (75 μl) of the TREX2 solution from one syringe was mixed with the oligonucleotide substrate (75 μl) from the second syringe, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for time intervals ranging from 4 to 2000 ms. Reactions were quenched in 0.3 m EDTA (final concentration) by an aliquot (75 μl) from a third syringe. A portion of the quenched reaction mixture (10 μl) was dried in vacuo, resuspended in 8 μl of formamide, and processed as described above to quantify the products. The amount of 30-mer was plotted against time and fit by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 8.0 to the single exponential equation: [30-mer] = A·e-kobs·t + C, where A is the amplitude; t is the time; C is the final [30-mer], and kobs is the observed TREX2 exonuclease rate.Protein and Nucleic Acid Concentrations—The proteins and oligonucleotides were quantified by A280 and A260, respectively. Protein and DNA concentrations were determined using the web tools available from ExPAsy (45Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar) and OligoCalc, respectively. TREX2 concentrations are expressed as protomer, and oligomer concentrations are expressed as 3′ termini.RESULTSCatalytic Efficiency of TREX2—Three arginines located at residue 163, 165, and 167 on the α6-α7 loops positioned adjacent to the active sites contribute to TREX2 catalytic efficiency. Our previous studies demonstrate the high catalytic efficiencies of TREX1 and TREX2, with about a 10-fold lower efficiency for TREX2 relative to that of TREX1 (23Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14718-14727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data indicated that this 10-fold lower efficiency of TREX2 could be largely attributed to differences in DNA binding. Mutation of all three arginines to alanine results in a dramatically decreased catalytic efficiency of the TREX2 enzyme, almost exclusively mediated through an increased Km value suggesting a DNA binding contribution by one or all three of these arginines (20Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To identify contributions to exonuclease activity by the Arg-163, Arg-165, and Arg-167, a series of TREX2 variant enzymes was generated in which each of these residues was changed to alanine individually or in combinations, and the variant TREX2 enzymes were expressed and purified (supplemental Fig. 1). Interestingly, we were not able to express and purify a TREX2R165A enzyme indicating considerable instability in this variant TREX2 protein. The TREX2H160A enzyme was also prepared to test possible contributions to activity by the histidine located at position 160 on the TREX2 α6-α7 loop. The TREX2 and variant proteins were tested for 3′ → 5′-deoxyribonuclease activity in time course reactions using a 30-mer oligonucleotide to confirm the presence of exonuclease activity in each of the TREX2 proteins and to establish the relative 3′-nucleotide excision activities for the variant TREX2 enzymes. In separate reactions TREX2 or variant enzyme was incubated with the ssDNA oligonucleotide; samples were removed at the indicated times, and products were quantified after separation on urea-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). These data showed reduced excision activities for all of the TREX2 arginine to alanine variant proteins relative to the wild-type TREX2. The excision rates of the single Arg TREX2 variants were reduced 2–3-fold (TREX2R163A = 1.3 nm dNMP/s/nm enzyme and TREX2R167A = 0.94 nm dNMP/s/nm enzyme) relative to the TREX2WT rate of 2.8 nm dNMP/s/nm enzyme. The excision rates of the double Arg TREX2 variants were reduced further by 11–18-fold (TREX2R163A,R165A = 0.24 nm dNMP/s/nm enzyme, TREX2R163A,R167A = 0.17 nm dNMP/s/nm enzyme, and TREX2R165A,R167A = 0.16 nm dNMP/s/nm enzyme) relative to the TREX2WT. Finally, the excision rate of the triple Arg TREX2 variant was reduced 60-fold (TREX2R163A,R165A,R167A = 0.048 nm dNMP/s/nm"
