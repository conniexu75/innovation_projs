https://openalex.org/W2061245902,Incubation of sarcoma-37 ascites cells in vitro with actinomycin D resulted in inhibition of synthesis of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The overall inhibition could be prevented or relieved by glucose; it is thus unrelated to breakdown of template RNA.

https://openalex.org/W1990930156,Maximumn tetanic tension developed by frog muscle fibers was measured before and after they had been injured at one end so as to break myoplasmic continuity but to leave the sarcolemma-tube connection to the tendon. The lateral mechanical coupling between myoplasm and sarcolemma is adequate to bear and transmit the maximum active tension developed during stimulation.
https://openalex.org/W1970022556,Rats were given a single electroconvulsive shock at varying intervals after receiving a punishing shock to the feet immediately after stepping into a compartment. Significant amounts of retrograde amnesia for the memory of the punishment was shown when electroconvulsive shock was administered up to and including 30 seconds after the punishment but not at 60 seconds. This brief temporal gradient cannot be explained in terms of changed stimulus cues or learned interference analogous to retroactive inhibition.
https://openalex.org/W1994041507,OVER the past 50 years many workers have tried to maintain and multiply parenchymal liver cells in tissue culture without success. The following discussion indicates that inadequate oxygen supply may be the basis for this failure. The oxygen tension (pO2) of pooled venous blood is about 40 mm Hg while that of arterial blood is about 95 mm Hg. Therefore the pO2 to which liver cells are exposed in vivo should be somewhere between these values. Direct measurements of liver pO2 in the dog gave a median value of 70 mm Hg1. Let us take 40 mm Hg as the lowest tension in which liver cells can survive.

https://openalex.org/W2027103257,Release of a substance that stimulates smooth muscle was detected from a phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation from the rat upon direct and indirect stimulation. On thin-layer chromatography most of the active material behaved as a mixture of prostaglandins. The effect of electrical stimulation was mimicked by catecholamines but not by acetylcholine or eserine. The effect of nerve stimulation was not antagonized by d-tubocurarine.

https://openalex.org/W1989367758,"Tetrodotoxin, which effectively suppresses the permeability of various tissues to sodium ions, has no effect on the calcium action potential of the fiber of barnacle muscle, which potential is produced by increase in permeability to calcium ions. Manganese ions, however, suppress the action potential. When applied to fiber of frog cardiac ventricle, tetrodotoxin suppresses the rate of rise of the action potential without affecting the overshoot; the suppressive effect of manganese ion is mainly on the overshoot of the action potential. This suggests that, in the action potential of the car-diac ventricle of the frog, the platealu phase is related primarily to the increase in permeability of the membrane to calcium ions."

Spleen explants from mice treated with either phytohemagglutinin or adjuvant were stimulated to form hemagglutinins and hemolysins, whereas no treatment of spleen donors was necessary to invoke a ""graft-versus-host"" response which led to specific splenomegly."

It is suggested that passage through enlarged nuclear pores, incorporation within a pinched off invagination, or inclusion within the nuclear envelope at telophase may have been responsible for this unusual event."

https://openalex.org/W1963590437,"MALEIC hydrazide is one of the various reagents which induce breaks in the chromosomes of some plants at specific regions recognizable as heterochromatin1,2. It also inhibits growth in several species of plants, at least doubling the time taken to proceed through a complete mitotic cycle. Much of this delay in cell development has been explained by Evans and Scott3 as due to severe depression in the rate of DNA synthesis. They also suggest that the aberrations are produced at the time of duplication, and that maleic hydrazide acts by interfering, in some way, with the normal process of duplication. It was also found by Compton4 that it has a more pronounced effect on cell division in the roots than in the shoots. In view of its pronounced effects in plants, it was thought of interest to test this chemical for mutagenic action in Drosophila."

So far as is known, these facts are not recorded elsewhere; it was therefore felt that they were worth recording."
https://openalex.org/W2087845143,"IN an earlier paper on this topic1 we proposed a four-parameter equation (1), which expresses the quantitative relationship between the structure of p-disubstituted derivatives of benzene and the magnitude of their biological activity, for example intravenous LD50. This report presents our results on a group of compounds of the type NO2, NH2. The series includes all possible combinations of groups X and Y, with the exception of three substances which were not soluble enough even in 20 per cent aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone solution to make LD50 measurements possible. The experimental results fitted equation"

https://openalex.org/W2035433034,"CHEMICALLY, magnesium and calcium are related since both elements are members of Group II of the Periodic Table. Physiologically, however, in plants1 or in animals2 their actions are often antagonistic. It has been shown that magnesium-deficient rats absorb more calcium from the gastrointestinal tract than do control rats3 and the active transport of calcium ions across the intestinal wall of several species is depressed by magnesium ions4. These experiments indicate again a physiological antagonism between these ions and also suggest the possibility of a common absorptive pathway. However, the experimental conditions in the former study3 are abnormal since magnesium is an integral part of normal diets and magnesium deficiency may have caused changes in the intestinal mucosa which allowed more calcium to be absorbed. In vitro type experiments4 are, by their nature, unphysiological and extrapolations from such isolated systems to interpretations concerning overall calcium absorption in vivo may not be valid."

After storage for 1 month the recovery viability was 86 percent, and cells showed normal growth upon reinoculation into the defined growth medium."

https://openalex.org/W2059707921,"LEACH1 showed that N-acetylneuraminic acid was rapidly metabolized by human saliva and ascribed this to the presence of an inducible aldolase produced by contaminating micro-organisms since such destruction was prevented by the addition of ‘Ledermycin’ or by heating the saliva in boiling water. This appears to be the second step in a process whereby salivary mucoproteins having N-acetylneuraminic acid residues as their non-reducing end groups act as inducer molecules to oral bacteria, producing first a neuraminidase and later an aldolase which cleaves the N-acetylneuraminic acid liberated by the neuraminidase into N-acetylmannosamine and pyruvic acid. Such a sequence has been found by us2 to occur when (α1-glycoprotein, which is present in sputum, is used as an inducer molecule in cultures of Klebsiella aerogenes. We wish to report on the third step whereby N-acetylmannosamine itself is digested."

The recent development of a system for the cultivation of post-implantation rat embryos in vitro2 has made it possible to investigate the direct action of trypan blue on the isolated embryo."

https://openalex.org/W2065162939,"IT has been previously reported that incubation of egg lecithin with human plasma produces on the guinea-pig ileum a slow contraction which is, in many respects, indistinguishable from the slow contraction produced by the original plasma1. The slow contracting substance, which is formed in the plasma on incubation with lecithin, can be extracted with alcohol, can be adsorbed on kaolin, and can be precipitated by calcium. It is interesting to note that the amount of egg lecithin which doubles the slow muscle-contracting effect of dialysed plasma is about 250 mg per cent of the plasma, a concentration which roughly corresponds to the concentration of the naturally occurring choline-containing phospholipids in human plasma. This observation suggested an attempt to separate the lipid-soluble slow muscle-contracting substances from human plasma and from the lecithin-plasma incubate which contains 0.25 per cent egg lecithin."
