https://openalex.org/W1492953040,"Abstract An enzyme, methylase I, which methylates its endogenous protein has been purified from calf thymus. Acid hydrolysis of the methylated endogenous protein gives rise to two methylated amino acid derivatives. Both derivatives are very sensitive to alkali treatment, and one of the decomposition products is identified as methylurea. These findings, as well as other evidence, indicate that one of the compounds is guanidino-methylated arginine and the other is α-amino-, guanidino-methylated arginine. Various histones comprise approximately 70% of the total endogenous methylated protein, and the radioactivity is widely distributed among the various histones when the enzyme is labeled with S-adenosyl-l-methionine-methyl-14C. Protein methylase I has a pH optimum of 7.4 and a Km of 2.1 x 10-5 m for S-adenosyl-l-methionine."

The relationship between the stimulus intensity and area of stimulation was examined for each component of three different types of S-potential. It appears that for each component there is full summation over a large portion of the retina, a type of organization different from that found in the ganglion cell."
https://openalex.org/W1499640544,"Abstract Coenzyme A thiol esters of the complete series of positional isomers of methylene-interrupted cis,cis-octadecadienoic acid were synthesized. Their rates of reaction, catalyzed by acyl-CoA:phospholipid acyltransferases in liver microsomal preparations from four species, ranged from 0 to 87 mµmoles per min per mg of protein. In general, acyl transfer was relatively rapid with compounds containing the cis-ethylenic bonds near the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. The commonly found 9,12-isomer, linoleate, was not rapidly esterified at position 1 of 2-acylglycero-3-phosphorylcholine, although six other positional isomers reacted rapidly at the primary hydroxyl. In contrast to the 9,12-isomer, the 8,11- and 10,13-isomers were esterified rapidly to position 1 of lecithin and slowly to position 2. The alternating activities of the 8,11-, 9,12-, and 10,13-isomers and their inverse effects at positions 1 and 2 indicate that the structure near carbon atoms 8, 9, and 10 is critical in the metabolism of polyunsaturated acids."
https://openalex.org/W1544300387,"The circular dichroism spectra of horse heart ferri- and ferrocytochrome c in the absence and presence of 9 M urea, pH 7.0, in the wave length region 188 to 600 mµ have been examined and the results were compared with results of optical rotatory dispersion and absorption spectra. The circular dichroism spectra of both ferri- and ferrocytochrome c in the region below 240 mµ exhibit characteristics of both an α-helix, namely, the negative minima at about 222 and 210 mµ and a positive maximum at 190 mµ, and of β structurally organized polypeptide chain, a shoulder at 218 mµ and a peak at 195 mµ. The change of oxidation state of heme iron seems to be devoid of any significant effect on the dichroic pattern in this wave length region. The dichroic spectra in the near ultraviolet and the visible spectral regions are exceedingly rich in detail and exhibit strong dependence on the valence state of the protein. The reduction of the protein results in a significant increase in the rotatory strengths of the porphyrin transitions (300 to 370 mµ), the inversion of the dichroic pattern in the Soret absorption region, possible change of sign of the dichroic bands corresponding to the aromatic absorption bands, and replacement of the broad dichroic peaks above 500 mµ by multiple small positive peaks. An internally compensated conformational change during the oxidation-reduction cycle, including the possibility of switching of the centrally coordinated amino acid side chain or the alteration of the geometry of heme iron or both, has been discussed."

Several breaks, gaps, and unidentifiable fragments were found in the treated but, with a few exceptions, not in the control animals. Secondary constrictions were more numerous in the treated than in the untreated mice. Possible consequences are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2028872999,The large mysid crustacean Gnathophausia ingens (between 35 and 125 millimeters long) lives at oxygen concentrations between 1.25 and 0.20 milliliter per liter along the coast of California. It lives aerobically at these low oxygen concentrations by regulating its rate of oxygen consumption in water having down to and below 0.26 milliliter of oxygen per liter.
https://openalex.org/W2016627351,"A sound-scattering layer, composed of discrete hyperbolic echosequences and apparently restricted to the Slope Water region of the western North Atlantic, has been identified from the Deep Submergence Research Vehicle Alvin with schools of the myctophid fish Ceratoscopelus maderensis. By diving into the layer and using Alvin's echo-ranging sonar, we approached and visually identified the sound scatterers. The number of echo sequences observed with the surface echo-sounder (1/23.76 × 105 cubic meters of water) checked roughly with the number of sonar targets observed from the submarine (1/7.45 × 105 cubic meters). The fish schools appeared to be 5 to 10 meters thick, 10 to 100 meters in diameter, and on centers 100 to 200 meters apart. Density within schools was estimated at 10 to 15 fish per cubic meter."
https://openalex.org/W1483217070,"The oxidation rates for palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids as their albumin complexes and for caprylic, butyric, and acetic acid as their potassium salts with isolated rat liver mitochondria were studied in a system where it had previously been demonstrated that the respiratory chain and the coupling of phosphorylation to oxidation is intact even at high concentrations of long chain fatty acids. Results were obtained which apparently fitted the Michaelis-Menten equation. The values of Km decreased with increasing length of the carbon chain. Of the long chain fatty acids, linoleic acid has the lowest constant. Vmax for long chain fatty acids was highest for linoleic acid, but this value was not as high as those of short chain fatty acids. However, if different substrates were compared in terms of the product nVmax, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, linoleic acid shows as high values as short chain fatty acids. The possibility is discussed that linoleic acid has the highest affinity for the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation system and that it is oxidized at the fastest rate of the long chain fatty acids studied. Implications of this findings for previously observed differences in fatty acid metabolism in vivo, explainable by increased linoleic acid oxidation, are considered."

https://openalex.org/W1596994957,"Studies of the nature of the inhibitory action of inorganic phosphate, fluoride, and some detergents on 5′-adenylic acid deaminase activities of rat brain and liver show that inorganic phosphate, as well as ATP, is an effector of the deaminase. Inorganic phosphate was found to be a competitive inhibitor in the absence of ATP, but in the presence of ATP, the nature of the inhibition was uncompetitive. ATP strongly prevented the inhibition by inorganic phosphate. It appears that inorganic phosphate competes with the substrate, AMP, and with the activator, ATP, simultaneously at the active site and the effector site, respectively. Fluoride inhibited the deaminase noncompetitively in the absence of ATP, and uncompetitive effect was obtained in the presence of ATP. It is likely that fluoride competes with ATP in binding to the effector binding site, and in the absence of ATP fluoride occupies the effector binding site to modify the activity. Deoxycholate and lauryl sulfate acted as activators or inhibitors, depending upon the enzyme concentrations and the inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition was also dependent upon the substrate concentrations and therefore showed a mixed type in nature. ATP could prevent the inhibitory effect, but higher deoxycholate concentrations reduced or diminished the ATP-activated activity. It appears that deoxycholate or lauryl sulfate can affect the ATP-binding site in modifying the ATP-activation as well as the deamination. The physiological significance of the relationship between inorganic phosphate and ATP in regard to AMP metabolism and consequently to intermediary metabolism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019553253,"Chemical modification of a vertebrate activity rhythm, the circadian (approximately 24-hour) rhythm of Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis, has been demonstrated. Activity in a running wheel was used to measure the rhythms of mice kept individually in conditions of continuous darkness. Deuterium oxide was presented in the drinking water. The length of the periods of rhythm increased directly and linearly with the increase in concentration of deuterium oxide. There is no threshold for this effect, and the maximum concentration of deuterium oxide (30 percent) that was presented resulted in a 6 percent lengthening of the period of circadian rhythm. The mice reverted to rhythms similar in period length to control values after deuterium oxide was withdrawn from their drinking water."
https://openalex.org/W1965489528,Exposure to primaquine for 48 hours caused lesions in the exoerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium fallax grown in cultivated cells derived from embryonic turkey brain. The lesions appeared in the form of cytoplasmic vacuoles when viewed under the light microscope. The electron microscope revealed these vacuoles as swollen mitochondria readily identifiable by their typical protozoan cristae. Mitochondria of the host cell were unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W2002850486,"Most of the yolk protein in the mature egg of Leucophaea maderae consists of one large component, whereas a second smaller protein is present during the early stages of vitellogenesis. The large protein can be converted to the smaller one and to even smaller units by mild alkaline conditions in vitro. After injection of uniformly labeled leucine-C(14) into females with developing eggs, the smaller yolk protein becomes labeled first, the label is then transferred to the large protein upon prolonged exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2068479595,"""Nitrosoguanidine"" (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) acts on polynucleotides in neutral aqueous solution, methylating guanine in the 7-position, and, to a much lesser extent, adenine. In 67 percent dimethylformamide the effect on the purines decreased, and what seems to be 3-methyl-cytosine appeared. In formamide solution no base changes were detected. Nitrosoguanidine had little mutagenic effect on tobacco mosaic virus RNA in water; it had greater effect in dimethylformamide, and even greater in formamide; it was a strong mutagen only when it acted on intact tobacco mosaic virus particles. Thus, neither the methylation of guanine nor the cytosine modification represents the main mutagenic event."
https://openalex.org/W1966032894,"SEVERAL workers have reported the occurrence of newberyite, MgHPO4.3H2O, in the human urinary calculi, and we found it in 17 per cent of the stones studied in this laboratory1. Newberyite, however, is not mentioned by other workers who have also made extensive studies of the composition of calculi1. The stones in which we found newberyite were, apart from those in an allegedly modern Indonesian collection, all old, the Norwich ones dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Data recently received on the Indonesian collection show that the stones were obtained from patients about twenty years ago and are therefore old enough for certain constituents to have undergone chemical change."
https://openalex.org/W1983534476,"Electrical recordings from single muscle cells in the fast portion of the scallop adductor have revealed a multiterminal distribution of motor nerves. All motor junctions appear to be of the fast designation, and several nerve fibers supply each muscle cell. The muscle fibers, by virtue of common innervation, are grouped into functional motor units. The pattern of innervation in scallops thus shares functional similarities with the motor distribution to skeletal muscle fibers of both vertebrates and arthropods."

Dispersed cells obtained from the ovotestes reaggregate rapidly into histotypically organized tissue. The role of cellular adhesiveness is facilitated by centrifugation, but pseudopodial activity of the cells is suggested as another factor in reaggregation."
