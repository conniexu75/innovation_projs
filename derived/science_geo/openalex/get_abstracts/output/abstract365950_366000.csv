https://openalex.org/W2115313813,"Classically, adult humans have been considered not to possess active brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, positron-emission-tomography has shown fluorodeoxyglucose uptake that is distributed in such a way (e.g., in the neck) that it would seem to be BAT. Until now this has not been supported by direct evidence that these areas truly represented BAT, that is, the presence of the BAT-unique uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). Samples of adipose tissue from the neck of 35 patients undergoing surgery for thyroid diseases were obtained and analyzed. In 1/3 of the subjects (the younger and leaner), distinct islands composed of UCP1 immunoreactive brown adipocytes could clearly be discerned, accounting for up to 1/3 of all adipocytes. The brown-adipose islands were richlysympathetically innervated (indicating acute central control); adjacent white adipose areas were not. The capillary density was high, implying a high capacity for oxygen delivery. Cells with features of brown adipocyte precursors were found in pericapillary areas. These data demonstrate that human adults indeed possess BAT and thus imply possibilities of future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity, including maintenance of brown adipocytes and stimulation of the growth of preexisting brown precursors.—Zingaretti, M. C., Crosta, F., Vitali, A., Guerrieri, M., Frontini, A., Cannon, B., Nedergaard, J., Cinti, S. The presence of UCP1 demonstrates that metabolically active adipose tissue in the neck of adult humans truly represents brown adipose tissue. FASEB J. 23, 3113–3120 (2009). www.fasebj.org"

Activation of the inflammasome causes the processing and release of the cytokines interleukins 1β and 18. In primary macrophages, potassium ion flux and the membrane channel pannexin 1 have been suggested to play roles in inflammasome activation. However, the molecular mechanism(s) governing inflammasome signaling remains poorly defined, and it is undetermined whether these mechanisms apply to the central nervous system. Here we show that high extracellular potassium opens pannexin channels leading to caspase-1 activation in primary neurons and astrocytes. The effect of K+ on pannexin 1 channels was independent of membrane potential, suggesting that stimulation of inflammasome signaling was mediated by an allosteric effect. The activation of the inflammasome by K+ was inhibited by the pannexin 1 channel blocker probenecid, supporting a role of pannexin 1 in inflammasome activation. Co-immunoprecipitation of neuronal lysates indicates that pannexin 1 associates with components of the multiprotein inflammasome complex, including the P2X7 receptor and caspase-1. Moreover antibody neutralization of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) blocked ATP-induced cell death in oocytes co-expressing P2X7 receptor and pannexin 1. Thus, in contrast to macrophages and monocytes in which low intracellular K+ has been suggested to trigger inflammasome activation, in neural cells, high extracellular K+ activates caspase-1 probably through pannexin 1.

Pannexin 1 is a vertebrate ortholog of the invertebrate innexin gap junction proteins (1.Panchin Y. Kelmanson I. Matz M. Lukyanov K. Usman N. Lukyanov S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R473-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), but it does not appear to form functional gap junctions in vivo. Instead pannexin 1 acts as a membrane channel that carries ions and signaling molecules between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space (2.Dahl G. Locovei S. IUBMB Life. 2006; 58: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3.Huang Y. Grinspan J.B. Abrams C.K. Scherer S.S. Glia. 2007; 55: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As such, it is a candidate ATP release channel in various cell types, including erythrocytes, astrocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and taste cells. Various functional roles have been ascribed to pannexin 1 including local vascular perfusion control and propagation of intercellular calcium waves (4.Locovei S. Bao L. Dahl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7655-7659Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 5.Iglesias R. Locovei S. Roque A. Alberto A.P. Dahl G. Spray D.C. Scemes E. Am. J. Physiol.

Neuron Glia Biol. 2007; 3: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently pannexin 1 was also shown to form the large pore of the P2X7 purinergic receptor (7.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A.

P2X7 plays a major role in inflammation, and its activation by extracellular ATP results in release of interleukin (IL) 2The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinNLRNOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-like receptorASCapoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a CARD (caspase recruitment domain)CNScentral nervous systemXIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineshshort hairpin. -1β from macrophages, probably involving pannexin 1 as a signaling molecule (7.Pelegrin P.

IL-1β production and maturation are tightly regulated by caspase-1 incorporated into large protein complexes termed inflammasomes (9.Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 126: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The molecular composition of the inflammasome depends on the identity of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member serving as a scaffold protein in the complex (12.Ting J.P. Willingham S.B. Bergstralh D.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The members of the cytosolic NLR family appear to recognize conserved microbial and viral components termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns in intracellular compartments (13.Carneiro L.A. Magalhaes J.G. Tattoli I. Philpott D.J. Travassos L.H. J. Pathol. 2008; 214: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The bipartite adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) bridges the interaction between NLR proteins and inflammatory caspases and plays a central role in the assembly of inflammasomes and the activation of caspase-1 in response to a broad range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and intracellular pathogens (14.Taniguchi S. Sagara J. Semin. Immunopathol. 2007; 29: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, the inflammasome can be activated by danger-associated molecular patterns, molecules endogenous to the organism that signal stress or injury, including extracellular ATP acting at ionotropic P2X7 receptors, fibronectin, or monosodium urate crystals (15.Matzinger P. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 961: 341-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16.Matzinger P. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Moreover it has been suggested that a rapid K+ efflux through ATP-activated P2X7 receptors induces inflammasome assembly (17.Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S.

Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Despite the recent advances in the understanding of accessory proteins required for full activation of caspase-1, little is known about the signaling pathways that trigger inflammasome activation, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). Recently we reported that spinal cord neurons contain the NLRP1/NALP1 inflammasome consisting of NLRP1, ASC, caspase-1, caspase-11, and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and that spinal cord injury induces rapid activation of the inflammasome, causing processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. Moreover antibody neutralization of ASC reduces caspase-1 activation and IL-1 cytokine processing, leading to significant tissue sparing and functional improvement (21.de Rivero Vaccari J.P. Lotocki G. Marcillo A.E. Dietrich W.D. Keane R.W. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on signaling events coupling pannexin 1 and P2X7 receptors to rapid caspase-1 activation in primary neurons and astrocytes. We provide compelling evidence that high extracellular K+ opens the pannexin 1 channel and activates inflammasomes in neurons and astrocytes, but not THP-1 cells, thus leading to caspase-1 activation. This signaling pathway in neurons is mediated through protein interactions between pannexin 1 and inflammasome proteins. We also provide evidence that ATP acting on P2X7 induces rapid cell death and that antibody neutralization of ASC blocks ATP-induced cell death. Thus, contrary to the widely accepted view in macrophages and monocytes that low intracellular K+ triggers inflammasome activation, high extracellular K+ surrounding cells such as neurons and astrocytes opens pannexin 1 channels and induces processing of caspase-1. Rabbit anti-Rattus norvegicus ASC and NLRP1 antisera were prepared by Bethyl Laboratories as described previously (21.de Rivero Vaccari J.P. Lotocki G. Marcillo A.E. Dietrich W.D. Keane R.W. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Chicken anti-pannexin 1 (4515) has been characterized (4.Locovei S. Bao L. Dahl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7655-7659Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and antibody affinity-purified on a matrix with the cognate peptide (prepared by Aves Labs Inc.) was used. Other antibodies were purchased from commercial sources and included anti-NLRP1 (Abcam), anti-IL-1β (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-caspase-1 (Upstate); anti-caspase-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-caspase-11 (Alexis Biochemicals), anti-caspase-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-XIAP (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-P2X7 receptor (Calbiochem). Neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16–17 rat cortices as described previously (22.Tedeschi B. Barrett J.N. Keane R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23.Keane R.W. Tallent M.W. Podack E.R. Transplantation. 1992; 54: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cortical tissue was disrupted into a cell suspension by gentle trituration and seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. Neurons were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture dishes in N5 medium that contained 5% serum fraction (24.Kawamoto J.C. Barrett J.N. Brain Res. 1986; 384: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Neurons were maintained for 12 days, and the neuronal nature of the majority of cells (95%) was confirmed electrophysiologically and immunohistochemically (22.Tedeschi B. Barrett J.N. Keane R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes were obtained from neonatal rat cerebral cortices as described previously (22.Tedeschi B. Barrett J.N. Keane R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained for 3 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. At least 99% of the cell populations were astrocytes as determined by staining with cell-specific markers (22.Tedeschi B. Barrett J.N. Keane R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The human monocytic cell line THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.05 mm 2-mecaptoethanol and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were pretreated with 1 mm probenecid (Alfa Aesar) for 10 min. The medium was removed and replaced with medium containing probenecid and 130 mm KCl for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, whereas controls received probenecid alone. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and lysed as described previously (25.Keane R.W. Srinivasan A. Foster L.M. Testa M.P. Ord T. Nonner D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bredesen D.E. Kayalar C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and prepared for immunoblot analysis. Pannexin 1 was knocked down using short hairpin (sh)RNA inserted into a retroviral silencing plasmid (pRS) purchased from Origene. One microgram of Panx1 shRNA expression plasmids containing puromycin resistance was transfected into the human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells plated in 35-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After overnight incubation, transfection reagents were removed, and cells were transferred to 100-mm dishes containing selection medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml puromycin). After 2–3 weeks in selection medium, clones were tested for appropriate Panx1 knockdown (18.Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) using Western blot analysis. The selected Panx1-KD 1321N1 cells were maintained in selection medium in a humidified chamber (100% humidity, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). Primary cell cultures were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoblot analysis of oocytes, each lane contained extracts of three oocytes that were pooled and lysed in 50 μl of oocyte Ringer's solution (OR2) by repeated passage through the end of a 1-ml disposable pipette tip. Cells were spun at 12,000 × g for 3 min, and samples were taken from the supernatant, avoiding both the pellet and the lipids on the surface. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and proteins were resolved on 10–20% Tris-HCl Criterion precast gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), placed in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.4% I-Block (Applied Biosystems)), and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies followed by appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Visualization of signal was enhanced by chemiluminescence using a Phototope-HRP detection kit (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). To control for protein loading, immunoblots were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (26.Doucet J.P. Pierce G.N. Hertzberg E.L. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16503-16508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and blotted for β-tubulin using monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:5000, BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Quantification of band density was performed using UN-SCAN-IT gelTM digitizing software (Silk Scientific, Inc.), and data were normalized to β-tubulin. To assess the protein composition and association of proteins in the inflammasome, primary neuronal cultures (2 × 106 cells) were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Approximately 200 μg of neuronal lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ASC or anti-pannexin 1 antibodies using TrueBlotTM anti-rabbit Ig or PrecipHen (Aves Labs Inc.) immunoprecipitation beads. Neuronal lysates were precleared by adding 50 μl of anti-rabbit TrueBlot beads to 200 μg of lysate in a microcentrifuge tube. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was recovered and immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-ASC or anti-pannexin 1 and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Fifty microliters of anti-rabbit TrueBlot beads or anti-chicken PrecipHen beads were added to the mixture, incubated for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The pelleted beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, resuspended in loading buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 3 min before analysis by immunoblotting using antibodies against ASC, NLRP1, capase-11 and caspase-1, caspase-3, XIAP, and pannexin 1. Oocytes were prepared as described previously (27.Dahl G. Stevenson B. Gallin W. Paul D. Cell-cell Interactions. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 143-165Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated by incubating small pieces of ovary in 2 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington) in Ca2+-free OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 5.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) and stirring at one turn/s for 3 h at room temperature. After thorough washing with regular OR2, oocytes devoid of follicle cells and having a uniform pigmentation were selected and stored in OR2 at 18 °C. RNA for mouse pannexin 1 was prepared using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Oocytes were injected with 20–40 nl of cRNA (1 μg/μl) and incubated for 18–48 h at 18 °C. RNA for human pannexin 1 and P2X7 was similarly prepared and injected. Oocytes were then incubated for 7–8 days prior to electrophysiological analysis at room temperature. Oocytes were tested using two-electrode voltage clamp (Model OC725C, Warner Instruments) under constant perfusion according to the protocols described in the figures. Oocytes expressing both human pannexin 1 and P2X7 receptor were tested 7–8 days after injection of RNA. Cells were clamped at −40 mV, and 5-s test pulses to −35 mV were applied. After base-line readings were taken in OR2, cells were exposed to 500 μm ATP for 4 min and then returned to OR2. After it was established that the ATP reliably resulted in cell death, remaining co-expressing cells were then injected with 60 nl of anti-ASC (diluted 1:10 in PBS) or 60 nl of control IgG (diluted 1:10 in PBS). After 1 h, the reinjected cells were exposed to 500 μm ATP and tested as before. Parental and Panx1-KD 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells were exposed for 30 min to control solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and to a depolarizing solution (60 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 10 μm YoPro1. After treatment, cells were washed with control solution and then fixed with p-formaldehyde, and cover slips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. YoPro fluorescence intensity was measured from the whole field of view of high K+ (50 mm)-treated cells and normalized to that obtained under control (5 mm K+) conditions. Images were acquired using MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.) and a digital camera (Photometrics HQ2) attached to a Nikon inverted TE-2000E microscope equipped with a 10× objective and fluorescein isothiocyanate and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter sets. Pannexin 1 is a channel that releases ATP and other ions from the cell. Accordingly an increase of extracellular K+ concentration causes ATP release from Xenopus oocytes expressing pannexin 1 (2.Dahl G. Locovei S. IUBMB Life. 2006; 58: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28.Bao L. Locovei S. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 29.Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, electrophysiological data suggest that pannexin 1 opens only when depolarized to positive membrane potentials. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we applied 130 mm K+ to pannexin 1 channels in voltage-clamped oocytes held at potentials at which the channel is normally closed. When high extracellular K+ was applied, currents in response to a 10-mV test pulse from a holding potential of −50 mV increased in a reproducible and reversible fashion (Fig. 1a and supplementalFig. 1A). The K+-induced current was attenuated by carbenoxolone (Fig. 1a) and by probenecid (supplementalFig. 2). In contrast, application of extracellular K+ to noninjected oocytes increased conductance only moderately (Fig. 1b). To quantify this increase, we measured the conductance of oocytes to this test pulse and found that 130 mm K+ increased conductance substantially in pannexin 1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 1c). Application of 130 mm K+ also increased the holding current needed to maintain cells at −50 mV compared with noninjected oocytes (Fig. 1d). The effect of K+ was dose-dependent. The lowest potassium concentration required for detectable activation of pannexin 1 currents was 20 mm (supplementalFig. 1B). Replacement of Na+ with choline+ did not activate pannexin (not shown), indicating that the observed effects are due to K+ and not the removal of Na+. Potassium chloride was as effective as potassium gluconate to activate pannexin 1 channels (not shown).FIGURE 2Voltage dependence of activation of pannexin 1 channels by high extracellular K+. A, currents from oocytes held in OR2 or perfused with 140 mm potassium gluconate (KGlu). Cells were held at −100 mV and subjected to a voltage ramp lasting 1 min from −100 mV to + 100 mV as indicated below the current traces. In OR2, cells expressing mPanx1 showed much larger current than noninjected cells, and addition of carbenoxolone (CBX) (100 μm) reduced mPanx1 currents to noninjected levels. Carbenoxolone had no effect on noninjected cells. Addition of potassium gluconate to mPanx1-expressing cells resulted in inward currents at −100 mV and increased outward currents at positive potentials. Carbenoxolone dramatically reduced both the inward and outward currents. B, quantification of currents recorded at −100, −50, 0, and +50 mV. Data are mean ± S.E.; n = 4–5. Where not visible, error bars are smaller than symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activation of pannexin 1 currents by high extracellular K+ was observed over a wide range of voltages (Fig. 2) with depolarization facilitating the process. Only at high positive potentials was the effect of high K+ minimal, probably because of exhaustion of recruitable channels. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that high extracellular K+ opens pannexin 1 channels at resting potentials at which the channel is normally closed. To test whether K+ also stimulates pannexin 1-mediated dye uptake, we used the astrocytoma cell line 1321N1. Thirty-minute exposure of 1321N1 cells to a depolarizing solution (50 mm K+) caused a significant influx of YoPro1 into cells compared with those bathed in normal (5 mm K+) solution (control, 0.99 ± 0.012-fold; high K+, 1.24 ± 0.031-fold; n = 6 fields from three experiments) (Fig. 3). High K+-induced dye uptake was significantly attenuated (0.99 ± 0.017-fold, n = 6 fields from three experiments) when Panx1 was knocked down with Panx1 shRNA (Fig. 3). Distinguishing the functions of pannexin 1 channels from connexin channels has been hampered by the lack of specific inhibitors able to discriminate between them. Despite the lack of any sequence homology between pannexins and connexins, known inhibitors of connexins also inhibit pannexin channels. Carbenoxolone demonstrates some specificity as its dose dependence for inhibition of pannexin and connexins differs by a factor of ∼3 (30.Bruzzone R. Barbe M.T. Jakob N.J. Monyer H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We have reported that a more specific inhibitor of pannexin 1 is probenecid, a common drug used to treat gout and gouty arthritis (29.Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Application of probenecid rapidly inhibited voltage-induced pannexin 1 currents in oocytes as did carbenoxolone (Fig. 4). We also found that probenecid significantly reduced the currents in response to application of 130 mm extracellular K+ (supplementalFig. 2), providing additional evidence that pannexin 1 is responsible for the currents in response to the extracellular K+ application. Neurons in culture express the NLRP1 inflammasome (21.de Rivero Vaccari J.P. Lotocki G. Marcillo A.E. Dietrich W.D. Keane R.W. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To test whether high extracellular K+ activates inflammasomes and caspase-1, we treated rat cortical neurons and astrocytes and human THP-1 cells grown in culture with 130 mm KCl for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h and assayed protein lysates for caspase-1 activation. As shown in Fig. 5, neurons and astrocytes exposed to high extracellular K+ showed an increase in caspase-1 activation when compared with untreated controls. As shown by others (20.Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), human THP-1 cells were refractory to high extracellular K+ exposure and therefore served as control. Pretreatment with the pannexin channel blocker probenecid (1 mm) prior to high K+ treatment suppressed caspase-1 induction in neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 5). Thus, inflammasome activation and caspase-1 processing induced by high extracellular K+ are inhibited by blocking the pannexin 1 channel, suggesting a role for pannexin 1 in the activation of the inflammasome in neurons and astrocytes but not THP-1 cells. Stimulation of the inflammasome in neurons and astrocytes also led to the release of IL-1β (supplementalFig. 3). Curiously the supernatant contained more of the unprocessed than the mature form of IL-1β. The rapid increase in caspase-1 expression after stimulation is in agreement with observations made in CNS injury models (21.de Rivero Vaccari J.P. Lotocki G. Marcillo A.E. Dietrich W.D. Keane R.W. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31.Pineau I. Lacroix S. J. Comp.

Blood Flow Metab. 2009; 29: 534-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A similar rapid increase of caspase-1 is also observed in macrophages exposed to Gram-negative bacteria or other agents like pathogen-associated molecular patterns (9.Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar, 33.Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). For an alternate test for a role of pannexin 1 in the activation of the inflammasome by K+ we used the 1321N1 cell line. The parental cell line exhibited an activation pattern of caspase-1 similar to that of primary astrocytes and neurons in response to stimulation with high K+. In contrast, caspase-1 in the pannexin 1 knockdown line was barely detectable and did not show increased activation (Fig. 6). The reduced expression of caspase-1 could be due to either transcriptional/translational effects or stability of the various components of the inflammasome multiprotein complex. It is conceivable that unassembled caspase-1 is degraded faster than the complexed protein. To characterize associations of inflammasome proteins in cortical neurons in culture, co-immunoprecipitations of neuronal lysates exposed to 130 mm KCl for 1 h were performed using anti-pannexin 1 antibody (Fig. 7, left). Anti-pannexin 1 immunoprecipitated NLRP1, ASC, caspase-1 and -11, XIAP, pannexin 1, and the P2X7 receptor. Caspase-1 was processed into its fragments (p26 and p13), and full-length XIAP was cleaved into a 30-kDa fragment. Thus, exposure to high extracellular K+ activates inflammasomes. Anti-pannexin 1 did not immunoprecipitate caspase-3, serving as a control. Caspase-3, however, was expressed in neurons as indicated by its presence in the lysate (supplementalFig. 4). Like caspase-1, caspase-3 levels increased with exposure to extracellular K+. In reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-ASC immunoprecipitated NLRP1, ASC and caspase-1 and -11 as well as XIAP, pannexin 1, and the purinergic receptor P2X7 (Fig. 7, right). These findings demonstrate that the NLRP1 inflammasome in neurons associates with pannexin 1 and the P2X7 receptor. The co-immunoprecipitation pattern was similar in unstimulated and stimulated neurons, suggesting that the inflammasome complex is preassembled. This observation is consistent with findings that the NLRP1 inflammasome is preassembled in motor neurons of the spinal cord (21.de Rivero Vaccari J.P. Lotocki G. Mar"
https://openalex.org/W2105171996,"Selenium is linked to male fertility. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), first described as an antioxidant enzyme, is the predominant selenoenzyme in testis and has been suspected of being vital for spermatogenesis. Cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear isoforms are all encoded by the same gene. While disruption of entire GPx4 causes early embryonic lethality in mice, inactivation of nuclear GPx4 does not impair embryonic development or fertility. Here, we show that deletion of mitochondrial GPx4 (mGPx4) allows both normal embryogenesis and postnatal development, but causes male infertility. Infertility was associated with impaired sperm quality and severe structural abnormalities in the midpiece of spermatozoa. Knockout sperm display higher protein thiol content and recapitulate features typical of severe selenodeficiency. Interestingly, male infertility induced by mGPx4 depletion could be bypassed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. We also show for the first time that mGPx4 is the prevailing GPx4 product in male germ cells and that mGPx4 disruption has no effect on proliferation or apoptosis of germinal or somatic tissue. Our study finally establishes that mitochondrial GPx4 confers the vital role of selenium in mammalian male fertility and identifies cytosolic GPx4 as the only GPx4 isoform being essential for embryonic development and apoptosis regulation.—Schneider, M., Forster, H., Boersma, A., Seiler, A., Wehnes, H., Sinowatz, F., Neumüller, C., Deutsch, M.

https://openalex.org/W2051936739,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cell fate determination and homeostasis. Expression of these small RNA genes is tightly regulated during development and in normal tissues, but they are often misregulated in cancer. MiRNA expression is also affected by DNA damaging agents, such as radiation. In particular, mammalian miR-34 is upregulated by p53 in response to radiation, but little is known about the role of this miRNA in vivo. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans with loss-of-function mutations in the mir-34 gene have an abnormal cellular survival response to radiation; these animals are highly radiosensitive in the soma and radioresistant in the germline. These findings show a role for mir-34 in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death in vivo, much like that of cep-1, the C. elegans p53 homolog. These results have been additionally validated in vitro in breast cancer cells, wherein exogenous addition of miR-34 alters cell survival post-radiation. These observations confirm that mir-34 is required for a normal cellular response to DNA damage in vivo resulting in altered cellular survival post-irradiation, and point to a potential therapeutic use for anti-miR-34 as a radiosensitizing agent in p53-mutant breast cancer."

Recent studies suggest that deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression promotes invasion and metastasis of cancer cells; we therefore explored the possibility that HER2/neu signaling induces the expression of specific miRNAs involved in this process. We identified a putative oncogenic miRNA, miR-21, whose expression is correlated with HER2/neu up-regulation and is functionally involved in HER2/neu-induced cell invasion. We show that miR-21 is up-regulated via the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway upon stimulation of HER2/neu signaling in breast cancer cells, and overexpression of other ERK1/2 activators such as RASV12 or ID-1 is sufficient to induce miR-21 up-regulation in HER2/neu-negative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the metastasis suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmedcell death 4) is down-regulated by miR-21 in breast cancer cells expressing HER2/neu.

The HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane protein-tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, p185HER2, which is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family. HER2/neu overexpression is found in about 30% of human breast cancers and several other cancer types. HER2/neu overexpression is associated with a poor clinical outcome, including a positive correlation with metastasis (1.Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J.

Up-regulation of several miRNAs in breast cancer cells, such as miR-21 and miR-10b, can increase cell invasion and metastasis (9.Zhu S. Wu H. Wu F. Nie D. Sheng S. Mo Y.Y.

Here we describe a putative oncogenic miRNA, miR-21, whose expression is correlated with HER2/neu up-regulation. We found that HER2/neu signaling up-regulates miR-21 via the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway and that its increased expression promotes cell invasion. Furthermore, miR-21 suppressed expression of the metastasis suppressor PDCD4 in HER2/neu-expressing breast cancer cells. Our data show a new mechanism by which HER2/neu induces cell invasion via miR-21 deregulation in breast cancer cells. This raises the possibility that anti-miR-21 therapies might exhibit a synergistic effect with other anti-HER2/neu therapeutics, for example Herceptin, in treating HER2/neu-associated breast cancers. Human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 (ATCC) was cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. BT-474 (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The oligonucleotides with either two complementary miR-21-binding sites (5′-GTACATCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTACCCGGGTCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTAG-3′) or miR-155-binding sites (5′-GTACACCCCTATCACGATTAGCATTAACCCGGGCCCCTATCACGATTAGCATTAAG-3′) were cloned downstream the mCherry gene using the BsrGI and EcoRI sites to produce the mCherry miR-21 sensor vector and the mCherry miR-155 sensor vector, respectively. To construct the miR-21 expression vector, 550 bp including the miR-21 pri-cursor was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA with the forward primer 5′-AGTTTTCTTGCCGTTCTGTAAGT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GTCATGAAGACTATCCCCATTTC-3′. The final PCR product was ligated into a PCR2.1 TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting vector was sequence verified and subsequently digested with BamHI and XhoI to release the DNA fragment, which was inserted into a modified pSicoR vector downstream from the GFP gene. 1,544 modified oligonucleotides with C6 5′ amino linkers (IDT) were printed in triplicate using a microarrayer on house-made poly-l-lysine slides (17.DeRisi J.L.

Probe sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. Before hybridization, the arrays were prehybridized, and probes were UV cross-linked. miRNA microarrays were performed essentially as described (20.Thomson J.M. Parker J. Perou C.M. Hammond S.M. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5 μg of total RNA was added to a ligation reaction containing either 250 ng of 5′-phospate-citidyl-uridyl-Cy3-3′ or 1 μg of 5′- phosphate-citidyl-citidyl-uridyl-Dy647-3′ (Dharmacon), and labeling was allowed to proceed overnight on ice. Two samples labeled with different dyes were then combined and precipitated with ethanol. Precipitated RNA was resuspended in 120 μl of hybridization buffer and hybridized for 2 h on arrays using a 1.7 × 2.8-cm Gene Frame (ABgene, Rochester, NY). The arrays were washed and then immediately scanned using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were extracted, and local background was subtracted using Genepix Pro-4 software (Axon Instruments). The data were processed in Excel to calculate the median intensity for each set of triplicate probes in each channel. The displayed data (see Fig. 1B) summarizes the results from three arrays in which labeling of each sample was done with a different fluorophore on each array, known as dye swapping, to eliminate dye bias. The mean fluorescence for each probe from the two arrays was normalized to the maximum mean fluorescence for each sample. Only the 330 probes on the array corresponding to annotated human miRNAs are shown. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human HER2/neu antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA).

For real time PCR of primary miR-21 transcripts (pri-miR-21) and Ets-1, total RNA was prepared using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and quantified by Nanodrop (Wilmington, DE). Reverse transcription was performed with a Superscript III first strand synthesis system for real time PCR (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using 7900HT Fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The pri-miR-21 was amplified using the forward primer 5′-CATTGTGGGTTTTGAAAAGGTTA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCACGACTAGAGGCTGACTTAGA-3′, and the specificity of the pri-miR-21 amplification was validated previously (22.Löffler D.

The PCR was established with the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and only one PCR product was generated in these reactions. PCR-based detection of mature miR-21 and other microRNAs was performed by the TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (24.Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4083) Google Scholar). The PCR results were normalized with U6 RNA as an internal control and then expressed as relative expression compared with untreated samples. For detection of HER2/neu expression, the cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-ErbB2 antibody (Abcam) at 4 °C for 30 min and analyzed with a LSRII flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For detection of mCherry expression, the cells were directly analyzed with the LSRII flow cytometer. For detection of miR-21 by Northern blotting, RNA was extracted by using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoretically separated on a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Subsequently RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by using a semi-dry Transblot electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by using UV radiation. Hybridization was carried out by using ULTRAHybOligo solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). The probe sequence was complementary to the mature form of miR-21 and was labeled with γ-32P. After washing, the membranes were imaged using phosphorimaging. Western blot analysis of PDCD4 expression was performed as previously described (25.Zhu S. Si M.L. Wu H. Mo Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14328-14336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In brief, the protein concentration was determined by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and the samples were separated in 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After probing with a primary antibody, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies labeled with IRDye 800CW. Finally; signal intensity was determined with the Odyssey infrared imaging system and associated software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Relative expression of PDCD4 was normalized against the internal control β-actin. Transfection of MDA-MB-435 and BT-474 cells with anti-miR-21 or a control inhibitor (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) was performed using the DharmaFECT small interfering RNA transfection reagents (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection of HeLa cells and BT-474 cells with DNA plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Lentiviruses were generated essentially as previously described (16.Ventura A. Meissner A. Dillon C.P. McManus M. Sharp P.A. Van Parijs L. Jaenisch R. Jacks T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10380-10385Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μg of lentiviral vector and 4 μg of a mixture of packaging vectors were cotransfected in 293T cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The supernatants were collected 48–96 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and used directly to infect cancer cells. The invasive potential of cells was measured in 24-well Matrigel-coated invasion chambers following the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After the cells were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, the noninvading cells that remained on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by scraping. Invading cells were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and counted in three randomly selected fields in the center of each membrane under fluorescence microscopy at medium power fields (100× or 200×). To detect the effect of HER2/neu on the direct miR-21 target PDCD4 expression at the cellular level, both MDA-MB-435/HER2 MDA-MB-435/Neo cells were directly immunostained with anti-PDCD4 antibody. Alternatively, MDA-MB-435/HER2 cells were transfected with anti-miR-21, or MDA-MB-435/Neo cells were transfected with miR-21 expression vector, followed by immunostaining with anti-PDCD4 antibody. The transfected cells were seeded on cover slides 24 h after transfection and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde as described previously (26.Wu F. Chiocca S. Beck W.T. Mo Y.Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After incubation with primary PDCD4 antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), second antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 560 nm (Invitrogen) was used to reveal PDCD4 signals. The images were taken under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Overexpression of HER2/neu enhances local tumor invasion and lung metastasis of breast cancer cells (4.Guy C.T.

We therefore explored the possibility that HER2/neu signaling induces the expression of miR-21 and/or other microRNAs, which could in turn contribute to the increased metastatic potential of these cancer cells. We first examined whether miR-21 level is up-regulated in the HER2/neu-transfected MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cell line, because overexpression of HER2/neu significantly enhances invasion and metastasis in this cell line without altering its cell growth rates, anchorage-independent growth, and other indices of tumorigenic potential (3.Tan M. Yao J. Yu D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that HER2/neu expression was sufficient to up-regulate mature miR-21 levels 2.9 ± 0.3-fold in MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 1A). To verify that HER2/neu is sufficient to induce miR-21 up-regulation in other cancer cells and identify other HER2/neu-dependent microRNAs, we assessed the changes in miRNA expression in the HeLa/HER2 cells compared with vector control cells by using miRNA microarrays. We chose HeLa cells because of the fact that some cervical carcinoma tumors overexpress HER2/neu (27.Chavez-Blanco A. Perez-Sanchez V. Gonzalez-Fierro A. Vela-Chavez T. Candelaria M. Cetina L. Vidal S. Dueñas-Gonzalez A. BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the transfection of HER2/neu expression vector is more feasible and efficient in this cell line. A HeLa cell line was generated that stably expresses HER2/neu (Fig. 1B), and surprisingly, only a single signature from the array was significantly elevated in the HeLa/HER2 cells: the highly conserved miR-21 miRNA (Fig. 1C). This observation was validated using qRT-PCR, which showed that mature miR-21 expression in HeLa/HER2 cells was increased 2.5 ± 0.5-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 1D). Northern blot analysis further confirmed these analyses, showing a moderate but significant up-regulation of miR-21 expression (Fig. 1E). Our results demonstrate that HER2/neu overexpression up-regulated miR-21 significantly in both MDA-MB-435 and HeLa cells. HER2/neu overexpression may stabilize the miR-21 level in breast cancer cells, thus resulting in higher miR-21 level compared with control cells. To examine whether HER2/neu signaling is able to induce de novo miR-21 expression, we followed the kinetics of miR-21 induction by assessing the relative abundance of its primary transcript and mature sequence upon HER2/neu signaling in different cancer cells. A HER2/neu agonist antibody (anti-HER2/neu ScFv-TNF-α (S147Y)) was used to induce HER2/neu signaling in various HER2/neu-expressing cells lines (21.Huang T.H. Morrison S.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Anti-HER2/neu ScFv-TNF-α (S147Y) (HER2/neu agonist) is a ScFv antibody specific for human HER2/neu fused to a mutant TNF-α with abrogated biological activity. This HER2/neu agonist has previously been shown to form a homotrimeric structure via the noncovalent binding of the mutant TNF-α and is therefore able to cross-link multiple HER2/neu receptors, thereby potently stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2/neu receptor and the downstream AKT and MAPK signaling (21.Huang T.H. Morrison S.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HER2/neu agonist treatment induced a rapid and substantial pri-miR-21 up-regulation in HeLa/HER2 (Fig. 2A), SKBR3 (Fig. 2B), and BT-474 (Fig. 2C) cells after 4 h, and the level of pri-miR-21 slightly decreased after 8 h of stimulation. In contrast, the kinetics of mature miR-21 processing in these cells is highly distinct. HER2/neu agonist treatment of HeLa/HER2 cells for 10 h caused a 3.4 ± 0.4-fold up-regulation of mature miR-21 expression as compared with untreated HeLa/HER2 cells. In contrast, no significant miR-21 up-regulation was observed in vector control cells treated with the HER2/neu agonist as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast to HeLa/HER2 cells, up-regulation of mature miR-21 was delayed in the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines SKBR3 (Fig. 2B) and BT-474 (Fig. 2C). Mature miR-21 was increased 3.2 ± 0.2- and 2.6 ± 0.2-fold in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells, respectively, stimulated with HER2/neu agonist for 4 days. These results suggest that HER2/neu signaling induces rapid transcription of pri-miR-21; however, processing to mature miR-21 is less efficient in SKBR3 and BT-474 breast cancer cells. Recently it has been shown that the expression of DICER1 is low in several HER2/neu-positive tumors (28.Blenkiron C. Goldstein L.D. Thorne N.P. Spiteri I. Chin S.F. Dunning M.J. Barbosa-Morais N.L. Teschendorff A.E. Green A.R. Ellis I.O. Tavaré S. Caldas C. Miska E.A. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R214Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), which may explain the delay in achieving increased mature miR-21 expression in SKBR3 and BT-474 cells. Given the significant but moderate level of miR-21 up-regulation, we wanted to determine whether a ∼3-fold change in miR-21 expression would mitigate a change in target mRNA expression. To study the potential functional consequence of miR-21 up-regulation in response to HER2/neu signaling, we took advantage of a lentivirus construct encoding a fluorescent reporter gene (mCherry) containing two exact miR-21-binding sites in its 3′-untranslated region (mCherry miR-21 sensor). A similar construct with miR-155-binding sites (mCherry miR-155 sensor) was used as a control vector because miR-155 levels do not change significantly in response to HER2/neu expression (data not shown). SKBR3 cells infected with the mCherry miR-155 sensor exhibited strong reporter expression, indicating that the miR-155 level is very low or undetectable in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D, left panel). Upon treatment with the HER2/neu agonist, the mCherry miR-155 sensor exhibited a slight increase of the reporter signal (Fig. 2D, left panel), probably because of the widespread activation of transcription factors induced by HER2/neu signaling. In contrast, SKBR3 cells infected with the mCherry miR-21 sensor exhibited a moderate reporter signal, indicating that the mCherry mRNA sequence is silenced by endogenous miR-21 expression in these cells (Fig. 2D, right panel). After treatment with HER2/neu agonist, the miR-21 sensor exhibited an even greater repression (50%) of the reporter signal (Fig. 2D, right panel), indicating that the ∼3-fold miR-21 expression level change induced by the HER2/neu signaling is sufficient to repress target gene expression and may therefore have a functional consequence in cancer cells by repressing endogenous target mRNAs. The RAS-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathways are two major signaling cascades downstream of activated HER2/neu. To test which pathway is responsible for the miR-21 up-regulation, we treated HER2/neu-overexpressing cells BT-474 with an inhibitor of ERK1/2 (U0126) or AKT (LY294002) and subsequently stimulated these cells for 4 days with HER2/neu agonist. Vehicle-treated cells up-regulated miR-21 levels by 3.2 ± 0.2-fold after stimulation, whereas the ERK1/2 inhibitor completely blocked miR-21 induction by the HER2/neu agonist (Fig. 3A) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the AKT inhibitor (LY294002) did not reduce HER2/neu-dependent miR-21 up-regulation (Fig. 3A). We also observed that treatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor repressed the miR-21 induction by HER2/neu agonist in SKBR3 cells and HER2/neu transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). Finally, miR-21 level increased 100% in 293T cells transfected with a wild type ERK2 but decreased 30% in 293T cells transfected with a dominant negative ERK2 (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that ERK1/2 is a key mediator for the HER2/neu-dependent miR-21 up-regulation and that this regulatory mechanism is conserved among several different cell types. We next examined which transcription factors activate miR-21 transcription. The miR-21 promoter contains a highly conserved region spanning 300 bp in which two STAT3-binding sites are present, and interleukin-6 treatment can induce miR-21 expression via STAT3 in myeloma cells (22.Löffler D. Brocke-Heidrich K. Pfeifer G. Stocsits C. Hackermller J. Kretzschmar A.K. Burger R. Gramatzki M. Blumert C. Bauer K. Cvijic H. Ullmann A.K. Stadler P.F. Horn F.

https://openalex.org/W1994229067,"The development of chemoresistance represents a major obstacle in the successful treatment of cancers such as neuroblastoma (NB), a particularly aggressive childhood solid tumour. The mechanisms underlying the chemoresistant phenotype in NB were addressed by gene expression profiling of two doxorubicin (DoxR)-resistant vs sensitive parental cell lines. Not surprisingly, the MDR1 gene was included in the identified upregulated genes, although the highest overexpressed transcript in both cell lines was the frizzled-1 Wnt receptor (FZD1) gene, an essential component of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. FZD1 upregulation in resistant variants was shown to mediate sustained activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as revealed by nuclear β-catenin translocation and target genes transactivation. Interestingly, specific micro-adapted short hairpin RNA (shRNAmir)-mediated FZD1 silencing induced parallel strong decrease in the expression of MDR1, another β-catenin target gene, revealing a complex, Wnt/β-catenin-mediated implication of FZD1 in chemoresistance. The significant restoration of drug sensitivity in FZD1-silenced cells confirmed the FZD1-associated chemoresistance. RNA samples from 21 patient tumours (diagnosis and postchemotherapy), showed a highly significant FZD1 and/or MDR1 overexpression after treatment, underlining a role for FZD1-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway in clinical chemoresistance. Our data represent the first implication of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in NB chemoresistance and identify potential new targets to treat aggressive and resistant NB."
https://openalex.org/W2025228190,"To investigate drug mechanisms of action and identify molecular targets for the development of rational drug combinations, we conducted synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based RNAi screens to identify genes whose silencing affects anti-cancer drug responses. Silencing of RRM1 and RRM2, which encode the large and small subunits of the human ribonucleotide reductase complex, respectively, markedly enhanced the cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). Silencing of RRM2 was also found to enhance DNA damage as measured by histone γ-H2AX. Further studies showed that CPT up-regulates both RRM1 and RRM2 mRNA and protein levels and induces the nuclear translocation of RRM2. The checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) was up-regulated and activated in response to CPT, and CHEK1 down-regulation by siRNA and small molecule inhibitors of Chk1 blocked RRM2 induction by CPT. CHEK1 siRNA also suppressed E2F1 up-regulation by CPT, and silencing of E2F1 suppressed the up-regulation of RRM2. Silencing of ATR or ATM and inhibition of ATM activity by KU-55933 blocked Chk1 activation and RRM2 up-regulation. This study links the known components of CPT-induced DNA damage response with proteins required for the synthesis of dNTPs and DNA repair. Specifically, we propose that upon DNA damage, Chk1 activation, mediated by ATM and ATR, up-regulates RRM2 expression through the E2F1 transcription factor. Up-regulation in RRM2 expression levels coupled with its nuclear recruitment suggests an active role for ribonucleotide reductase in the cellular response to CPT-mediated DNA damage that could potentially be exploited as a strategy for enhancing the efficacy of topoisomerase I inhibitors.

Despite the fact that camptothecins are highly targeted agents with Top1 as their sole cellular target, the response of cancer cells to the inhibition of Top1 by camptothecins is highly variable and remains for the most part undefined (2.Pommier Y.

Synthetic siRNA-based RNAi screening is emerging as a powerful approach to revealing the determinants of cellular responses to drugs. Using a synthetic siRNA-based RNAi screen to identify genes whose silencing affects the activity of CPT, we found that RNAi against RRM1 and RRM2, both ribonucleotide reductase genes, markedly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CPT. The ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme complex is essential for the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) precursors for DNA synthesis. RNR catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates and maintains a highly regulated and balanced pool of dNTPs for DNA replication and repair. A failure in the control of dNTP levels leads to cell death or genetic abnormalities (11.Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 12.Herrick J. Sclavi B. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In mammals, RNR is an heterodimeric tetramer composed of two identical large subunits RRM1 and two identical small subunit RRM2 (11.Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Each RRM1 subunit contains an active site (controlling enzyme activity) and an allosteric site (controlling substrate specificity by binding nucleoside triphosphates). Each RRM2 subunits contains a non-heme (binuclear) iron center and a stable tyrosyl free radical. Both are essential for catalysis (11.Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Recently, an additional small subunit has been found, RRM2B (p53R2), which is induced by p53 and can substitute for RRM2 to form a highly active RNR complex involved in DNA repair (for review, see Ref. 11.Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). RNR activity is closely regulated during the cell cycle, peaking in S-phase. In yeast, expression of the large subunit RNR1 fluctuates more than 10-fold during the cell cycle, whereas the small subunit RNR2 mRNA levels show only a 2-fold change. In mammalian cells, RRM2 protein levels begin to rise in late G1 and reach their highest level during S-phase, whereas the levels of RRM1 remain relatively constant throughout the cell cycle. Fluctuations in RRM2 protein levels have been attributed to both transcriptional up-regulation during S-phase and proteasome-mediated degradation as cells enter mitosis (11.Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). DNA damage also regulates RNR activity. In budding yeast RNR up-regulation (14.Lubelsky Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10665-10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15.Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) depends on the protein kinases Mec1 and Rad53. Mec1 initiates Rad53 activation by phosphorylating Rad53, and Rad53 is further activated by autophosphorylation. Activated Rad53 up-regulates RNR by phosphorylating Dun1, another protein kinase (16.Chen S.H. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 986-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activated (phosphorylated) Dun1 up-regulates RNR by at least two routes (see Fig. 7). The first is through phosphorylation of Sml1 (17.Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 18.Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), which dissociates Sml1 from RNR and de-represses the activity of RNR (19.Uchiki T. Dice L.T. Hettich R.L. Dealwis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11293-11303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20.Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The second route by which Dun1 up-regulates RNR is through phosphorylation of Crt1, which dissociates Crt1 from the RNR promoter and de-represses RNR gene transcription (21.Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Thus, in budding yeast, the DNA damage response kinases Mec1-Rad53-Dun1 act as positive regulators of RNR both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In mammalian cells evidence is limited regarding the regulation of RNR by the orthologs of the yeast Mec1 and Rad53, ATM/ATR and Chk1/Chk2, respectively (22.Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23.Naruyama H. Shimada M. Niida H. Zineldeen D.H. Hashimoto Y. Kohri K. Nakanishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 374: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mammalian Crt1 ortholog, Rfx1, has been found to bind to the RNR2 gene and block its transcription (14.Lubelsky Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10665-10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, RNR genes contain E2F binding sites and could be activated at the transcription level by E2F1 overexpression in quiescent cells before the induction of S-phase (13.DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 24.Chabes A.L. Björklund S. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10796-10807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). E2F1 activity is also up-regulated in response to CPT (25.Fusaro G. Wang S. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A recent study also provided evidence for RNR2 regulation by Chk1 for S-phase progression (23.Naruyama H. Shimada M. Niida H. Zineldeen D.H. Hashimoto Y. Kohri K. Nakanishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 374: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells are also deficient in activating p53R2 compared with normal wild type cells (26.Eaton J.S. Lin Z.P. Sartorelli A.C. Bonawitz N.D. Shadel G.S. J. Clin.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8256-8262PubMed Google Scholar). Our present findings indicate that up-regulation of RRM2 transcription in response to DNA damage in human cells involves an ATR/ATM-Chk1-E2F1 pathway, which is reminiscent of the Mec1-Rad53-Dun1 pathway in budding yeast (see Fig. 7). MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI, National Institutes of Health, nci.nih.gov) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All siRNAs were obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Germantown, MD). CPT was obtained from Sigma. UCN-01 was obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program. CHIR124 was a kind gift from Chiron Corp. KU-55933 was a kind gift from KuDOS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). CPT and KU-55933 were prepared at 10 mm in DMSO. UCN-01 and CHIR124 were prepared at 1 mm in DMSO. Drug stock solutions were separated into aliquots at −20 °C. All drugs were diluted to desired concentrations in full medium immediately before each experiment. The final DMSO concentrations did not exceed 0.1%. The CPT chemosensitization RNAi screen was performed using a library of synthetic siRNAs targeting ≈400 genes associated with cancer and using a previously described multiplexed siRNA screening strategy (see Martin et al. (28.Martin S.E. Jones T.L. Thomas C.L. Lorenzi P.L. Nguyen D.A. Runfola T. Gunsior M. Weinstein J.N. Goldsmith P.K. Lader E. Huppi K. Caplen N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for details). Multiplexes comprised six siRNAs corresponding to three unique gene targets (two siRNAs per gene). Multiplexes were evaluated at a final concentration of 60 nm (10 nm of each individual siRNA) in a 96-well-plate format. Only the interior 60 wells were used. Transfections were performed by precomplexing siRNA (6 pmol) with Oligofectamine lipid transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of serum-free RPMI in individual plate wells for 30 min at ambient temperature. MDA-MB-231 cells (4500) were added in 50 μl of RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to yield transfection mixtures consisting of 60 nm total siRNA in RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum. This final mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 45 min before being placed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The library was screened in duplicate (half intended to receive CPT treatment and half to establish siRNA multiplex basal activity). After 48 h the medium was removed, and 100 μl of fresh medium containing either CPT (≈EC50, 0.1% DMSO) or vehicle only (0.1% DMSO) was added, and the cells incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C. After this time, cell viability was assayed (Cell Titer Blue Reagent, Promega, Madison, WI). Plate median values were used for normalization. Multiplexes were assayed in duplicate. For deconvolution studies, the two siRNAs targeting a given gene were evaluated as a pair, each used at 10 nm, and compared with cells transfected with negative control siRNA (siNeg) (20 nm). For RNA analysis, transfections were performed as described for screening, except that 2500 cells were seeded. Unless otherwise stated, after 48 h the medium was removed, 100 μl of fresh medium containing CPT (1 μm, 0.1% DMSO) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24–72 h depending on the end assay. For protein analysis, transfections were performed in 6-well plates with Oligofectamine reagent. Cells transfected with negative control siRNA were used for comparison. The target sequences for the experimental siRNAs are listed in supplemental Table 1. After 30 min of pulse-labeling with 50 μmol/liter bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Calbiochem), cells were collected and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences). Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide (PI) solution (50 μg/ml PI and 50 μg/ml RNase A) and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Gene-specific transcript levels were measured using a branched DNA-based assay (QuantiGene Reagent System, Panomics, Fremont, CA) in single or multiplex formats. The single gene assay format has been described previously (28.Martin S.E. Jones T.L. Thomas C.L. Lorenzi P.L. Nguyen D.A. Runfola T. Gunsior M. Weinstein J.N. Goldsmith P.K. Lader E. Huppi K. Caplen N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study probes corresponding to RRM1, RRM2, or CTNNB1 (control) and human cyclophilin (PPIB) (for normalization) (Panomics) were used. The multiplex format (Quantigene® Plex assay, Panomics) was performed using a custom-designed panel consisting of 20 different XMAP® beads, each conjugated with a probe set corresponding to a different mRNA. The mRNAs assayed included genes associated with this study (RRM2, RRM1, E2F1, CHEK1, CHEK2, ATM, and ATR). Bead identity was used to identify each mRNA species, and the fluorescent signal from each bead (Bioplex, Bio-Rad) was used to quantify the amount of RNA. Protein levels were measured by Western blot with corresponding specific primary antibodies, including those against RRM2, Chk1, and E2F1 (Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated-H2AX (γ-H2AX) (Upstate/Millipore), RRM1 (Chemicon/Millipore), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphorylated-Chk1(Ser-317) (Cell Signaling). Shown are the representative data from separate experiments. MDA-MB-231 cells plated in four-well chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were used to study the subcellular localization of RRM2. After drug treatment, cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and washed twice with PBS. After incubation for 20 min with 70% ethanol and washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in blocking buffer (8% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h before incubation for 2 h with primary antibodies against RRM2 (Santa Cruz, CA). Slides were incubated for an additional 1 h with the Alex488-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 488 donkey anti-goat IgG, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). After three washes in PBS, cells were stained with 0.5 μg/ml PI and 100 μg/ml RNaseA (Sigma) for 15 min in the dark. Finally, slides were washed with PBS for three times and mounted with Vectashield anti-fade mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 confocal microscope. All the data are represented as mean values ± S.D. The significance of differences between means was assessed by the Student's t test, with p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Early studies of CPT showed this compound was cytotoxic to breast cancer cell lines (29.Nieves-Neira W. Pommier Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); however, adverse in vivo side effects and/or drug resistance due to overexpression of ABCG2 (30.Brangi M. Litman T. Ciotti M. Nishiyama K. Kohlhagen G. Takimoto C. Robey R. Pommier Y. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5938-5946PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Doyle L.A. Ross D.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7340-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) have limited the clinical development of the CPT derivatives as main line treatments for breast cancer. Recent studies have, however, reconsidered the potential of CPT in treatment of advanced breast cancer alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (32.O'Connor T. Rustum Y. Levine E. Creaven P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2008; 61: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A rational approach to determining additional pathways that could be used to improve the application of Top1 inhibitors in advanced breast cancer could be revealed by RNAi screening in an appropriate model system. The breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line is frequently used as a cellular model of triple-negative, basal-like breast cancer as it lacks expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and ERBB2 (HER2/Neu). A multiplex siRNA-based RNAi screen (28.Martin S.E. Jones T.L. Thomas C.L. Lorenzi P.L. Nguyen D.A. Runfola T. Gunsior M. Weinstein J.N. Goldsmith P.K. Lader E. Huppi K. Caplen N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was performed in the MDA-MB-231 to identify genes that modulated the activity of CPT (Fig. 1A). A duplicate screen showed good correlation (r = 0.8, data not shown). Deconvolution of the top sensitizing siRNA multiplexes identified RRM1 and RRM2 as genes whose silencing not only affected cell viability alone but also significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CPT (multiplexes C and G, Fig. 1B). As expected (33.Pommier Y. Barcelo J.M. Rao V.A. Sordet O. Jobson A.G. Thibaut L. Miao Z.H. Seiler J.A. Zhang H. Marchand C. Agama K. Nitiss J.L. Redon C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2006; 81: 179-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), BRCA1 and ATR knockdowns also produced CPT sensitization (multiplexes E and F, respectively). This screen also identified gap junction protein β1 (GJB1), a member of the connexin family of proteins, as an additional gene whose silencing enhances CPT toxicity. Notably, connexin proteins have been linked to mechanisms of cell death (34.Decrock E. Vinken M. De Vuyst E. Krysko D.V. D'Herde K. Vanhaecke T. Vandenabeele P. Rogiers V. Leybaert L. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, this target was not pursued further in the context of this study. HU inactivates RNR by targeting specifically the RRM2 subunit (35.Lassmann G. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to RRM2 knockdown (Fig. 1B), HU is known to protect from the cytotoxicity of CPT (7.Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6365-6368PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Cheng M.F. Chatterjee S. Berger N.A. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 269-279PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the difference between the effects of HU and RRM2 silencing on CPT cytotoxicity, a BrdUrd incorporation assay was used to detect the DNA replication in cells treated with HU or with RRM2 siRNA. Five mm HU blocked DNA replication totally after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, although the RRM2 protein level was knocked down with siRNA (Fig. 2B), only limited effects on cell cycle distribution were produced. siRNA against RRM2 produced an increase of S-phase cells but without fully arresting DNA synthesis as most cells in S-phase continued to incorporate BrdUrd (Fig. 2C). Thus, RRM2 knockdown, unlike HU, only partially reduced DNA synthesis. Because in yeast cells, the two RNR genes encoding the small (RNR2) and large (RNR3) subunits are both up-regulated at the transcriptional level in response to DNA damage (15.Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that CPT could also up-regulate the mammalian RNR genes, which may form part of the basis for the sensitization to CPT seen after RNAi against the RNR genes. To assess this possibility we examined the protein and mRNA levels of RRM1 and RRM2 after treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with CPT. At the protein level both RRM2 and RRM1 were induced, and RRM2 showed the greatest increase after CPT addition (Fig. 3A). At the mRNA level, RRM2 expression was induced ∼2.5-fold, and RRM1 was induced about 1.8-fold, 24–48 h post-CPT addition (Fig. 3B). RRM1 and RRM2 induction was also observed in the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116 (Fig. 3C). Because the RRM2 induction after CPT treatment was more pronounced than the RRM1 induction, and because of the regulatory role of the RNR2 subunit in the DNA damage response of yeast, we choose to focus our subsequent studies on RRM2. Immunofluorescence assays were performed to further examine the RRM2 induction by CPT at different time points up to 24 h. The overall RRM2 fluorescence signal per cell rose with drug exposure time, and RRM2 induction was already detectable after 1 h of CPT treatment (Fig. 3D). Moreover, subcellular localization analyses showed translocation of RRM2 from cytoplasm to nucleus in CPT-treated cells. Compared with the untreated control, the population of cells with nuclear RRM2 signal after CPT treatment increased from 7 to 37% (Fig. 3E). Those data confirmed the induction of RRM2 expression in response to CPT and revealed nuclear translocation of RRM2, consistent with the potential role of RRM2 in the DNA repair of Top1-induced DNA damage. To probe the DNA damage response mechanisms underlying the transcriptional up-regulation of RRM2 induced by CPT, we investigated the effects of RNAi targeting RRM2, E2F1, CHEK1, CHEK2, ATM, and ATR on the expression of those genes in the absence and presence of CPT. Each siRNA showed high efficiency silencing of the corresponding target gene expression in the absence (and presence) of CPT. As seen in Fig. 4, besides RRM2, silencing of CHEK1, E2F1, ATM, or ATR all partially suppressed the up-regulation of RRM2 by CPT. However, CHEK2 silencing had no effect on the RRM2 induction. The silencing of CHEK1 also suppressed the up-regulation of E2F1 expression, and silencing of ATM and ATR blocked both CHEK1 and E2F1 up-regulation at transcription level. Together these results suggested that ATM and ATR regulate RMM2 via CHEK1 and E2F1. In yeast cells, Rad53 regulates the expression of the ribonucleotide reductase small subunit RNR2 in response to DNA damage (37.Allen J.B. Zhou Z. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2401-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 38.Koc A. Merrill G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 5178-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but in mammalian cells the regulation of RRM2 is still unclear. Of the mammalian homologues of Rad53, Chk1, and Chk2, only the silencing of CHEK1 suppressed the transcription up-regulation of RRM2 in response to CPT, whereas CHEK2 silencing had no effect (Fig. 4). Therefore, we investigated the relationship between Chk1 and RRM2 in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CPT. Fig. 5 shows that Chk1 was activated by CPT. Indeed, phosphorylated-Chk1 (Chk1-Ser-317) increased upon CPT treatment (Fig. 5A). Both the Chk1 inhibitors UCN-01 and CHIR124 decreased the up-regulation of RRM2 in response to CPT, which suggested that Chk1 was involved in the up-regulation of RRM2 in response to CPT treatment (Fig. 5B). This was further confirmed by knockdown experiments with siRNA, which showed an attenuation of the up-regulation of RRM2 by CHEK1 knockdown (Fig. 5C). CHEK1 knockdown also enhanced the γ-H2AX response to CPT. Taken together, those experiments demonstrate that the up-regulation of RRM2 induced by CPT is Chk1-dependent and may have a protective effect as inactivation of Chk1 enhances CPT-induced DNA damage (9.Furuta T. Takemura H. Liao Z.Y. Aune G.J. Redon C. Sedelnikova O.A. Pilch D.R. Rogakou E.P. Celeste A. Chen H.T. Nussenzweig A. Aladjem M.I. Bonner W.M. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Because the RNR gene is one of the transcriptional targets of the replication- and stress-associated transcription factor E2F1 (13.DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 24.Chabes A.L. Björklund S. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10796-10807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and because E2F1 has been involved in the DNA damage response through its phosphorylation by ATM and Chk2 (41.Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), we investigated in more details the role of E2F1 in the up-regulation of RRM2 in response to CPT. After our finding that E2F1 increased at the mRNA level under exposure to CPT (Fig. 4), we examined E2F1 response at the protein level. Fig. 5 (B–D) shows enhanced E2F1 protein signal in cells treated with CPT. To determine the effect of E2F1 on the RRM2 up-regulation, knockdown of E2F1 with siRNA was then introduced. We had already found that E2F1 silencing suppressed RRM2 transcriptional up-regulation in response to CPT (Fig. 4). E2F1 knockdown also blocked the up-regulation of RRM2 at the protein level (Fig. 5D). These data demonstrate that RRM2 up-regulation in response to CPT is regulated by E2F1. The next set of experiments was done to examine the relationship between Chk1 and E2F1 in the RRM2 up-regulation. After siChk1 silencing, E2F1 base-line expression was reduced at the protein leve"

P3H1 consists of two major domains: a carboxyl-terminal dioxygenase domain, which is similar to the α-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylases, and a unique amino-terminal domain. The amino-terminal domain contains four cysteine (CXXXC) repeats and is homologous to CRTAP. This domain is found in five proteins of the human genome: P3H1, P3H2, P3H3, CRTAP, and SC65 (6Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23615-23621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The function of this domain has not been established, but it also contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat domains that are known to be important in protein-protein interactions (8Blatch G.L.

P3H1 was immunolocalized to cells in tissues that contain fibrillar collagens (6Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23615-23621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells in tissues rich in basement membrane collagens did not stain with the monoclonal antibody against P3H1, and it is therefore likely that P3H2 (10Tiainen P. Pasanen A. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19432-19439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or P3H3 3-hydroxylates proline residues in these collagens. To understand the potential roles of the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex during collagen biosynthesis a brief review of the known steps follows. After the translocation of the growing polypeptide chains of procollagens into the rER, proline residues become 4-hydroxylated by prolyl 4-hydroxlase. 4-Hydroxylation of proline residues increases the stability of the triple helix and is a key element in the folding of the triple helix. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase requires an unfolded chain as a substrate. The chain selection and association for triple helix formation are determined by the carboxyl-terminal propeptides in fibrillar collagens. Premature association between procollagen chains is thought to be prevented by chaperones such as protein-disulfide isomerase, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, HSP47, and FKBP65 and collagen modifying enzymes until the biosynthesis of the individual chain is completed. Additional modifications are the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues by the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex, the hydroxylation of lysine residues by lysyl hydroxylases, and glycosylation. The chains are then selected, and trimers are formed by association of the carboxyl-terminal propeptides. Disulfide bonds between the chains are formed, and this formation is most likely catalyzed by protein-disulfide isomerase. Triple helix formation proceeds from the carboxyl-terminal end toward the amino-terminal end in a zipper-like fashion. The rate-limiting step in this process is the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds. This process is catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (CypB). Because procollagen molecules are only marginally stable, it was proposed that folding of procollagen molecules inside cells requires special chaperones (11Makareeva E. Leikin S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with HSP47 and FKBP65 as a potential candidates. Given the complexity of this process, it is not surprising that so many different proteins in the rER are involved and that these proteins interact and function as “folding machines.” Additionally collagen molecules have a strong tendency to aggregate. This process must be inhibited inside the cells and allowed only after secretion into the extracellular space. The functional importance of collagen chaperones is further shown by the embryonic lethality of HSP47 knock-out mice (12Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and the accumulation of BiP/GRP78 in cells with mutations in the collagen chains (13Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18226-18233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex was recently demonstrated in CRTAP knock-out mice (7Morello R. Bertin T.K.

These mice show osteochondrodysplasia characterized by severe osteoporosis and decreased osteoid production. They lack the 3-Hyp in type I and II collagens.

In this report we show that the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex is not only responsible for the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues, but it is also a potent molecular chaperone.

Homogenization was carried out in a Waring blender at maximum speed for 3 min. This and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min in an H-6000A rotor (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The supernatant was then centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1.5 h in a 45 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The pellets from this step were resuspended in twice the volume of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 m NaCl, and the same protease inhibitors as described above, treated with 1 μl/ml diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and gently stirred for 4 h on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1.5 h, filtered through Miracloth, and run over a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column (2.6 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HOAc buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). The column was washed with at least 2 bed volumes of buffer A and then with 1 bed volume of 50 mm Tris/HOAc buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 followed by another bed volume of buffer A. Elution was performed using a pH gradient from 7.5 to 5.0 with buffer A. Peak fractions containing P3H1 complex and collagen-related proteins were pooled, dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and filtrated through a 0.45-μm filter prior to being loaded onto the P3H1 monoclonal antibody affinity column. The column was washed with at least 5 bed volume of phosphate-buffered saline and then eluted by 50 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. P3H1 complex was pooled and dialyzed against each enzyme assay and reaction buffers. The cDNA encoding chick CypB without the signal sequence was amplified by PCR from chick fibroblast cDNA using primers with the 5′ side containing an NcoI site and the 3′ side containing a SalI site after the stop codon. This DNA was inserted between the NcoI and SalI restriction sites of a pET30a(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). The expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (final concentration, 1 mm) to induce expression of CypB. After incubation at 30 °C overnight, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in B-PER (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and ammonium sulfate (final concentration, 30% (w/v)) was added to the supernatant, and it was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged to remove the precipitated materials. The supernatant from the ammonium sulfate precipitation was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and applied onto a Co2+-chelating resin column, and CypB was eluted by 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m imidazole after washing with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05 m imidazole for at least 10 column volumes. The fractions containing CypB were dialyzed into enterokinase cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% Tween 20), and enterokinase (0.1 unit/200-μl reaction volume) (Invitrogen) was added at 4 °C overnight to cleave the His tag. The reaction mixture was incubated with DEAE-Sepharose (100 μl/1.5-ml reaction volume) to remove enterokinase at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was spun down, the supernatant was applied onto a Co2+-chelating resin column, and CypB was eluted by 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The purified CypB was dialyzed against each enzyme assay and reaction buffer. The aggregation of citrate synthase upon thermal denaturation (19Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) was measured by the method of Shao et al. (20Shao F. Bader M.W. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13349-13352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 200-fold to a final concentration of 0.15 μm into prewarmed 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, at 43 °C. The aggregation of citrate synthase was monitored by absorbance at 500 nm in a Cary4 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). All enzyme concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. A stock solution of 0.5 mm cyclosporine A (EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) was prepared in DMSO and further diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm (0.2% DMSO). Before measurement the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex was incubated with Cyclosporine A for 1 h at 4 °C. Another frequently used assay for chaperone activity is the inhibition of aggregation of chemically denatured rhodanese (21Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 22Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine rhodanese (Sigma-Aldrich) was denatured in 30 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C for 1 h and then diluted 100-fold to a final concentration of 0.3 μm in 30 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm KCl. The aggregation of denatured rhodanese was monitored at 320 nm with a Cary4 spectrophotometer. All protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Measurements of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the isomerization reaction were performed as described previously (23Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) based on the α-chymotrypsin assay (24Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Stock solutions of substrates were prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 2.5 mm for Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA. The final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.352% for kcat/Km measurements and 0.602% for the inhibition studies. Kinetic measurements were made at 5 °C to minimize the non-enzymatic isomerization reaction in 35 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.8. Final substrate and chymotrypsin concentrations were 8.8 and 12.8 μm, respectively. Fluorescence changes were monitored at 380 nm with a HiTech stopped-flow spectrophotometer (TgK Scientific Ltd., Bradford-on-Avon, UK). The assay was started by mixing chymotrypsin and substrate. Progression curves were analyzed by fitting to a second-order exponential decay function with Origin (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Inhibition measurements were performed in a similar manner. A stock solution of cyclosporine A (0.1 mm) was prepared in DMSO and further diluted with 35 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.8. After preincubation of the inhibitor with the P3H1 complex at 4 °C for 1 h, the assay was started. Values for kcat/Km were calculated according to kcat/Km = (kobs − ku)/[E] where ku is the rate constant for the unanalyzed isomerization reaction and kobs is the rate constant for the catalyzed reaction in the presence of enzymes at a given concentration of [E]. k values were calculated using Origin. The thermal stability of bovine type I and III collagens was monitored at 365 nm using a 341MC polarimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a 10-cm-path length thermostatted cell. The temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath and programmable temperature controller (RCS, Lauda Division, Brinkmann Instruments) and measured with a digital thermometer (Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT) and a thermistor inserted into the cell. Both the temperature and the optical rotatory dispersion signals were recorded and digitized on an HP9070A measurement and plotting system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The temperature was increased from 25 to 50 °C at a rate of 10 °C/h. Stock solutions of type I and type III collagens (final concentration, 0.025 μm) in 10 mm acetic acid were diluted into 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 m NaCl. Refolding of pN type III collagen (0.125 μm) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl was monitored at 365 nm. The sample was denatured for 10 min at 45 °C and refolded at 25 °C by switching between two water baths. A stock solution of type I collagen in 50 mm acetic acid was diluted to a final concentration of 0.3 μm in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl. The absorbance (light scattering) was monitored at 313 nm as a function of time at 34 °C. All protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out using a BIACore X instrument (GE Healthcare). Purified native bovine type I collagen was immobilized at a concentration of about 6 ng/mm2 (6,000 resonance units) on a CM5 sensor chip by amide coupling. The experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20. Various concentrations of P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex (from 0.35 to 0.075 μm) were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex was isolated from chick embryos and purified on a gelatin-Sepharose column followed by an antibody column loaded with a monoclonal antibody against chicken P3H1. Fig. 1 shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the elution of the gelatin-Sepharose column (Fig. 1A) and the elution from the antibody column (Fig. 1B). To compare the biochemical activities of the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex and free CypB, we recombinantly expressed chicken CypB in E. coli. An SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the purified chicken CypB is shown in Fig. 1C. These protein preparations were used for the characterization of the biochemical activities. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex exhibited potent chaperone activity in this assay. Fig. 2A shows the concentration-dependent inhibition of the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase. Compared with BSA as a negative control and 0.15 μm protein-disulfide isomerase, an established chaperone, the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex showed much stronger aggregation inhibition activity at only 0.01 μm concentration (Fig. 2B). Chicken CypB or cyclosporine A alone did not show any chaperone activity, and the addition of cyclosporine A to the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex did not alter its chaperone activity (Fig. 2C). The concentration-dependent inhibition of the aggregation and refolding of chemically denatured rhodanese by the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex is shown in Fig. 3A. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex at a concentration of 0.08 μm showed a much higher chaperone activity than protein-disulfide isomerase at a concentration of 2 μm (Fig. 3B). Free CypB did not contribute to the chaperone effect in this assay as shown previously (25Horibe T. Yosho C. Okada S. Tsukamoto M. Nagai H. Hagiwara Y. Tujimoto Y. Kikuchi M. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex was active as a PPIase when analyzed with a synthetic peptide substrate. Fig. 4A shows the PPIase activity using Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA as a substrate. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km 18,800 ± 1000 mm−1 s−1) of the complex is a little higher than that of chicken CypB (11,600 ± 1000 mm−1 s−1) (data not shown). The PPIase activity of the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex could be inhibited by cyclosporine A in a manner similar to that of the inhibition of CypB (Fig. 4B). This indicates that CypB in this complex is fully functional. The refolding of type III collagen was rate-limited by cis-trans isomerizations of proline residues, and this rate could be catalyzed by CypB. Fig. 5 shows the refolding of thermally denatured pN type III collagen. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex increased the rate of refolding of pN type III collagen; however, an equimolar amount of free CypB was a better catalyst in this reaction despite the higher catalytic efficiency of the complex against peptide substrates. In contrast to the recently described FKBP65, the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex or free CypB did not stabilize the collagen triple helix. Fig. 6 shows the melting curves for type I collagen (Fig. 6A) and type III collagen (Fig. 6B). In both cases the curves are very close in the presence or absence of a 4-fold molar excess of P3H1·CRTAP·CypB or CypB. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex also interacted with folded triple helical collagen as shown by its activity in inhibiting the formation of type I collagen fibrils. Fig. 7 shows the concentration-dependent inhibition of type I collagen fibril formation by the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex and compares this activity with the known inhibitor HSP47. When equimolar amounts of HSP47 and P3H1·CRTAP·CypB were used HSP47 showed a lower activity in inhibiting fibril formation. Free CypB did not show any activity in this assay (data not shown). The dissociation constant of the type I collagen P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex was determined to be 7.4 μm (Table 1). This value indicates a weaker interaction as compared with HSP47, which was used as a control (Kd = 2.3 μm). The difference in Kd was the result of a 5–10-fold faster dissociation rate of the complex compared with HSP47.TABLE 1Dissociation and rate constants of binding of native bovine type I collagen to the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex and HSP47Kdkakd10−6 m1/m s1/sP3H1·CRTAP·CypB7.4 ± 2.82.5 ± 0.4·1042.0 ± 0.5·10−1HSP472.3 ± 0.62.8 ± 0.5·1046.2 ± 1.0·10−2HSP47aTaken from Ref.

Open table in a new tab P3H1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of the Pro-986 to (3S)-Hyp of the α1 chains of type I collagen in vitro (6Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23615-23621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, when P3H1 is extracted from chick embryos, P3H1 is present in a complex with CRTAP and cyclophilin B. For the in vivo hydroxylation of the single Pro residue in the α1 chains of type I, II, and III collagens the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex seems to be required. The CRTAP knock-out mice and human mutations in CRTAP and P3H1 show a dramatic decrease in the level of 3-hydroxylation (7Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M.

Mutat. 2008; 29: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Assuming that the hydroxylase activity is in the carboxyl-terminal dioxygenase domain of P3H1, why are CRTAP and CypB required for the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues in vivo? The results shown here indicate that the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex is not only responsible for the 3-hydroxylation of specific proline residues in the α chains of fibrillar collagens, but it also acts as a potent molecular chaperone. The complex was active in the inhibition of the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase and in the refolding and aggregation assay of chemically denatured rhodanese. Free CypB had no activity in these assays, and inhibition of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of CypB in the complex did not change this activity. The CypB in the complex was active as a PPIase, and this activity could be inhibited with cyclosporine A. The catalytic efficiency of CypB in the complex was higher than that of free CypB against a peptide substrate. The catalytic efficiency of the complex was lower against pN type III collagen, but a slightly higher amount of collagen refolded compared with control or free CypB. The chaperone activity of the complex might help in the recognition of substrates, and therefore the complex combines chaperone activity and PPIase activity during the refolding of collagen triple helices. It was recently shown that the insertion of a chaperone domain into FKBP12 (a PPIase) increased the catalytic efficiency of protein refolding (26Knappe T.A. Eckert B. Schaarschmidt P. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the chaperones HSP47 and FKBP65 stabilize the collagen triple helix in the rER (11Makareeva E. Leikin S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Ishikawa Y. Vranka J. Wirz J. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31584-31590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex had no effect on the stability of type III collagen. A slight decrease in the stability of type I collagen could be observed at a 4-fold molar excess of complex. This indicates that HSP47 and FKBP65 are the likely chaperones that stabilize the triple helix of these collagens in the rER. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex also interacts with folded triple helical collagens as indicated by the inhibition of fibril formation of type I collagen. The complex inhibited the fibril formation of type I collagen as efficiently as HSP47 and FKBP65 (16Baldridge D. Schwarze U. Morello R. Lennington J. Bertin T.K. Pace J.M. Pepin M.G. Weis M. Eyre D.R. Walsh J. Lambert D. Green A. Robinson H. Michelson M. Houge G. Lindman C. Martin J. Ward J. Lemyre E. Mitchell J.J. Krakow D. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Byers P.H. Lee B. Hum. Mutat. 2008; 29: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It therefore contributes in the prevention of premature aggregation of collagen chains and molecules in the rER. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex bound folded type I collagen less efficiently than did HSP47. The association rate constants were similar, but the complex showed a higher dissociation rate constant. Binding to unfolded collagen chains is likely to be very complex. The complex will bind to unfolded collagen chains for the 3-hydroxylation activity, the cis-trans isomerase activity, and likely for the chaperone activity. One can speculate that the complex preferentially binds to unfolded chains and catalyzes the folding of the triple helix. The complex can then interact at this site with the triple helical structure and temporarily stabilize this junction. The fast dissociation is then used to replace the complex with HSP47 or other helix-stabilizing chaperones. The P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex therefore has three distinct activities: it is a prolyl 3-hydroxylase, a PPIase, and a molecular chaperone. The observed phenotypes in the CRTAP-null mice and human mutations in CRTAP and P3H1 may not only result from the lack of the 3-Hyp residues in the type I, II, or III collagens but also from a disturbance in the additional function of the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex as a chaperone and PPIase. CRTAP-null mice show overmodified α chains on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M. Castagnola P. Rauch F. Glorieux F.H. Vranka J. Bächinger H.P.

Overmodified α chains in collagens of fibroblasts of patients with CRTAP and P3H1 mutations were also observed, and in addition a slower rate of secretion of type I collagen was found in these cells (14Barnes A.M.

https://openalex.org/W1989463629,"Various studies using proteomic approaches have shown that HDL can carry many proteins other than its constitutive apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Using mass spectrometry and Western blotting, we showed the presence of alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AAT) (SERPINA1, serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, an elastase inhibitor) in HDL, isolated either by ultracentrifugation or by selected-affinity immunosorption using an anti-apoA-I column. Furthermore, we report that HDL possesses potent antielastase activity. We further showed that only HDL but not LDL is able to bind AAT. HDL-associated AAT was able to inhibit extracellular matrix degradation, cell detachment, and apoptosis induced by elastase in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and in mammary artery cultured ex vivo. Degradation of fibronectin by elastase used as a marker of pericellular proteolysis was prevented by addition of HDL. Elastase present in aortic abdominal aneurysm (AAA) thrombus samples was also able to induce apoptosis of VSMCs in culture. This phenomenon was prevented by addition of HDL but not of LDL. Finally, we report that the proportion of AAT in HDL isolated from patients with an AAA is decreased relative to that from matched control subjects, suggesting a reduced capacity of HDL to inhibit elastase in these patients. In conclusion, our data provide evidence of a new potential antiatherogenic property of HDL attributable to AAT and its antielastase activity."

The aim of this work was to establish the in vitro conditions for generation of NHP tolerogenic DCs (Tol-DCs), as well as to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which these cells could control an immune response. Two populations of NHP bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were obtained: adherent and nonadherent. Although both populations displayed a quite similar phenotype, they were very different functionally. We characterized the adherent BMDCs as Tol-DCs that were poor stimulators of T cells and actively inhibited T-cell proliferation, whereas the nonadherent population displayed immunogenic properties in vitro. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was up-regulated in Tol-DCs, compared to the immunogenic BMDCs. We demonstrated that HO-1 mediates the immunosuppressive properties of Tol-DCs in vitro (in NHPs and rats) and that HO-1 is involved in the in vivo tolerogenic effect of Tol-DCs in a rat model of allotransplantation. In conclusion, here we characterized the in vitro generation of NHP Tol-DCs. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that HO-1 plays a role in the active inhibition of T-cell responses by rat and NHP Tol-DCs."

We sought to define physiological constraints on erythrocyte antioxidant defense. Hemoglobin (Hb) conformation gates glycolytic flux through the hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP), the sole source of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in erythrocytes. We hypothesized elevated intraerythrocytic deoxyHb would limit resilience to oxidative stress. Human erythrocytes were subjected to controlled oxidant (superoxide) loading following independent manipulation of oxygen tension, Hb conformation, and glycolytic pathway dominance. Sufficiency of antioxidant defense was determined by serial quantification of GSH, NADPH, NADH redox couples. Hypoxic erythrocytes demonstrated greater loss of reduction potential [Δ GSH Ehc (mV): 123.4±9.7 vs. 57.2±11.1] and reduced membrane thiol (47.7±5.7 vs. 20.1±4.3%) (hypoxia vs. normoxia, respectively;P<0.01), a finding mimicked in normoxic erythrocytes after HMP blockade. Rebalancing HMP flux during hypoxia restored resilience to oxidative stress at all stages of the system. Cell-free studies assured oxidative loading was not altered by oxygen tension, heme ligation, or the inhibitors employed. These data indicate that Hb conformation controls coupled glucose and thiol metabolism in erythrocytes, and implicate hypoxemia in the pathobiology of erythrocyte-based vascular signaling.—Rogers, S.

https://openalex.org/W2028320880,"1,4-Dihydropyridines (DHPs) constitute a major class of ligands for L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC). The DHPs have a boat-like, six-membered ring with an NH group at the stern, an aromatic moiety at the bow, and substituents at the port and starboard sides. Various DHPs exhibit antagonistic or agonistic activities, which were previously explained as stabilization or destabilization, respectively, of the closed activation gate by the portside substituents. Here we report a novel structural model in which agonist and antagonist activities are determined by different parts of the DHP molecule and have different mechanisms. In our model, which is based on Monte Carlo minimizations of DHP-LTCC complexes, the DHP moieties at the stern, bow, and starboard form H-bonds with side chains of the key DHP-sensing residues Tyr_IIIS6, Tyr_IVS6, and Gln_IIIS5, respectively. We propose that these H-bonds, which are common for agonists and antagonists, stabilize the LTCC conformation with the open activation gate. This explains why both agonists and antagonists increase probability of the long lasting channel openings and why even partial disruption of the contacts eliminates the agonistic action. In our model, the portside approaches the selectivity filter. Hydrophobic portside of antagonists may induce long lasting channel closings by destabilizing Ca(2+) binding to the selectivity filter glutamates. Agonists have either hydrophilic substituents or a hydrogen atom at their portside, and thus lack this destabilizing effect. The predicted orientation of the DHP core allows accommodation of long substituents in the domain interface or in the inner pore. Our model may be useful for developing novel clinically relevant LTCC blockers."

To understand how KLF5 acetylation functions in TGFβ-induced p15 transcription, we characterized the interactions of KLF5 with other transcription factors and promoter DNA elements in the context of TGFβ. KLF5 interacted with Smad2–4 and Miz-1 in a TGFβ-independent manner, but interacted with Myc only when TGFβ was activated, and at least some of the interactions had an additive effect on TGFβ-induced p15 transcription. Oligo pulldown assays showed that binding of Myc to the Inr element was KLF5-dependent, and TGFβ could enhance the binding when more KLF5 was available. Furthermore, TGFβ induced an interaction between KLF5 and the p300 acetylase, and acetylation of KLF5 was necessary for Smad4 to associate with p300. Failure in KLF5 acetylation not only prevented p300-assembled Smad4-KLF5 complex formation on p15 promoter but also affected the binding of Smad4 and FOXO3 on the p15 promoter <i>in vivo</i>. These findings suggest that without TGFβ, some KLF5 associates with Smads in the nucleus and other KLF5 associates with Miz-1 on the p15 promoter to repress its transcription. Activation of TGFβ recruits p300 to the KLF5-Smad complex to acetylate KLF5, and the complex with acetylated KLF5 binds to the Smad binding element and alters the binding of other factors to p15 promoter to induce its transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2090589796,"This study investigated potential cardiotoxicity as exerted by Erbicin-derived-immunoagents (EDIAs), novel human anti-ErbB2 immunoagents engineered by fusion of a human anti-ErbB2 scFv, Erbicin, with either a human RNase or the Fc region of a human IgG1. EDIAs are strongly cytotoxic on ErbB2-positive cells in vitro and in vivo and bind to an epitope different from that of Herceptin, a humanized anti-ErbB2 mAb effective in the therapy of breast carcinoma, but cardiotoxic in a high percentage of cases. Toxicity and apoptosis were tested in vitro by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thizolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), DNA fragmentation, and immunoblotting analyses. Echocardiography was measured in mice after treatment with each immunoagent. Cardiac fibrosis and detection of apoptosis were examined by Sirius red staining of collagen and TUNEL assay, respectively. EDIAs were found in vitro to have no adverse effects on cardiac cells for which Herceptin is severely toxic. In vivo studies on a mouse model showed that the EDIAs did not alter cardiac function, whereas Herceptin and doxorubicin, used as positive controls, significantly reduced the fractional shortening parameter. Cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis were not significantly affected in mice treated with EDIAs. Thus, EDIAs could fulfill the therapeutic need of patients ineligible for Herceptin treatment due to cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2039976715,"Genetic analysis suggests that the TGD2 protein of Arabidopsis is required for the biosynthesis of endoplasmic reticulum derived thylakoid lipids. TGD2 is proposed to be the substrate-binding protein of a presumed lipid transporter consisting of the TGD1 (permease) and TGD3 (ATPase) proteins. The TGD1, -2, and -3 proteins are localized in the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. TGD2 appears to be anchored with an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain into the inner envelope membrane, whereas the C-terminal domain faces the intermembrane space. It was previously shown that the C-terminal domain of TGD2 binds phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). To investigate the PtdOH binding site of TGD2 in detail, the C-terminal domain of the TGD2 sequence lacking the transit peptide and transmembrane sequences was fused to the C terminus of the Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DR). This greatly improved the solubility of the resulting DR-TGD2C fusion protein following production in Escherichia coli. The DR-TGD2C protein bound PtdOH with high specificity, as demonstrated by membrane lipid-protein overlay and liposome association assays. Internal deletion and truncation mutagenesis identified a previously undescribed minimal 25-amino acid fragment in the C-terminal domain of TGD2 that is sufficient for PtdOH binding. Binding characteristics of this 25-mer were distinctly different from those of TGD2C, suggesting that additional sequences of TGD2 providing the proper context for this 25-mer are needed for wild type-like PtdOH binding."
https://openalex.org/W1992150326,"Expression of oncoprotein c-Myb oscillates during hematopoiesis and hematological malignancies. Its quantity is not only regulated through transcriptional control but also through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, accompanied by phosphorylation, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this report, we tried to identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets c-Myb for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We found that an F-box protein, Fbw7, interacted with c-Myb, which is mutated in numerous cancers. Fbw7 facilitated ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Myb in intact cells. Moreover, depletion of Fbw7 by RNA interference delayed turnover and increased the abundance of c-Myb in myeloid leukemia cells concomitantly, and suppressed the transcriptional level of gamma-globin, which receives transcriptional repression from c-Myb. In addition, we analysed sites required for both ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Myb. We found that Thr-572 is critical for Fbw7-mediated ubiquitylation in mouse c-Myb using site-directed mutagenesis. Fbw7 recognized the phosphorylation of Thr-572, which was mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). In consequence, the c-Myb protein was markedly stabilized by the substitution of Thr-572 to Ala. These observations suggest that SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase regulates phosphorylation-dependent degradation of c-Myb protein."
https://openalex.org/W2020158514,"Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is found in over 80% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and associated with poor clinical outcomes. EFGR selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or antibodies have recently emerged as promising treatments for solid tumors, including HNSCC, though the response rate to these agents is low. p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, is required for apoptosis induced by p53 and various chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we show that PUMA induction is correlated with EGFR-TKI sensitivity, and is mediated through the p53 family protein p73beta and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In some HNSCC cells, the gefitinib-induced degradation of oncogenic Delta Np63 seems to facilitate p73-mediated PUMA transcription. Inhibiting PUMA expression by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) impairs gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PUMA or BH3 mimetics sensitize HNSCC cells to gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that PUMA induction through p73 represents a new mechanism of EGFR inhibitor-induced apoptosis, and provide potential ways for enhancing and predicting the sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2023560849,"The activity of protein kinase B, also known as Akt, is commonly elevated in human malignancies and plays a crucial role in oncogenic transformation. The relationship between Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which is also frequently associated with oncogenesis, remains controversial. We report here examples of cooperation between Akt and cRaf in oncogenic transformation, which was accompanied by elevated activity of extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases. The effect of Akt on extracellular signal-regulated kinases depended on the status of p21-activated kinase (PAK). Importantly, disruption of the function of PAK not only uncoupled the activation of Akt from that of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, but also greatly reduced the capacity of Akt to act as a transforming oncogene. For the malignancies with hyperactive Akt, our observations support the role for PAK-1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2156316410,"In skeletal muscle, STAT5a/b transcription factors are critical for normal postnatal growth, whole-animal glucose homeostasis, and local IGF-1 production. These observations have led us to hypothesize that STAT5a/b are critical for maintenance of normal muscle mass and function. To investigate this, mice with a skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the Stat5a/b genes (Stat5MKO) were used. Stat5MKO mice displayed reduced muscle mass, altered fiber-type distribution and reduced activity. On a molecular level, gene expression in skeletal muscle of Stat5MKO and control mice was analyzed by microarrays and real-time PCR, both in the presence and absence of growth hormone (GH) stimulation. Expression of several genes involved in muscle growth and fiber type were significantly changed. Specifically, in the quadriceps, a muscle almost exclusively composed of type II fibers, the absence of STAT5a/b led to increased expression of several genes associated with type I fibers and the de novo appearance of type I fibers. In addition, it is shown here that expression of the androgen receptor gene (Ar) is controlled by GH through STAT5a/b. The link between STAT5a/b and Ar gene is likely through direct transcriptional regulation, as chromatin immunoprecipitaion of the Ar promoter region in C2C12 myoblasts was accomplished by antibodies against STAT5a. These experiments demonstrate an important role for STAT5a/b in skeletal muscle physiology, and they provide a direct link to androgen signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1966803652,"Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a family of molecules that control the duration of G protein signaling. A variety of RGS proteins have been reported to modulate opioid receptor signaling. Here we show that RGS4 is abundantly expressed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells that endogenously express mu- and delta-opioid receptors and test the hypothesis that the activity of opioids in these cells is modulated by RGS4. Endogenous RGS4 protein was reduced by approximately 90% in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA specifically targeted to RGS4. In these cells, the potency and maximal effect of delta-opioid receptor agonist (SNC80)-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was increased compared with control cells. This effect was reversed by transient transfection of a stable RGS4 mutant (HA-RGS4C2S). Furthermore, MAPK activation by SNC80 was increased in cells with knockdown of RGS4. In contrast, there was no change in the mu-opioid (morphine) response at adenylyl cyclase or MAPK. FLAG-tagged opioid receptors and HA-RGS4C2S were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the delta-opioid receptor but not the mu-opioid receptor could be precipitated together with the stable RGS4. Using chimeras of the delta- and mu-opioid receptors, the C-tail and third intracellular domain of the delta-opioid receptor were suggested to be the sites of interaction with RGS4. The findings demonstrate a role for endogenous RGS4 protein in modulating delta-opioid receptor signaling in SH-SY5Y cells and provide evidence for a receptor-specific effect of RGS4."
https://openalex.org/W2100260797,"Folate (vitamin B9) is utilized for synthesis of both S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), which are required for methylation reactions and DNA synthesis, respectively. Folate depletion leads to an imbalance in both AdoMet and nucleotide pools, causing epigenetic and genetic damage capable of initiating tumorigenesis. Polyamine biosynthesis also utilizes AdoMet, but polyamine pools are not reduced under a regimen of folate depletion. We hypothesized that high polyamine biosynthesis, due to the high demand on AdoMet pools, might be a factor in determining sensitivity to folate depletion. We found a significant correlation (P<0.001) between polyamine biosynthesis and the amount of folate required to sustain cell line proliferation. We manipulated polyamine biosynthesis by genetic and pharmacological intervention and mechanistically demonstrated that we could thereby alter AdoMet pools and increase or decrease demand on folate availability needed to sustain cellular proliferation. Furthermore, growing a panel of cell lines with 100 nM folate led to imbalanced nucleotide and AdoMet pools only in cells with endogenously high polyamine biosynthesis. These data demonstrate that polyamine biosynthesis is a critical factor in determining sensitivity to folate depletion and may be particularly important in the prostate, where biosynthesis of polyamines is characteristically high due to its secretory function."
https://openalex.org/W1980010909,"Microbial pathogen entry and survival in the host is mediated by a network of molecular interactions between the two partners, which has been the subject of many research efforts. A complex picture is emerging in which host-pathogen crosstalk involves a high number of proteins, often with redundant functions. In the present study, we investigated the potential of protein microarrays to simultaneously scan interactions between surface proteins from two main human streptococcal pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, and three human ligands, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4 binding protein, known to play an important role in streptococcal pathogenesis. By using this technology, we confirmed interactions described in the literature and detected a novel set of streptococcal proteins with binding capacities for the human ligands. The observations were validated by Western blot and ELISA techniques. Three of the newly identified proteins were isoforms of a group B streptococcus-secreted component named Fib and displayed differential binding capacities for fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4BP. The protein regions involved in the interaction with each ligand were identified by constructing fragments of one of the Fib variants. The approach proved valuable for the acquisition of novel insights into the complex network of protein-protein interactions occurring during microbial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2021660803,"The small guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) proteins RhoA and RhoC are essential for tumor invasion and/or metastasis in breast carcinomas. However, it is poorly understood how RhoA and RhoC are activated in breast cancer cells. Here we describe the role of myosin-interacting guanine nucleotide exchange factor (MyoGEF) in regulating RhoA and RhoC activation as well as cell polarity and invasion in an invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. RNA-interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of MyoGEF in MDA-MB-231 cells not only suppresses the activation of RhoA and RhoC, but also decreases cell polarity and invasion activity. The dominant-negative mutants of RhoA and RhoC, but not Rac1 and Cdc42, dramatically decrease actin polymerization induced by MyoGEF. In addition, MyoGEF colocalizes with nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) to the front of migrating cells, and depletion of NMIIA by RNAi disrupts the polarized localization of MyoGEF at the cell leading edge, suggesting a role for NMIIA in regulating MyoGEF localization and function. Moreover, MyoGEF protein levels significantly increase in infiltrating ductal carcinomas as well as in invasive breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, our results suggest that MyoGEF cooperates with NMIIA to regulate the polarity and invasion activity of breast cancer cells through activation of RhoA and RhoC."
https://openalex.org/W2104161116,"The Bordetella adenylate cyclase-hemolysin (CyaA, ACT, or AC-Hly) is a multifunctional toxin. Simultaneously with promoting calcium ion entry, CyaA delivers into host cells an adenylate cyclase enzyme (AC) and permeabilizes cell membrane by forming small cation-selective pores. Indirect evidence suggested that these two activities were accomplished by different membrane-inserted CyaA conformers, one acting as an AC-delivering monomer and the other as an uncharacterized pore-forming oligomer. We tested this model by directly detecting toxin oligomers in cell membrane and by assessing oligomerization of specific mutants with altered pore-forming properties. CyaA oligomers were revealed in sheep erythrocyte membranes by immunogold labeling and directly demonstrated by pulldown of membrane-inserted CyaA together with biotinylated CyaA-AC(-) toxoid. Membrane oligomers of CyaA could also be resolved by nondenaturing electrophoresis of mild detergent extracts of erythrocytes. Furthermore, CyaA mutants exhibiting enhanced (E581K) or reduced (E570K+E581P) specific hemolytic and pore-forming activity were found to exhibit also a correspondingly enhanced or reduced propensity to form oligomers in erythrocyte membranes. On the other hand, processed CyaA, with the AC domain cleaved off by erythrocyte proteases, was detected only in a monomeric form excluded from the oligomers of unprocessed CyaA. These results provide the first direct evidence that oligomerization is involved in formation of CyaA pores in target membranes and that translocation of the AC domain across cell membrane may be accomplished by monomeric CyaA."

Understanding the role of FANCJ in DNA metabolism and how FANCJ dysfunction leads to tumorigenesis requires mechanistic studies of FANCJ helicase and its protein partners. In this work, we have examined the ability of FANCJ to unwind DNA molecules with specific base damage that can be mutagenic or lethal. FANCJ was inhibited by a single thymine glycol, but not 8-oxoguanine, in either the translocating or nontranslocating strands of the helicase substrate. In contrast, the human RecQ helicases (BLM, RECQ1, and WRN) display strand-specific inhibition of unwinding by the thymine glycol damage, whereas other DNA helicases (DinG, DnaB, and UvrD) are not significantly inhibited by thymine glycol in either strand.

As a DNA helicase, FANCJ is a likely candidate to operate in this capacity, potentially extending its range of function beyond cross-link repair. Activation of FANCJ helicase activity is required for timely progression through S phase of the cell cycle (18.Kumaraswamy E. Shiekhattar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6733-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); however, its precise functions in S phase progression remain to be understood. One source of genomic instability is alternate DNA structures such as DNA triplexes and quadruplexes that may impede the replication fork or interfere with transcription. Recently, FANCJ was shown to unwind G-quadruplex structures and have a role in G4 DNA metabolism (19.Wu Y. Shin-ya K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4116-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). There has been speculation that the underlying defect in FA and other chromosomal instability disorders may be due to an improper cellular response to oxidative stress. Bone marrow failure and leukemia progression in FA may be at least partly due to the accumulation of oxidative damage that induces excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (20.Du W. Adam Z. Rani R. Zhang X. Pang Q. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2008; 10: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an effort to further understand the unwinding mechanism of FANCJ and its interaction with damaged DNA, we have investigated the effects of naturally occurring DNA base modifications on its helicase activity. Our findings demonstrate that FANCJ is uniquely sensitive to a single thymine glycol base modification in either the nontranslocating or translocating strands of the duplex DNA substrate. The ability of FANCJ to sense base damage in either strand of the DNA duplex as it unwinds may be important for its physiological functions in DNA damage signaling or repair. The existence of FANCJ in a BRCA1-containing complex with other DNA repair factors involved in the recognition and repair of aberrant DNA structures suggests that the complex functions in the DNA damage response (14.Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). Reactions were conducted under standard conditions for 15 min and initiated by the addition of helicase. Reactions were quenched with the addition of 20 μl of 2× Stop buffer (17.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol). A 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand was included in the quench to prevent reannealing. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by using the following formula: % unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the substrate. The values of the product and substrate have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate controls, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with standard deviation shown by error bars. For helicase sequestration studies, FANCJ (9.6 nm) was preincubated with the indicated concentrations (0–12.5 nm) of the specified unlabeled forked duplex competitor DNA molecule (top strand thymine glycol or bottom strand thymine glycol) in standard helicase reaction buffer in the presence of ATP (2 mm) for 3 min at 30 °C. Ten fmol of radiolabeled forked 19-bp duplex molecules (tracker substrate (31.Gupta R. Sharma S. Doherty K.M. Sommers J.A. Cantor S.B. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6673-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) was subsequently added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 7 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched and resolved on native polyacrylamide gels as described above. Percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated as described above. Typically, 60–70% of the tracker substrate was unwound in reactions lacking competitor DNA molecule. Helicase data (% control) were expressed relative to the control reactions lacking the competitor DNA. Protein/DNA binding mixtures (10 μl) contained the indicated concentrations of RPA and 0.5 nm of the specified 32P-end-labeled DNA substrate in the same reaction buffer as that used for helicase assays but lacking ATP. The binding mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min after the addition of RPA. After incubation, 10 μl of Loading dye (25% glycerol, 18 mm EDTA, 0.04% xylene cyanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue) was added to each mixture, and samples were loaded onto native 6% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 125 V for 3 h at 4 °C using 1× TBE as the Running buffer. The resolved radiolabeled species were visualized using a PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Increasing concentrations of FANCJ helicase were incubated with a fork duplex DNA substrate harboring a single thymine glycol positioned in either the top (translocating) or bottom strand (nontranslocating) within the double-stranded region of a forked duplex DNA substrate (Table 1). As a control, a forked duplex of identical sequence without a thymine glycol base damage in either strand was tested for FANCJ helicase activity. The control undamaged DNA substrate was unwound by FANCJ in a protein concentration-dependent manner throughout a titration range of 0.0375–0.6 nm FANCJ monomer (Fig. 1). Fifty percent of the substrate was unwound at 0.6 nm FANCJ. At greater concentrations of FANCJ, more substrate was unwound; however, the percent unwinding began to plateau, presumably due to substrate depletion effects. Throughout the FANCJ titration, significantly lower percentages of the forked duplex substrate with a thymine glycol in either the translocating or nontranslocating strands were unwound compared with the control DNA substrate. For example, only 13% of the substrate with a thymine glycol in the translocating strand was unwound at 0.6 nm FANCJ compared with 50% of the control substrate unwound. At 0.3 nm FANCJ, 10% of the damaged substrate was unwound compared with 40% of the control substrate. Although significant inhibition of unwinding by the translocating strand thymine glycol was observed at the lower FANCJ concentrations, increasing the FANCJ concentration to 19.2 nm resulted in nearly 70% of the damaged substrate unwound, indicating that the inhibition could be overcome to some extent by elevated FANCJ concentration. For the DNA substrate with a thymine glycol in the nontranslocating strand, FANCJ helicase activity was inhibited to a significantly greater extent throughout the helicase titration range compared with the undamaged substrate (Fig. 1). For example, at 0.6 nm FANCJ, only 5% of the substrate with the nontranslocating strand thymine glycol was unwound, indicating potent inhibition. Even at the 19.2 nm FANCJ concentration, only 43% of the substrate with the nontranslocating strand thymine glycol was unwound. These results demonstrate that FANCJ is sensitive to a single thymine glycol located in either the translocating or nontranslocating strand of the duplex region of the DNA substrate. The inhibition of FANCJ DNA unwinding by a thymine glycol in either the translocating or nontranslocating strand of the duplex raised the question if other helicases are inhibited in a similar manner or if FANCJ is uniquely sensitive to the base damage in either strand of the substrate. To address this issue, we first tested the SF2 5′ to 3′ Escherichia coli DNA helicase DinG (32.Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28284-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which has significant sequence homology to FANCJ in the seven ATPase/helicase motifs of the helicase core domain (7.Cantor S.B. Bell D.W. Ganesan S. Kass E.M. Drapkin R. Grossman S. Wahrer D.C. Sgroi D.C. Lane W.S. Haber D.A. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) as well as the conserved iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster domain (33.Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, considerably greater concentrations of DinG compared with FANCJ were required to detect unwinding of the control substrate, consistent with earlier published results for DinG helicase activity on similar DNA substrates (25.Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18437-18447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). DinG was only mildly affected by the thymine glycol in either strand of the duplex substrate throughout the DinG protein titration. The greatest difference, ∼1.4-fold, was observed at a DinG concentration of 375 nm. Unlike FANCJ, no significant difference in DNA unwinding by DinG was observed between the substrates harboring thymine glycol in either the top or bottom strands of the DNA substrate, and overall DinG helicase activity was resistant to inhibition by the thymine glycol in either strand. We next examined DNA unwinding of the thymine glycol substrate and control substrate by DnaB, an SF3 5′- to 3′-hexameric DNA helicase in E. coli that operates at the replication fork (34.Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Unlike FANCJ, DnaB was insensitive to the thymine glycol in either strand of the substrate throughout the DnaB protein titration (Fig. 2B). Thus, neither DnaB nor DinG 5′- to 3′-helicases displayed a sensitivity to the thymine glycol adduct in either strand of the duplex that was remotely comparable with the inhibition of DNA unwinding observed for FANCJ. To further examine the apparent specificity of thymine glycol for inhibiting FANCJ unwinding, we tested several 3′- to 5′-RecQ DNA helicases implicated in the maintenance of chromosomal stability (35.Sharma S. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 36.Sharma S. Brosh Jr., R.M. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) on the DNA substrates used to analyze the unwinding activity of FANCJ, DinG, and DnaB. Three human SF2 RecQ helicases, Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM), RECQ1, and an exonuclease-deficient missense mutant version of the Werner syndrome helicase (X-WRN), were tested. BLM was strongly inhibited by the thymine glycol adduct positioned in the bottom translocating strand of the forked duplex substrate; however, greater BLM helicase activity was observed on the substrate with thymine glycol residing in the top nontranslocating strand compared with the undamaged substrate at BLM concentrations up to 1.25 nm (Fig. 2C). For RECQ1, little to no inhibition of DNA unwinding was observed when the thymine glycol was positioned in the top (nontranslocating) strand of the DNA substrate; however, inhibition of RECQ1 helicase activity throughout the RECQ1 protein titration range was observed when the thymine glycol resided in the bottom translocating strand (Fig. 2D). For X-WRN, the DNA substrate with thymine glycol in the bottom translocating strand completely blocked DNA unwinding throughout the helicase titration range (0.036–0.58 nm) (Fig. 2E). However, for the DNA substrate with the nontranslocating strand modification, X-WRN helicase activity was significantly increased throughout the protein titration range compared with the undamaged substrate (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that BLM and X-WRN helicases are strongly inhibited by the thymine glycol when the base damage exists in the translocating strand. RECQ1 was also inhibited by the translocating strand thymine glycol, but not as severely as BLM or X-WRN. Unlike FANCJ, all three human RecQ helicases were not inhibited by the nontranslocating strand thymine glycol. In fact, DNA unwinding by all concentrations of X-WRN or the lower concentrations of BLM was greater on the DNA substrate with thymine glycol in the nontranslocating strand compared with undamaged substrate. Finally, we tested the bacterial SF1 3′- to 5′-UvrD helicase implicated in mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair (37.Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), a"
https://openalex.org/W2077141717,"Palmitoylation of the yeast vacuolar protein Vac8 is important for its role in membrane-mediated events such as vacuole fusion. It has been established both in vivo and in vitro that Vac8 is palmitoylated by the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) protein Pfa3. However, the determinants of Vac8 critical for recognition by Pfa3 have yet to be elucidated. This is of particular importance because of the lack of a consensus sequence for palmitoylation. Here we show that Pfa3 was capable of palmitoylating each of the three N-terminal cysteines of Vac8 and that this reaction was most efficient when Vac8 is N-myristoylated. Additionally, when we analyzed the Src homology 4 (SH4) domain of Vac8 independent of the rest of the protein, palmitoylation by Pfa3 still occurred. However, the specificity of palmitoylation seen for the full-length protein was lost, and the SH4 domain was palmitoylated by all five of the yeast DHHC proteins tested. These data suggested that a region of the protein C-terminal to the SH4 domain was important for conferring specificity of palmitoylation. This was confirmed by use of a chimeric protein in which the SH4 domain of Vac8 was swapped for that of Meh1, another palmitoylated and N-myristoylated protein in yeast. In this case we saw specificity mimic that of wild type Vac8. Competition experiments revealed that the 11th armadillo repeat of Vac8 is an important element for recognition by Pfa3. This demonstrates that regions distant from the palmitoylated cysteines are important for recognition by DHHC proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2151896857,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has been demonstrated to interact with multiple proteins involved in several metabolic pathways such as DNA replication and repair. However, there have been fewer reports about whether these PCNA-binding proteins influence stability of PCNA. Here, we observed a physical interaction between PCNA and MutT homolog2 (MTH2), a new member of the MutT-related proteins that hydrolyzes 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP). In several unstressed human cancer cell lines and in normal human fibroblast cells, PCNA and MTH2 formed a complex and their mutual binding fragments were confirmed. It was intriguing that PCNA and MTH2 were dissociated dependent on acetylation of PCNA, which in turn induced degradation of PCNA in response to UV irradiation, but not in response to other forms of DNA-damaging stress. To further explore the link between dissociation of PCNA-MTH2 and degradation of PCNA, RNAi against MTH2 was performed to mimic the dissociated status of PCNA to evaluate changes in the half-life of PCNA. Knockdown of MTH2 significantly promoted degradation of PCNA, suggesting that the physiological interaction of PCNA-MTH2 may confer protection from degradation for PCNA, whereas UV irradiation accelerates PCNA degradation by inducing dissociation of PCNA-MTH2. Moreover, secondary to degradation of PCNA, UV-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis or cell cycle progression was enhanced.

Because PCNA is essential for DNA synthesis both in DNA replication and repair, a dynamic balance between PCNA synthesis and degradation is critical for maintaining normal DNA synthesis. Up-regulation of PCNA accelerates DNA synthesis and promotes cell proliferation, such that PCNA is regarded as a general proliferation marker in tumor development. On the other hand, degradation of PCNA leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis (9.Prelich G. Kostura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 21.Engel F.B. Hauck L. Boehm M. Nabel E.G. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this case, in response to inhibition of DNA synthesis by PCNA degradation, both cell proliferation and DNA repair are inhibited, and cells are thus subject to death. In Escherichia coli, MutT protein encoded by the mutT gene has 8-oxo-dGTPase activity, and hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP, which is nonutilizable for DNA synthesis, thus preventing misincorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA (22.Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). 8-Oxo-dGTP is a product of dGTP oxidation and can be inserted into opposite dA or dC residues of template DNA at almost equal efficiencies. As a result, G:C to T:A or T:A to G:C transversion mutations occur (22.Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 23.Shibutani S. Takeshita M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a mutT-deficient strain, the rate of spontaneous occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion increases by 1000-fold compared with that of cells with wild type mutT (25.Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 26.Akiyama M. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, MutT protein is required for preventing mutations and maintaining high fidelity of DNA replication (28.Sekiguchi M. Tsuzuki T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8895-8904Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, RibA is a backup enzyme for MutT in E. coli and also plays a role in maintaining high fidelity of DNA replication (29.Kobayashi M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Hayakawa H. Sekiguchi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26394-26399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The MutT homologue MTH1 is the first MutT-related protein found in mammalian cells (30.Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spontaneous mutation frequency in MTH1-deficient cells showed an increase of ∼2-fold as compared with that in wild type MTH1 cells (31.Tsuzuki T. Egashira A. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Nakatsuru Y. Tominaga Y. Kawate H. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Ide F. Kura S. Nakabeppu Y. Katsuki M. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Comparing the mutation frequency in mutT-deficient E. coli cells with that in MTH1-deficient mammalian cells suggests that there must be other proteins responsible for preventing occurrence of high numbers of oxidative damage induced mutations in mammalian cells. By searching the GenBankTM EST data base, our research group and others (32.Cai J.P. Ishibashi T. Takagi Y. Hayakawa H. Sekiguchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have cloned a new member of MutT-related protein, MTH2. The increased mutation frequency in mutT-deficient cells was significantly reduced by overexpression of MTH2 cDNA (32.Cai J.P. Ishibashi T. Takagi Y. Hayakawa H. Sekiguchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, MTH2 may help to ensure cells achieve accurate DNA synthesis. However, aside from the activity of 8-oxo-dGTPase, the exact mechanism by which MTH2 influences DNA synthesis has not been explored. The functions of both PCNA and MTH2 partially overlap in DNA synthesis, thus warranting exploration of whether MTH2 works together with PCNA to regulate DNA replication or repair. In this study, we found that MTH2 directly interacts with PCNA, and this interaction enhances PCNA stability. However, when cells were exposed to UV light, the interaction of MTH2 and PCNA was disrupted, and PCNA degradation was accelerated. Consequently, DNA synthesis was reduced, and cell cycling was arrested. Human lung cancer cell lines A549, H1299, H719 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an appropriate amount of penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator. Human lung diploid fibroblast cells (2BS) or human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum). Cells were plated 24 h prior to UV treatment. Cells were irradiated at the indicated doses with a UV lamp (253.7 nm), and then fresh medium was changed for incubation at 37 °C for 3 to 24 h. Protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting as previously described (33.Zhu W.G. Lakshmanan R.R. Beal M.D. Otterson G.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1327-1333PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used were anti-PCNA, -α-tubulin, -histone-H3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetyl-lysine, -phosphotyrosine, -phosphoserine, -phosphothreonine (Upstate), anti-Flag (Sigma), anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-MTH2 (a kind gift from Dr. Mutsuo Sekiguchi, mouse origin). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (34.Zhao Y. Lu S. Wu L. Chai G. Wang H. Chen Y. Sun J. Yu Y. Zhou W. Zheng Q. Wu M. Otterson G.A. Zhu W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell extract was incubated with antibodies on ice for 1 h. Agarose A/G was washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, and a 1% mixture of protease inhibitors), and then added to the samples, which were then rolled at 4 °C for 1 h. After the beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, the pellets were dissolved into 2× SDS loading buffer after centrifugation and boiled 5 min at 100 °C. The protein was analyzed by Western blotting with various antibodies. Cells were rinsed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES at pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min on ice, and the cells were then scraped and centrifuged. The supernatant was the Triton-extractable fraction, and the pellet was then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated. After centrifuging, the supernatant was Triton-resistant. GST-MTH2 or GST-PCNA fusion protein plasmids were generated by inserting MTH2 or PCNA segments into the vector pGEX-4T-2 with BamHI and XhoI (New England Biolabs). pECFP-PCNA or pEYFP- MTH2 was constructed by inserting PCNA or MTH2 segments into the vector pECFP or pEYFP with XhoI and BamHI. Flag-tagged PCNA plasmid was generated by inserting wild-type PCNA into the vector of p3×FLAG- CMV-10. Flag-PCNA mutants was generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's directions. GST or GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (Tiangen Biotechnology, Beijing, China), induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C and purified following the protocol from Amersham Biosciences. Equal amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, and the beads were then washed three times with TEN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl). Total cell extracts from A549 cells were added to the beads and incubated by rocking at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with TENT buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 300 mm NaCl), and then dissolved into 2× SDS loading buffer after centrifugation and boiled 5 min at 100 °C. After centrifuging, the supernatant was extracted and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to PCNA and MTH2. Plasmid pHPCNA15 (a kind gift from Dr. Moshe Szyf) was linearized with ClaI. Linear pHPCNA15 was purified and used for in vitro translation employing T7 RNA polymerase (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated protein was detected by Western blotting. Both pECFP-PCNA and pEYFP-MTH2 were transfected into HEK293T cells. After 48 h, cells were observed under a TCS SP2 confocal microscope, and the FRET assay was performed with TCS SP2 confocal software (Leica, Germany). Plasmids (pECFP-PCNA, pEYFP-MTH2, p3×FLAG-CMV-PCNA) were transfected into HEK293T cells by use of the Qiagen Effectene Transfection kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA for MTH2 or PCNA (GeneChem, Shanghai, China) was transfected into A549 cells by use of a Lipofectamine 2000 kit (Invitrogen) for 48 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine the efficiency of siRNA, total protein was extracted for Western blotting using anti-MTH2 or anti-PCNA. MTH2 siRNA: cccagccaucauuuaucuutt; PCNA siRNA: ccuuggcgcuaguauuugatt. DNA synthesis was assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Cells were plated onto a 6-well plate 24 h prior to experiments. [3H]Thymidine was added (1 μCi/ml) for 12 h, and DNA was precipitated with cold trichloroacetic acid (50%). The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble DNA was placed on a glass microfiber filter (Whatman, Maidstone, England) and washed twice with cold trichloroacetic acid (5%) and then washed once with ethanol or acetone. After air drying the glass filter, it was put into a vial for counting radioactivity (Beckman LS 5000 Liquid Scintillation Counter). Cell cycle analysis was performed as described previously (35.Wang H. Zhao Y. Li L. McNutt M.A. Wu L. Lu S. Yu Y. Zhou W. Feng J. Chai G. Yang Y. Zhu W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2564-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). UV-irradiated or MTH2-knocked down A549 cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide. The samples were analyzed with flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur) using BD CellQuest software. A549 cells were plated on coverslips and grown to 50% confluence. After the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature for 15 min, they were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 5 min and blocked with 10% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with 1:20 dilution of anti-8-oxo-dG overnight at 4 °C and then with a 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 2 h. Images were captured with TCS SP2 confocal microscopy (Leica, Germany). The fluorescence value was quantified with TCS SP2 confocal software. To explore the relationship between PCNA and MTH2, we first tested whether PCNA interacts with MTH2 using the co-immunoprecipitation assay. Endogenous PCNA was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-MTH2 from cell lysates of several human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, and H719), human lung diploid fibroblast cells (2BS), and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T). It was of interest to observe that PCNA and MTH2 formed a complex in vivo (Fig. 1A). Next, to confirm whether the interaction was a direct interaction, a GST pull-down assay was carried out in vitro using bacterially expressed proteins. Wild-type PCNA translated in vitro (Fig. 1B, upper panel) was incubated with a full-length GST-MTH2 fusion protein (Fig. 1B, middle panel), and Western blotting was then performed with anti-PCNA. As shown in Fig. 1B (lower panel), PCNA formed a complex with GST-MTH2 fusion protein in vitro. To further map regions of interaction, PCNA and MTH2 were divided into three fragments to perform GST pull-down in A549 cells. Results showed that the 76–165-amino acid region of MTH2 (Fig. 1C) and 7–100-amino acid region of PCNA (Fig. 1D) are the fragments involved in the interaction of PCNA and MTH2. Although the antibody of MTH2 was produced from mouse MTH2 cDNA, it can effectively detect human MTH2 assayed with purified protein in vitro or by RNAi in vivo (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). These results suggested that PCNA physiologically interacts with MTH2 in cells. To investigate the effect of DNA-damaging stresses on the PCNA-MTH2 complex, A549 cells were treated with UV, x-ray, H2O2, or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR, a DNA demethylating agent that causes DNA damage) (35.Wang H. Zhao Y. Li L. McNutt M.A. Wu L. Lu S. Yu Y. Zhou W. Feng J. Chai G. Yang Y. Zhu W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2564-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36.Zhu W.G. Hileman T. Ke Y. Wang P. Lu S. Duan W. Dai Z. Tong T. Villalona-Calero M.A. Plass C. Otterson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and co-immunoprecipitation assays were then performed. It was a surprise to find that PCNA co-immunoprecipitated with anti-MTH2 was markedly decreased in UV-treated cells (Fig. 2A), and this result was dependent on UV dose or UV treatment time (Fig. 2E). For example, compared with untreated cells, the interaction of these proteins was decreased 1.3-fold at a dose of 23 J/m2 and 3.7-fold at a dose of 46 J/m2 in UV-irradiated cells as determined by Western blot band intensity measurement (Fig. 2E, left lower column diagram). In addition, at 3 h after UV irradiation the interaction of these proteins was decreased 2.3-fold, and at 6 h 5.5-fold (Fig. 2E, right lower column diagram). It is interesting that there were no obvious changes in the interaction of these proteins in cells treated with x-ray, H2O2, or 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 2, B–D), which shows that UV treatment may have a unique capacity to induce a decrease in the interaction of PCNA-MTH2. To investigate whether the decrease in interaction between PCNA and MTH2 is due to dissociation of these proteins or down-regulation of individual protein expression, Western blotting and RT-PCR were performed to evaluate expression of PCNA and MTH2 (respectively). Results showed that levels of both proteins and mRNA were sustained almost without change within a period of 6 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 2, F and G), indicating that UV irradiation led to reduced MTH2/PCNA association and not to a decrease in the level of either protein. In addition, the FRET assay was performed to confirm the occurrence of dissociation of PCNA and MTH2 in response to UV treatment. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing ECFP-PCNA and EYFP-MTH2. In this assay, the acceptor photobleaching technique was used to compare the emission of the donor fluorophore (ECFP-PCNA) before and after photobleaching of the acceptor fluorophore (EYFP-MTH2) within both ROI 1 and ROI 2 (ROI, region of interest). The images on the left panels of Fig. 3, A and B show the fluorescence of EYFP-MTH2 and ECFP-PCNA before photobleaching. In unstressed cells, after photobleaching of both ROI 1 and ROI 2 of the acceptor (upper right panel, Fig. 3A), the fluorescence of the donor in the ROIs was markedly enhanced (lower right panel, Fig. 3A), demonstrating that FRET had occurred between PCNA and MTH2. However, in UV-treated cells, after both ROI 1 and ROI 2 of the acceptor were photobleached (upper right panel, Fig. 3B), the fluorescence of the donor in the ROIs showed no obvious change (lower right panel, Fig. 3B), suggesting that FRET was weakened between these two proteins. Statistically, the energy transfer efficiency was obviously decreased in UV-irradiated HEK293T cells as compared with that in untreated cells (Fig. 3C). These data clearly demonstrate that the interaction between PCNA and MTH2 was disrupted in response to UV irradiation. Both acetylation and phosphorylation have been reported to be related to the PCNA function (37.Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20194-20199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38.Wang S.C. Nakajima Y. Yu Y.L. Xia W. Chen C.T. Yang C.C. McIntush E.W. Li L.Y. Hawke D.H. Kobayashi R. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which raises a question as to whether post-translational modification of PCNA is involved in UV-induced dissociation. To evaluate this question, cell lysate from A549 cells was first co-immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphoserine, or anti-phosphothreonine, and Western blotting was carried out with anti-PCNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, we did not observe an obvious change in PCNA phosphorylation at tyrosine, serine, or threonine sites. However, UV led to significant acetylation of PCNA (Fig. 4B), and the acetylation was sustained for up to 24 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 4C). In addition, to test the specificity of these antibodies, A549 cells and A431 cells were treated with various stimuli. 5-aza-CdR and x-ray were shown to induce phosphorylation of p53 serine or phosphorylation of p53 threonine in A549 cells (35.Wang H. Zhao Y. Li L. McNutt M.A. Wu L. Lu S. Yu Y. Zhou W. Feng J. Chai G. Yang Y. Zhu W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2564-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was shown to stimulate the phosphotyrosine of pp85 (39.Cohen B. Yoakim M. Piwnica-Worms H. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4458-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Depsipeptide (a HDAC inhibitor) was shown to induce the acetylation of p53 lysine (34.Zhao Y. Lu S. Wu L. Chai G. Wang H. Chen Y. Sun J. Yu Y. Zhou W. Zheng Q. Wu M. Otterson G.A. Zhu W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D, these stimuli significantly induced post-translational modifications of p53 at these sites which were tested, demonstrating that acetylation is a unique modification of PCNA in response to UV treatment. To test whether modification of PCNA by acetylation is related to dissociation of these proteins, A549 cells were treated with TSA (Trichostatin A, a HDAC inhibitor) to mimic protein acetylation status, and a co-immunoprecipitation assay was carried out. Results showed that TSA also induced acetylation of PCNA (Fig. 5A), and dissociation of these proteins followed (Fig. 5B). However, the level of the two proteins was sustained in TSA-treated cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, to identify which acetylation site is critical for the interaction of these two proteins, several site-directed mutants of PCNA were established. As PCNA binds to MTH2 via its N terminus (including Lys-13, Lys-14, Lys-20, Lys-77, Lys-80), Flag-tagged wild-type and various mutants of PCNA (mutated Lys-13, Lys-14, Lys-20, Lys-77, or Lys-80) was generated and transfected in HEK293T cells. However, it was found that UV irradiation did not induce an obvious increase in PCNAK14R acetylation as compared with that of wild-type PCNA (Fig. 5D). Consequently, UV could not lead to the dissociation of PCNAK14R and MTH2 (Fig. 5E), indicating that acetylation of PCNA at Lys-14 may play a key role in regulating interaction of MTH2 and PCNA. PCNA is a highly conserved protein and its half-life is comparatively long. For example, in NIH/3T3 cells, the reported half-life of PCNA is 20 h (40.Bravo R. Macdonald-Bravo H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). When cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was added into the medium at 25 μg/ml for up to 24 h, the expression levels of PCNA remained unchanged in A549 cells (Fig. 6A, upper panel). However, in response to UV irradiation, the half-life of PCNA was obviously shortened after a lag time (Fig. 6A, middle panel). For example, the level of PCNA did not obviously change in the initial time period (∼6 h) after UV irradiation. However, the PCNA level was decreased to 58.7% at 12 h and further decreased to 21.4% at 24 h as compared with the level of PCNA immediately after UV irradiation (0 h) (Fig. 6B). Because the PCNA mRNA level was not changed in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 6E), it is likely that UV irradiation accelerates degradation of PCNA. To determine whether there is a link between UV-induced dissociation of these proteins and UV-induced degradation of PCNA, the half-life of PCNA in TSA-treated or MTH2-knocked down A549 cells was also evaluated. A similar result was obtained in the TSA-treated cells, in which the half-life of PCNA was shortened to 12–24 h (Fig. 6, A, lower panel and B). Subseque"
https://openalex.org/W2033833483,"The detachment of epithelial cells from the basal matrix during wound healing and differentiation of keratinocytes requires the disassembly of the hemidesmosomal multiprotein adhesion complex. Integrin alpha6beta4-plectin interaction plays a major role in the formation of hemidesmosomes, and thus the mechanisms regulating this interaction should be critical also for the disassembly process. Here we show that a particular plectin isoform (1a) interacts with the Ca(2+)-sensing protein calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. As a result of this interaction, binding of the hemidesmosome-associated plectin isoform 1a to integrin beta4 is substantially diminished. Calmodulin-binding inhibits also the interaction of plectin with F-actin. Further, we found that, during Ca(2+)-induced keratinocyte differentiation, plectin 1a is first relocated within the cell and later down-regulated, suggesting that Ca(2+) affects the fate of plectin 1a upon its release from hemidesmosomes. We propose a novel model for the disassembly of hemidesmosomes during keratinocyte differentiation, where both, binding of calmodulin to plectin 1a and phosphorylation of integrin beta4 by protein kinases, are required for disruption of the integrin alpha6beta4-plectin complex."

Fungi are known to tolerate a large range of chemicals of natural or anthropogenic origin by developing mechanisms to act on xenobiotic and natural compounds (5.Tortella G.R. Diez M.C. Duran N. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 31: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6.Stadler M. Keller N.P. Mycol. Res. 2008; 112: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fungi are therefore good models to identify and to understand tolerance mechanisms to xenobiotics (7.Teeri T.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 8.Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, characterization of the mechanisms by which fungi tolerate certain toxic xenobiotics can potentially lead to the identification of new targets for the treatment of fungal infections in vertebrates (7.Teeri T.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 8.Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K.

Diez M.C. Duran N. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 31: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9.D'Annibale A. Rosetto F. Leonardi V. Federici F. Petruccioli M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using the common ascomycete Podospora anserina as a model, we provide here the demonstration that a single enzyme can mediate tolerance to toxic AA chemicals in a eukaryotic species. This enzyme was identified and characterized as an arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT), a xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme that acetylates efficiently several toxic AA. Targeted disruption of this NAT gene led to the complete loss of tolerance to AA, thus confirming that this enzyme enables the fungus to detoxify AA that would otherwise prove toxic. These findings will help to understand the enzymatic mechanisms contributing to adaptation of living organisms to their environment. In particular, our data demonstrate that the NAT-dependent detoxification mechanisms may provide a eukaryotic organism with tolerance to toxic AA. Moreover, we provide proof-of-principle experiments, using soils contaminated with the highly toxic pesticide residue 3,4-dichloroaniline, proving that the fungal NAT-dependent detoxification pathway may represent a novel model with reasonable cost and a low environmental impact for the bioremediation of AA-contaminated environments. The S strain of P. anserina was used for all experiments. The culture conditions for this organism have been described elsewhere (10.Rizet G. Rev. Cytol. Biol. Veg. 1952; 13: 51-92Google Scholar). The methods currently used for genetic analysis, the extraction of nucleic acids and proteins, and genetic transformation are available from the Podospora anserina Genome Project. P. anserina was grown in the well defined M2 synthetic medium providing the wild-type (WT) strain with optimal growth conditions. Phenotypic analyses were performed on WT and mutant (ΔPaNat1, ΔPaNat2 single mutants, and ΔPaNat1/2 double mutants) P. anserina strains. The vegetative part of the life cycle was investigated in laboratory conditions by assessing growth rate and mycelial morphology: that is, the presence or absence of aerial hyphae and accumulation of pigments, as described for other mutants (11.Malagnac F. Klapholz B. Silar P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Senescence and other types of cell degeneration were evaluated by measuring life span and investigating “crippled growth,” as described previously (12.Silar P. Haedens V. Rossignol M. Lalucque H. Genetics. 1999; 151: 87-95PubMed Google Scholar). Hyphal interference was evaluated by placing P. anserina mycelia in the presence of Penicillium chrysogenum and Coprinopsis cinerea (13.Silar P. Mycol. Res. 2005; 109: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Completion of the sexual cycle was investigated by measuring male and female fertility, perithecium maturation and content, and the timing of ascospore germination (11.Malagnac F. Klapholz B. Silar P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The acetylated forms of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), and 4-butoxyaniline (4-BOA) were synthesized from 3,4-DCA, 2-AF, and 4-BOA (Sigma) using acetic acid chloride in the presence of triethylamine (base). Column chromatography purification was carried out on silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh American Society for Testing and Materials, Merck). The structure of all compounds was confirmed by IR and NMR spectra. IR spectra were obtained in paraffin oil with a ATI Mattson Genesis Series Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrometer; 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, in CDCl3, on a BRUKER AC 200 spectrometer using hexamethyldisiloxane as an internal standard. Yields of acetylated products were around 80%. Escherichia coli C41 (DE3) cells containing pET-28A-based plasmids encoding PaNat1 or PaNat2 were used to produce and purify His6-tagged recombinant proteins. The purified PaNat1 and PaNat2 enzymes were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol before dialysis against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Yields of recombinant proteins were in general 15–20 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. An antibody raised against the Salmonella typhimurium NAT enzyme was used to detect the purified recombinant PaNat1 and PaNat2 proteins (14.Rodrigues-Lima F. Dairou J. Diaz C.L. Rubio M.C. Sim E. Spaink H.P. Dupret J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The null ΔPaNat1 and ΔPaNat2 alleles were constructed separately, using the approaches indicated in supplemental Fig. 1. The native PaNat1 and PaNat2 genes were replaced by recombinant defective alleles in which all or most of the coding sequences were replaced by the hygromycin B- and phleomycin-selectable markers, respectively. Tests carried out with the hygromycin B- and phleomycin-resistant strains obtained after transformation of the WT with the marker genes showed that neither of these genes interfered with resistance/sensitivity to AA. Independent hygromycin B- or phleomycin-resistant transformants were tested for homologous integration of the defective alleles at the PaNat1 and PaNat2 loci by appropriate PCR and Southern blot analyses (see supplemental Fig. 1). ΔPaNat1/2 double mutants were recovered from the progenies of crosses between ΔPaNat1 mutants and ΔPaNat2 mutants of opposite mating types. The ΔPaNat2 mutation was complemented by cotransforming the ΔPaNat2 mutant with a PCR-amplified DNA fragment encompassing the PaNat2 gene and the pBC-hygro vector (15.Silar P. Fungal Genet. Newslett. 1995; 42: 73Google Scholar). Six of the 16 transformants tested were resistant to AA, whereas none was resistant in the control transformation carried out with the vector only in the absence of the PaNat2 gene. Genetic analysis of four randomly picked transformants showed that resistance to AA cosegregated with the hygromycin B resistance marker, confirming that the restoration of AA resistance was due to the introduced PaNat2 gene. Fungi were grown for 2 days at 27 °C in M2 liquid medium supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml yeast extract. The fungal mass was then harvested under sterile conditions by filtration. Typically ∼1.5 g of fungal dry mass was obtained from each 100-ml culture. Total extracts were prepared by grinding fungal pellets in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. The resulting suspensions were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were removed and used for enzyme assays. WT or ΔPaNat1/2 mutant P. anserina (1.5 g of fungal dry mass) was grown in 25 ml of M2 medium broth in the presence or absence of DCA (400 μm) for 2 days at 27 °C. The medium was centrifuged and filtered (0.22-μm pores) and used for the preparation of agar plates (50% conditioned medium). Sterilized Lactuca sativa seeds were germinated on agar plates and photographed after 7 days (room temperature, illumination for 12 h/day). For the remediation of 3,4-DCA (25 mg/kg) contamination in soil (Terre Végétale NF-U44-551, Truffaut, Paris), soil samples (3 g) were inoculated with WT or ΔPaNat1/2 mutant P. anserina (0.3 or 0.9 g of fungal dry mass) and incubated for 2 days at 25 °C. Aliquots (0.5 g) of soil were mixed with absolute ethanol at different time points for the quantification of 3,4-DCA and acetyl-3,4-DCA by HPLC. For the germination and growth of L. sativa seeds in soil, contaminated soil samples (20 g/pot, 80 mg/kg of 3,4-DCA) were inoculated three times (every 24 h) with 0.5 g of WT or ΔPaNat1/2 strains and incubated for 72 h at 25 °C. Seeds (20.Sim E. Walters K. Boukouvala S. Drug Metab. Rev. 2008; 40: 479-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were then sown in soil samples and allowed to germinate and grow at 25 °C for 8 days (illumination for 12 h/day). Controls were carried out with acetyl-3,4-DCA (80 mg/kg) and H2O. NAT activity was measured in the 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay, as described previously (16.Brooke E.W. Davies S.G. Mulvaney A.W. Pompeo F. Sim E. Vickers R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant enzymes and aromatic amine substrates (500 μm final concentration) in assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) were incubated for 5 min at 37°C in a 96-well plate. AcCoA (400 μm final concentration) was added, and the plate was incubated at 37°C (for up to 30 min). The reaction (100 μl total volume) was quenched with 25 μl of guanidine hydrochloride solution (6.4 m guanidine/HCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Kinetic analyses were performed by varying the aromatic amine substrate concentrations. Kinetic constants were determined by non-linear regression analysis, with the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The rate of acetylation of aromatic amines by fungal extracts was measured by HPLC, as described previously (17.Dupret J.M. Grant D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7381-7385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetylated aromatic amines were detected in samples (M2 liquid medium) or ethanol eluates of soil by HPLC on a C18 column, using 60% sodium perchlorate (20 mm, pH 3) and 40% acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Chemically acetylated AAs (acetylated 3,4-DCA; acetylated 2AF, and acetylated BOA) were synthesized as reported above and used as HPLC standards to identify enzymatically acetylated AAs in samples. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments, with quadruplicate assays for each experiment. Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between means. Significance was defined as a p ≤ 0.05. AA are an important class of chemicals that are used in the manufacturing of pesticides, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. AA are also found in tobacco smoke and food pyrolysis products (18.Hein D.W. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 112–113: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Many AA are toxic for living organisms, and several AA are recognized as carcinogens. It has been suggested that certain soil fungi can detoxify and tolerate toxic AA (19.Tixier C. Sancelme M. Aït-Aïssa S. Widehem P. Bonnemoy F. Cuer A. Truffaut N. Veschambre H. Chemosphere. 2002; 46: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, fungal models are of interest to identify and understand mechanisms responsible for tolerance to toxic AA in eukaryotic organisms (7.Teeri T.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 8.Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Four well known fungal species (Fusarium graminearum, Phycomyces blakesleeanus, P. anserina, and Rhizopus oryzae) from different ecosystems, for which complete genome sequences were available, were screened for radial growth in the presence of three toxic AA: 3,4-DCA (pesticide residue), 2-AF (carcinogen), and 4-BOA (chemical intermediate) (14.Rodrigues-Lima F. Dairou J. Diaz C.L. Rubio M.C. Sim E. Spaink H.P. Dupret J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The growth of R. oryzae and P. blakesleeanus was almost completely abolished by these three AA at concentrations of 100–250 μm in standard minimal growth medium. In the same conditions, little effect on growth was observed in the other two species studied (P. anserina and F. graminearum) (data not shown), suggesting that these two species have mechanisms of tolerance to AA. We aimed to decipher the mechanisms underlying fungal survival in AA-contaminated environments. Tolerance to potentially toxic xenobiotics often depends on specific biotransformation pathways catalyzed by endogenous enzymes, and in particular, xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme, such as cytochrome P-450 varieties or glutathione S-transferases. AA may be biotransformed via several routes involving different types of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme, in particular, arylamine NATs (20.Sim E. Walters K. Boukouvala S. Drug Metab. Rev. 2008; 40: 479-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, NAT enzymes have long been known to biotransform AA (20.Sim E. Walters K. Boukouvala S. Drug Metab. Rev. 2008; 40: 479-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear what role NAT enzymes actually play in either preventing or enhancing toxic response to AA (21.Sugamori K.S. Brenneman D. Grant D.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). So far, the studies on the knock-out NAT mouse models (21.Sugamori K.S. Brenneman D. Grant D.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22.Sugamori K.S. Wong S. Gaedigk A. Yu V. Abramovici H. Rozmahel R. Grant D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23.Cornish V.A. Pinter K. Boukouvala S. Johnson N. Labrousse C. Payton M. Priddle H. Smith A.J. Sim E. Pharmacogenomics J. 2003; 3: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have not demonstrated clearly the relevance of this pathway to AA tolerance in living organisms. BLAST analysis indicated that P. anserina had two putative NAT enzymes and that F. graminearum had three such enzymes, whereas the two sensitive fungi had no genes encoding NAT enzymes (see supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). A broader BLAST screening of the complete genome sequences of eumycete fungi showed that many of these fungi had NAT genes (see supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). We investigated the possible role of these genes in AA tolerance, focusing on the filamentous ascomycete P. anserina, which is highly tolerant to 2-AF, 3,4-DCA, and 4-BOA and amenable to reverse genetics techniques. The two NAT genes present in the genome of P. anserina (24.Espagne E. Lespinet O. Malagnac F. Da Silva C. Jaillon O. Porcel B.M. Couloux A. Aury J.M. Ségurens B. Poulain J. Anthouard V. Grossetete S.

Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R77Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) encode two putative NAT enzymes, PaNat1 and PaNat2 (Coding Sequence Regions (CDS) numbers: Pa_2_13150 and Pa_4_4860, respectively). These genes are expressed as an expressed sequence tag was identified for each of these genes in the data base (Podospora anserina Genome Project). The P. anserina PaNat1 and PaNat2 genes encode two polypeptides, which, at 333 and 303 amino acids in length, are larger than any previously described NAT enzyme (20.Sim E. Walters K. Boukouvala S. Drug Metab. Rev. 2008; 40: 479-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The P. anserina NATs contain all the known NAT-specific functional motifs (25.Rodrigues-Lima F. Dupret J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses (see supplemental Fig. 2) showed the percentage of identity between the P. anserina NAT isoforms (32%) to be lower than that between NAT isoforms in any other eukaryotic species (67–94%). This unusually low level of identity between two paralogous eukaryotic NAT enzymes may reflect functional divergence (26.Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The percentage of identity between the two P. anserina NAT and the other predicted fungal NAT proteins were found to range from 15% (with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis NAT) to 55% (with Chaetomium globosum NAT1 and NAT2) (supplemental Fig. 2). PaNAT1 and PaNAT2 were found to share around 30% identity with a newly characterized NAT isoform (called FDB2) from Fusarium verticilloides, which is involved in benzoxazolinone metabolism (27.Glenn A.E. Bacon C.W. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). When compared with characterized mammalian NAT enzymes such as human NAT1 and NAT2, identities were found to be around 25–30% (data not shown). Protein sequence identities between PaNAT1 and PaNAT2 and known bacterial NAT enzymes such as the Mycobacterium smegmatis or S. typhimurium NAT isoforms were around 15–20% (data not shown). Predicted fungal NAT enzymes and the mammalian and bacterial isoforms also differ in their protein sequence lengths (supplemental Fig. 2). Almost all mammalian and bacterial NAT enzymes identified so far are less than 295 amino acids long (28.Martins M. Pluvinage B. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Barbault F. Dairou J. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the contrary, all fungal NAT identified in this study (including PaNAT1 and PaNAT2) range between 303 and 387 amino acids (supplemental Fig. 2). So far, no NAT enzyme has been identified in plants. We purified recombinant P. anserina NAT isoforms and showed that they were readily detected with an anti-NAT antibody (supplemental Fig. 3). We further characterized the purified P. anserina NATs by investigating whether they catalyzed the AcCoA-dependent acetylation of several AA (Fig. 1a and Table 1). We tested a series of different substrates, including a carcinogen (2-AF), drugs (SMX, SMZ, 4-AS, 5-AS, INH, HDZ; definitions are available in Table 1), industrial chemical intermediates (4-BOA, 4-EOA, 4-PD, 4-ANS, 4-AMV; definitions are available in Table 1), and pesticide residues (4-BA, 4-IA, 3,4-DCA; definitions are available in Table 1). Kinetic parameters (Vm, kcat, and Km) were estimated for aromatic NAT substrates (14.Rodrigues-Lima F. Dairou J. Diaz C.L. Rubio M.C. Sim E. Spaink H.P. Dupret J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, b and c). P. anserina NAT enzymes were highly active against most of the AA substrates tested, with PaNat2 systematically more active than PaNat1 (Table 1 and Fig. 1, b and c). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of PaNat2 was up to 80 times higher than that of PaNat1 (Fig. 1c). The catalytic efficiency of PaNat1 with 3,4-DCA was 2.5 times higher and that of PaNat2 was five times higher than that of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa NAT, which is currently considered to be the most efficient NAT enzyme ever described, particularly with 3,4-DCA (29.Westwood I.M. Holton S.J. Rodrigues-Lima F. Dupret J.M. Bhakta S. Noble M.E. Sim E. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When compared with the two NAT isoforms from the plant symbiotic bacterium Mesorhizobium loti, the catalytic efficiency toward 3,4-DCA by PaNAT2 (kcat/Km = 17,400 m−1·s−1) was 220 and 120 times higher than that of M. loti NAT1 and M. loti NAT2, respectively (14.Rodrigues-Lima F. Dairou J. Diaz C.L. Rubio M.C. Sim E. Spaink H.P. Dupret J.M. Mol.

The phenotypes of mutants lacking either one (ΔPaNat1 or ΔPaNat2) or both (ΔPaNat1/2) NAT genes were compared with that of the WT strain (11.Malagnac F. Klapholz B. Silar P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No obvious differences in key biological features, including growth, differentiation, defense against competitors, aging, sexual reproduction, and ascospore germination, were observed (data not shown). We then evaluated the AA tolerance of P. anserina WT and mutant strains. We first assessed AA tolerance in a minimal medium to which selected aromatic compounds (3,4-DCA, 2-AF, 4-BOA) were added. All the fungal isolates (WT and mutants) were screened by assessing radial growth for 3 days. The growth of strains lacking PaNat2 was strongly impaired in the presence of 2-AF, 3,4-DCA, or 4-BOA, whereas strains lacking PaNat1 were less affected and grew similarly to the WT (Fig. 2a). Sensitivity to AA cosegregated in crosses with the phleomycin resistance marker gene used to inactivate PaNat2, and the introduction of a PaNat2 gene by cotransformation with a hygromycin B resistance marker restored WT levels of growth in the ΔPaNat2 mutants. Hypersensitivity to AA therefore resulted from PaNat2 deletion. The WT and mutant strains grew similarly in the presence of chemically synthesized N-acetylated forms of 2-AF, 3,4-DCA, and 4-BOA (Fig. 2a). The N-acetylation of these three AA by PaNat2 therefore seems to be a key mechanism underlying tolerance to these toxic aromatic chemicals. Measurements of N-acetylation activity in various fungal extracts confirmed that 3,4-DCA, 2-AF, and 4-BOA were N-acetylated principally by PaNat2 (Fig. 2b). A low level of AA acetylation was detected with the ΔPaNat1/2 extracts (Figs. 2b and 3a). This is likely due to background acetylation by non-NAT acetyltransferases present in P. anserina. We characterized the role of PaNat2 in tolerance to AA in more detail, focusing on 3,4-DCA, a highly toxic pesticide-derived AA persistent in soil, surface water, and groundwater. This compound is the major breakdown product of the phenylamide herbicides diuron, linuron, and propanil (30.Voelker D. Stetefeld N. Schirmer K. Scholz S. Aquat. Toxicol. 2008; 86: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N-acetylated form of 3,4-DCA has been shown to be much less toxic than the parental compound (19.Tixier C. Sancelme M. Aït-Aïssa S. Widehem P. Bonnemoy F. Cuer A. Truffaut N. Veschambre H. Chemosphere. 2002; 46: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether 3,4-DCA was acetylated in vivo by WT and mutant P. anserina strains. Similar amounts of the N-acetylated form of 3,4-DCA were detected by HPLC in the liquid medium of WT and ΔPaNat1 strains grown in the presence of a toxic dose of 3,4-DCA (250 μm; Fig. 3a). By contrast, very low levels of acetyl-3,4-DCA were found in the media of strains lacking PaNat2, mainly due to the very poor growth of these strains in the presence of 3,4-DCA. Acetyl-3,4-DCA generation was time-dependent. After 3 days of incubation, 45% of the 3,4-DCA had been biotransformed into its acetylated product, 3,4-dichloroacetanilide, in WT cultures, versus 38% in ΔPaNat1 cultures and only 5% in ΔPaNat2 cultures (no significant differences were found between ΔPaNat2 and ΔPaNat1/2; Fig. 3a). No other 3,4-DCA metabolite was detected, suggesting that the PaNat2-dependent N-acetylation of 3,4-DCA was the main biotransformation pathway in vivo. Lettuce (L. sativa) seeds have been shown to be highly sensitive to 3,4-DCA (at concentrations >10 mg/kg of soil), with the complete abolition of germination and growth (31.Hulzebos E.M. Adema D.M. Dirven-van Breemen E.M. Henzen L. Van dis W.A. Herbold H.A. Hoekstra J.A. Baerselman R. Van Gestel C.A. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1993; 12: 1079-1094Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After 7 days (Fig. 3b), no seed germination was observed in 3,4-DCA-contaminated medium (200 μm) or in 3,4-DCA-contaminated medium previously incubated with the ΔPaNat1/2 strain. Conversely, seeds were able to germinate and grow in contaminated medium previously incubated with WT P. anserina. Thus, PaNat2 is sufficient for the detoxification of 3,4-DCA in vivo. These data also suggest that no toxic (at least for the seeds) fungal compound was released by P. anserina strains. P. anserina is found on herbivore dung in nature but can grow in soil in the presence of plant debris. This species reproduces by sexual means only, with mating occurring only between partners of opposite mating types (32.Silar P. Lalucque H. Haedens V. Zickler D. Picard M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 1477-1489PubMed Google Scholar). The spread of this non-pathogenic fungus is therefore easy to control, making it an attractive candidate for safe bioremediation. As proof of principle, we assessed the capacity of the NAT-dependent acetylation pathway of P. anserina to N-acetylate 3,4-DCA present in soil samples. For this purpose, we inoculated soils highly contaminated with 3,4-DCA (final concentration 25 mg/kg of soil) with WT or ΔPaNat1/2 P. anserina strains and incubated the mixtures at 25 °C for 2 days. We then extracted 3,4-DCA and its acetylated metabolites for detection by HPLC (Fig. 4a). Acetylated 3,4-DCA was readily detected in soil samples incubated with WT P. anserina. The amount of acetyl-3,4-DCA was found to depend on the amount of fungus used for soil inoculation (Fig. 4a, black and dotted lines). We found that 40% of the 3,4-DCA present could be N-acetylated within 48 h (Fig. 4b). In the same conditions, no acetylation of 3,4-DCA was detected with ΔPaNat1/2 P. anserina (Fig. 4a, dashed line, and 4b). We analyzed L. sativa seed germination and growth in 3,4-DCA-contaminated (80 mg/kg of soil) soils after incubation with WT or ΔPaNat1/2 P. anserina strains for 72 h (Fig. 4c). L. sativa seed germination and early growth were completely abolished in soils contaminated with 3,4-DCA. No seed germination or growth was observed with 3,4-DCA-contaminated soil inoculated with the ΔPaNat1/2 strain (Fig. 4c). Conversely, in contaminated soil treated with WT P. anserina, seed germination and growth were restored to the levels observed with soil treated with chemically acetylated 3,4-DCA (Fig. 4c). Thus, the inoculation of a 3,4-DCA-contaminated soil with a P. anserina strain harboring a functional NAT-dependent acetylation pathways leads, in situ, to significant detoxification of this toxic compound, making possible the germination of L. sativa seeds and the early growth of the seedlings. Concentrations around 100 μg/kg of 3,4-DCA have been reported in contaminated soils (33.Gooddy D.C. Chilton P.J. Harrison I. Sci. Total Environ. 2002; 297: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our study shows that even at higher 3,4-DCA concentrations (25 mg/kg), P. anserina mediates efficient bioremediation of this compound in soil. These results pave the way for use of the fungal NAT metabolic pathway in the bioremediation of AA pollution in soils. The potential of fungi metabolic pathways for the bioremediation of AA pollution, particularly in soils contaminated with aniline pesticide residues such as 3,4-DCA, has been little studied. Certain fungi and bacteria have nonetheless been shown to biotransform 3,4-DCA to its acetylated form (19.Tixier C. Sancelme M. Aït-Aïssa S. Widehem P. Bonnemoy F. Cuer A. Truffaut N. Veschambre H. Chemosphere. 2002; 46: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34.Giacomazzi S. Cochet N. Chemosphere. 2004; 56: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In the bacterium M. loti, a NAT isoform has been shown to acetylate 3,4-DCA (14.Rodrigues-Lima F. Dairou J. Diaz C.L. Rubio M.C. Sim E. Spaink H.P. Dupret J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In plants, glucosylation of 3,4-DCA was described, but this pathway was considered as non-effective at detoxifying this AA (35.Brazier-Hicks M. Edwards R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our results should facilitate prospective studies of AA bioremediation and the rationalization of future strategies based on the fungal NAT pathway for AA detoxification. In addition, our findings further emphasize that certain well characterized fungi may constitute a more efficient alternative model, with a reasonable cost and a low environmental impact. Studies on model fungi have provided much of our understanding of biological processes. Such models also help to understand the general mechanisms by which living organisms protect themselves against potentially toxic effects of natural products or xenobiotics present in their environment (7.Teeri T.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 8.Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The NAT-dependent xenobiotic biotransformation pathway is found in many organisms ranging from bacteria to humans (26.Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of this pathway to AA tolerance in living organisms has remained unclear. So far, studies done on knock-out NAT mouse models have not demonstrated a role for NAT enzymes in preventing AA toxicity (21.Sugamori K.S. Brenneman D. Grant D.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our P. anserina model provides the first clear molecular and functional evidence indicating that the NAT-dependent xenobiotic-biotransformation pathway can afford complete tolerance toward toxic AA in a eukaryotic organism. In addition to the existing knock-out mouse model, our P. anserina model should be helpful to uncover the potential endogenous functions of NAT enzymes. Overall, our data underline the role of certain xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in the adaptation of organisms to their chemical environment and emphasize the potential biotechnological applications of such enzymatic pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2008398360,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent inducer of cell death in several cancer cells, but many cells are resistant to TRAIL. The mechanism that determines sensitivity to TRAIL-killing is still elusive. Here we report that deletion of TAK1 kinase greatly increased activation of caspase-3 and cell death after TRAIL stimulation in keratinocytes, fibroblasts and cancer cells. Although TAK1 kinase is involved in NF-κB pathway, ablation of NF-κB did not alter sensitivity to TRAIL. We found that TRAIL could induce accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when TAK1 was deleted. Furthermore, we found that TAK1 deletion induced TRAIL-dependent downregulation of cIAP, which enhanced activation of caspase-3. These results show that TAK1 deletion facilitates TRAIL-induced cell death by activating caspase through ROS and downregulation of cIAP. Thus, inhibition of TAK1 can be an effective approach to increase TRAIL sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2116391100,"The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and a key molecule in the regulation of energy homeostasis. At least 159 substitutions in the coding region of human MC4R (hMC4R) have been described experimentally; over 80 of those occur naturally, and many have been implicated in obesity. However, assessment of the presumably functionally essential residues remains incomplete. Here we have performed a complete in silico mutagenesis analysis to assess the functional essentiality of all possible nonnative point mutants in the entire hMC4R protein (332 residues). We applied SNAP, which is a method for quantifying functional consequences of single amino acid (AA) substitutions, to calculate the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the hMC4R AA sequence. We compiled a mutability score that reflects the degree to which a particular residue is likely to be functionally important. We performed the same experiment for a paralogue human melanocortin receptor (hMC1R) and a mouse orthologue (mMC4R) in order to compare computational evaluations of highly related sequences. Three results are most salient: 1) our predictions largely agree with the available experimental annotations; 2) this analysis identified several AAs that are likely to be functionally critical, but have not yet been studied experimentally; and 3) the differential analysis of the receptors implicates a number of residues as specifically important to MC4Rs vs. other GPCRs, such as hMC1R."
https://openalex.org/W2017162649,"Almost all of the chlorine-containing gas emitted from natural sources is methyl chloride (CH(3)Cl), which contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. Tropical and subtropical plants emit substantial amounts of CH(3)Cl. A gene involved in CH(3)Cl emission from Arabidopsis was previously identified and designated HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER (hereafter AtHOL1) based on the mutant phenotype. Our previous studies demonstrated that AtHOL1 and its homologs, AtHOL2 and AtHOL3, have S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activities. However, the physiological functions of AtHOLs have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, our comparative kinetic analyses with possible physiological substrates indicated that all of the AtHOLs have low activities toward chloride. AtHOL1 was highly reactive to thiocyanate (NCS(-)), a pseudohalide, synthesizing methylthiocyanate (CH(3)SCN) with a very high k(cat)/K(m) value. We demonstrated in vivo that substantial amounts of NCS(-) were synthesized upon tissue damage in Arabidopsis and that NCS(-) was largely derived from myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates. Analyses with the T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis mutants (hol1, hol2, and hol3) revealed that only hol1 showed increased sensitivity to NCS(-) in medium and a concomitant lack of CH(3)SCN synthesis upon tissue damage. Bacterial growth assays indicated that the conversion of NCS(-) into CH(3)SCN dramatically increased antibacterial activities against Arabidopsis pathogens that normally invade the wound site. Furthermore, hol1 seedlings showed an increased susceptibility toward an Arabidopsis pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. Here we propose that AtHOL1 is involved in glucosinolate metabolism and defense against phytopathogens. Moreover, CH(3)Cl synthesized by AtHOL1 could be considered a byproduct of NCS(-) metabolism."

Transmembrane TLRs, localized to endosomes, and cytoplasmic RNA helicases bind viral nucleic acids and initiate distinct intracellular signaling pathways to produce type I interferons (IFNs), thereby mounting antiviral responses (1.Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Matsumoto K. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Foy E. Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Akira S. Yonehara S. Kato A. Fujita T. J.

TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 respond to nucleic acids in endosomes, whereas RIG-I and MDA-5 bind cytoplasmic nucleic acids from RNA viruses. Thus, TLRs and RIG-I-like helicases provide immune protection against distinct viruses (3.Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J.

Regarding the subcellular localization of nucleic acid-binding TLRs, it has been shown that the large parts of TLR3 and TLR9 are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum with stimulus-dependent translocation to endosomes (5.Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat.

Due to their homology with TLR9, TLR7 (in mice) and TLR8 (in humans) are also believed to bind viral nucleic acids present in endosomes. The relative importance and involvement of TLRs and RIG-I like helicases are cell type-specific (7.Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells appear to utilize the TLR system, whereas, for example, fibroblasts, macrophages, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells signal through the RNA helicase RIG-I.RIG-I and MDA-5 contain an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) that associates with the CARD-containing mitochondrial protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) (also called VISA, Cardif, or IPS-1; see Ref. 8.Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Both the CARD domain and mitochondrial anchoring domain of MAVS have been shown to be essential for antiviral signaling events that activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IFN-β production (9.Seth R.B.

TBK1 is a noncanonical IκB-kinase-related kinase that phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF-3, thus integrating signaling from both endosomal and cytosolic receptors recognizing viral RNA or DNA (10.Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 11.Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H.

Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). TLR-dependent induction of type I IFNs in response to viral infections occurs through the adapter protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) (TLR7/8 and TLR9) or TRIF (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β) (TLR3). It was recently shown that IFN-β production and NF-κB activation through TLRs are mediated by TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-3) and TRAF6, respectively (14.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 15.Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). TRAF3-mediated activation of TBK1 and IRF-3 is necessary for RIG-I/MAVS-dependent IFN-β induction (14.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H.

Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Hence, different TLR adapters and either TRAF3 or TRAF6 regulate signal specificity and gene transcription.The Src family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulate diverse arrays of cellular responses, including immune responses, integrin signaling, motility, and carcinogenesis. We have previously shown that the tyrosine kinase c-Src is implicated in double-stranded RNA-elicited TLR3-dependent activation of the transcription factors IRF-3 and STAT1. Moreover, we found that c-Src acted downstream of the TLR3 adapter protein TRIF. In this study, we have investigated if c-Src also contributes to TLR-independent antiviral responses mediated through RIG-I. Our results show that c-Src enhances RIG-I-mediated signaling to IRF-3 activation and production of antiviral proteins. Moreover, we show that c-Src associates with the RING domain of TRAF3, thus providing a molecular explanation for its involvement in both RIG-I and TLR-dependent signaling.DISCUSSIONDetection of pathogenic nucleic acids by the innate immune system is brought about by several components, including transmembrane TLRs, the interferon-induced enzyme RNA-activated protein kinase R, the cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I, and the DNA-binding sensor DAI (26.Takaoka A. Wang Z. Choi M.K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Ban T. Lu Y. Miyagishi M. Kodama T. Honda K. Ohba Y. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2007; 448: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that impairment of c-Src function by either pharmacological inhibition, expression of a kinase-inactive c-Src mutant, or genetic knock-out strategies effectively suppress SV-stimulated, RIG-I-dependent transcriptional activation of IRF-3 and lead to reduced expression of the IRF-3 target genes IFN-β and IP10. This suggests that c-Src participation in antiviral immune mechanisms is of biological significance, regulating IFN-β and the chemokine IP10 that control activation and migration of immune cells during viral infections. In conjunction with our previous results (6.Johnsen I.B. Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), these results show that c-Src contributes to distinct antiviral signaling pathways emanating from different pathogen recognition receptors, which suggests that c-Src may play a broader role in innate defense mechanisms against diverse viruses.Concerning the location of c-Src in the signaling pathway from RIG-I to IRF-3, we found that enforced expression of RIG-I and its adapter protein MAVS (to bypass RIG-I activation) induced IRF-3-dependent gene expression that was effectively suppressed by impaired c-Src function (following c-Src siRNA depletion or expression of kinase-defective c-Src). Hence, these results further suggest that c-Src acts downstream of RIG-I and MAVS. Recently, TRAF3 was found to be a critical intermediary molecule that integrates TLR-dependent and -independent IFN production and antiviral responses (14.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 15.Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Since our previous (6.Johnsen I.B. Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and present data showed that c-Src contributes to both TLR-dependent and -independent signaling and associates with TRAF3 upon infection with SV, we sought to gain mechanistic insight into molecular determinants of the TRAF3-c-Src association. We found that c-Src associated with TRAF3 mutants that contained the N-terminal RING and zinc finger domains (lacking the coiled-coil and TRAF domains), whereas it failed to interact with different N-terminal truncation mutants that lacked the RING domain (while encompassing the coiled-coil, zinc finger, and TRAF motifs). This suggests that the RING domain of TRAF3 directs interaction with c-Src. Conversely, we found that the TRAF domain was sufficient for binding of TRAF3 to MAVS (Fig. 9C). These results corroborate previous data demonstrating that MAVS contains a TRAF interaction motif that governs association to the TRAF domain of TRAF3 (25.Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these results demonstrate functional specificity of different TRAF3 domains in antiviral signaling mediated by MAVS and c-Src.Numerous studies have indicated that an important step downstream of PRRs is the assembly of multicomponent signaling complexes that activate critical kinases. These signaling complexes serve as structural platforms to assemble downstream signaling molecules. The complexes have been shown to contain TRIF or MAVS (depending pathogenic agent), TANK (TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator), and TRAF3 and have been suggested to stimulate the IRF-3-phosphorylating kinase TBK1 (27.Guo B. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11817-11826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28.Ryzhakov G. Randow F. Embo J. 2007; 26: 3180-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that c-Src physically associated with MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1, suggesting that c-Src is organized into IRF-3-activating signaling complexes. Moreover, wild-type c-Src acted synergistically with MAVS and TRAF3 in IRF-3 activation, whereas kinase-inactive c-Src had no effect on MAVS- and TRAF3-stimulated IRF-3. In addition, activating phosphorylation of c-Src was enhanced by co-transfection of MAVS and TRAF3. Taken together, this indicates a functional relationship between MAVS, TRAF3, and c-Src in that IRF-3-activating complexes entail MAVS, TRAF3, and c-Src and that the presence of MAVS and TRAF3 augments c-Src activation. Concerning the functional outcome of c-Src involvement, it is possible that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation might modulate protein-protein interactions through distinct modular domains in target proteins that may promote recruitment of antiviral signaling components to regulate the activity of TBK1 (directly or indirectly). It has also been suggested that alternative kinases are implicated in IRF-3 activation through phosphorylation of IRF-3 residues other than those targeted by TBK1 (29.Saitoh T. Tun-Kyi A. Ryo A. Yamamoto M. Finn G. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Lu K.P. Yamaoka S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 30.Clément J.F. Bibeau-Poirier A. Gravel S.P. Grandvaux N. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Servant M.J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3984-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, c-Src may modulate activation of such kinases. In this regard, it could be mentioned that we have previously found that c-Src mediates TLR3-elicited Akt activation but not p38 and p42/44 MAP kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (6.Johnsen I.B. Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that c-Src activates distinct pathways downstream of TLRs. Interestingly, the scaffold protein TANK was recently shown to be subject to phosphorylation and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination (31.Gatot J.S. Gioia R. Chau T.L. Patrascu F. Warnier M. Close P. Chapelle J.P. Muraille E. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Piette J. Dejardin E. Chariot A. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, TRAF3 was recently reported to become ubiquitinated, presumably through lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains that recruit the kinase TBK1 (32.Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R.

It is generally believed that ligand binding to TRAF-associating receptors induces TRAF oligomerization that leads to lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of target proteins. This promotes protein-protein interactions and activation of the kinase TAK1 in the NF-κB signaling pathway and recruits TBK1 to TRAF3 in the IRF-3 pathway (32.Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R. Quan C. O'Rourke K.M. Eby M. Pietras E. Cheng G. Bazan J.F. Zhang Z. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33.Gao M. Karin M.

Interestingly, TRAF3 has been suggested to function as a regulator of protein kinases that control IFN-producing pathways (34.Schneider K. Benedict C.A. Ware C.F. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Specifically, TRAF3 interacts with several nonrelated kinases: the IRF-3 phosphorylating kinases TBK1 and IKKϵ; IRAK1, which acts in MyD88-dependent TLR pathways; NIK, which activates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway; and protein kinase R, which binds viral double-stranded RNA. Although NIK has been shown to interact with TRAF3 through the TRAF domain (35.Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms responsible for TRAF3 binding to TBK1, IKKϵ, IRAK1, and protein kinase R are not known. In this study, we present novel results showing that c-Src binds to TRAF3 through the TRAF3 RING domain, thus illustrating that different modular domains link NIK and c-Src to TRAF3 function. Hence, TRAF3 may function as a scaffold protein that recruits kinases (e.g. c-Src), which mediates phosphorylation-dependent posttranslational modifications of proteins critical for IRF-3 activation, such as ubiquitination. In this connection, phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been found to mutually regulate each other through several distinct mechanisms (36.Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results provide further insight into the role of c-Src in sensing of pathogenic RNA and contribute to increased understanding of the IRF-3 regulatory pathway. As such, our results may have implications for antiviral strategies. Sensing of viral infections by the innate immune system depends on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), 2The abbreviations used are: PRRpattern recognition receptorIFNinterferonTLRToll-like receptorSVSendai virusCARDcaspase recruitment domainGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseIRFinterferon regulatory factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNASYFSrc/Yes/FynqRTquantitative real timeHAUhemagglutination units.2The abbreviations used are: PRRpattern recognition receptorIFNinterferonTLRToll-like receptorSVSendai virusCARDcaspase recruitment domainGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseIRFinterferon regulatory factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNASYFSrc/Yes/FynqRTquantitative real timeHAUhemagglutination units. such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the DEX(D/H) box RNA helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5). Transmembrane TLRs, localized to endosomes, and cytoplasmic RNA helicases bind viral nucleic acids and initiate distinct intracellular signaling pathways to produce type I interferons (IFNs), thereby mounting antiviral responses (1.Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Matsumoto K. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Foy E. Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Akira S. Yonehara S. Kato A. Fujita T. J.

TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 respond to nucleic acids in endosomes, whereas RIG-I and MDA-5 bind cytoplasmic nucleic acids from RNA viruses. Thus, TLRs and RIG-I-like helicases provide immune protection against distinct viruses (3.Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J.

Regarding the subcellular localization of nucleic acid-binding TLRs, it has been shown that the large parts of TLR3 and TLR9 are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum with stimulus-dependent translocation to endosomes (5.Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat.

Due to their homology with TLR9, TLR7 (in mice) and TLR8 (in humans) are also believed to bind viral nucleic acids present in endosomes. The relative importance and involvement of TLRs and RIG-I like helicases are cell type-specific (7.Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T.

RIG-I and MDA-5 contain an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) that associates with the CARD-containing mitochondrial protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) (also called VISA, Cardif, or IPS-1; see Ref. 8.Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Both the CARD domain and mitochondrial anchoring domain of MAVS have been shown to be essential for antiviral signaling events that activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IFN-β production (9.Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Binding of viral nucleic acids to TLRs or to DEX(D/H) box RNA helicases in endosomes or cytosol stimulates recruitment of specific adapter proteins and signaling components that induce intracellular signaling pathways converging on TBK1 (TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1). TBK1 is a noncanonical IκB-kinase-related kinase that phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF-3, thus integrating signaling from both endosomal and cytosolic receptors recognizing viral RNA or DNA (10.Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 11.Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). IRF-3, along with NF-κB, is critical for transcription of type I interferons (12.Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). TLRs may associate with different cytoplasmic Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapters (13.O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). TLR-dependent induction of type I IFNs in response to viral infections occurs through the adapter protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) (TLR7/8 and TLR9) or TRIF (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β) (TLR3). It was recently shown that IFN-β production and NF-κB activation through TLRs are mediated by TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-3) and TRAF6, respectively (14.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 15.Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). TRAF3-mediated activation of TBK1 and IRF-3 is necessary for RIG-I/MAVS-dependent IFN-β induction (14.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 15.Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Hence, different TLR adapters and either TRAF3 or TRAF6 regulate signal specificity and gene transcription. The Src family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulate diverse arrays of cellular responses, including immune responses, integrin signaling, motility, and carcinogenesis. We have previously shown that the tyrosine kinase c-Src is implicated in double-stranded RNA-elicited TLR3-dependent activation of the transcription factors IRF-3 and STAT1. Moreover, we found that c-Src acted downstream of the TLR3 adapter protein TRIF. In this study, we have investigated if c-Src also contributes to TLR-independent antiviral responses mediated through RIG-I. Our results show that c-Src enhances RIG-I-mediated signaling to IRF-3 activation and production of antiviral proteins. Moreover, we show that c-Src associates with the RING domain of TRAF3, thus providing a molecular explanation for its involvement in both RIG-I and TLR-dependent signaling. DISCUSSIONDetection of pathogenic nucleic acids by the innate immune system is brought about by several components, including transmembrane TLRs, the interferon-induced enzyme RNA-activated protein kinase R, the cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I, and the DNA-binding sensor DAI (26.Takaoka A. Wang Z. Choi M.K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Ban T. Lu Y. Miyagishi M. Kodama T. Honda K. Ohba Y. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2007; 448: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that impairment of c-Src function by either pharmacological inhibition, expression of a kinase-inactive c-Src mutant, or genetic knock-out strategies effectively suppress SV-stimulated, RIG-I-dependent transcriptional activation of IRF-3 and lead to reduced expression of the IRF-3 target genes IFN-β and IP10. This suggests that c-Src participation in antiviral immune mechanisms is of biological significance, regulating IFN-β and the chemokine IP10 that control activation and migration of immune cells during viral infections. In conjunction with our previous results (6.Johnsen I.B. Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), these results show that c-Src contributes to distinct antiviral signaling pathways emanating from different pathogen recognition receptors, which suggests that c-Src may play a broader role in innate defense mechanisms against diverse viruses.Concerning the location of c-Src in the signaling pathway from RIG-I to IRF-3, we found that enforced expression of RIG-I and its adapter protein MAVS (to bypass RIG-I activation) induced IRF-3-dependent gene expression that was effectively suppressed by impaired c-Src function (following c-Src siRNA depletion or expression of kinase-defective c-Src). Hence, these results further suggest that c-Src acts downstream of RIG-I and MAVS. Recently, TRAF3 was found to be a critical intermediary molecule that integrates TLR-dependent and -independent IFN production and antiviral responses (14.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 15.Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Since our previous (6.Johnsen I.B. Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and present data showed that c-Src contributes to both TLR-dependent and -independent signaling and associates with TRAF3 upon infection with SV, we sought to gain mechanistic insight into molecular determinants of the TRAF3-c-Src association. We found that c-Src associated with TRAF3 mutants that contained the N-terminal RING and zinc finger domains (lacking the coiled-coil and TRAF domains), whereas it failed to interact with different N-terminal truncation mutants that lacked the RING domain (while encompassing the coiled-coil, zinc finger, and TRAF motifs). This suggests that the RING domain of TRAF3 directs interaction with c-Src. Conversely, we found that the TRAF domain was sufficient for binding of TRAF3 to MAVS (Fig. 9C). These results corroborate previous data demonstrating that MAVS contains a TRAF interaction motif that governs association to the TRAF domain of TRAF3 (25.Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these results demonstrate functional specificity of different TRAF3 domains in antiviral signaling mediated by MAVS and c-Src.Numerous studies have indicated that an important step downstream of PRRs is the assembly of multicomponent signaling complexes that activate critical kinases. These signaling complexes serve as structural platforms to assemble downstream signaling molecules. The complexes have been shown to contain TRIF or MAVS (depending pathogenic agent), TANK (TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator), and TRAF3 and have been suggested to stimulate the IRF-3-phosphorylating kinase TBK1 (27.Guo B. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11817-11826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28.Ryzhakov G. Randow F. Embo J. 2007; 26: 3180-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that c-Src physically associated with MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1, suggesting that c-Src is organized into IRF-3-activating signaling complexes. Moreover, wild-type c-Src acted synergistically with MAVS and TRAF3 in IRF-3 activation, whereas kinase-inactive c-Src had no effect on MAVS- and TRAF3-stimulated IRF-3. In addition, activating phosphorylation of c-Src was enhanced by co-transfection of MAVS and TRAF3. Taken together, this indicates a functional relationship between MAVS, TRAF3, and c-Src in that IRF-3-activating complexes entail MAVS, TRAF3, and c-Src and that the presence of MAVS and TRAF3 augments c-Src activation. Concerning the functional outcome of c-Src involvement, it is possible that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation might modulate protein-protein interactions through distinct modular domains in target proteins that may promote recruitment of antiviral signaling components to regulate the activity of TBK1 (directly or indirectly). It has also been suggested that alternative kinases are implicated in IRF-3 activation through phosphorylation of IRF-3 residues other than those targeted by TBK1 (29.Saitoh T. Tun-Kyi A. Ryo A.

Grandvaux N. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Servant M.J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3984-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, c-Src may modulate activation of such kinases. In this regard, it could be mentioned that we have previously found that c-Src mediates TLR3-elicited Akt activation but not p38 and p42/44 MAP kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (6.Johnsen I.B.

This demonstrates that c-Src activates distinct pathways downstream of TLRs. Interestingly, the scaffold protein TANK was recently shown to be subject to phosphorylation and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination (31.Gatot J.S. Gioia R. Chau T.L. Patrascu F. Warnier M. Close P.

Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. Embo J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that c-Src activates distinct pathways downstream of TLRs. Interestingly, the scaffold protein TANK was recently shown to be subject to phosphorylation and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination (31.Gatot J.S. Gioia R. Chau T.L. Patrascu F. Warnier M. Close P. Chapelle J.P. Muraille E. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Piette J. Dejardin E. Chariot A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31131-31146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), thus illustrating the complexity of IRF-3 regulatory mechanisms. Regarding assembly of multiprotein complexes involving TRAF3 and c-Src, it is presently not clear how TRAF3 is activated and conveys signaling to IRF-3. Nevertheless, TRAF3 was recently reported to become ubiquitinated, presumably through lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains that recruit the kinase TBK1 (32.Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R. Quan C. O'Rourke K.M. Eby M. Pietras E. Cheng G. Bazan J.F. Zhang Z. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that ligand binding to TRAF-associating receptors induces TRAF oligomerization that leads to lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of target proteins. This promotes protein-protein interactions and activation of the kinase TAK1 in the NF-κB signaling pathway and recruits TBK1 to TRAF3 in the IRF-3 pathway (32.Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R. Quan C. O'Rourke K.M. Eby M. Pietras E. Cheng G. Bazan J.F. Zhang Z. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33.Gao M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 581-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRAF3 has been suggested to function as a regulator of protein kinases that control IFN-producing pathways (34.Schneider K. Benedict C.A. Ware C.F. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Specifically, TRAF3 interacts with several nonrelated kinases: the IRF-3 phosphorylating kinases TBK1 and IKKϵ; IRAK1, which acts in MyD88-dependent TLR pathways; NIK, which activates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway; and protein kinase R, which binds viral double-stranded RNA. Although NIK has been shown to interact with TRAF3 through the TRAF domain (35.Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms responsible for TRAF3 binding to TBK1, IKKϵ, IRAK1, and protein kinase R are not known. In this study, we present novel results showing that c-Src binds to TRAF3 through the TRAF3 RING domain, thus illustrating that different modular domains link NIK and c-Src to TRAF3 function. Hence, TRAF3 may function as a scaffold protein that recruits kinases (e.g. c-Src), which mediates phosphorylation-dependent posttranslational modifications of proteins critical for IRF-3 activation, such as ubiquitination. In this connection, phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been found to mutually regulate each other through several distinct mechanisms (36.Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results provide further insight into the role of c-Src in sensing of pathogenic RNA and contribute to increased understanding of the IRF-3 regulatory pathway. As such, our results may have implications for antiviral strategies. We thank Veslemøy Malm Landsem and Mari Sæther for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2024812079,"We used single molecule dynamic force spectroscopy to unfold individual serine/threonine antiporters SteT from Bacillus subtilis. The unfolding force patterns revealed interactions and energy barriers that stabilized structural segments of SteT. Substrate binding did not establish strong localized interactions but appeared to be facilitated by the formation of weak interactions with several structural segments. Upon substrate binding, all energy barriers of the antiporter changed thereby describing the transition from brittle mechanical properties of SteT in the unbound state to structurally flexible conformations in the substrate-bound state. The lifetime of the unbound state was much shorter than that of the substrate-bound state. This leads to the conclusion that the unbound state of SteT shows a reduced conformational flexibility to facilitate specific substrate binding and a reduced kinetic stability to enable rapid switching to the bound state. In contrast, the bound state of SteT showed an increased conformational flexibility and kinetic stability such as required to enable transport of substrate across the cell membrane. This result supports the working model of antiporters in which alternate substrate access from one to the other membrane surface occurs in the substrate-bound state."
https://openalex.org/W1984926897,"Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs."
https://openalex.org/W2075110269,"Malic enzyme has a dimer of dimers quaternary structure in which the dimer interface associates more tightly than the tetramer interface. In addition, the enzyme has distinct active sites within each subunit. The mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD(P)-ME) isoform behaves cooperatively and allosterically and exhibits a quaternary structure in dimer-tetramer equilibrium. The cytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzyme (c-NADP-ME) isoform is noncooperative and nonallosteric and exists as a stable tetramer. In this study, we analyze the essential factors governing the quaternary structure stability for human c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME. Site-directed mutagenesis at the dimer and tetramer interfaces was employed to generate a series of dimers of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME. Size distribution analysis demonstrated that human c-NADP-ME exists mainly as a tetramer, whereas human m-NAD(P)-ME exists as a mixture of dimers and tetramers. Kinetic data indicated that the enzyme activity of c-NADP-ME is not affected by disruption of the interface. There are no significant differences in the kinetic properties between AB and AD dimers, and the dimeric form of c-NADP-ME is as active as tetramers. In contrast, disrupting the interface of m-NAD(P)-ME causes the enzyme to be less active than wild type and to become less cooperative for malate binding; the kcat values of mutants decreased with increasing Kd,24 values, indicating that the dissociation of subunits at the dimer or tetramer interfaces significantly affects the enzyme activity. The above results suggest that the tetramer is required for a fully functional m-NAD(P)-ME. Taken together, the analytical ultracentrifugation data and the kinetic analysis of these interface mutants demonstrate the differential role of tetramer organization for the c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME isoforms.

Malic enzymes catalyze a reversible oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to yield pyruvate and CO2 with reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. This reaction requires a divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for catalysis (1.Hsu R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 43: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2.Frenkel R. Curr. Top.

In mammals, malic enzymes have been divided into three isoforms according to their cofactor specificity and subcellular localization as follows: cytosolic NADP+-dependent (c-NADP-ME), 2The abbreviations used are: c-NADP-MEcytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzymeMEmalic enzymem-NADP-MEmitochondrial NADP+-dependent malic enzymem-NAD(P)-MEmitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzymeWTwild type. mitochondrial NADP+-dependent (m-NADP-ME), and mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent (m-NAD(P)-ME). The m-NAD(P)-ME isoform displays dual cofactor specificity; it can use both NAD+ and NADP+ as the coenzyme, but NAD+ is more favored in a physiological environment (6.Loeber G. Infante A.A.

Dissimilar to the other two isoforms, m-NAD(P)-ME binds malate cooperatively, and it can be allosterically activated by fumarate; the sigmoidal kinetics observed with cooperativity is abolished by fumarate (9.Moreadith R.W.

The overall tertiary structures of these malic enzymes are similar, but there are still some differences that may be significant for catalysis and regulation of the enzyme. Malic enzyme exists as a dimer of dimers with a stronger association of the dimer interface than that of the tetramer interface (Fig. 1A). The dimer interface is formed by subunits A and B or C and D (Fig. 1B), whereas the tetramer interaction consists of contacts between subunits A and D or B and C (Fig. 1C). A hydrophobic interaction is the major driving force for subunit assembly, but hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions also contribute markedly. The homotetramer of the enzyme is composed of four identical monomers each with its own active site. In the structure of human m-NAD(P)-ME, aside from its well defined active site, there are two regulatory sites on the enzyme (Fig. 1A). One of these sites is located at the dimer interface and is occupied by fumarate (Fig. 1B), whereas the other site, which is referred to as the exo site, is located at the tetramer interface and is occupied by either an NAD or an ATP molecule (Fig. 1A). In the ME family, Ascaris suum and human m-NAD(P)-ME were found to be activated by fumarate (11.Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L.

Previous studies have shown that the quaternary structure stability of malic enzyme isoforms is diverse. At neutral pH, pigeon c-NADP-ME exists as a unique tetramer with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼10 S (33.Chang H.C. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. J. Biol.

Although the crystal structure of human c-NADP-ME has not been resolved, it is believed that it is similar to pigeon c-NADP-ME. Here we analyze the essential factors governing quaternary structure stability for human c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME. Site-directed mutagenesis at the dimer and tetramer interfaces was used to disrupt the tetramer organization to create a series of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME dimers. Combined with the analytical ultracentrifugation data and kinetic analysis of these interface mutants, we demonstrate the differential role of tetramer organization for the c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME isoforms. The regulatory mechanism of m-NAD(P)-ME is highly associated with the tetramer formation of this isoform. The expression and purification protocols for human m-NAD(P)-ME have been described in previous reports (4.Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6.Loeber G. Infante A.A. Maurer-Fogy I. Krystek E. Dworkin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, m-NAD(P)-ME was subcloned into the expression vector (pRH281) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for overexpression using the inducible trp promoter system. The enzyme was purified by chromatography through an anionic exchange, DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column, followed by an ATP-agarose affinity column (Sigma). c-NADP-ME was subcloned into the pET21b vector, which carries a C-terminal His6 tag sequence. This ampicillin-resistant vector was transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli. Expression was controlled by an inducible T7 promoter system. The overexpressed enzyme was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Sigma). The lysate/nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was washed with buffer (10 mm imidazole, 500 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) to remove unwanted proteins. Desired c-NADP-ME was recovered from the resin with elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 500 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The purified enzyme was dialyzed and concentrated in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore, Billerica, MA) with a molecular mass cutoff of 30 kDa. Enzyme purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford method (38.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to construct the mutated human c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME plasmids. The purified DNA of human c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME was used as a template for PCRs along with specific primers containing the desired codons and high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase. The primers, including the desired mutation sites, were about 25–45 nucleotides in length, which is considered necessary for binding specifically to template DNA. After 16–18 temperature cycles, the mutated plasmids, including staggered nicks, were complete. The PCR products were subsequently treated with DpnI to digest the wild-type human malic enzyme templates. Finally, the nicked DNA with desired mutations was transformed into the XL-1 E. coli strain, and their DNA sequences were checked by autosequencing. The malic enzyme reaction was measured by tracing NADH or NADPH production. The reaction mixture contained saturated concentrations of NAD+ or NADP+, l-malate, and MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The absorbance at 340 nm was continuously monitored at 30 °C with a Lambda 25 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 for NAD(P)H was employed in the calculations. Apparent Michaelis constants of the substrate and coenzymes were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate (or coenzymes) around its Km value and keeping the other components constant under saturating concentrations. Furthermore, the kcat values of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)- ME were calculated by Equation 1, kcatS−1=v/6.22/μg protein×molecular weight/60(Eq. 1) where v represents ΔA340/min; 6.22 is the millimolar absorption coefficient of NAD(P)H; 260,000 and 256,000 are the tetramer molecular weights of human c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME, respectively; and 60 is the number of seconds in 1 min. The sigmoidal curves of malate against the initial rate were fitted into the Hill Equation 2. The data were analyzed to calculate the K0.5 value, the substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity, and the Hill coefficient (h), which were utilized to evaluate the degree of cooperativity. v=Vmaxmalateh/K0.5h+malateh(Eq. 2) Data were fitted with the Sigma Plot 8.0 program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). Sedimentation velocity experiments of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples (380 μl) and buffer solutions (400 μl) were loaded into the double sector centerpiece separately and built up in a Beckman An-50 Ti rotor. Experiments were performed at 20 °C and a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm for 3.5–4 h. Protein samples were monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm in a continuous mode with a time interval of 480 s and a step size of 0.002 cm. Multiple scans of sedimentation velocity data were collected and analyzed using the software SEDFIT 9.4c (39.Schuck P. Biophys.

All size distributions were solved with a confidence level of p = 0.95, a best-fitted average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/f0), and a resolution N of 200 sedimentation coefficients between 0.1 and 20.0 S. To determine precisely the dissociation constants of malic enzyme in monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium, sedimentation velocity experiments were performed for three different enzyme concentrations. All sedimentation data were globally fitted to the dimer-tetramer equilibrium model for c-NADP-ME and monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium model for m-NAD(P)-ME using the program SEDPHAT to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) of the enzyme (41.Schuck P.

The partial specific volume of the enzyme, solvent density, and viscosity were calculated by the software program SEDNTERP (44.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelleter S.L.

The kinetic parameters of the human WT and interface mutant c-NADP-ME are shown in Table 1. The Km,NADP and Km,malate values of WT c-NADP-ME are 0.009 and 0.5 mm, respectively. There was no significant difference in Km,NADP and Km,malate among WT and interface mutants, indicating that the active site region is not affected by the mutation at the interface. The kcat value of WT c-NADP-ME was ∼110 s−1. The values for the c-NADP-ME interface mutants were in the range of 95–136 s−1. The similar kcat values for WT and mutant enzymes suggest that the catalytic activity of the enzyme was not changed by disrupting the subunit-subunit interactions.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of the human WT and interface mutant c-NADP-MEc-NADP-MEKm,NADPKm,malatekcatQuaternary structureaThe abbreviations used are as follows: T, tetramer; D, dimer; Kd,24, dissociation constant between dimer and tetramer.Kd,24mmmms−1μmWT0.0090 ± 0.00100.49 ± 0.09110.89 ± 0.9T0.062 ± 0.001Dimer interfaceH51A0.0072 ± 0.00131.10 ± 0.04109.50 ± 1.2D/T9.95 ± 0.09D90A0.0039 ± 0.00030.68 ± 0.0294.57 ± 0.5D/T1.01 ± 0.01D139A0.0048 ± 0.00070.95 ± 0.0395.53 ± 0.6D217.8 ± 1.7H51A/D90A0.0037 ± 0.00050.84 ± 0.0184.83 ± 0.8D156.3 ± 1.3H51A/D139A0.0040 ± 0.00051.03 ± 0.04105.29 ± 0.9D94.2 ± 0.8Tetramer interfaceH142A0.0040 ± 0.00030.89 ± 0.04122.72 ± 1.3D133.1 ± 1.0D568A0.0050 ± 0.00080.97 ± 0.10136.90 ± 1.4D/T0.26 ± 0.01H142A/D568A0.0042 ± 0.00050.92 ± 0.0398.03 ± 1.1D123.1 ± 1.0W572A0.0050 ± 0.00080.98 ± 0.04106.04 ± 0.9D262.4 ± 1.6a The abbreviations used are as follows: T, tetramer; D, dimer; Kd,24, dissociation constant between dimer and tetramer. Open table in a new tab The quaternary structures of human c-NADP-ME WT and the interface mutant were examined by analytical ultracentrifugation (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), and the dissociation constants between dimer and tetramer (Kd,24) for the respective enzymes were determined (Table 1). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed to analyze the differences in the size distribution among WT and mutant enzymes. The WT enzyme primarily exists as a tetramer in solution with the major peak exhibiting a Kd,24 value of 0.062 μm (Fig. 2A). At the dimer interface, Asp-139 of subunit A is hydrogen-bonded with His-51 of subunit B. Asp-90 may be involved in the electrostatic network at the dimer interface. The single mutants, D90A and H51A, existed in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium with Kd,24 values of 1.01 and 9.95 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). However, the D139A single mutant dissociated more readily according to a Kd,24 value of 217.8 μm (Fig. 2D). The double mutants, H51A/D90A and H51A/D139A, were predominantly dimeric with Kd,24 values of 156.3 and 94.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that the hydrogen bonding formed by Asp-139(A) and His-51(B) and the ion pair network involving Asp-90 at the dimer interface are crucial factors for the stability of the tetrameric enzyme. The dimer, for these dimer interface mutants, should be composed of AD or BC subunit complexes. In the tetramer interface, His-142 of subunit A is ion-paired with Asp-568 of subunit D. Trp-572 is in the C-terminal domain involved in hydrophobic interactions with another subunit at the tetramer interface. Mutation of His-142 and Asp-568 to alanine resulted in mixed quaternary structural changes. The D568A enzyme mainly behaved as a tetramer, whereas H142A was primarily in dimeric form (Fig. 3, B and C); their Kd,24 values were 0.26 and 133.1 μm, respectively. The H142A/D568A also behaved as a dimer with a Kd,24 value of 123.1 μm (Fig. 3D), representing the importance of the salt bridge between His-142(A) and Asp-568(D) in preserving the quaternary structure. The C-terminal mutant, W572A, mostly behaved as a dimer with a Kd,24 value of 262.4 μm (Fig. 3E), suggesting that a hydrophobic interaction at the tetramer interface is also essential for the stability of the holoenzyme. The dimer for these tetramer interface mutants should be composed of AB or CD subunit complexes. Distinct from c-NADP-ME, m-NAD(P)-ME binds l-malate cooperatively; the initial velocities of m-NAD(P)-ME measured in various concentrations of malate exhibited sigmoidal kinetics. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained by fitting these sigmoidal curves to the Hill equation. The half-saturation for l-malate (K0.5,malate) and the degree of cooperativity of malate (h) were estimated. Like c-NADP-ME, the Km,NAD and K0.5,malate values of the m-NAD(P)-ME interface mutant were similar to that of WT, indicating that the active site was not perturbed by the mutations. However, the kcat values of these interface mutants were less than that of WT. The kcat values of WT m-NAD(P)-ME were ∼306 and 239 s−1, with or without fumarate, respectively. The values for the m-NAD(P)-ME interface mutants ranged from 110 to 234 s−1, implying that enzyme activity was altered by disrupting the interactions at the subunit interface.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of the human WT and interface mutant m-NAD(P)-MEm-NAD(P)-MEa− indicates no fumarate; + indicates 4 mm fumarate added.Km,NADk0.5,malatekcathKd,24bKd,24 indicates dissociation constant between dimer and tetramer; Kd,12 indicates dissociation constant between monomer and dimer.Kd,12bKd,24 indicates dissociation constant between dimer and tetramer; Kd,12 indicates dissociation constant between monomer and dimer.mmmms−1μmμmWT−0.68 ± 0.1611.81 ± 0.48238.5 ± 2.32.0 ± 0.151.38 ± 0.020.25 ± 0.003+0.32 ± 0.012.76 ± 0.12306.4 ± 2.51.1 ± 0.06Dimer interfaceQ51A−0.99 ± 0.0616.35 ± 0.46139.1 ± 1.51.4 ± 0.053.28 ± 0.040.36 ± 0.004+0.51 ± 0.035.97 ± 0.25189.9 ± 1.91.0 ± 0.04E90A−0.32 ± 0.022.83 ± 0.17203.0 ± 2.31.0 ± 0.071.08 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.002+0.34 ± 0.042.95 ± 0.08210.7 ± 2.61.0 ± 0.03Q51A/E90A−0.45 ± 0.027.23 ± 0.35140.1 ± 1.51.1 ± 0.057.73 ± 0.060.09 ± 0.001+0.43 ± 0.026.36 ± 0.30143.3 ± 1.21.0 ± 0.04D139A−1.06 ± 0.0523.31 ± 1.81114.5 ± 1.01.1 ± 0.0715.92 ± 0.201.87 ± 0.024−+0.76 ± 0.079.70 ± 1.43115.4 ± 1.61.0 ± 0.12Tetramer interfaceH142A−0.82 ± 0.0318.84 ± 0.76117.9 ± 1.31.3 ± 0.058.75 ± 0.103.63 ± 0.04+0.47 ± 0.028.06 ± 0.76139.9 ± 1.91.0 ± 0.08D568A−1.82 ± 0.1228.54 ± 2.13124.0 ± 1.21.3 ± 0.0812.59 ± 0.160.57 ± 0.007−+0.85 ± 0.0813.08 ± 2.39139.6 ± 1.61.0 ± 0.12H142A/D568A−1.39 ± 0.7329.00 ± 1.72112.8 ± 1.51.3 ± 0.0611.61 ± 0.1813.06 ± 0.20+0.72 ± 0.0510.55 ± 1.09127.4 ± 2.01.0 ± 0.06P567A−0.87 ± 0.0521.10 ± 1.03141.1 ± 1.21.4 ± 0.07NDcND indicates not determined.+0.51 ± 0.026.80 ± 0.41164.4 ± 1.31.0 ± 0.05NDY570A−1.07 ± 0.0421.75 ± 0.51141.9 ± 1.11.4 ± 0.0412.6 ± 0.100.89 ± 0.007+0.58 ± 0.038.33 ± 0.54165.7 ± 1.41.0 ± 0.06W572A−1.01 ± 0.0120.49 ± 0.84150.4 ± 1.81.3 ± 0.04ND+0.54 ± 0.026.54 ± 0.31181.9 ± 1.31.0 ± 0.05NDP573A−1.20 ± 0.1021.08 ± 0.65150.2 ± 1.51.5 ± 0.06ND+0.59 ± 0.036.97 ± 0.71167.1 ± 1.41.0 ± 0.09NDP579A−0.79 ± 0.1813.88 ± 0.37234.3 ± 2.11.7 ± 0.08ND+0.39 ± 0.023.86 ± 0.32284.1 ± 2.51.0 ± 0.08NDP580A−0.95 ± 0.1713.32 ± 0.46196.5 ± 2.01.6 ± 0.082.92 ± 0.030.85 ± 0.01+0.40 ± 0.023.18 ± 0.17211.6 ± 2.31.2 ± 0.07V581A−0.83 ± 0.0913.37 ± 0.60205.8 ± 2.81.6 ± 0.10ND+0.40 ± 0.042.98 ± 0.14234.4 ± 2.11.0 ± 0.05NDa − indicates no fumarate; + indicates 4 mm fumarate added.b Kd,24 indicates dissociation constant between dimer and tetramer; Kd,12 indicates dissociation constant between monomer and dimer.c ND indicates not determined. Open table in a new tab The h value for WT m-NAD(P)-ME is approximately 2; however, the h value was significantly reduced for the interface mutants. Most mutations at the dimer interface had an h value close to 1, indicating that cooperativity was diminished by interruption of the dimer interface. The mutations at the tetramer interface had h values of 1.3 and 1.7, suggesting that the cooperativity was partially maintained for these mutant enzymes even when the tetramer interface was disrupted. With fumarate, the Km,NAD and K0.5,malate of most of the interface mutant enzymes is reduced; the kcat values of some mutant enzymes can be raised, and the h value can be reduced to 1, indicating that allosteric regulation by fumarate is functioning for some interface mutants. The dimer interface mutants E90A, Q51A/E90A, and D139A are not activated by fumarate, and their h values were near 1, indicating that they have become noncooperative and nonallosteric enzymes. The size distribution of human m-NAD(P)- ME WT and interface mutant is shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6. Becausethe WT and interface mutant may exhibit monomer-dimer or dimer-tetramer behavior (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6), the dissociation constants between dimer and tetramer forms (Kd,24) or monomer and dimer forms (Kd,12) were determined (Table 2). The WT enzyme chiefly existed in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium with little monomer present; the Kd,24 and Kd,12 values were 1.38 and 0.25 μm, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similar to c-NADP-ME, the dimer interface of m-NAD(P)-ME positions Asp-139 of subunit A in a hydrogen bond with Gln-51 of subunit B, and Glu-90 may be involved in electrostatic interactions. Mutating these amino acid residues caused the enzyme to be dissociated. The E90A enzyme, similar to WT, also existed in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium with little monomer observable; the Kd,24 and Kd,12 values were 1.08 and 0.22 μm, respectively (Fig. 4C). The D139A single mutant was significantly dissociated into monomers and dimers with Kd,24 and Kd,12 values of 15.9 and 1.87 μm, respectively (Fig. 4D). The Q51A and Q51A/E90A mutants displayed monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibriums (Fig. 4, B and E, respectively) with larger Kd,24 values (3.28 and 7.73 μm, respectively) than that of WT (1.38 μm), indicating that mutation of Gln-51 resulted in greater dissociation of the dimer interface. At the tetramer interface of m-NAD(P)-ME, the positions of His-142(A) and Asp-568(D) are also conserved and form a salt bridge. Mutation of His-142 and Asp-568 to alanine caused the enzyme to be predominantly dissociated into dimers and monomers with Kd,24 and Kd,12 values of 8.75 and 3.63 μm for H142A and 12.6 and 0.57 μm for D568A, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). The H142A/D568A double mutant also presented itself as a dimer (Fig. 5D); its Kd,24 and Kd,12 values were 11.6 and 13.1 μm, respectively, again suggesting the significance of the salt bridge between His-142(A) and Asp-568(D) at the tetramer interface. The hydrophobic amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain are also important for stability of the quaternary structure. The W57A, Y770A, W572A, and P175A mutants were dimers at 0.3 mg/ml protein concentration (Fig. 6, B–E, respectively). For K507A, the Kd,24 and Kd,12 values were 12.6 and 0.89 μm, respectively (Fig. 6C). However, the quaternary structure distribution of P175A, K508A, and V18A (Fig. 6, F–H, respectively) demonstrated a pattern similar to WT. For K508A, the Kd,24 and Kd,12 values were 2.92 and 0.85 μm, respectively (Fig. 6G). These results suggest that the amino acid residues from 579 to 581 are not absolutely required for stability of the tetramer interface as these mutants had kinetic properties similar to those of WT (Table 2). Malic enzyme has a dimer of dimers quaternary structure in which the dimer interface is made up of relatively stronger interactions than the tetramer interface. Furthermore, each subunit of the tetramer has a corresponding active site. The m-NAD(P)-ME isoform exhibits both cooperative and allosteric activity and is in dimer-tetramer flux according to its equilibrium constant (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, c-NADP-ME behaves noncooperatively and nonallosterically and exists as a stable tetramer (Fig. 2A). The correlation between the catalytic efficiency and quaternary structure organization of the enzyme is unclear. This study establishes the functional significance of the dimer and tetramer interface for the enzyme. Our data clearly indicate that the enzyme activity of c-NADP-ME is not affected by the disruption at the interface. There are no significant differences in the kinetic properties between AB and AD dimers. The dimeric enzyme, either AB or AD, is as active as the tetramer, suggesting that the four subunits of the enzyme may not cross-talk with one another, and they may work independently. We also attempted to isolate the monomeric form of the enzyme by mutating several residues at the dimer and tetramer interfaces; however, we have not yet been successful because the monomer aggregates as inclusion bodies. Given these results, we conclude that the functional significance of the quaternary structure organization for c-NADP-ME may be in maintaining the stability of the holoenzyme rather than in communicating among the subunits. In contrast to c-NADP-ME, disruption of the subunit interfaces of m-NAD(P)-ME causes it to be less active than WT; the kcat values of the mutants decreased with increasing Kd,24 values (Table 2), suggesting that the dissociation of subunits at the dimer or tetramer interface significantly affects the activity of the enzyme. Moreover, these interface mutants become less cooperative for malate binding and less activated by fumarate, suggesting that the tetramer is the fully functional form of the enzyme. There seems to be some differences between AB and AD dimers of this isoform. For some dimer interface mutants, malate cooperativity is nearly abolished, and fumarate activation becomes minimal, suggesting that organization at the dimer interface is critical for proper malate cooperativity and fumarate-induced allosteric regulation. Although fumarate occupies a separate binding site on each subunit, its binding is dependent on the neighboring subunit, which helps to shield the binding site from the solvent and thus stabilize the binding of fumarate at the dimer interface (11.Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure. 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We suggest that the subunit-subunit interactions between A and B (C and D) is important not only for the malate cooperativity but also for the binding of fumarate (supplemental Fig. 1). The AD dimer may exhibit noncooperative and nonallosteric characteristics. In contrast, for tetramer interface mutants, cooperativity is partially conserved, and fumarate still functions by reducing the Km and increasing the kcat value. Fumarate may still bind to the allosteric site of the tetramer interface mutants to activate the enzyme and reduce the malate cooperativity (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 2); however, these tetramer interface mutants cannot be reconstituted into tetramers by fumarate (supplemental Fig. 1); thus the enzyme cannot be fully activated by fumarate (Table 2). These results support the hypothesis that tetramer interface organization is associated with malate cooperativity and involved in the fumarate-triggered tetramer reorganization for full activation of the enzyme. The AB dimer, however, may still be a cooperative and allosteric enzyme but less active than the tetramer. Size distribution analysis demonstrates that H142A and D568A form dimers in context of c-NADP-ME or m-NAD(P)-ME, suggesting that the ion pair formed by His-142(A) and Asp-568(D) is essential for the stability of the tetramer interface. Hydrophobic interactions in the C-terminal domain are also an important factor for the tetramer interface organization. Mutation of the hydrophobic amino acid residues (Tyr-570, Trp-572, and Pro-573) in the C-terminal domain makes the tetramer interface unstable causing the enzyme to dissociate into dimers. The stabilities of the tetramer interfaces in c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME have unique qualities. The c-NADP-ME isoform exists as a stable tetramer (Fig. 2A), whereas m-NAD(P)-ME exhibits a dimer-tetramer equilibrium (Fig. 4A). The ionic bond formed between His-142(A) and Asp-568(D) and the hydrophobic amino acid residues Tyr-570, Trp-572, and Pro-573 are conserved at the interfaces of both isoforms. Our data suggest that the hydrophobic amino acid residues Pro-579, Pro-580, and Val-581, which lie in the C-terminal tail of m-NAD(P)-ME, are not as important as Tyr-570, Trp-572, and Pro-573 for tetramer interface stability. The C-terminal tail of these two isoforms is not conserved, especially from residues 575 to 584. In this nonconserved region, c-NADP-ME contains additional ionic residues (Glu-575, Lys-578, and Lys-582), where m-NAD(P)-ME contains Ser or Ile. Investigating the role of these ionic residues at the tetramer interface may be helpful in finding additional factors governing the differential stability observed for the tetramer interfaces of these two isoforms. The D139A mutant is rather unique. Of all the mutants, it produces the highest percentage of monomer relative to other forms. In the structure, Asp-139 participates in the subunit-subunit interactions both at the dimer and tetramer interfaces. Asp-139(A) is hydrogen-bonded with His-51(B) in c-NADP-ME or with Gln-51(B) in m-NAD(P)-ME at the dimer interface. In addition, Asp-139(A) is hydrogen-bonded with Tyr-570(D) and Trp-572(D) at the tetramer interface of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME (supplemental Fig. 3). Thus, the mutant shows the highest percentage of monomer relative to others. In summary, we demonstrate that the dimeric form of c-NADP-ME has similar enzyme activity to the tetrameric form. The quaternary structure of c-NADP-ME is mainly for protein stability. For m-NAD(P)-ME, dissociation of subunits at the dimer or tetramer interface causes the enzyme to be less active, less cooperative for malate binding, and less responsive to fumarate. Thus the tetramer organization for this isoform is principally for enzyme regulation. Download .pdf (.19 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2049538655,"Recent evidence suggests that extranuclear action of retinoid receptors is involved in mediating the pleiotropic effects of retinoids. However, whether they reside in the cytoplasm remains elusive. Here, we showed that retinoic acid receptor-γ (RARγ) was cytoplasmic in confluent cells, or when cells were released from serum depletion or treated with growth factors. In studying the regulation of RARγ subcellular localization, we observed that ectopically overexpressed RARγ was mainly cytoplasmic irrespective of serum concentration and cell density. The cytoplasmic retention of RARγ was inhibited by ligand retinoic acid (RA). In addition, coexpression of retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) resulted in nuclear localization of RARγ through their heterodimerization. Mutagenesis studies revealed that a C-terminal fragment of RXRα potently prevents RA-induced RARγ nuclear localization and transcriptional function. Furthermore, our results showed that the cytoplasmic retention of RARγ was due to the presence of its unique N-terminal A/B domain, which was subject to regulation by p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. Deletion or mutation of the N-terminal A/B domain largely impaired its cytoplasmic localization. Together, our data demonstrate that the subcellular localization of RARγ is regulated by complex interactions among ligand binding, receptor phosphorylation, and receptor dimerizations.

RARγ, but not RARα, plays a role in predisposing murine keratinocytes to Ras-induced tumorigenesis, in retinoic acid (RA)-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in keratinocytes (5.Chen C.F.

RXRs, besides forming heterodimer with RARs in retinoid signaling, can act as heterodimerization partners for many other nuclear receptors to activate transcription of their target genes in a variety of signaling pathways (1.Kastner P.

Retinoid receptors, like other nuclear receptors, consist of three main functional domains: the non-conserved N-terminal A/B domain, the central DNA-binding domain containing two zinc finger motifs and nuclear localization signal (NLS), and the multifunctional C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) containing regions for receptor dimerization, ligand binding, and the ligand-dependent transactivation function. Dimerization interfaces that largely mediate heterodimerization of RXRα with RARs have been mapped to regions in the C terminus, corresponding to helices 9 and 10 in the canonical nuclear receptor LBD structure (10.Bourguet W.

Phosphorylation of the A/B domain of RARγ is indispensable for differentiation of F9 cells upon RA and cAMP treatment (16.Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P.

Unlike steroid hormone receptors such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor that rapidly translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon ligand-induced activation, retinoid receptors are considered to mainly reside in the nucleus independent of the presence of ligand (18.Hager G.L.

Thus, subcellular localization of retinoid receptors changes during development of the testes (26.Dufour J.M. Kim K.H. Biol.

Thus, subcellular localization may represent another mechanism by which retinoid receptors mediate the pleiotropic effects of retinoids. Cytoplasmic localization of nuclear receptors not only regulates transcription by modulating their availability in the nucleus but also plays an active role in the cross-talk with other signal transduction pathways.

Thus, understanding how subcellular localization of retinoid receptors is regulated will provide additional important information regarding the mechanism of retinoid receptor action. Here we report that RARγ often resides in the cytoplasm when cells are cultured at high density, released from serum starvation, or treated with growth factors. Using transient transfection assays, we show that the cytoplasmic accumulation of RARγ is largely dependent on its N-terminal A/B domain, which is modulated by phosphorylation of its Ser-77 and Ser-79 residues by p38 MAPK. Cytoplasmic retention of RARγ is also inhibited by ligand binding and heterodimerization with RXRα. Thus, our results demonstrate that the subcellular localization of RARγ is regulated by complex interplays among ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation and that its N-terminal A/B region plays a critical role in determining its cytoplasmic accumulation.

In studying whether retinoid receptors exhibited differential subcellular localization in response to cellular stimulation, we observed that RARγ exhibited strikingly different intracellular localization patterns in H460 lung cancer cells depending on culture conditions. In non-confluent cells, immunostaining with anti-RARγ antibody revealed that typically >95% of cells had RARγ nuclear staining. In contrast, RARγ was predominantly (>70%) cytoplasmic in confluent cells (Fig. 1A). The subcellular localization of RARγ was also regulated by serum concentration. When subconfluent H460 cells were cultured in serum-free medium, RARγ was predominantly nuclear. However, cytoplasmic localization of RARγ was observed when cells were released from 24 h of serum starvation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, treatment of H460 cells cultured in serum-free medium with various growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor, also resulted in increased RARγ cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1B). Such effects of cell density and growth factors were not observed when RARα was studied (data not shown). Thus, RARγ frequently resides in the cytoplasm, depending on cell density, serum concentration, and the presence of growth factors. To study the regulation of subcellular localization of RARγ, we transfected Myc-RARγ (RARγ1 tagged with the Myc epitope) expression vector into HeLa cells. Immunostaining of transfected cells with anti-Myc antibody showed that ectopically expressed Myc-RARγ was mainly cytoplasmic (Fig. 2A). Cytoplasmic localization of Myc-RARγ was independent on cell density (data not shown), which was in contrast to the endogenous RARγ whose subcellular localization depended on growth conditions (Fig. 1). To study whether cell density-independent cytoplasmic localization of Myc-RARγ was due to Myc epitope tagged, RARγ fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was transfected into HeLa cells. Fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that GFP-RARγ also resided in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, untagged RARγ displayed similar cytoplasmic localization when examined by anti-RARγ antibody (Fig. 2A). Cytoplasmic localization of Myc-RARγ, GFP-RARγ, and RARγ was potently inhibited by ligand binding as treatment of cells with RA resulted in their exclusive nuclear localization. To determine whether the cytoplasmic localization of ectopically expressed RARγ could be observed in other cell types, we transfected Myc-RARγ into several cell lines, including ZR-75-1 breast cancer, SW480 colon cancer, H460 lung cancer, and HEK293T embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 2B). Similar to that observed in HeLa cells, Myc-RARγ was mainly cytoplasmic in these cells, demonstrating that cytoplasmic localization of overexpressed RARγ is not cell type-specific. As nuclear receptors are known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and their subcellular localization is often determined by a balance between activities of nuclear export sequence (NES) and NLS (43.Prüfer K. Barsony J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we determined whether cytoplasmic retention of RARγ might depend on its sustained nuclear export. Myc-RARγ-transfected cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB), which is known to inhibit classic Crm-1-dependent nuclear export (44.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that treatment of cells with LMB had no apparent effect on cytoplasmic accumulation of Myc-RARγ, suggesting that retention of transfected RARγ in the cytoplasm was not dependent on its continuous nuclear export. Our observations that the cytoplasmic localization of endogenous RARγ depended on culture condition while transfected RARγ was constitutively cytoplasmic suggested the presence of endogenous RARγ-binding protein(s) that acted to keep RARγ in the nucleus and were limiting. Because RXRα was known to modulate subcellular distribution of its heterodimerization partners (29.Cao X. Liu W. Lin F. Li H. Kolluri S.K. Lin B. Han Y.H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9705-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 43.Prüfer K. Barsony J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 45.Baumann C.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41114-41123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we examined whether RXRα represented such a limiting factor. As shown in Fig. 3A, when RXRα was cotransfected with GFP-RARγ, both receptor proteins were found exclusively in the nucleus. Such a relocalization of RARγ from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by RXRα occurred in the absence of RA treatment and was specific, because the cytoplasmic localization of GR was not affected by RXRα overexpression. In addition, cotransfection of RARα had no effect on the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-RARγ. Thus, RXRα is an important regulator of the subcellular localization of RARγ, similar to the effect of RARγ ligand. To study how RXRα regulated RARγ subcellular localization, several RXRα mutants were constructed. An excess amount of expression vector encoding each of the RXRα mutants was transfected with Myc-RARγ to determine their effect on the cytoplasmic localization of Myc-RARγ. Deletion of the A/B domain from RXRα had no effect on its ability to induce RARγ nuclear import (not shown). Although cotransfection of RXRα completely retained Myc-RARγ in a ligand-independent manner, removal of the very C-terminal region (amino acids 386–462) from RXRα completely impaired its effect, as cotransfection of RXRα-(1–385) did not result in relocalization of RARγ into the nucleus in the absence of RA (Fig. 3B). Co-IP assay showed that RXRα-(1–385) could not heterodimerize with RARγ (Fig. 3C), suggesting that heterodimerization of RARγ and RXRα was required for their nuclear localization. Consistently, RXRα-(1–385) did not interfere with the effect of RA on inducing Myc-RARγ nuclear import. We also evaluated the effect of the RXRα LBD, RXRα-(222–462), which alone is cytoplasmic (29.Cao X. Liu W. Lin F. Li H. Kolluri S.K. Lin B. Han Y.H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell.

When RXRα-(222–462) and RARγ were cotransfected, both receptor proteins were almost exclusively localized in the cytoplasm.

https://openalex.org/W1991087156,"The promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF) is a transcription factor and c-kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with human disease, particularly in hematopoietic cells. MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and c-kit has been described as a target of miRs-221 and -222 in erythropoiesis. In the present study, we identified c-kit as a target of PLZF in normal and leukemic cells. Particularly, in erythropoietic (E) culture of CD34(+) progenitors, PLZF is downregulated, whereas c-kit expression at both the mRNA and protein levels inversely increases during the first days of E differentiation. In functional experiments, PLZF transfection induces c-kit downregulation, inhibits E proliferation and delays differentiation, whereas PLZF knockdown induces opposite effects, independently of miRs-221 and -222 expression. The inverse correlation between PLZF and c-kit expression was found in normal CD34(+)38(+/-) hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells and in acute myeloid leukemias of M0/M1 French-American-British subtypes, suggesting that the control of PLZF on c-kit expression may be crucial at the level of the stem cell/progenitor compartment. Altogether, our data indicate a new mechanism of regulation of c-kit expression that involves a transcriptional control by PLZF in CD34(+) cells and early erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2108504970,"Smooth muscle myosin is activated by regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation. In the unphosphorylated state the activity of both heads is suppressed due to an asymmetric, intramolecular interaction between the heads. The properties of myosin with only one of its two RLCs phosphorylated, a state likely to be present both during the activation and the relaxation phase of smooth muscle, is less certain despite much investigation. Here we further characterize the mechanical properties of an expressed heavy meromyosin (HMM) construct with only one of its RLCs phosphorylated (HMM-1P). This construct was previously shown to have more than 50% of the ATPase activity of fully phosphorylated myosin (HMM-2P) and to move actin at the same speed in a motility assay as HMM-2P (Rovner, A. S., Fagnant, P. M., and Trybus, K. M. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 5280–5289). Here we show that the unitary step size and attachment time to actin of HMM-1P is indistinguishable from that of HMM-2P. Force-velocity measurements on small ensembles show that HMM-1P can generate approximately half the force of HMM-2P, which may relate to the observed duty ratio of HMM-1P being approximately half that of HMM-2P. Therefore, single-phosphorylated smooth muscle HMM molecules are active species, and the head associated with the unphosphorylated RLC is mechanically competent, allowing it to make a substantial contribution to both motion and force generation during smooth muscle contraction. Smooth muscle myosin is activated by regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation. In the unphosphorylated state the activity of both heads is suppressed due to an asymmetric, intramolecular interaction between the heads.

Therefore, single-phosphorylated smooth muscle HMM molecules are active species, and the head associated with the unphosphorylated RLC is mechanically competent, allowing it to make a substantial contribution to both motion and force generation during smooth muscle contraction. Myosin motors are involved in a diverse array of actin-based cellular functions including muscle contraction, cargo transport, and cytokinesis. To accomplish any of these processes successfully, there needs to be strict control of when the motor is activated and when it is turned “off.” Smooth muscle myosin, which powers smooth muscle contraction in both vascular and visceral tissues, is no exception, and the mechanism by which it is regulated has been studied for many years (for review, see Ref. 2.Sellers J.R. Knight P.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2007; 28: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

In the unphosphorylated state, smooth muscle myosin is unable to move actin, and the actomyosin ATPase activity is rate-limited by phosphate release so that the motor can only weakly interact with actin in the M·ADP·Pi state (3.Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13880-13883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Early studies characterized the inhibited state of myosin at physiologic ionic strength as a species that sedimented at 10 S in the ultracentrifuge, indicating that the rod must adopt a compact conformation (4.Onishi H. Wakabayashi T. J. Biochem. 1982; 92: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5.Craig R. Smith R. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1983; 302: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Consistent with the hydrodynamic studies, metal-shadowed images showed a structure with the rod bent into nearly equal thirds and heads bent back toward the rod (6.Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher resolution cryoelectron microscopic images of two-dimensional arrays of unphosphorylated HMM revealed an asymmetric intramolecular interaction between the heads called the “blocked” and “free” heads that proposed a molecular basis for inhibition (7.Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The actin binding domain of the blocked head interacts with the converter domain of the free head, so that the blocked head cannot bind actin and be actin-activated. The free head is prevented from progressing through its ATPase cycle because rotation of the converter domain cannot occur due to the binding of the blocked head, and thus, the free head is locked in a weak binding state (7.Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These asymmetric head interactions were also observed by single particle analysis of negatively stained images of smooth muscle myosin (8.Burgess S.A. Yu S. Walker M.L. Hawkins R.J. Chalovich J.M. Knight P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This motif appears to be a general mechanism widely used by class II myosins to maintain a relaxed or inhibited state, as it was also observed in native striated muscle myosin thick filaments from tarantula, which are regulated by phosphorylation (9.Woodhead J.L. Zhao F.Q. Craig R. Egelman E.H. Alamo L. Padrón R. Nature. 2005; 436: 1195-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), as well as in striated myosins from both vertebrates and invertebrates (10.Jung H.S. Komatsu S. Ikebe M. Craig R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3234-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).RLC phosphorylation abolishes these interactions, allowing both heads to freely interact with actin (7.Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11.Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although these two endpoints are well characterized, much less is agreed upon with regard to smooth muscle myosin that has only one of its two RLCs phosphorylated. RLC phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase is random (12.Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15988-15995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sellers J.R. Chock P.B. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so myosin with only one phosphorylated RLC is a predominant species during muscle activation and perhaps during relaxation. The hydrolytic and mechanical activity of this state has been investigated for decades. In the early studies, the activity of single-phosphorylated myosin was inferred from ensemble measurements in which it existed in a mixture with both unphosphorylated and double-phosphorylated myosin. Some of these studies suggested that it has less than half the actin-activated ATPase activity of the double-phosphorylated state (15.Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Science. 1981; 213: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16.Ikebe M. Ogihara S. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas others suggested that both the hydrolytic and actin filament motility was approximately half (17.Harris D.E. Stromski C.J. Hayes E. Warshaw D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1160-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Chacko S. Rosenfeld A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The former studies imply that the activation of one head does not activate the whole molecule, whereas the latter was consistent with each head acting independently of its partner.Recently, the approach to this problem has been improved by employing various methods that allow isolation of a single-phosphorylated species (1.Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19.Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 15611-15618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Single-phosphorylated heavy meromyosin (HMM) had much less than half the hydrolytic and mechanical activity of double-phosphorylated HMM when prepared using light chain exchange or stripping protocols (19.Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Tanaka H. Homma K. White H.D. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15611-15618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using differential tagging of constructs expressed in Sf9 cells followed by sequential affinity columns, the single-phosphorylated HMM (HMM-1P) had more than half the ATPase activity and actin filament speeds in the in vitro motility assay that were similar to double-phosphorylated HMM (1.Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Here, we further characterize the mechanical properties of the expressed HMM-1P construct. An optical trap assay was used to show that the unitary step size and attachment time of an expressed single HMM-1P molecule was indistinguishable from that of double-phosphorylated HMM (HMM-2P) (1.Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one of the heads of HMM-1P is equivalent to a head of HMM-2P. The optical trap was further used to characterize the force-velocity relationship for a small ensemble of HMM-1P molecules (21.Debold E.P. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: L34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data showed that HMM-1P can generate approximately half the force of HMM-2P, which may relate to the observed duty ratio of HMM-1P being approximately half that of HMM-2P. The results are discussed in terms of two mechanisms that cannot be distinguished from one another based on the current data. The ability of HMM-1P to generate motion and force implies that it likely contributes to smooth muscle contraction both during activation at low phosphorylation levels as well as in maintaining tension when phosphorylation levels start to decline.DiscussionHere we use both single molecule techniques to measure unitary displacements and attachment times and small ensemble measurements of HMM to measure force at different loads to more fully understand the force and motion-generating capabilities of smooth muscle HMM that has only one of its two RLCs phosphorylated. This species is expected to play an important role during smooth muscle activation as well as relaxation. It is well established that unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin is “off,” which requires the presence of two heads (33.Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34.Li X.D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M.

Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), rendering both heads incapable of ATPase activity and motion generation. Phosphorylation of both RLCs disrupts this interaction so that each head can associate with actin to generate force and motion. Given this structural view of regulation, the question becomes whether phosphorylation of one RLC disrupts the asymmetric head interactions, and if it does, are the individual heads associated with the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RLCs in the HMM-1P molecule mechanically equivalent?Single Molecule Data: HMM-2P Versus HMM-1PThe optical trap provides a sensitive measure of myosin inherent displacement generation (d) and the time that the motor remains attached to actin after the power-stroke (ton). When characterizing unphosphorylated HMM, the lack of any mechanical activity confirms that this molecule adopts the inhibited conformation. In contrast, both the power-stroke displacement (d) and strong binding lifetime (ton) of HMM-1P were identical to that of HMM-2P, consistent with the actin filament speeds for these constructs being similar in the motility assay (1.Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that displacement events in the optical trap are generated by only one head of myosin (26.Kad N.M. Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Joel P.B. Kennedy G.G. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37.Tyska M.J. Dupuis D.E. Guilford W.H. Patlak J.B. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4402-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For example, a heterodimeric smooth muscle HMM construct having one wild type and one obligatory weak binding mutant head generates d and ton identical to that of HMM-2P (26.Kad N.M. Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Joel P.B. Kennedy G.G. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results cannot determine whether one or both heads of HMM-1P are mechanically competent but at a minimum confirms that HMM-1P is more like the HMM-2P rather than the unphosphorylated species.A recent optical trap study by Yanagida and co-workers (20.Tanaka H. Homma K. White H.D. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15611-15618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) characterized the step displacement and strong binding lifetime of unphosphorylated and single- and double-phosphorylated myosin. Surprisingly, the unphosphorylated myosin in their study bound strongly to actin filaments with the majority of events having lifetimes of ∼1 s. These data are contrary to biochemical studies, which characterize the unphosphorylated, inhibited state of myosin as having only weak binding capacity (2.Sellers J.R. Knight P.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2007; 28: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3.Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13880-13883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as suggested by our own optical trap data with unphosphorylated HMM. It is possible that the biochemical conditions used by Tanaka et al. (20.Tanaka H. Homma K. White H.D. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15611-15618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to exchange RLC in their preparation may have resulted in a small fraction of modified, unregulated myosin capable of binding actin. If so, this might explain their observation that single-phosphorylated myosin has both short lifetimes characteristic of their double-phosphorylated species and a fraction of long lifetimes equivalent to their unphosphorylated myosin (20.Tanaka H. Homma K. White H.D. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15611-15618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanics of their single-phosphorylated myosin could simply be a mixture of single-phosphorylated myosin that, as in our study, is indistinguishable from the double-phosphorylated species and a modified unregulated component to account for the long-lived lifetime component.Duty Ratio and Force-VelocityEach HMM-1P head has approximately half the duty ratio of HMM-2P (Fig. 2). Because the duty ratio estimates the fraction of the ATPase cycle (ton+ toff) that the head is strongly bound (ton) to actin (i.e. α = ton/(ton+ toff)), a change in α could indicate an alteration in ton and/or toff. For low duty ratio motors, ton ≪ toff, so that α ≈ ton/toff. The similarity in both actin filament speed for HMM-1P and -2P at saturating HMM surface densities (see “Results” and in Rovner et al. (1.Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)), which is limited by ton, and the similarity in ton measured directly in the optical trap at low ATP suggest that toff for HMM-1P is twice that of HMM-2P to account for the lower duty ratio.HMM-1P also generates approximately half the force of HMM-2P when the force-velocity relationships are normalized on a per head basis (see Fig. 3c). The force (F) produced by a population of n HMM heads is related to the time averaged force generation (Favg) of a single head (F = nFavg). Because an HMM head can only support force while strongly bound, Favg is the product of its force while strongly bound (Funi) and its duty ratio under loaded conditions (αLoad), i.e. Favg = αLoadFuni. If we assume that Funi is the same because the step sizes for HMM-1P and -2P are identical, then the reduced force under load (F = nαLoadFuni) associated with phosphorylating a single RLC could result from alterations to the kinetics of the HMM-1P head (i.e. a change in αLoad) or to a reduction in the effective number of mechanically competent heads (i.e. n).Modeling the Functional Consequences of HMM-1PNumerous protein biochemical, structural, and mutational studies have focused on the structural elements that are essential to adopt the off state of smooth muscle myosin (2.Sellers J.R. Knight P.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2007; 28: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Minimal requirements include that the molecule must form a stable double-headed structure with a sufficient length of rod that is flexible enough to allow the required head-head interactions to occur. This would explain why single-headed myosin, the S1 head of myosin, and constructs with short rods that have been artificially dimerized with a leucine zipper are active when unphosphorylated (38.Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutations to regions involved in stabilizing the off state also disrupt the ability to adopt the inhibited conformation. Altering charged residues in surface loop 2, which is part of the actin binding domain, lessens the ability of the blocked head to interact with the converter domain of the free head and, thus, activates the molecule (39.Rovner A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Our data suggest that phosphorylation of one RLC is also sufficient to disrupt these interactions as HMM-1P generates substantial force and motion. If we assume that the inhibited and active states of smooth muscle myosin are in equilibrium and that phosphorylating both RLCs shifts this equilibrium toward the active state (Fig. 4), it is then possible that phosphorylation of only one RLC may also bias this equilibrium toward the active state. However, not knowing the extent to which HMM-1P shifts this equilibrium, two mechanisms are possible (see Fig. 4); 1) the equilibrium is such that all HMM-1P molecules are active, but the heads differ in their hydrolytic and mechanical properties; 2) phosphorylation of a single RLC cannot fully overcome the interactions between the two heads, so that the equilibrium constant between the inhibited and active states is ∼1 under our experimental conditions, resulting in effectively half of the HMM-1P population being active and indistinguishable from HMM-2P.If phosphorylation of one RLC shifts the equilibrium so that all HMM-1P molecules are active (Mechanism 1), then the kinetics for each molecule must differ to account for the lower apparent duty ratio and force observed here and the lower actin-activated steady state and single turnover ATPase rates of HMM-1P compared with HMM-2P reported previously (1.Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19.Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because each HMM-1P has two heads, it is possible that the two heads have different kinetics (i.e. attachment rates) depending on the RLC phosphorylation state of that head. For example, mutations to or deletion of the RLC can have significant effects on myosin force and motion generation (40.Sherwood J.J. Waller G.S. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10973-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the effective kinetics of an HMM-1P molecule would be determined by the combined kinetics of the individual heads.However, an alternate mechanism (Mechanism 2) is that HMM-1P molecules are in rapid equilibrium between the active and inhibited state, with an equilibrium constant of ∼1 under the conditions of our experiments. If the active HMM-1P molecule is indistinguishable from an HMM-2P molecule (as in the optical trap), then this simple mechanism effectively reduces the number of active molecules at any point in time by approximately half. This would account for the apparent reduction in duty ratio and force data, as the effective HMM-1P surface density would be decreased.It should be noted that elements of both mechanisms can also co-exist. For example, there may be an equilibrium between the active and inhibited states, but there may also be differences between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated head in the active species, although to a lesser extent than depicted in Mechanism 1.ConclusionsThe present results agree with previous studies (19.Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Tanaka H. Homma K. White H.D. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

This result is relevant for smooth muscle physiology in that single-phosphorylated myosin must exist during activation and, more importantly, during sustained periods of force maintenance. Smooth muscle tissue has the ability to maintain force with little energy expenditure even though the level of RLC phosphorylation is reduced compared with that at the peak of activation. Various models have been proposed to explain the ability of smooth muscle myosin to modulate its enzymatic and mechanical activities with phosphorylation (41.Dillon P.F. Aksoy M.O. Driska S.P. Murphy R.A. Science. 1981; 211: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 42.Fuglsang A. Khromov A. Török K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res.

It is possible that the methods for preparing HMM-1P contribute to these experimental differences, because our protein expression system does not require the additional biochemical procedures required for RLC removal or exchange (19.Ellison P.A.

Knowing that the HMM-1P, having one of its RLCs unphosphorylated, is still capable of generating at least half the force of the fully phosphorylated HMM, this species will be an important contributor to the capacity of smooth muscle tissue to maintain force despite a reduced level of RLC phosphorylation. Although we cannot distinguish between the two mechanisms for HMM-1P functionality proposed here (see Fig. 4), future biophysical and modeling studies may help distinguish between these proposed mechanisms. Myosin motors are involved in a diverse array of actin-based cellular functions including muscle contraction, cargo transport, and cytokinesis. To accomplish any of these processes successfully, there needs to be strict control of when the motor is activated and when it is turned “off.” Smooth muscle myosin, which powers smooth muscle contraction in both vascular and visceral tissues, is no exception, and the mechanism by which it is regulated has been studied for many years (for review, see Ref. 2.Sellers J.R. Knight P.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2007; 28: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

In the unphosphorylated state, smooth muscle myosin is unable to move actin, and the actomyosin ATPase activity is rate-limited by phosphate release so that the motor can only weakly interact with actin in the M·ADP·Pi state (3.Sellers J.R.

Glycan array analysis revealed that the carbohydrate-recognition domain in the extracellular domain of the receptor binds glycans with terminal alpha-linked mannose or fucose residues. Prolectin expressed in fibroblasts is found at the cell surface, but unlike many glycan-binding receptors it does not mediate endocytosis of a neoglycoprotein ligand. However, compared with other known glycan-binding receptors, the receptor contains an unusually large intracellular domain that consists of multiple sequence motifs, including phosphorylated tyrosine residues, that allow it to interact with signaling molecules such as Grb2. Immunohistochemistry has been used to demonstrate that prolectin is expressed on a specialized population of proliferating B cells in germinal centers. Thus, this novel receptor has the potential to function in carbohydrate-mediated communication between cells in the germinal center."
https://openalex.org/W2123506661,"Fluorescent fusion proteins are exceedingly useful for monitoring protein localization in situ or visualizing protein behavior at the single molecule level. Unfortunately, some proteins are rendered inactive by the fusion. To circumvent this problem, we fused a hyperactive RecA protein (RecA803 protein) to monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) to produce a functional protein (RecA-RFP) that is suitable for in vivo and in vitro analysis. In vivo, the RecA-RFP partially restores UV resistance, conjugational recombination, and SOS induction to recA(-) cells. In vitro, the purified RecA-RFP protein forms a nucleoprotein filament whose k(cat) for single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity is reduced approximately 3-fold relative to wild-type protein, and which is largely inhibited by single-stranded DNA-binding protein. However, RecA protein is also a dATPase; dATP supports RecA-RFP nucleoprotein filament formation in the presence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Furthermore, as for the wild-type protein, the activities of RecA-RFP are further enhanced by shifting the pH to 6.2. As a consequence, RecA-RFP is proficient for DNA strand exchange with dATP or at lower pH. Finally, using single molecule visualization, RecA-RFP was seen to assemble into a continuous filament on duplex DNA, and to extend the DNA approximately 1.7-fold. Consistent with its attenuated activities, RecA-RFP nucleates onto double-stranded DNA approximately 3-fold more slowly than the wild-type protein, but still requires approximately 3 monomers to form the rate-limited nucleus needed for filament assembly. Thus, RecA-RFP reveals that its attenuated biological functions correlate with a reduced frequency of nucleoprotein filament nucleation at the single molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2055119407,"Skin maintenance and healing after wounding requires complex epithelial-mesenchymal interactions purportedly mediated by growth factors and cytokines. We show here that, for wound healing, transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in keratinocytes activates von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor expression, which in turn represses the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), integrin beta1, and integrin beta5 via inhibition of the Sp1-mediated signaling pathway in the keratinocytes. The reduced production of PDGF-B leads to a paracrine-decreased expression of hepatocyte growth factor in the underlying fibroblasts. This TAK1 regulation of the double paracrine PDGF/hepatocyte growth factor signaling can regulate keratinocyte cell proliferation and is required for proper wound healing. Strikingly, TAK1 deficiency enhances cell migration. TAK1-deficient keratinocytes displayed lamellipodia formation with distinct microspike protrusion, associated with an elevated expression of integrins beta1 and beta5 and sustained activation of cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Our findings provide evidence for a novel homeostatic control of keratinocyte proliferation and migration mediated via TAK1 regulation of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Dysfunctional regulation of TAK1 may contribute to the pathology of non-healing chronic inflammatory wounds and psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W1967516994,"The NF-kappaB signaling pathway can perform multiple functional roles depending on specific cellular environments and cell types. Even in the same cell clones, the pathway can show different kinetic and phenotypic properties. It is believed that the complex networks controlling the NF-kappaB signaling pathway can generate these diverse and sometimes ambiguous phenomena. We noted, however, that the dynamics of NF-kappaB signaling pathway is highly stochastic and that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway contains multiple negative feedback circuits formed by IkappaB isoform proteins, IkappaBalpha and IkappaBepsilon in particular. Considering the topological similarity, their functional roles seem to be redundant, raising the question why different types of IkappaB isoforms need to exist. From extensive stochastic simulations of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, we found that each IkappaB isoform actually conducts a different regulatory role through its own negative feedback. Specifically, our data suggest that IkappaBalpha controls the dynamic patterns of nuclear NF-kappaB, while IkappaBepsilon induces cellular heterogeneity of the NF-kappaB activities. These results may provide an answer to the question of how a single NF-kappaB signaling pathway can perform multiple biological functions even in the same clonal populations."
https://openalex.org/W1972811653,"Auditory hair cell function requires proper assembly and regulation of the nonmuscle gamma isoactin-rich cytoskeleton, and six point mutations in this isoactin cause a type of delayed onset autosomal dominant nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss, DFNA20/26. The molecular basis underlying this actin-dependent hearing loss is unknown. To address this problem, the mutations have been introduced into yeast actin, and their effects on actin function were assessed in vivo and in vitro. Because we previously showed that polymerization was unaffected in five of the six mutants, we have focused on proteins that regulate actin, in particular cofilin, which severs F-actin and sequesters actin monomers. The mutations do not affect the interaction of cofilin with G-actin. However, T89I and V370A mutant F-actins are much more susceptible to cofilin disassembly than WT filaments in vitro. Conversely, P332A filaments demonstrate enhanced resistance. Wild type actin solutions containing T89I, K118M, or P332A mutant actins at mole fractions similar to those found in the hair cell respond in vitro toward cofilin in a manner proportional to the level of the mutant present. Finally, depression of cofilin action in vivo by elimination of the cofilin-activating protein, Aip1p, rescues the inability to grow on glycerol caused by K118M, T278I, P332A, and V370A. These results suggest that a filament instability caused by these mutations can be balanced by decreasing a system in vivo that promotes increased filament turnover. Such mutant-dependent filament destabilization could easily result in hair cell malfunction leading to the late-onset hearing loss observed in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2014434110,"We examine the potential for erythropoietin signaling to promote donor cell survival in a model of myoblast transplantation. Expression of a truncated erythropoietin receptor in hematopoietic stem cells has been shown to promote selective engraftment in mice. We previously demonstrated expression of endogenous erythropoietin receptor on murine myoblasts, and erythropoietin treatment can stimulate myoblast proliferation and delay differentiation. Here, we report that enhanced erythropoietin receptor expression, as well as exogenous erythropoietin treatment in myoblasts, provided a survival advantage and protection against apoptosis under serum-starvation conditions. When cultured in differentiation medium, expression of the myogenic regulatory proteins shifted toward early differentiation with increased erythropoietin receptor. Expression of early myogenic differentiation proteins Myf-5 and MyoD increased, while later stage protein myogenin decreased. Transplantation of C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing truncated erythropoietin receptor showed more transplanted cell incorporation into muscle fibers in muscular dystrophy mdx mice. These cells also restored dystrophin protein expression in mdx mice at 6 wk after cell treatment that was further increased with exogenous erythropoietin administration. In summary, enhanced erythropoietin receptor expression promotes transplanted cell survival in a mouse model for myoblast transplantation and provides dystrophin expression in mice with muscular dystrophy.—Jia, Y., Warin, R., Yu, X., Epstein, R., Noguchi, C.

https://openalex.org/W2038580634,"Cytoskeletal organization of the osteoclast (OC), which is central to the capacity of the cell to resorb bone, is induced by occupancy of the alphavbeta3 integrin or the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor c-Fms. In both circumstances, the tyrosine kinase Syk is an essential signaling intermediary. We demonstrate that Cbl negatively regulates OC function by interacting with Syk(Y317). Expression of nonphosphorylatable Syk(Y317F) in primary Syk(-/-) OCs enhances M-CSF- and alphavbeta3-induced phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton-organizing molecules, SLP76, Vav3, and PLCgamma2, to levels greater than wild type, thereby accelerating the resorptive capacity of the cell. Syk(Y317) suppresses cytoskeletal organization and function while binding the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Cbl. Consequently, Syk(Y317F) abolishes M-CSF- and integrin-stimulated Syk ubiquitination. Thus, Cbl/Syk(Y317) association negatively regulates OC function and therefore is essential for maintenance of skeletal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2078046435,"Factor I-like modules (FIMs) of complement proteins C6, C7, and factor I participate in protein-protein interactions critical to the progress of a complement-mediated immune response to infections and other trauma. For instance, the carboxyl-terminal FIM pair of C7 (C7-FIMs) binds to the C345C domain of C5 and its activated product, C5b, during self-assembly of the cytolytic membrane-attack complex. FIMs share sequence similarity with follistatin domains (FDs) of known three-dimensional structure, suggesting that FIM structures could be reliably modeled. However, conflicting disulfide maps, inconsistent orientations of subdomains within FDs, and the presence of binding partners in all FD structures led us to determine the three-dimensional structure of C7-FIMs by NMR spectroscopy. The solution structure reveals that each FIM within C7 contains a small amino-terminal FOLN subdomain connected to a larger carboxyl-terminal KAZAL domain. The open arrangement of the subdomains within FIMs resembles that of first FDs within structures of tandem FDs but differs from the more compact subdomain arrangement of second or third FDs. Unexpectedly, the two C7-FIMs pack closely together with an approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry that is rarely seen in module pairs and has not been observed in FD-containing proteins.

The formation of this multi-protein complex is triggered by proteolytic cleavage of complement component C5. This is followed swiftly by a remarkable, although little understood, self-assembly process involving multiple sequential protein-protein recognition events. MAC assembly culminates in the formation of a pore traversing the targeted cell membrane (1.Podack E.R. Biesecker G. Kolb W.P. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 484-490PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of multiple MACs in a membrane triggers cell-dependent responses and may result in cell lysis (2.Bohana-Kashtan O. Ziporen L. Donin N.

Classical, alternative, and lectin pathways of complement activation converge at a step in which C5 is cleaved to release activated C5b. Immediately following C5b formation, C6 and C7 bind sequentially; the C5b6 complex is soluble and relatively stable (3.Goldlust M.B. Shin H.S. Hammer C.H. Mayer M.M. J. Immunol. 1974; 113: 998-1007PubMed Google Scholar), but soluble C5b67 has a brief half-life and is proposed to attach rapidly to target membrane surfaces (4.Götze O. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp.

Subsequently, C8 binds to the nascent complex, inserting into the target membrane and causing disruptive rearrangements of the lipid bilayer. Finally the mature MAC, C5b6789n, forms by recruitment of between 10 and 16 copies of C9 that insert in the membrane to form the pore. Notably, once C5b is generated, MAC assembly requires no additional enzymatic triggers; this implies that individual components encompass highly specific, complementary binding sites that become exposed during MAC formation. Complement proteins C6, C7, C8 (α and β subunits), and C9 comprise the “MAC family” (Fig. 1a) (6.DiScipio R.G. Chakravarti D.N. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Fey G.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13918-13929Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), so named because of their apparent relatedness to an amino-terminal domain of complement factor I (fI) (Fig. 1b). Latent C5 was shown, in vitro, to bind reversibly to both C6 and C7 prior to activation. These interactions are distinct from and precede irreversible binding of C6 and subsequently C7 to C5b (18.Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the C56 and C57 preactivation complexes ensure that C6 and C7 are maintained proximal to C5 in the plasma. This may be significant because activated C5b is labile (19.Cooper N.R. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20.DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A.

Within this preactivation complex, critical interactions occur between the carboxyl-terminal C345C domain of C5, C5-C345C (21.Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6565-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal FIM pair of both C6 and C7 (22.DiScipio R.G. Linton S.M. Rushmere N.K. J. Biol.

The involvement of these domains in MAC formation was demonstrated using recombinant proteins, where either C7-FIMs or C5-C345C inhibited the binding of C7 to C5b6 and inhibited complement-mediated erythrocyte lysis (23.Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6227-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The FIMs of C6, however, although shown to promote MAC assembly, do not appear to be essential for MAC formation (22.DiScipio R.G. Linton S.M. Rushmere N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31811-31818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C7-FIMs have a stronger affinity than C6-FIMs for C5-C345C, suggesting that C7-FIMs may displace C6-FIMs during MAC assembly (23.Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6227-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions between C5- C345C and FIMs are key to the early assembly of MAC, and their structural basis is an important target of investigations. The structure of the C5-C345C domain is well established (24.Bramham J. Thai C.T. Soares D.C. Uhrín D. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. J. Biol.

Discipio R. Sottrup-Jensen L. Andersen G.R. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); however, there has been no three-dimensional structural information available for any of the FIMs or for any other domains within C6 or C7. The closely related FIM within fI has been postulated to resemble a follistatin domain (26.Ullman C.G. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 939-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, however, disulfide mapping of human C6 isolated from plasma appeared to exclude that possibility (27.Lengweiler S. Schaller J. DiScipio R.G. Rickli E.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional arrangement of the neighboring FIMs, and the extent of interactions between them, has also been a mystery. We previously described a protein construct comprising the carboxyl-terminal pair of FIMs from human C7 (18.Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which folds homogeneously and binds to C5 in surface plasmon resonance assays. Here we report the solution structure of this consecutive pair of FIMs. This new structure reveals that, despite previous evidence to the contrary, each FIM adopts a follistatin-like fold, and the two FIMs are intimately associated to form a homodimer-like, pseudosymmetrical carboxyl terminus of C7. This work, therefore, serendipitously provides the first published structure of a follistatin-domain pair in the absence of ligand and suggests that conformational changes within FIM pairs accompany ligand binding. Novel structures of the FIMs from both C6 and fI have been modeled based upon our NMR-derived solution structure of the C7-FIMs. C7-FIMs, encompassing residues Asn693 to Gln843 of C7 with an amino-terminal His6 tag, was cloned previously (18.Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J.

The His6-tagged protein was captured using a Co2+ affinity column, the His6 tag was then cleaved with thrombin before noncleaved material, and the His6 tag was removed via a re-pass down the Co2+ affinity column. The cleaved protein was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Supelco Discovery BIO Wide Pore C8 column; Supelco Inc., PA), eluting with an acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, before lyophilization and resuspension into NMR buffer. Characterization of the purified protein was carried out using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. NMR sample conditions were optimized by analysis of two-dimensional 15N,1H HSQC spectra at a range of protein concentrations (0.1–1.0 mm), salt concentrations (0–150 mm), buffers (Arg-Glu (29.Golovanov A.P.

Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E. D Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). Assignment of the NOE spectroscopy data was carried out using a combination of 10% manual peak assignment and 90% automated assignment within the structure calculation software CYANA 2.1 (31.Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 32.Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). All of the proline residues were defined as trans on the basis of chemical shifts and NOEs between Hα(Pron−1) and Hδ(Pron). All 18 cysteines were inferred to be disulfide-bonded on the basis of accurate mass spectrometry. Therefore, although no specific disulfide linkages were initially incorporated, all of the cysteine residues were defined as in the oxidized state in the structure calculations. The incidence of hydrogen bonds between backbone amides and carboxyl groups was determined on the basis of amide exchange retardation as observed in 15N,1H HSQC spectra collected 1 h after the protein was transferred to 99.9% (v/v) deuterated buffer. The hydrogen bond acceptor of the protected amide was then inferred from the corresponding network of NOEs. The CYANA calculation comprised a seven-cycle routine using combined, automated, NOE assignment, and structure determination. The upper limit distance constraints generated were transferred into the crystallography and NMR system (33.Bünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Structure calculations proceeded iteratively with inclusion of hydrogen bonds, ambiguous disulfide bridges, dihedral restraints generated using TALOS (35.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar), and, finally, unambiguous disulfide bridges. An ensemble of 25 structures was calculated based on the converged set from 100 structures calculated. In addition a further set of structures were calculated without disulfide bonds Cys773–Cys782 and Cys776–Cys789 explicitly constrained; this yielded 23 converged structures (from 100) of differing disulfide linkages in this region, although as expected, the overall structure was not affected. All 48 converged structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (36.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

For analysis of the structures calculated, intermodular interactions including hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges were assessed using PIC (42.Tina K.G. Bhadra R. Srinivasan N.

The buried surface area at the intermodular junctions was calculated using GETAREA 1.0 (50.Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar), being computed as: (SA Modulei + SA Modulej) − SA Bimoduleij. Intermodular angles were determined using the same protocol as previously described (51.Barlow P.N. Steinkasserer A. Norman D.G. Kieffer B. Wiles A.P. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

Bioinformat. 2004; 56: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of C6-FIMs was modeled using, as a template, the structure of C7-FIMs closest to that of the mean from the ensemble generated in structure calculations. The single FIM in fI (fI-FIM) was modeled using the carboxyl-terminal FIM (C7-FIM2) from the closest-to-mean structure of C7-FIMs as the template. C6-FIMs and fI-FIM share 32 and 25% sequence identity with their templates, respectively. The optimal alignment between the targets and template sequences was achieved using an initial multiple sequence alignment of homologous protein sequences from a range of differing genera employing the program PROMALS3-D (54.Pei J. Tang M. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W30-W34Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Related sequences for C6-FIMs were first identified via the [email protected] server (55.Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem.

Because the FIM from fI exhibits a lower degree of sequence similarity to its template sequence, in this case a remote hidden Markov model (58.Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4066) Google Scholar), search methodology was employed to identify related sequences prior to alignment (data not shown). The resulting target-template alignments were manually refined from the multiple sequence alignment to place gaps optimally guided by positioning of predicted and identified secondary structure elements. Twenty models were built for each protein using the program Modeler 9v6 (59.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10563) Google Scholar), and the one with the lowest objective function score was selected as the representative model. The quality of the models was assessed using PROCHECK v3.5.4 (40.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 41.Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) and ProQ (60.Wallner B. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein fragment C7-FIMs, encompassing residues Asn693 to Gln843 of human C7 with an amino-terminal His6 tag (and where Gln843 is the carboxyl-terminal residue of the complete C7 protein), was expressed as a soluble, folded protein in the Origami B strain of E. coli. The affinity tag was removed by thrombin, leaving four non-native residues (Gly-Ser-His-Met) at the new amino terminus. Protein expression levels in rich or isotopically enriched media were typically 4 mg liter−1, yielding sufficient high quality protein to enable a solution state structure determination of C7-FIMs by NMR spectroscopy. Protein purity and the presence of nine disulfide bonds were confirmed by mass spectrometry (28.Phelan M.M. Thai C.T. Herbert A.P. Bella J. Uhrin D. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. Bramham J. Biomol NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The 15N-, and 15N,13C-labeled samples of C7-FIMs yielded high quality NMR spectra, thus permitting assignment of 90% of 1H, 15N, and 13C nuclei (28.Phelan M.M. Thai C.T. Herbert A.P. Bella J. Uhrin D. Ogata R.T. Barlow P.N. Bramham J. Biomol NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The missing backbone assignments arise from the four non-native amino-terminal residues and three stretches of residues within FIM2 (Cys773–Gly774, Cys776–Trp779, and Asp783–Lys788). There was an absence of observable backbone resonances corresponding to these regions despite exploration of a variety of protein concentrations, ionic strengths, temperatures, pH values, and field strengths. All eight proline residues were judged to be trans on the basis of chemical shift differences δCβ − δCγ and NOEs between Hδ (Pron) and Hα (Pron−1). Initial NMR structures were determined using 2702 NOE-derived restraints. A total of 154 ϕ and ψ dihedral angle restraints were deduced using TALOS (35.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and incorporated into subsequent calculations. Early structure calculations containing only NOE data confirmed 28 hydrogen bonds that had been inferred by deuterium exchange; these were incorporated into the next round of calculations. Seven of the nine disulfide bonds inferred from mass spectrometry were clearly identified by supporting NOEs (often Cβ-Cβ) and by the proximity of pairs of cysteines in these initially calculated structures (Cys702–Cys713, Cys715–Cys750, Cys721–Cys743, Cys728–Cys763, Cys791–C825, Cys797–Cys818, and Cys805–Cys838). These disulfide bonds were therefore included (61.Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) in subsequent refinement calculations. The remaining four cysteines (Cys773, Cys776, Cys782, and Cys789) lie in, or close to, an apparently flexible region of FIM2. Consequently, the complete disulfide bonding pattern of C7-FIMs could not be unambiguously determined from the NMR data; nor could it be uniquely determined by protease digest and mass spectrometry because of the lack of appropriate cleavage sites. In the final structure calculations, disulfide bonds Cys773–Cys782 and Cys776–Cys789 were inferred on the basis of the alignment of FIM2 with FIM1 and in agreement with the previously observed preference for such a linkage arrangement, termed a disulfide β-cross, in other protein structures (62.Harrison P.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ensemble of 25 structures with lowest NOE-derived energies converged well overall, as may be judged from backbone overlays and from the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of the Cα coordinates and the heavy atoms (Fig. 2, a and b, and Table 1). The initial residues of FIM2 (Cys773, Gly774, Pro777, and Leu778), which lie adjacent to the intermodular linker, form a solvent-exposed loop that did not converge during structure calculations because of the low number of NOEs observed in this region; this is reflected in the high RMSDs of the relevant Cα coordinates (Fig. 2b). Relaxation experiments (T1, T2, and 1H,15N NOE) identified residues Ala767–Ala772, as undergoing motion faster than the overall molecular tumbling (Fig. 2b). These residues are located in the linker region connecting the two modules indicating a significant amount of flexibility here; this is reflected by the lack of convergence observed in this region, depicted in the overlay (Fig. 2a). The surface-exposed loop within the β-hairpin (see below) of FIM2, Asp783–Ser787, is also likely to be very flexible; again there is a dearth of detectable NMR signals for these residues, indicative of conformational movement on the intermediate timescale (milliseconds). However, because of the lack of observed resonances, this dynamic behavior could not be confirmed by NMR relaxation data. The relaxation data also identified two solvent-exposed residues within FIM1 and FIM2 that may be considered mobile: Asn754 within FIM1 and Arg792 within FIM2.TABLE 1Structural statistics for the lowest energy structuresNumber of lowest energy structures25Upper limit distance constraintsIntraresidue618Sequential770Intermediate range (2–4 residues)402Long range (>4)912Total2702Intermodular124FIM1 to linker11FIM2 to linker38Hydrogen bonds28Disulfides explicit9Root mean square deviations (Å)All heavy atoms1.53Backbone atoms Cα, N, COFIM10.74FIM20.94Both modules0.95Skew, twist, and tilt angles (°)28, 161, 100Ramachandran assessment (%)Most favored81.5Additionally allowed17.2Generously allowed1.1Disallowed0.2Coarse packing Whatif score−1.53Buried surface area of intermodular junction (Å2)1237.69"

This structural similarity and the presence of viral genes coding for other base excision repair proteins suggest that pol X functions in a manner similar to pol β, but inconsistencies concerning pol X catalysis have been reported. We examined the structural and functional properties of two forms of pol X using spectroscopic and kinetic analysis. Using 1H-15N correlated NMR, we unambiguously demonstrated the slow interconversion of pol X between a reduced (pol Xred) and an oxidized form (pol Xox), confirmed by mass spectrometry. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that pol Xox, with a disulfide bond between Cys-81 and Cys-86, has ∼10-fold lower fidelity than pol Xred during dNTP insertion opposite a template G. The disulfide linkage is located between two β-strands in the palm domain, near the putative dNTP-binding site. Structural alignment of pol X with a pol β ternary structure suggests that the disulfide switch may modulate fidelity by altering the ability of the palm domain to align and stabilize the primer terminus and catalytic metal ion for deprotonation of the 3′-OH group and subsequent phosphoryl transfer. Thus, DNA polymerase fidelity is altered by the redox state of the enzyme and its related conformational changes.

It is an economically significant disease with a potential of epidemic proportions resulting in losses of livestock. ASFV is a large icosahedral, cytoplasmic deoxyvirus prone to interactions with host macrophages (2.Enjuanes L. Cubero I. Viñuela E. J. Gen.

Although genetically similar to the poxviruses, it is structurally closer to the iridoviruses but sufficiently different from both such that it has recently been classified as the founding member of its own family, the Asfarviridae family (African swine fever and related viruses) (3.Salas M.L.

Vigário J.D. Terrinha A.M. Arch. Virol. 1975; 49: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or perinuclear inclusion bodies. These factories contain high levels of viral structural proteins, viral DNA, and membranous material needed for particle assembly (14.Brookes S.M. Dixon L.K. Parkhouse R.M.

However, the mature virion was shown to be resistant to oxidation upon release in the oxygen-rich cytosol or extracellular space (21.Cobbold C. Windsor M. Parsley J. Baldwin B. Wileman T. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Maturation of the virus involves the initial formation of an empty particle within the virus factory, which is then filled by the separately formed nucleoproteins and viral DNA (22.Andrés G.

Upon leaving the virus factory, these mature virions are infectious (25.Andrés G. Alejo A. Simón-Mateo C. Salas M.L. J. Biol.

The ASFV genome codes for a number of proteins vitally involved in DNA replication, including a minimal repair system (6.Yáñez R.J. Rodríguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enríquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), consistent with the later stage replication inside the perinuclear space. pol X, one of the two DNA polymerases encoded in the ASFV genome, is a close structural analogue of the well known mammalian DNA polymerase pol β (27.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), involved in the BER pathway (28.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K.

Additional enzymes consistent with the presence of a viral BER pathway were found in the ASFV genome, i.e. an apurinic endonuclease, phosphodiesterase, and ATP-dependent DNA ligase (6.Yáñez R.J.

Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14826-14833Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). pol X is only one-half the size of pol β, matches the structure of the palm (nucleotidyltransferase) and finger (dNTP selection) domains exceptionally well, and has ∼55% sequence identity to the C terminus of pol β (30.Showalter A.K. Byeon I.J. Su M.I. Tsai M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Notably, pol X is missing the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase and thumb domains present in pol β. pol X is generally considered an error-prone polymerase, but the level of fidelity has been debated in the literature (29.Lamarche B.J. Kumar S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14826-14833Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31.García-Escudero R. García-Díaz M. Salas M.L. Blanco L. Salas J. J. Mol.

Although the actual level of pol X fidelity is not entirely clear from the conflicting reports, it does appear that the enzyme can catalyze misinsertion of dGTP opposite template G in a relatively facile manner, leading to the hypothesis that pol X may be involved in mutagenesis of the viral genome (30.Showalter A.K.

In this study we focused on the presence of the reduced and oxidized forms of pol X and its biochemical implications. The two forms are distinguished by the formation of either a disulfide bridge between Cys-81 and Cys-86 or their free thiols. Both cysteines reside in the palm domain of pol X and are the only cysteines present in the protein. They also present the main difference in the two NMR solution structures that have been published (30.Showalter A.K. Byeon I.J. Su M.I. Tsai M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36.Maciejewski M.W. Shin R. Pan B. Marintchev A. Denninger A. Mullen M.A. Chen K. Gryk M.R. Mullen G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One structure was described to contain reduced cysteines (36.Maciejewski M.W. Shin R. Pan B. Marintchev A. Denninger A. Mullen M.A. Chen K. Gryk M.R. Mullen G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the other structure was reported to contain a disulfide linkage (30.Showalter A.K. Byeon I.J. Su M.I. Tsai M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The latter structure was based on the sole observation of two downfield-shifted 13C-β cysteine resonances. Interestingly, both of the reported buffer systems contained the reducing agent DTT at 10 mm (36.Maciejewski M.W. Shin R. Pan B. Marintchev A. Denninger A. Mullen M.A. Chen K. Gryk M.R. Mullen G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and 1 mm (30.Showalter A.K. Byeon I.J. Su M.I. Tsai M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), respectively, which was not sufficient to keep the protein in the reduced form for the second structure. We report unambiguous confirmation of the presence of both oxidation states by NMR and MS, show how the equilibrium can be shifted reversibly between the two states by modifying the buffer conditions, and describe an NMR method to monitor the oxidation state in pol X. More importantly, we also demonstrate through steady-state kinetic analysis that there are significant functional differences between the reduced and oxidized forms of pol X, necessitating consideration of the oxidation state in catalytic experiments. No other DNA polymerase has been shown to exist in two oxidation states nor to exhibit mechanisms of catalysis that depend upon the redox state of the enzyme. The results reported here expand our understanding of how DNA polymerases facilitate genomic replication and may represent a previously unappreciated aspect of viral mutagenesis. Heterologous expression of isotopically labeled 15N and 15N/13C full-length ASFV pol X (residues 1–174) was done in Escherichia coli as described (34.Oliveros M. Yáñez R.J. Salas M.L. Salas J.

The standard NMR buffer contained 20 mm PIPES-Na (pH 6.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3 (w/v), 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. DTT (up to 100 mm) was added to the buffer to ensure fully reduced samples, whereas buffer without DTT was used for oxidized pol X samples. To expedite the oxidation, the buffer was oxygen-saturated by bubbling pure O2 through the solution. Samples were concentrated in Ultra-15 Amicon centrifugal filter units (10,000 NMWL, Millipore, Billerica, MA) in a swinging bucket rotor at 4,000 × g. Final volumes from 100 to 500 μl were used. Buffer exchanges were achieved by diluting the concentrated sample with 5 ml of the new buffer followed by a re-concentration step, repeating the procedure three to five times. All NMR samples contained 5% D2O (v/v) as a lock substance. The oxidation state of pol X was monitored by 1H-15N HSQC (39.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) experiments at 20 °C using an AVANCE spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) at either 500.13 or 800.13 MHz. Both instruments were equipped with a triple resonance inverse cryogenically cooled NMR probe. The small samples used for biological assays were measured in 1.7-mm NMR tubes using the MATCHTM system (both Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA), requiring only 40 μl of protein solution (at a concentration of 200 μm) in NMR buffer. All other measurements were done with samples containing about 500 μm protein solution in a volume of 300 μl of NMR buffer, prepared in 4-mm NMR tubes, inserted in a 5-mm outer tube (both Wilmad-LabGlass, Buena, NJ) that contained D2O as lock solvent (40.Voehler M.W.

Further parameters were as follows: spectral width 12 ppm, 1024 complex points in the 1H dimension, 32 ppm with 128 complex points in the 15N dimension, and a relaxation delay of 1.2 s. Data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe and NMRDraw software (44.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). Data processing included zero filling in the acquisition dimension and linear prediction followed by zero filling in the indirect dimension, resulting in a data matrix of 2048 × 512, a π/2-shifted squared sine window function in both dimensions, and a time domain convolution function to suppress the residual water signal (45.Marion D. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 425-430Google Scholar). NMR experiments for chemical shift assignments of the backbone of an oxidized sample of pol X were performed at 20 °C on an AVANCE spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) at 600.13 MHz, equipped with triple resonance inverse cryogenically cooled NMR probe. Resonance assignments for 1HN, 15N, 13C-α, 13C-β, and 13C=O were made using the connectivities derived from the HNCACB, CBCAcoNH, HNCA, HNcoCA, HNcaCO, and HNCO spectra (46.Wittekind M. Mueller L. J.

Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Figures of molecular structures were prepared using PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Preparation of the labeled primers was as follows: [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3 × 103 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Bio-Spin columns were obtained from Bio-Rad. Primer strands were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (1 h at 37 °C followed by treatment at 95 °C for 20 min), passed over Bio-Spin columns to remove excess [γ-32P]ATP. A 15/12/28-mer “gapped” DNA substrate (Fig. 1A) was prepared by annealing 32P-labeled primer (15-mer) with template oligonucleotide (28-mer) and unlabeled downstream complementary strand (p-12-mer) by heating a 1:1:1 solution of oligonucleotides to 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to room temperature. The 13/18-mer DNA substrate (Fig. 1B) was prepared in a similar fashion. The gapped substrate (200 nm) was then incubated with pol Xox/red (100 nm) and extended in the presence of a mixture of all four dNTPs. The presence of >95% pol Xox or pol Xred was verified by NMR for each sample prior to its use. Each reaction was initiated by adding dNTP·Mg2+ (1 mm of each dNTP and 5 mm MgCl2) solution to the preincubated pol X·DNA complex. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μg ml−1 BSA and 10% (v/v) glycerol, with or without DTT (10 mm) for reduced and oxidized enzyme, respectively. At the indicated time, 4-μl aliquots were quenched with 36 μl of a 95% formamide (v/v), 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue (w/v), 0.1% xylene cyanol (w/v) solution and were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide (w/v), 7 m urea gel. pol X-catalyzed single nucleotide incorporation was measured over a range of dNTP concentrations for both primer-template (13/18-mer) and gapped (15/12/28-mer) DNA substrates. Two samples of purified pol X were prepared, one under reducing conditions (100 mm DTT) and one in which the enzyme was in the completely oxidized state, both verified by NMR. All reactions for the reduced enzyme were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 100 μg ml−1 BSA, and 5% glycerol (v/v). All reactions for the oxidized enzyme were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg ml−1 BSA, and 5% glycerol (v/v). pol X (10 nm) was preincubated with the 32P-end-labeled primer-template complex (100 nm), and the reaction was initiated by adding varying amounts of dNTP with Mg2+ (5 mm). Aliquots (5 ml) were quenched with 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue (w/v), 0.1% xylene cyanol (w/v) solution and were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide (w/v), 7 m urea gel. The products were then visualized using a Bio-Rad Molecular FX PhosphorImager device and quantitated using Quantity OneTM software (both Bio-Rad). The initial portion of the velocity curve was fit to a linear equation in the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, San Diego). The resulting velocity was plotted as a function of dNTP concentration and then fit to a hyperbola, correcting for enzyme concentration, to obtain estimates of kcat and Km,dNTP. The limit of detection was assumed to equal a product signal that is three times the noise level (∼1%). An estimate for the lower limit of catalytic efficiency for pol Xred misincorporation events on 13/18-mer DNA substrates was calculated by assuming that the minimum rate of nucleotide incorporation that could be detected under the experimental conditions used (8 h, 10 nm pol X, 100 nm DNA) was <0.002 nm min−1, i.e. a minimum detectable kcat of <0.0002 min−1 when corrected for enzyme concentration. Plotting the minimum rate detectable against the maximum nucleotide concentration used in the misincorporation experiments (2.5 mm), taking the slope of the resulting line, and correcting for enzyme concentration provides an estimate for the lower limit of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km,dNTP) to be approximately <10−8 min−1 μm−1. Samples of 15N-labeled pol Xox and pol Xred (10–25 nmol, oxidation state verified by NMR) were digested overnight at 37 °C using 0.1 μg of trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega, Madison, WI) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 2 m urea and 1 mm CaCl2. Alternatively, samples were alkylated prior to digestion using 10 mm iodoacetamide. LC-MS/MS analysis of the peptides was performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) equipped with an Eksigent NanoLC-AS1 Autosampler 2.08, the Eksigent NanoLC-1D plus high performance liquid chromatography pump (Eksigent, Dublin, CA), and Nanospray source. The peptides were resolved on a packed fused silica capillary column, 100 μm × 15 cm, packed with octadecylsilane (C18) resin (Jupiter C18, 5 μm, 300 Å, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), and coupled with an in-line trapping column (100 μm × 4 cm) packed with the same C18 resin (using a frit generated with liquid silicate Kasil (55.Cortes H.J. Pfeiffer C.D. Richter B.E. Stevens T.S. J. High Res. Chromatogr. 1987; 10: 446-448Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar)). LC was carried out at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 0.5 μl min−1 using a gradient mixture of 0.1% (v/v) HCO2H in H2O (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) HCO2H in CH3CN (solvent B). The flow rate during the loading and desalting phase of the gradient was 1.5 μl min−1 and during separation phase was 500 nl min−1. A 95-min gradient was performed with a 10-min washing period diverted to waste after the pre-column (100% solvent A for the first 10 min followed by a gradient to 98% solvent A, v/v, at 15 min) to allow for removal of any residual salts. After the initial washing period, a 60-min gradient was performed where the first 35 min was a slow, linear gradient from 98% solvent A to 75% A, followed by a faster gradient to 10% solvent A at 65 min and an isocratic phase at 10% solvent A to 75 min. Orbitrap full MS scans were collected in profile mode at 60,000 resolution and a maximum injection time of 1 s. Data-dependent MS/MS scans were acquired for the five most intense ions from the full scan using an isolation width of 2 m/z, an activation time of 30 ms, a 30% normalized collision energy, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Charge states of 1+ and >4+ were excluded from consideration for MS/MS, and a dynamic exclusion list of 50 ions was used to allow collection of MS/MS spectra from lower abundance peptides. The instrument was operated in preview mode to allow for concurrent collection of MS/MS spectra during the Orbitrap scan. A comparison of various 1H-15N HSQC data collected on pol X indicated that a number of amide resonances were shifting with time (Fig. 2). The chemical shifts from a freshly prepared pol X sample were in good agreement with the data deposited at the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank by Maciejewski et al. (36.Maciejewski M.W. Shin R.

Denninger A. Mullen G.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), but this was no longer the case after 4–6 months for those shifting peaks. Between measurements, the sample was maintained without further manipulation at 4 °C in the standard buffer, containing 5 mm DTT. Although DTT is a useful reducing agent, oxidation has been reported in aerated solutions over time (56.Chang H.W. Bock E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 57.Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 58.Newton A.C.

Furthermore, the reducing power is decreased at pH values <7, where the reactive thiolate form is protonated. With no other changes apparent (except for a pot"
https://openalex.org/W2076168498,"We have investigated the structural basis of processive GATC methylation by the Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase, which is critical in chromosome replication and mismatch repair. We determined the contribution of the orthologically conserved phosphate interactions involving residues Arg(95), Asn(126), Asn(132), Arg(116), and Lys(139), which directly contact the DNA outside the cognate recognition site (GATC) to processive catalysis, and that of residue Arg(137), which is not conserved and contacts the DNA backbone within the GATC sequence. Alanine substitutions at the conserved positions have large impacts on processivity yet do not impact k(cat)/K(m)(DNA) or DNA affinity (K(D)(DNA)). However, these mutants cause large preferences for GATC sites varying in flanking sequences when considering the pre-steady state efficiency constant k(chem)/K(D)(DNA). These changes occur mainly at the level of the methylation rate constant, which results in the observed decreases in processive catalysis. Thus, processivity and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)(DNA)) are uncoupled in these mutants. These results reveal that the binding energy involved in DNA recognition contributes to the assembly of the active site rather than tight binding. Furthermore, the conserved residues (Arg(95), Asn(126), Asn(132), and Arg(116)) repress the modulation of the response of the enzyme to flanking sequence effects. Processivity impacted mutants do not show substrate-induced dimerization as is observed for the wild type enzyme. This study describes the structural means by which an enzyme that does not completely enclose its substrate has evolved to achieve processive catalysis, and how interactions with DNA flanking the recognition site alter this processivity."
https://openalex.org/W2098337777,"It has been hypothesized that translational efficiency is determined by the amount of secondary structure in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of mRNA. Here, we examined whether specific 5'-UTRs with excessive secondary structure selectively regulate translational efficiency in adult cardiocytes. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated to express reporter mRNAs consisting of the 5'-UTR derived from c-jun or ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) fused to beta-galactosidase (betaGal) coding sequence. Each adenovirus expressed GFP mRNA as a control for 5'-UTRs with minimal secondary structure. Subsequently, cardiocytes were electrically stimulated to contract at 1 Hz to accelerate protein synthesis as compared to quiescent controls. Translational efficiency was calculated by measuring protein expression as a function of mRNA levels. Translational efficiency of c-jun/betaGal mRNA increased significantly by 3.7-fold in contracting vs. quiescent cardiocytes, but ODC/betaGal mRNA was unchanged. Contraction increased c-jun/betaGal mRNA levels in polyribosomes by 2.3-fold, which indicates that translational efficiency was enhanced by mobilization. A short, unstructured 5'-UTR was sufficient for efficient translation of betaGal mRNA in quiescent and contracting cardiocytes. GFP mRNA produced similar results. These studies demonstrate that the 5'-UTR functions as a determinant of translational efficiency of specific mRNAs, such as c-jun, that regulate growth of the adult cardiocyte."
