https://openalex.org/W1956168554,"It is shown, by flash technique, that the light-initiated interconversions between the red (Pr) and far red (Pfr) forms of phytochrome occur in a complex series of steps. For the transformation Pr → Pfr at 0°, the initial photoreaction is followed by four dark processes in the interval from 0.1 msec to 5 sec after the flash. The initial photoproduct has a peak at 695 mµ and no far red absorption. In the reverse reaction, Pfr → Pr, two dark processes are observed in the interval from 0.1 msec to 10 msec, and the intermediates show no far red absorption. The transformations are first order in phytochrome. Rate constants and spectra are given for all six distinguishable stages of the interconversion. The effects are attributed to a combination of sequential and parallel processes, involving conformational changes of the chromophore and possibly also of the protein. The kinetic and spectroscopic evidence indicates that in the photoconversion of Pr the photochemical act leads, through an intervening dark step, to three different intermediates, which then react independently to form Pfr. Two such parallel intermediates may appear in the formation of Pr from Pfr. Comparisons are made between the two photoreversible systems, phytochrome and rhodopsin."

https://openalex.org/W1656023616,"Abstract The conditions have been described for measuring quantitatively phosphocholine-glyceride transferase and choline phosphokinase activities in microgram quantities of nervous tissue. It was observed that the various parameters affecting enzyme activity in brain are quite similar to those previously reported for the liver enzyme. The enzymatic formation of labeled phosphatidylcholine from 14C-cytidine diphosphocholine was stimulated more than 20-fold on the addition of D-α,β-diglyceride to the incubation mixtures. Diglycerides having a high degree of unsaturated fatty acids were the most active substrates. The activity of phosphocholine-glyceride transferase was elevated in neonatal brain tissue (peak activity at 10 to 20 days postnatally). The enzyme activity was also elevated in a peripheral nerve undergoing demyelination. The neurone-rich grey structures of adult rabbit brain were 2- to 8-fold more active than adjacent white (myelinated) matter. Phosphocholine-glyceride transferase was predominantly located in the microsomal fraction of brain, but it is suggested that a significant portion of activity is also present in mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1593796168,"The increased incorporation of 32P into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol in polymorphonuclear leukocytes undergoing phagocytosis is not secondary to an elevated specific activity of adenosine triphosphate during phagocytosis. The incorporation of labeled glycerol, oleic acid, and linolenic acid into the above phosphatides is not increased on stimulation of phagocytosis. Phosphatidic acid is synthesized directly from α-glycerophosphate added to the incubation medium, but this synthesis is not increased on stimulation of phagocytosis. If it is assumed that the α-glycerophosphate which enters the cell is accessible to all of the intracellular α-glycerophosphate this result argues against the increased synthesis of phosphatidic acid being catalyzed by α-glycerophosphate acylase. The formation of phosphatidic acid in homogenates of leukocytes from ATP and diglyceride or monoglyceride was, respectively, 20 and 12 times that from α-glycerophosphate and palmityl coenzyme A plus oleyl coenzyme A. These results suggest that the increased synthesis of phosphatidic acid on induction of phagocytosis may be brought about by diglyceride kinase or possibly monoglyceride kinase plus lysophosphatidic acid acylase. The incorporation of labeled inositol into phosphatidylinositol is increased in cells undergoing phagocytosis, indicating that the increased incorporation of 32P into this phosphatide is not solely a result of a higher specific activity of phosphatidic acid, which may be the precursor for phosphatidylinositol in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1514157157,"Abstract The phosphorylcholine cytidyltransferase activity of fresh rat liver supernatant fractions was observed to be stimulated by boiled, previously incubated particulate fractions of rat liver. This stimulation was shown to be mediated by the phospholipids present in the latter. Treatment of rat liver supernatant fractions with acetone and butanol to remove phospholipids resulted hi very low transferase activity which could be increased up to 25-fold by the addition of suitable phospholipid preparations. Lipid extracts of fresh rat liver homogenates did not stimulate transferase activity unless they were exposed to a continuous flow of air for 15 hours leading to lipid oxidation. Fractionation of the phospholipids of fresh and incubated rat liver homogenates showed that lysophosphatides were present in higher concentrations in the latter and were the most active phospholipids in stimulating transferase activity. Similarly, highly purified egg lecithin showed little ability to stimulate transferase activity whereas egg lysolecithin was highly active. None of the individual isolated phospholipids stimulated to the same degree as unfractionated rat liver lipid preparations. The stimulation of transferase activity by degraded phospholipids is suggested to represent a positive feedback mechanism for the control of phospholipid synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1605450427,Abstract Kinetic studies comparing methanethiosulfonate and thiosulfate as rhodanese substrates have shown that the cleavage of the thiosulfate sulfur-sulfur bond limits the over-all maximum velocity of the thiosulfate-cyanide sulfur transfer reaction. A kinetically significant enzyme-thiosulfate complex has thus been shown. The same studies have indicated that the Michaelis constant for thiosulfate is a true dissociation constant for this complex. Infrared spectral studies and experiments involving the reaction between thiosulfonates and cyanide in nonenzymic systems have shown that the reactivity of the planetary sulfur atom toward cyanide is enhanced by a shift of electrons away from the sulfur-sulfur bond. Studies of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction between the thiosulfonates and cyanide have suggested that one aspect of enzymic catalysis in the thiosulfate reaction is such a shift of electrons away from the sulfur-sulfur bond. A basis for the anomalous behavior of aromatic substrates has been discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1491370718,"Abstract In order to investigate the specificity of streptococcal proteinase, the peptides formed during proteolysis of the reduced, carboxymethylated phenylalanyl chain of insulin have been isolated and identified. One of the bonds most rapidly hydrolyzed was the Phe-Tyr linkage in the -Phe-Phe-Tyr-sequence. With this result as a lead, a series of synthetic substrates was tested. The results of experiments with acyl dipeptides and with the insulin chain showed that the chief requirement for hydrolysis is the presence of a bulky side chain on the ammo acid adjacent, on the amino-terminal side, to the residue contributing the carbonyl to the susceptible peptide bond. This side chain appears to be important for the binding of substrate to the active center of the enzyme. The residues actually linked by the bond are not so critical, although the results with the acyl dipeptides indicate that there may be a secondary hydrophobic binding of the side chain of the amino acid donating the nitrogen to the susceptible peptide bond. Studies of Vmax and Km for the hydrolysis of several benzyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanyl peptides showed that, in these cases, deacylation of an acyl enzyme is not rate-limiting. The variations of Vmax and Km with pH were studied. A graph of log Vmax with respect to pH showed one inflection at pH 6.4 whereas a graph of pKm with respect to pH had two inflections, one at pH 6.4 and the other at pH 8.4. These results are compatible with the conclusion that an unprotonated imidazole ring and the protonated form of the single sulfhydryl group are essential for activity."

Harvested leaves were subjected to three curing conditions. The major portion of the lead-210 in the plant was probably absorbed through the roots. Airborne radon 222 and its daughters contributed much less to the plant's content of lead-210 and of polonium-210. The stage of leaf development and the methods used to cure the leaf affected the final amount of polonium-210 in tobacco leaf."

https://openalex.org/W1997339231,"The rate of pyruvate oxidation by mitochondria from blowfly flight muscle decreased in the presence of tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris). An increase in the rate of mitochondrial swelling was concomitant with the loss of pyruvate oxidation. These changes were prevented by bovine serum albumin, adenosine triphosphate, and magnesium ions, factors required for mitochondrial contraction. Proline, but not glutamate or malate, restored the rate of pyruvate oxidation to original values. These findings suggest that mitochondrial swelling leads to leakage of intramitochondrial intermediates of the Krebs cycle, accounting for the decrease in the rate of pyruvate oxidation. Exogenous proline penetrates the mitochondrial membrane and is rapidly oxidized, via glutamate, forming intramitochondrial precursors of oxaloacetate. Malate and glutamate were ineffective because of the selective permeability of the mitochondrial membrane."

One (Fraction I) has two α bands and two Soret bands in liquid nitrogen difference spectra and thus appears to possess two heme groups. A molecular weight of 27,000 was determined by chromatography on Sephadex G-75. Protoheme was shown to be the prosthetic group of this pigment, and the Eo' was found to be +0.10 volt. It is only very slowly autoxidizable. The other pigment (Fraction II) is very autoxidizable and has an Eo' of -0.09 volt. The prosthetic group of this protein is also protoheme, and it has a molecular weight of 22,500. The properties of both pigments are discussed in relation to their possible roles as the terminal oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1552352424,"Abstract Bisulfite reacts rapidly with glucose oxidase to produce characteristic changes in the absorbance and fluorescence of the enzyme. When the bisulfite-treated enzyme is dialyzed against buffer, the active native enzyme is regenerated. The visible absorption spectrum of the glucose oxidase-bisulfite product is similar to but not identical with that of the reduced enzyme in which the bound flavin is in the fully reduced form (FADH2). A major difference between reduced enzyme and the glucose oxidase-bisulfite product is the failure of the latter compound to react with electron acceptors such as oxygen, ferricyanide, or sulfate. The formation of an addition compound between glucose oxidase and bisulfite has been postulated. The proportion of combined to uncombined enzyme was found to be dependent on the absolute concentration of the reactants (not their ratio), the temperature, and the pH. The presence of 4M urea depressed the amount of complex formed. The complex has been shown to be enzymically inactive by the stopped flow method. Bisulfite reacts with free flavins when very high concentrations are used. A dissociation constant of 4M has been calculated for the flavin mononucleotide-bisulfite complex. The reaction of bisulfite with glucose oxidase brings about shifts and large increases in the blue fluorescence (emission peak, 450 mµ; excitation peaks, 360 and 290 mµ) and also the ultraviolet fluorescence (emission peak, 340 mµ; excitation peak, 290 mµ) of the enzyme. The bound FAD in glucose oxidase does not fluoresce. The blue fluorescence is a property of a component of the enzyme which has not yet been characterized, while the ultraviolet fluorescence is primarily a property of the aromatic amino acid residues of the protein. The fluorescence and absorbance changes correlate during the titration of the enzyme with bisulfite, and are affected by the temperature, pH, and urea concentration in similar ways. It is proposed that both types of change are a function of the formation of an enzyme-bisulfite complex. Active site groups such as the bound FAD and possibly the blue fluorophore are involved. This conclusion is further substantiated by fluorometric and absorbance experiments in which glucose has been shown to displace bisulfite slowly from the complex."

https://openalex.org/W1642751590,"Abstract Oleic acid was converted to dihydrosterculic acid (9,10-methyleneoctadecanoic acid) by Lactobacillus arabinosus cells. This was established by the mass spectra of branched chain esters formed by reductive opening of the cyclopropane ring of the corresponding cyclopropane fatty esters. The mass spectra allowed unambiguous assignment of the ring location to position 9,10. Oleic acid-9,10-d2 was converted to a dideuterated cyclopropane acid by L. arabinosus. This finding rules out intermediates in cyclopropane ring formation which have double bonds at carbon atom 9 or 10 after the extra carbon has been added, e.g. a 9,10-cyclopropene compound, 9- or 10-methylene compounds, or 9,10-olefins with a branched methyl group at position 9 or 10."

https://openalex.org/W2083232765,Increases in the extracellular concentration of calcium ions above 1.8 millimoles per liter caused a reversible decrease in the sensitivity of tmuscle postiunctional membrane to carbamylcholine. A quantitative study of the inhibitory effect of calcium ions on membrane depolarization produced by carbamylcholine indicates that calcium ions compete with carbamylcholine for some common binding sites on the postjunctional membrane. Calcium ions (20 millimoles per liter) caused a neuromuscular block wherein prolonged end plate potentials were produced after nerve stimulation. Calcium ions applied ionophoretically to the postjunctional membrane decreased the amplitude and prolonged the time course of the transient depolarization produced by ionophoretically applied carbamylcholine.
https://openalex.org/W1480455073,"Abstract The specificity of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconic (KDP-gluconate) aldolase for azomethine formation was studied by incubating α-carbonyl compounds and borohydride with the aldolase and determining the amount of inactivation sustained. Both pyruvate and α-ketobutyrate produced complete inactivation, whereas monohydroxyacetone, α-ketoisovalerate, α-ketoglutarate, 5-keto-4-deoxyglucarate, 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate were partially inhibitory. Hydroxypyruvate and 2-ketogluconate were not inhibitory; thus, it was concluded that the only major restriction upon azomethine formation was against the presence of a hydroxyl group at carbon 3. Formation of an azomethine with α-ketobutyrate prevented subsequent azomethine formation with pyruvate, and α-ketobutyrate under some conditions competed with pyruvate for azomethine formation. Thus, it was concluded that the same lysine residue is involved in azomethine formation for both keto acids. The curves of the effect of concentration of pyruvate and α-ketobutyrate show about a 40-fold lower affinity for α-ketobutyrate. The aldolase catalyzed the exchange of only 1 proton from water into α-ketobutyrate. The initial rate of exchange was at least 37-fold slower with α-ketobutyrate than with pyruvate. 2-Keto-4-hydroxyglutarate was cleaved at 0.1% of the rate with KDP-gluconate, whereas 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate was cleaved at a definite, but much slower, rate. Oxalacetate was decarboxylated at about 0.5% of the rate with KDP-gluconate. These data are interpreted as demonstrating a dissociation of azomethine formation, cleavage, and perhaps proton exchange phases of the over-all reaction catalyzed by KDP-gluconate aldolase."

https://openalex.org/W1489958568,"Abstract The increase in deoxyribonuclease activity after infection of Escherichia coli with bacteriophage T5 has been shown to be due to the synthesis of a DNase different from those known to be present in the host cell. During the course of T5 infection the enzyme appears at about the same time as the phage-induced deoxycytidylate kinase and DNA polymerase and only after most of the cellular DNA has been rendered acid-soluble. Purification of the T5-induced DNase resulted in a preparation that is at least 80% pure, as judged by gel electrophoresis. The following properties of the purified enzyme have been established. 1. It has a pH optimum of 9.3 and requires Mg++ or Mn++ for maximal activity. 2. It can degrade either native or heat-denatured DNA. 3. Its mode of attack appears to be both endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic, yielding a mixture of small oligonucleotides with an average chain length of 4 to 5 and mono-nucleotides terminated with a 5'-phosphoryl group. 4. The proportion of mononucleotides produced from native E. coli DNA is about 4 times greater than that produced from heat-denatured DNA."

A method is also described by which the dependence of the midpoint potential of a system on pH can be determined by titrating a buffered, partially reduced solution with alkali. Oxidation-reduction studies were performed on the pyridine, histidine, and imidazole hemochromes of heme a. A new species of the imidazole hemochrome of heme a was discovered; it has absorption bands at 456 and 610 mµ it is related to the imidazole hemochrome described in a previous paper (2) which has bands at 456 and 596 mµ under the conditions used here. The midpoint potentials found for the various hemochromes at pH 7.0 are: pyridine, +0.278 volt; histidine, -0.056 volt; histidine plus sodium dodecyl sulfate, -0.041 volt; strongly interacting imidazole hemochrome with bands at 456 and 596 mµ, +0.045 volt; strongly interacting imidazole hemochrome with bands at 456 and 610 mµ, +0.079 volt; sodium dodecyl sulfate added to the strongly interacting imidazole hemochrome, -0.038 volt. Structural interpretations are given insofar as possible to account for the potential versus pH data. The relationship of this work to cytochrome oxidase is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1535227204,"Abstract An aminoacyltransferase preparation has been obtained from a beef liver homogenate, and a 44-fold purification of the activity has been achieved. The enzyme preparation catalyzes both peptide synthesis from suitable amino acid esters (e.g. phenylalanine methyl ester, tyrosine methyl ester, leucine methyl ester) and the hydrolysis of such esters, the former process predominating at pH values near 7. Both actions are completely inhibited by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate. Evidence is presented to show that in the formation of dipeptides (e.g. phenylalanylphenylalanine) from amino acid esters (e.g. phenylalanine methyl ester), the corresponding dipeptide ester is an intermediate. In peptide synthesis, the enzyme preparation exhibits side chain specificity with respect to both the acyl donor and the amine acceptor, but the specificity with respect to the amine acceptor appears to be more restricted, and limited to esters of certain L-amino acids. Amino acid amides and peptide amides corresponding to susceptible esters are resistant to enzymic action."

https://openalex.org/W1486067184,"In elimination reactions, catalyzed by pyridoxal phosphate enzymes, from β- or γ-substituted 4-carbon amino acids, a transient intermediate is trapped by N-ethylmaleimide, leading to the accumulation of a new product in place of α-ketobutyrate. From examination of degradation products, this compound has tentatively been assigned the structure α-keto-3-[3'-(N'-ethyl-2',5'-dioxopyrrolidyl)]butyric acid (KEDB). KEDB has now been isolated in pure form as its dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNPH) derivative, as has the corresponding compound, α-keto-3-[3'-(2',5'-dioxopyrrolidyl)]butyric acid (KDB), formed when maleimide was substituted for N-ethylmaleimide. The molar specific radioactivity (compared with that of a labeled precursor) and ultraviolet absorbance of KEDB-DNPH were compatible with the molecular weight, 407, of the proposed structure, and the infrared spectrum indicated the presence of an intact succinimide ring. The presence or absence of optical activity could not be determined because of rapid racemization, as shown by interconversion of diastereoisomers, during the isolation procedure. The elementary composition of all the ions in a mass spectrum of KEDB-DNPH was determined. The peak of highest mass corresponded to the proposed structure less CO2. However, the spectrum of α-ketobutyrate-DNPH also showed only a weak molecular ion, and an intense peak reflecting decarboxylation. The spectrum of KDB-DNPH served to distinguish fragments originating from DNPH, which were of the same mass as those from KEDB-DNPH, from those containing the succinimidyl group, which were 28 mass units (C2H4) lower. The elemental composition of fragments thus shown to be derived from the succinimidyl moiety (C10H13NO4) of KEDB-DNPH, and containing 9, 8, or 6 carbon atoms, was consistent with plausible fragmentations of a structure in which N-ethylsuccinimide is connected with the carbonyl carbon of the α-keto acid moiety by —(CH3)CH—, whereas the low abundance of 7-carbon fragments was evidence against a linkage through a —CH2CH2— bridge."
