https://openalex.org/W2028557999,"Greater understanding of the mechanisms contributing to chemical and enzymatic solubilization of plant cell walls is critical for enabling cost-effective industrial conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels. Here, we report the use of correlative imaging in real time to assess the impact of pretreatment, as well as the resulting nanometer-scale changes in cell wall structure, upon subsequent digestion by two commercially relevant cellulase systems. We demonstrate that the small, noncomplexed fungal cellulases deconstruct cell walls using mechanisms that differ considerably from those of the larger, multienzyme complexes (cellulosomes). Furthermore, high-resolution measurement of the microfibrillar architecture of cell walls suggests that digestion is primarily facilitated by enabling enzyme access to the hydrophobic cellulose face. The data support the conclusion that ideal pretreatments should maximize lignin removal and minimize polysaccharide modification, thereby retaining the essentially native microfibrillar structure."

However, like those of other complex viruses, our understanding of its protein coding potential is far from complete. We used ribosome profiling and transcript analysis to experimentally define the HCMV translation products and follow their temporal expression. We identified hundreds of previously unidentified open reading frames and confirmed a fraction by means of mass spectrometry. We found that regulated use of alternative transcript start sites plays a broad role in enabling tight temporal control of HCMV protein expression and allowing multiple distinct polypeptides to be generated from a single genomic locus. Our results reveal an unanticipated complexity to the HCMV coding capacity and illustrate the role of regulated changes in transcript start sites in generating this complexity."

The crystal structure of Orai from Drosophila melanogaster, determined at 3.35 angstrom resolution, reveals that the calcium channel is composed of a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore. The pore traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs markedly from other ion channels and gives insight into the principles of selective calcium permeation and gating."

If added to soil on a large scale, biochar has the potential to both benefit global agriculture and mitigate climate change. It could also provide an income stream from carbon abatement for farmers worldwide. However, biochar properties are far from uniform, and biochar production technologies are still maturing. Research is beginning to point the way toward a targeted application of biochar to soils that maximizes its benefits."

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the fusion of one sperm with the egg and the second sperm with the central cell are largely unknown. We show that gamete interactions in Arabidopsis depend on small cysteine-rich EC1 (EGG CELL 1) proteins accumulating in storage vesicles of the egg cell. Upon sperm arrival, EC1-containing vesicles are exocytosed. The sperm endomembrane system responds to exogenously applied EC1 peptides by redistributing the potential gamete fusogen HAP2/GCS1 (HAPLESS 2/GENERATIVE CELL SPECIFIC 1) to the cell surface. Furthermore, fertilization studies with ec1 quintuple mutants show that successful male-female gamete interactions are necessary to prevent multiple-sperm cell delivery. Our findings provide evidence that mutual gamete activation, regulated exocytosis, and sperm plasma membrane modifications govern flowering plant gamete interactions."

The present study provides evidence that XBP1 mRNA splicing triggered an autophagic response in ECs by inducing autophagic vesicle formation and markers of autophagy BECLIN-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β (LC3-βII). Endostatin activated autophagic gene expression through XBP1 mRNA splicing in an inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W1969630360,"Inflammation and microenvironment play a crucial role in muscle regeneration. IL (interleukin)-6, as a multifunctional cytokine is involved in the processes. However, the causative effect of IL-6 in muscle regeneration remains unclear. In a mouse model of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury/regeneration, infiltrated monocytes/macrophages produce a high level of IL-6 started on 1 day (24 h) after injury. In IL-6 knock-out (-/-) mice, the muscle regeneration procedure was impaired along with decreased myogenic determination factor (MyoD) and myogenin mRNA level and increased interstitial fibrosis. The IL-6(-/-) mice exhibited less macrophage infiltration, lower inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, inducible NO synthase, Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-10) and chemokine (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) expression, and inhibited myoblast proliferation. In vitro, IL-6 deficiency or Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) knockdown in activated macrophage attenuated the expression of CCL2, CCL3, but not CCL5, which resulted in less macrophage migration. Moreover, inflammatory macrophages promoted myoblast proliferation in an IL-6-dependent manner. Finally, adoptive transfer IL-6(+/+) BM cells into IL-6(-/-) mice rescued the impaired regeneration with improved MyoD and myogenin expression. Taken together, IL-6 expression and the activated STAT3 signaling pathway in monocytes/macrophages is a critical mediator of macrophage migration and myoblast proliferation during muscle regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1992381387,"Planetary Interiors Under Pressure The interiors of Earth and other rocky planets generally consist of a few common minerals. Depending largely on the size of the planet, the distribution and relative abundance of these minerals varies; for example, MgO is abundant in the mantles of Earth and large Earth-like planets, but is present in Jupiter's core. The properties of MgO also vary with planetary size as a function of temperature and pressure. McWilliams et al. (p. 1330 , published online 22 November) performed laser-shock experiments at pressures over three times higher than Earth's inner core. MgO underwent two phase transformations, first to a solid with a modified crystal structure, and then to a conductive liquid. In terrestrial planets greater than eight Earth masses, MgO in the mantle could generate a magnetic field–generating dynamo such as those that typically found in planetary cores."

To gain insight into the molecular functions of synucleins, we performed an unbiased proteomic screen and identified synaptic protein changes in αβγ-synuclein knock-out brains. We observed increases in the levels of select membrane curvature sensing/generating proteins. One of the most prominent changes was for the N-BAR protein endophilin A1. Here we demonstrate that the levels of synucleins and endophilin A1 are reciprocally regulated and that they are functionally related.

Although its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases is well established, the physiological function of α-synuclein is unknown. α-Synuclein is a member of a family of three presynaptic proteins that includes β- and γ-synuclein. Previous molecular studies have implicated synucleins in synaptic vesicle trafficking (7Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Intriguingly, transgenic mice overexpressing wild type α-synuclein show decreased neurotransmission, opposite to the phenotype of synuclein knock-out mice (13Nemani V.M. Lu W. Berge V. Nakamura K.

This indicates that in case of PARK4 patients, the normal synuclein function is being perturbed. Thus, understanding the precise molecular function of synucleins is important to gain further insight into regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle as well as synaptic dysfunction in PD. Structurally, synucleins are ∼14 kDa proteins with highly conserved N termini and divergent C termini (supplemental Fig. S1A). The N terminus of synucleins contains 7 copies of an 11-residue imperfect XKTKEGVXXXX repeat similar to those seen in the amphipathic helices of class A2 apolipoproteins (supplemental Fig. S1A; Ref. 15Davidson W.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). The C terminus is highly acidic and has many prolines. Synucleins are thought to be natively unfolded proteins in solution that adopt α-helical conformations when the monomeric protein binds lipid membranes. However, recently it was shown that α-synuclein also exists as an α-helical tetramer both in solution and on the membrane (16Bartels T. Choi J.G.

All members of the synuclein family interact robustly with acidic lipid membranes (15Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M.

Upon binding membranes, the N terminus of monomeric α-synuclein folds into one of two amphipathic α-helical conformations. This conformation can be either an uninterrupted N-terminal α-helix (∼93 amino acids; Ref. 19Jao C.C. Der-Sarkissian A. Chen J. Langen R.

In both conformations there is partial insertion of the N-terminal hydrophobic residues into the outer leaflet of the membrane, while the C terminus remains unfolded. The exact α-helical conformation adopted depends on the curvature of the membrane: the broken helix is formed on highly curved lipid surfaces, while the longer helix is formed on flatter lipid surfaces (21Ferreon A.C. Gambin Y. Lemke E.A. Deniz A.A. Interplay of α-synuclein binding and conformational switching probed by single-molecule fluorescence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, α-synuclein possesses the hallmarks of being a membrane curvature sensor. Congruently, α-synuclein preferentially binds to smaller lipid vesicles, i.e. those with higher membrane curvature (15Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. Stabilization of α-Synuclein in secondary structure upon binding to synthetic membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein affinity for lipid vesicles is increased dramatically at around 45 nm, the size of a synaptic vesicle (23Middleton E.R. Rhoades E. Effects of curvature and composition on α-synuclein binding to lipid vesicles.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2279-2288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, α-synuclein has been localized to synaptic vesicles by immuno-electron microscopy (24Clayton D.F. George J.M. Synucleins in synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders.J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). While the tetrameric form of α-synuclein also binds acidic lipid membranes (16Bartels T. Choi J.G. Selkoe D.J. α-Synuclein occurs physiologically as a helically folded tetramer that resists aggregation.Nature. 2011; 477: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), it is not known if binding is membrane curvature-dependent. Recent in vitro experiments using synthetic lipid mixtures have revealed that synucleins can also generate membrane curvature (25Varkey J. Isas J.M. Mizuno N. Jensen M.B. Bhatia V.K. Jao C.C. Petrlova J. Voss J.C. Stamou D.G. Steven A.C. Langen R. Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins.J. Biol.

However, it is still unclear if synucleins can bend neuronal membranes, especially at concentrations likely to be present at synapses. Further, the ability of tetrameric α-synuclein to generate membrane curvature remains to be established. Importantly, it is not known if the membrane bending properties of synucleins are physiologically relevant. Therefore, we set out to biochemically characterize αβγ-synuclein KO mice and investigate the ability of synucleins to generate membrane curvature in a physiologically relevant setting. These studies shed interesting new light on the function of these presynaptic proteins. Human and mouse synuclein constructs have been described previously (18Chandra S. Chen X. Rizo J. Jahn R.

Quantitative proteomics affords an unbiased and sensitive way to monitor global protein changes. In the case of synucleins, it allows us to identify other proteins affected by deletion of synucleins, thus indicating possible functions. To identify such protein alterations, we performed DIGE (two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis) and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) on wild type and αβγ-synuclein KO synaptic fractions (Fig. 1). DIGE and iTRAQ use differential tags, fluorescent and isobaric respectively, to monitor protein changes and are used in a complementary manner (37Tannu N.S. Hemby S.E. Methods for proteomics in neuroscience.Prog Brain Res. 2006; 158: 41-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In both methods, as expected, the largest changes were observed for α- and β-synuclein (Fig. 1, A and B). We set stringent criteria to denote genuine protein changes, including strict cut-offs and replication in both biological (n = 3) and technical (n = 2–4) replicates. Interestingly, there were very few other protein changes in αβγ-synuclein KO samples. The only proteins that were consistently increased were the endocytic N-BAR protein endophilin A1 and its family member endophilin B2, the peripherally associated synaptic vesicle protein synapsin IIb, and the phosphatidylserine-binding protein annexin A5 (Fig. 1C). The increase in the levels of these four proteins was modest, in the range of 1.26–1.74-fold in αβγ-synuclein KO synaptic fractions. We validated the mass spectrometry results for all four proteins by quanititative immunoblotting (validated column, Fig. 1C). The observed increase for synapsin IIb is consistent with our previously published results (12Greten-Harrison B. Polydoro M. Morimoto-Tomita M. Diao L. Williams A.M. Nie E.H. Makani S. Tian N.

As two members of the endophilin family were up-regulated in the αβγ-synuclein KO proteomic screen (Fig. 1), we investigated the relationship between endophilins and synucleins. First, the increase in endophilin A1 and B2 levels was confirmed by quantitative immunoblotting of wild type and αβγ-synuclein KO in total brain homogenates (1.97 ± 0.094- and 1.46 ± 0.079-fold, respectively; Fig. 2A). The magnitude of the increase was greater in the brain than in synaptic fractions as measured by mass spectrometry. Interestingly, we observed that the protein level of the closely related family member endophilin A2 was similarly increased (1.79 ± 0.169; Fig. 2A). We also saw that other membrane curvature inducing proteins such as the N-BAR protein APPL1, the F-BAR proteins syndapin I and FBP-17, and the amphipathic helix-containing protein epsin were unchanged (Fig. 2A; Refs. 42Henne W.M.

Similar observations of the seismic body waves that propagate through the interior of Earth would provide a window into the deep Earth. We report the observation of the mantle transition zone through noise correlations of P waves as they are reflected by the discontinuities associated with the top [410 kliometers (km)] and the bottom (660 km) of this zone. Our data demonstrate that high-resolution mapping of the mantle transition zone is possible without using earthquake sources.
https://openalex.org/W2111097423,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ligand for 5 specific receptors, is a potent lipid mediator that plays important roles in lymphocyte trafficking and immune responses. S1P is produced inside cells and therefore must be secreted to exert its effects through these receptors. Spinster 2 (Spns2) is one of the cell surface transporters thought to secrete S1P. We have shown that Spns2 can export endogenous S1P from cells and also dihydro-S1P, which is active at all cell surface S1P receptors. Moreover, Spns2–/– mice have decreased levels of both of these phosphorylated sphingoid bases in blood, accompanied by increases in very long chain ceramide species, and have defective lymphocyte trafficking. Surprisingly, levels of S1P and dihydro-S1P were increased in lymph from Spns2–/– mice as well as in specific tissues, including lymph nodes, and interstitial fluid. Moreover, lymph nodes from Spns2–/– mice have aberrant lymphatic sinus that appeared collapsed, with reduced numbers of lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Spns2 is an S1P transporter in vivo that plays a role in regulation not only of blood S1P but also lymph node and lymph S1P levels and consequently influences lymphocyte trafficking and lymphatic vessel network organization.—Nagahashi, M., Kim, E.

https://openalex.org/W2035449764,"Background The purpose of this investigation is to determine if Epstein Barr virus (EBV), high risk human papillomavirus (HPV), and mouse mammary tumour viruses (MMTV) co-exist in some breast cancers. Materials and Methods All the specimens were from women residing in Australia. For investigations based on standard PCR, we used fresh frozen DNA extracts from 50 unselected invasive breast cancers. For normal breast specimens, we used DNA extracts from epithelial cells from milk donated by 40 lactating women. For investigations based on in situ PCR we used 27 unselected archival formalin fixed breast cancer specimens and 18 unselected archival formalin fixed normal breast specimens from women who had breast reduction surgery. Thirteen of these fixed breast cancer specimens were ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) and 14 were predominantly invasive ductal carcinomas (idc). Results EBV sequences were identified in 68%, high risk HPV sequences in 50%, and MMTV sequences in 78% of DNA extracted from 50 invasive breast cancer specimens. These same viruses were identified in selected normal and breast cancer specimens by in situ PCR. Sequences from more than one viral type were identified in 72% of the same breast cancer specimens. Normal controls showed these viruses were also present in epithelial cells in human milk – EBV (35%), HPV, 20%) and MMTV (32%) of 40 milk samples from normal lactating women, with multiple viruses being identified in 13% of the same milk samples. Conclusions We conclude that (i) EBV, HPV and MMTV gene sequences are present and co-exist in many human breast cancers, (ii) the presence of these viruses in breast cancer is associated with young age of diagnosis and possibly an increased grade of breast cancer."

Here, we report the measurement of state-resolved inelastic scattering cross sections for collisions between two open-shell molecules that are both prepared in a single quantum state. Stark-decelerated OH radicals were scattered with hexapole-focused NO radicals in a crossed beam configuration. Rotationally and spin-orbit inelastic scattering cross sections were measured on an absolute scale for collision energies between 70 and 300 cm$^{-1}$. These cross sections show fair agreement with quantum coupled-channels calculations using a set of coupled model potential energy surfaces based on ab initio calculations for the long-range non-adiabatic interactions and a simplistic short-range interaction. This comparison reveals the crucial role of electrostatic forces in complex molecular collision processes."
https://openalex.org/W2069385510,"This study was designed to explore the role of versican in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ectopic expression of the versican 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) was studied as a competitive endogenous RNA for regulating miRNA functions. We used this approach to modulate the expression of versican and its related proteins in 3′-UTR transgenic mice and in the liver cancer cell line HepG2, stably transfected with the 3′-UTR or a control vector. We demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing the versican 3′-UTR developed HCC and increased expression of versican isoforms V0 and V1. HepG2 cells transfected with versican 3′-UTR displayed increased proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, colony formation, and enhanced endothelial cell growth, but decreased apoptosis. We found that versican 3′-UTR could bind to miRNAs miR-133a, miR-199a*, miR-144, and miR-431 and also interacted with CD34 and fibronectin. As a consequence, expression of versican, CD34, and fibronectin was up-regulated by ectopic transfection of the versican 3′-UTR, which was confirmed in HepG2 cells and in transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls. Transfection with siRNAs targeting the versican 3′-UTR abolished the effects of the 3′-UTR. Taken together, these results demonstrate that versican V0 and V1 isoforms play important roles in HCC development and that versican mRNAs compete with endogenous RNAs in regulating miRNA functions.—Fang, L., Du, W.

https://openalex.org/W2013883770,"Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification that mediates diverse cellular functions. SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SMURF1) belongs to the Nedd4 family of HECT ubiquitin ligases that directly catalyzes ubiquitin conjugation onto diverse substrates. As a result, SMURF1 regulates a great variety of cellular physiologies including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, cell migration, and planar cell polarity. Structurally, SMURF1 consists of a C2 domain, two WW domain repeats, and a catalytic HECT domain essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This modular architecture allows for interactions with other proteins, which are either substrates or adaptors of SMURF1. Despite the increasing number of SMURF1 substrates identified, current knowledge regarding regulatory proteins and their modes of action on controlling SMURF1 activity is still limited. In this study, we employed quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze SMURF1-associated cellular complexes, and identified the deubiquitinase FAM/USP9X as a novel interacting protein for SMURF1. Through domain mapping study, we found the second WW domain of SMURF1 and the carboxyl terminus of USP9X critical for this interaction. SMURF1 is autoubiquitinated through its intrinsic HECT E3 ligase activity, and is degraded by the proteasome. USP9X association antagonizes this activity, resulting in deubiquitination and stabilization of SMURF1. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, SMURF1 expression is elevated and is required for cellular motility. USP9X stabilizes endogenous SMURF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Depletion of USP9X led to down-regulation of SMURF1 and significantly impaired cellular migration. Taken together, our data reveal USP9X as an important regulatory protein of SMURF1 and suggest that the association between deubiquitinase and E3 ligase may serve as a common strategy to control the cellular protein dynamics through modulating E3 ligase stability."

Here we provide biochemical, cryo-electron tomographic, and x-ray crystal structural data demonstrating the unique structural characteristics of fascin. Systematic mutagenesis studies on 100 mutants of fascin indicate that there are two major actin-binding sites on fascin. Crystal structures of four fascin mutants reveal concerted conformational changes in fascin from inactive to active states in the process of actin bundling.

These characteristics make them an attractive source of biomass for renewable biofuels. The U.S. Navy and commercial airlines have demonstrated the use of algal biofuel in ships and planes; blending algal biofuel with ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel reduced the pollutants and particulate matter and improved fuel economy during the operation of a marine vessel on the Great Lakes (1). Algae-derived fuel is very expensive, however, and most of the cost is associated with producing the biomass. The U.S. Navy has contracted to pay $12 million for 450,000 gallons (1.7 million liters) of biofuel, which works out to about $27/gallon or 10 times the U.S. cost of petroleum-derived fuel [see, for example, (2)]. Chemical reactions in hot, compressed water (hydrothermal reactions) and in supercritical fluids can provide new, potentially cheaper paths to renewable fuels from wet algal biomass (3)."
https://openalex.org/W2093755635,"Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) is a member of the RIG-I-like receptor family of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that detect molecular signatures of virus infection and initiate antiviral signal transduction cascades. The ATP hydrolysis activity of LGP2 is essential for antiviral signaling, but it has been unclear how the enzymatic properties of LGP2 regulate its biological response. Quantitative analysis of the dsRNA binding and enzymatic activities of LGP2 revealed high dsRNA-independent ATP hydrolysis activity. Biochemical assays and single-molecule analysis of LGP2 and mutant variants that dissociate basal from dsRNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis demonstrate that LGP2 utilizes basal ATP hydrolysis to enhance and diversify its RNA recognition capacity, enabling the protein to associate with intrinsically poor substrates. This property is required for LGP2 to synergize with another RIG-I-like receptor, MDA5, to potentiate IFNβ transcription in vivo during infection with encephalomyocarditis virus or transfection with poly(I:C). These results demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of LGP2 ATP hydrolysis and RNA interaction and provide a mechanistic basis for a positive regulatory role for LGP2 in antiviral signaling."

To do this, we utilized a cell-permeable peptide of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, Sab (SH3BP5), as an inhibitor of JNK mitochondrial translocation. In vitro studies showed that 6-OHDA induced JNK translocation to the mitochondria and that inhibition of mitochondrial JNK signaling by Tat-SabKIM1 protected against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotoxicity.

Recently, we designed a retro-inverso peptide containing the HIV-Tat sequence along with 20 residues from the Sab KIM1 domain (Tat-SabKIM1), which could also be used for in vivo purposes (21Chambers J.W. Cherry L. Laughlin J.D. Figuera-Losada M. Lograsso P.V. Selective inhibition of mitochondrial JNK signaling achieved using peptide mimicry of the Sab kinase interacting motif-1 (KIM1).ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Utilizing both JNK and Sab siRNA silencing, along with peptide mimicry with Tat-SabKIM1, we demonstrated that prevention of JNK translocation to the mitochondria was protective against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytotoxicity induced by anisomycin in HeLa cells, and this occurred in a nucleus-independent fashion. Indeed, this peptide has been shown to be highly selective for the JNK pathway over the p38 pathway (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V.

These results, coupled with our demonstration that highly selective JNK inhibitors, such as SR-3306 that do not inhibit p38, PI3K, Akt, and over 300 other kinases (10Chambers J.W. Pachori A.

Khan S. Cameron M.D. Robertson H.A. Robertson G.S. Lograsso P. JNK inhibition protects dopamine neurons and provides behavioral improvement in a rat 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2011; 2: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), led us to hypothesize that Tat-SabKIM1 could provide the same benefits in neuronal cells and in rats. This study was designed to test if blocking JNK translocation to the mitochondria would prevent 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. To do this, we utilized SHSY5Y cells and the 6-OHDA lesion model in rats and monitored ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation in vitro, and neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral improvement in vivo. The major findings showed that 6-OHDA induced JNK translocation to the mitochondria, and blocking this translocation with Tat-SabKIM1 peptide reduced ROS generation, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation, and it increased mitochondrial membrane potential and OCR in vitro, while increasing the number of TH+ neurons and decreasing the d-amphetamine-induced circling in vivo. Human SHSY5Y cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as per the manufacturer's instructions. SHSY5Y cells were used for studies between passages 5 and 17. SHSY5Y cells were passaged using AccuMax cell counting solution to transfer cells among tissue culture vessels. Rat primary cortical neurons were purchased from Invitrogen and grown according to the product insert. Cells were treated with 25 μm 6-OHDA solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For measurements involving ROS generation, 6-OHDA was solubilized in N,N-dimethylformamide to prevent DMSO-induced ROS generation. Cells were incubated in 6-OHDA for 4 h for JNK-related Western blots and mitochondrial translocation studies. Mitochondrial dysfunction measures were taken at either 12, 18, or 24 h as indicated below. Cell viability was monitored at 24 h post-6-OHDA treatment. 2.5 × 105 SHSY5Y cells were seeded into a 6-well plate and then treated as described in the individual experiments. In the case of monitoring JNK signaling, cell lysates were harvested and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using an iBlot apparatus (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked a minimum of 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies for a minimum of 2.5 h. Most antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, with the exception of the Sab antibody, which was purchased from Novus Biomedical. Membranes were washed and then incubated with DyLight antibodies (680 and 800) purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies for 1 h. Western blots were developed using the Li-Cor Biosciences Odyssey near-infrared scanner. Fluorescent quantitation of Western blots was performed using the software accompanying the Odyssey scanner. Normalized fluorescence was determined based on the ratio of the band of interest to a loading control for individual treatments and divided by the ratio for untreated cells. Purification of mitochondria was conducted according to the protocol described in our previous research (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V.

The cells were washed twice in room temperature PBS, and the cells were scraped gently from the culture surface. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended at six times the pellet volume with ice-cold cell homogenization buffer (150 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), and the suspension was placed on ice for 2 min. Using an ice-cold homogenizer, the cells were disrupted with up to 10 up-and-down strokes (disruption was confirmed by microscopy). To the disrupted cells, cell homogenization buffer with 0.25 m sucrose was added at one-third the volume of the suspension followed by gentle inversion to mix thoroughly. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold sucrose/Mg2+ buffer (150 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7). The pellet was disrupted with an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer with a few strokes. The solution suspension was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To remove endoplasmic reticulum membranes from the mitochondria, the mitochondrial pellet was centrifuged through a Histodenz/Percoll gradient. Mitochondria found in the pellet were resuspended in the indicated buffers for the following experiments. The purity of the mitochondrial enrichments was determined using Western blot analysis for mitochondrial resident protein, cytochrome oxidase, cytosolic protein, enolase, nuclear contamination with histone-H3, and microsomal constituent calnexin. Mitochondria were diluted to a concentration of 80 mg/ml, then frozen on dry-ice/ethanol slurry, and stored at −80 °C until use. Knockdown of JNK and Sab was conducted as described in our previous publications (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V.

Cells were transfected with siRNAs using the Qiagen Hiperfect reagent according to the supplier's instructions. siRNAs for JNK and controls were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, and Sab-specific siRNAs were purchased from Novus Biomedical. Cell viability was monitored by TUNEL assay (Millipore) and Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) assay as described in our previous works (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V.

TUNEL and Cell Titer Glo assays were conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. ROS generation, oxygen consumption, ATP production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were monitored as described in our previous research (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V.

Using 96-well plate formats, 4 × 104 cells were seeded and then monitored for ROS generation using MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen), oxygen consumption on the Seahorse Biosciences XF-96 extracellular flux analyzer, ATP production by the ATP determination kit protocol (Invitrogen), and mitochondrial membrane potential via JC-1 staining (Cayman Chemical). The results for ROS, oxygen consumption, and ATP production were measured at 12 h post-stress, whereas mitochondrial membrane potential was measured at 18 h post-stress. As described above for the measurements of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress was measured in a 96-well plate format with 4 × 104 cells per well. Measurement of reduced glutathione was performed using the Glutathione-Glo assay kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipid peroxides (LPO) and protein carbonyls were measured using assay kits purchased from Cayman Chemical in accordance with the supplier's instructions. These measurements were made at 18 h post-stress. All cell-based assays were the average from at least three biological replicate experiments, each performed in quadruplicate. All animal procedures were performed at Scripps (Jupiter, FL) accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Scripps and the principles outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories), 9–10 weeks old, were used in this study. The animals were housed in a controlled environment under a 12-h light/dark cycle and were allowed standard rat chow and water ad libitum. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups to receive saline + saline (n = 5), saline + 6-hydroxydopamine (n = 9), or Tat-Sab peptide + 6-hydroxydopamine (n = 11). Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine and xylazine mixture (70 and 8 mg/kg, respectively). Unilateral lesions of the right substantia nigra pars compacta were made by one 4- μl injection of 2 μg/μl 6-OHDA (Tocris Bioscience) in 0.1% ascorbate saline (0.9% sodium chloride) into the mid-forebrain bundle and three 2-μl injections of 2.1 μg/μl Tat-Sab peptide (NeoBioScience, MA) in saline. The final total dose of 6-OHDA was 8 μg, and the final dose of Tat-Sab was 42 μg/kg. The animals were placed in a Stoelting stereotaxic apparatus with the nose positioned 2.3 mm below the interaural line. Four burr holes were made to allow for injections at specific coordinates based on the atlas of Paxinos and Watson. The first, second, and third injections of either saline or Tat-Sab peptide were made at stereotaxic coordinates as follows: AP-5.5, ML −1.2 and DV −7.8; AP-4.8, ML −2.0 and DV −8.0; AP-6.2, ML −1.8 and DV −7.4, respectively. The fourth injection of either 6-OHDA or saline was made at AP-4.4, ML −1.2 and DV −7.8. The injections were made with a Stoelting Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector set at 1 μl/min with a 10-μl Hamilton syringe and 30-gauge 45° beveled tipped needle. The needle was left in place for 5 min post-injections to prevent backfilling along the injection tract. One week after the 6-OHDA lesions and Tat-Sab peptide injections, the efficacy of Tat-Sab peptide was determined by measuring rotational behavior following amphetamine administration. Rotational behavior was monitored with a Columbus Instrument Roto-Count-8 bowl cage system. Rats were attached to a harness and acclimated to the bowl cages for at least 10 min prior to amphetamine administration. Amphetamine (Sigma), 5 mg/kg, was given intraperitoneally 10 min prior to initiating measurement of rotation behavior. Both clockwise and counter-clockwise turning behavior was collected in seven 10-min intervals. One hour following rotation testing, animals were sacrificed by an overdose of ketamine and xylazine followed by cardiac perfusion with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brains were removed and further post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 day, followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose for 4 days. Brains were embedded and frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound and stored frozen at −80 °C until sectioning. Symmetrical 30-μm-thick sections were cut on a crytostat (Leica CM3050S) between approximately −4.4 and −6.6 mm bregma for ∼73 sections. Every 3rd section (∼21–24 sections) was processed for immunohistochemistry. Free-floating sections were pretreated in 0.3% H2O2 in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 15 min and in blocking solution (4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. In between steps, sections were washed three times for 15 min in TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. For proper identification of the SNpc, all sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:500; Abcam ab112) in 4% BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were then washed with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500; Alexa Fluor 488) in 4% BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. In between steps, sections were washed three times for 15 min in TBS. Sections were mounted on superfrost plus slides, and a drop of fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (1:4) was applied to each section. Slides were coverslipped, sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4 °C. The total number of surviving TH+ immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra were estimated using unbiased stereology using the stereological software (Stereo Investigator 9, Microbrightfield Biosciences). Every other section of the immunostained sections was counted (or every 6th section between approximately −4.4 and −6.6 mm bregma) for a total of 10 sections for each animal. The optical fractionator probe consisted of a 50 × 50-μm counting frame with a height of 12 μm. The section thickness was estimated every dissector measurement and then averaged for each section. For behavioral rotation analysis, ipsilateral clockwise rotations were averaged for the group over each 10-min interval. Group differences were assessed at a significance level of p < 0.05 using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc testing. TH+ cell populations were estimated using number weighted section thickness and averaged for each group. In addition, the total area (μm2) of the SNpc analyzed for counting was averaged for each group. Group differences for TH+ cell populations were assessed at a significance level of p < 0.05 using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc testing. To test the hypothesis that Tat-SabKIM1 could protect neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo by blocking JNK translocation to the mitochondria, we first had to establish that 6-OHDA activated the JNK pathway in cells and induced JNK mitochondrial translocation. To do this, we stressed SHSY5Y cells with 25 μm 6-OHDA for 4 h and monitored JNK pathway activation by Western analysis. Fig. 1 shows that the two JNK upstream activators, MKK4 and MKK7, as well as JNK itself were phosphorylated after 6-OHDA treatment as compared with DMSO treatment (Fig. 1A). In addition, mitochondrial isolation revealed that both MKK4 and JNK translocated to the mitochondria after 6-OHDA treatment and were not present before treatment. Moreover, both of these enzymes were phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). This is in contrast to Sab, which was present on the mitochondria at all times. COX-IV showed equal loading in all mitochondrial preparations. Enolase, histone H3, and calnexin blots were presented to demonstrate purity of mitochondrial preparations. These findings establish 6-OHDA as an activator and inducer of"
https://openalex.org/W2065608810,"Cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs) are among the most highly conserved regulators of actin dynamics, being present in organisms from mammals to apicomplexan parasites. Yeast, plant, and mammalian CAPs are large multidomain proteins, which catalyze nucleotide exchange on actin monomers from ADP to ATP and recycle actin monomers from actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin for new rounds of filament assembly. However, the mechanism by which CAPs promote nucleotide exchange is not known. Furthermore, how apicomplexan CAPs, which lack many domains present in yeast and mammalian CAPs, contribute to actin dynamics is not understood. We show that, like yeast Srv2/CAP, mouse CAP1 interacts with ADF/cofilin and ADP-G-actin through its N-terminal α-helical and C-terminal β-strand domains, respectively. However, in the variation to yeast Srv2/CAP, mouse CAP1 has two adjacent profilin-binding sites, and it interacts with ATP-actin monomers with high affinity through its WH2 domain. Importantly, we revealed that the C-terminal β-sheet domain of mouse CAP1 is essential and sufficient for catalyzing nucleotide exchange on actin monomers, although the adjacent WH2 domain is not required for this function. Supporting these data, we show that the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum CAP, which is entirely composed of the β-sheet domain, efficiently promotes nucleotide exchange on actin monomers. Collectively, this study provides evidence that catalyzing nucleotide exchange on actin monomers via the β-sheet domain is the most highly conserved function of CAPs from mammals to apicomplexan parasites. Other functions, including interactions with profilin and ADF/cofilin, evolved in more complex organisms to adjust the specific role of CAPs in actin dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2009485405,"Lipophilic flavonoids found in the Lamiaceae exhibit unusual 6- and 8-hydroxylations whose enzymatic basis is unknown. We show that crude protein extracts from peltate trichomes of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivars readily hydroxylate position 6 of 7-O-methylated apigenin but not apigenin itself. The responsible protein was identified as a P450 monooxygenase from the CYP82 family, a family not previously reported to be involved in flavonoid metabolism. This enzyme prefers flavones but also accepts flavanones in vitro and requires a 5-hydroxyl in addition to a 7-methoxyl residue on the substrate. A peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.) homolog displayed identical substrate requirements, suggesting that early 7-O-methylation of flavones might be common in the Lamiaceae. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the pioneering discovery of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent flavone demethylase activity in basil, which explains the accumulation of 7-O-demethylated flavone nevadensin."
https://openalex.org/W2024828526,"Chronic Inflammation is a key link between obesity and insulin resistance. We previously showed that two nutrient sensors AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SIRT1 interact to regulate macrophage inflammation. AMPK is also a molecular target of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), which has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in various animal models. Here we aim to determine whether the therapeutic effects of AICAR against insulin resistance involve its anti-inflammatory function, which requires macrophage SIRT1. Long-term administration of low-dose AICAR significantly suppressed adipose inflammation in established diet-induced obese mice. This was associated with improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity without changes of body weight. In contrast, SIRT1 deletion in myeloid SIRT1 knockout (MSKO) mice increased infiltration of classically activated M1 macrophages and decreased alternatively activated M2 macrophages in adipose tissue. As a result, MSKO mice on high fat (HF) diets exhibited impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, fat, and liver, and developed systemic insulin resistance in glucose tolerance tests, insulin tolerance tests, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of AICAR on adipose inflammation and insulin sensitivity were absent in MSKO mice fed HF diets, suggesting that the full capacity of AICAR to antagonize obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance requires myeloid SIRT1. In summary, AICAR negatively regulates HF diet-induced inflammation, which requires myeloid SIRT1, thereby contributing to the protection against insulin resistance. Myeloid SIRT1 is a therapeutic target of the anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects of AICAR."
https://openalex.org/W2112338403,"To investigate the role of GRP78 in adipogenesis and metabolic homeostasis, we knocked down GRP78 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced to undergo differentiation into adipocytes. We also created an adipose Grp78-knockout mouse utilizing the aP2 (fatty acid binding protein 4) promoter-driven Cre-recombinase. Adipogenesis was monitored by molecular markers and histology. Tissues were analyzed by micro-CT and electron microscopy. Glucose homeostasis and cytokine analysis were performed. Our results indicate that GRP78 is essential for adipocyte differentiation in vitro. aP2-cre-mediated GRP78 deletion leads to lipoatrophy with ∼90% reduction in gonadal and subcutaneous white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, severe growth retardation, and bone defects. Despite severe abnormality in adipose mass and function, adipose Grp78-knockout mice showed normal plasma triglyceride levels, and plasma glucose and insulin levels were reduced by 40-60% compared to wild-type mice, suggesting enhanced insulin sensitivity. The endoplasmic reticulum is grossly expanded in the residual mutant white adipose tissue. Thus, these studies establish that GRP78 is required for adipocyte differentiation, glucose homeostasis, and balanced secretion of adipokines. Unexpectedly, the phenotypes and metabolic parameters of the mutant mice, which showed early postnatal mortality, are uniquely distinct from previously characterized lipodystrophic mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W1981945461,"ELMO and DOCK180 proteins form an evolutionarily conserved module controlling Rac GTPase signaling during cell migration, phagocytosis, and myoblast fusion. Here, we identified the microtubule and actin-binding spectraplakin ACF7 as a novel ELMO-interacting partner. A C-terminal polyproline segment in ELMO and the last spectrin repeat of ACF7 mediate a direct interaction between these proteins. Co-expression of ELMO1 with ACF7 promoted the formation of long membrane protrusions during integrin-mediated cell spreading. Quantification of membrane dynamics established that coupling of ELMO and ACF7 increases the persistence of the protruding activity. Mechanistically, we uncovered a role for ELMO in the recruitment of ACF7 to the membrane to promote microtubule capture and stability. Functionally, these effects of ELMO and ACF7 on cytoskeletal dynamics required the Rac GEF DOCK180. In conclusion, our findings support a role for ELMO in protrusion stability by acting at the interface between the actin cytoskeleton and the microtubule network."
https://openalex.org/W2019074897,"Most of the increase in global agricultural production over the past half-century has come from raising crop and livestock yields rather than through area expansion. This growth in productivity is attributed largely to investments in research and innovation ( 1 ). Since around 1990, there has been a decline in the rate of growth in yield per area harvested for several important crops ( 2 ). In parallel, the rate of growth in public spending on agricultural research and development (R&D) has also fallen, which may account for declining crop yield growth and may be contributing to rising food prices ( 3 )."
https://openalex.org/W2004330426,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a conserved signaling molecule in a pathway that maintains adenosine triphosphate homeostasis. Recent studies have suggested that low energy adenylate ligands bound to one or more sites in the γ subunit of AMPK promote the formation of an active, phosphatase-resistant conformation. We propose an alternative model in which the kinase domain association with the heterotrimer core results in activation of the kinase catalytic activity, whereas low energy adenylate ligands bound in the kinase active site promote phosphatase resistance. Purified Snf1 α subunit with a conservative, single amino acid substitution in the kinase domain is protected from dephosphorylation by adenosine diphosphate in the complete absence of the β and γ subunits. Staurosporine, a compound known to bind to the active site of many protein kinases, mediates strong protection from dephosphorylation to yeast and mammalian AMPK enzymes. The analog-sensitive Snf1-I132G protein but not wild type Snf1 exhibits protection from dephosphorylation when bound by the adenosine analog 2NM-PP1 in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate that ligand binding to the Snf1 active site can mediate phosphatase resistance. Finally, Snf1 kinase with an amino acid substitution at the interface of the kinase domain and the heterotrimer core exhibits normal regulation of phosphorylation in vivo but greatly reduced Snf1 kinase activity, supporting a model in which kinase domain association with the heterotrimer core is needed for kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2042337071,"In this study, the interaction of mTORC1 with its downstream targets p70S6K1 and 4E-BP1 was evaluated in both mouse liver and mouse embryonic fibroblasts following combined disruption of the genes encoding 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Phosphorylation of p70S6K1 was dramatically elevated in the livers of mice lacking 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 following feeding-induced activation of mTORC1. Immunoprecipitation of mTORC1 suggested that elevated phosphorylation was the result of enhanced interaction of p70S6K1 with raptor. These findings were extended to a cell culture system wherein loss of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 resulted in elevated interaction of p70S6K1 with IGF1-induced activation of mTORC1 in conjunction with an enhanced rate of p70S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr-389. Furthermore, cotransfecting HA-p70S6K1 with 4E-BP1, but not 4E-BP1(F114A), reduced recovery of mTORC1 in HA-p70S6K1 immunoprecipitates. Together, these findings support the conclusion that, in the absence of 4E-BP proteins, mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of p70S6K1 is elevated by a reduction in competition between the two substrates for interaction with raptor."
https://openalex.org/W2093735326,"Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera. For V. cholerae to colonize the intestinal epithelium, accessory toxins such as the multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX(Vc)) toxin are required. MARTX toxins are composite toxins comprised of arrayed effector domains that carry out distinct functions inside the host cell. Among the three effector domains of MARTX(Vc) is the Rho inactivation domain (RID(Vc)) known to cause cell rounding through inactivation of small RhoGTPases. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis in the activity subdomain of RID(Vc), four residues, His-2782, Leu-2851, Asp-2854, and Cys-3022, were identified as impacting RID(Vc) function in depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and inactivation of RhoA. Tyr-2807 and Tyr-3015 were identified as important potentially for forming the active structure for substrate contact but are not involved in catalysis or post translational modifications. Finally, V. cholerae strains modified to carry a catalytically inactive RID(Vc) show that the rate and efficiency of MARTX(Vc) actin cross-linking activity does not depend on a functional RID(Vc), demonstrating that these domains function independently in actin depolymerization. Overall, our results indicate a His-Asp-Cys catalytic triad is essential for function of the RID effector domain family shared by MARTX toxins produced by many Gram-negative bacteria."

P. Dailey (University of Pennsylvania) through published methods (4Hall M.A. Xi J. Lor C. Dai S. Pearce R. Dailey W.P.

AziPm was radiolabeled by AmBios Labs (Boston, MA) by iodinating the ring and reducing with tritium under catalytic conditions. The final product was purified with HPLC. EcoLite(+) liquid scintillation mixture (MP Biomedicals) was used with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Tri-Carb 2800TR instrument; a Varian Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer was used for spectroscopy. First and second dimension gels, electrophoresis apparatuses, and molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. UVA was generated by filtering a 100-watt arc mercury lamp through colored glass UV-visible broadband (∼340–615-nm) and UV band-pass (∼250–375-nm) filters (lamp and filters from Newport, Stratford, CT). Light intensities (measured with an optical power meter (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ)) were 28.1 microwatts/mm2 and 27.7 microwatts/mm2 at 350 and 375 nm, respectively. Albino X. laevis tadpoles (stage 45–47) were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI) and housed in supplied pond water for at least 24 h prior to experiments. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania. Tadpoles were placed in Petri dishes with propofol or AziPm dissolved in pond water. The same physicochemical parameters determine anesthetic passage across the gills and skin as does passage across the blood brain barrier (18Downes H. Courogen P.M. Contrasting effects of anesthetics in tadpole bioassays.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 284-296PubMed Google Scholar, 19Krasowski M.D. Jenkins A. Flood P. Kung A.Y. Hopfinger A.J. Harrison N.L.

In some experiments, after a 30-min equilibration, tadpoles were transferred to fresh water; in others, after equilibration, tadpoles remained on the bench for a sham control or were exposed to UVA (photolabeled in vivo) before transfer to fresh water. Immobility was defined (and scored) as the percentage of tadpoles that did not swim, twitch, or right themselves throughout a 30-s time window preceding every 10-min interval. Tadpole assays are established measures of anesthetic potency (18Downes H. Courogen P.M. Contrasting effects of anesthetics in tadpole bioassays.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 284-296PubMed Google Scholar, 19Krasowski M.D. Jenkins A. Flood P. Kung A.Y. Hopfinger A.J. Harrison N.L.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 338-351PubMed Google Scholar), and reversible immobility is the most commonly used general anesthetic end point. Alternative causes of immobility in our study (e.g. muscular toxicity) were not ruled out, but should have had additional and toxic features that would have been observed (e.g. cardiac muscle dysfunction, etc). The water temperature was 21–22 °C for experiments and changed <0.5 °C throughout any experiment. Tadpoles were incubated for 30 min with 4 μm [3H]AziPm and treated ± UVA for 10 min. After transfer to fresh water, tricaine methanesulfonate (500 mg/liter) was added immediately for the zero time point or at 165 min for the emergence time point, and the tadpoles were placed on ice. After decapitation, brains and spinal cords were removed with forceps under a dissecting microscope and placed in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Tissue isolation required less than 15 min following each time point; central nervous system (CNS) tissue was homogenized every 3–5 min using a Teflon/glass homogenizer. CNS homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, washed with isolation buffer, and recentrifuged. The pellet was homogenized in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, washed, and centrifuged again before resuspension in 2 mm Tris, pH 7.4. An aliquot was removed for a protein assay prior to freezing at −80 °C. Unexposed tadpoles were anesthetized with tricaine methanesulfonate, and neuronal tissue, dissected as above, was homogenized in sucrose buffer, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, washed, and recentrifuged. The pellet was suspended in isolation buffer, and the protein concentration was determined and then diluted to 1 mg/ml in a microcentrifuge tube. 4 μm [3H]AziPm ± 400 μm propofol was added and, after a brief vortex, the tissue was incubated at 21 °C in the dark for 10 min. After transfer to a quartz cuvette (path length, 1 mm), the tissue was photolabeled for 10 min using the same light source as above. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g, homogenized in 5 mm Tris, recentrifuged at 100,000 × g, washed, and stored at −80 °C in 2 mm Tris. Dissected CNS tissue from tadpoles treated with 4 μm [3H]AziPm ± UVA was placed in 1 ml of ice-cold 2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Following homogenization, the protein concentration was determined. 5 and 10 μl of the homogenates were added to separate vials in scintillation fluid. The disintegrations per minute (dpm) from each vial were normalized to the corresponding protein amount, and the mean of the two values was used for a single experimental measurement. After thawing, 100 μg of neuronal membrane protein was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Following removal of the supernatant, the pellet was dissolved in 125 μl of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% carrier ampholytes. Isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE proceeded according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 3–10 nonlinear pH strips (7 cm) and 4–15% SDS-PAGE. Tissue from ∼25 tadpoles sufficed for a single gel. Gels were washed with water and fixed overnight in 15% trichloroacetic acid before staining with Coomassie Blue G-250. After destaining, the gels were scanned on a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer with quantitation performed using the accompanying Quantity One software. Background was subtracted with a box drawn between the 50- and 75- kDa molecular mass markers, and mean optical density multiplied by spot area was recorded from contoured spots. Spots were excised with a 1.5-mm cylindrical hole punch and placed into scintillation vials. 400 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added, and the sealed vials were incubated overnight at 65 °C to dissolve the polyacrylamide. These were cooled to room temperature before adding scintillation fluid. Trypsin-digested samples were separated on a nanoLC column before online electrospray into a Thermo LTQ linear ion trap. Raw data were acquired with Xcalibur. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) online protein database was searched with the term “Xenopus,” and the FASTA formatted sequences of the results were downloaded. This downloaded database was searched with SEQUEST for protein identification. Parameters were 1 atomic mass unit of parent ion tolerance, 1 atomic mass unit of fragment ion tolerance, and 1 missed cleavage. The search result files were combined with Scaffold 3 and filtered with the following criteria: Xcorr scores (+1 ion) 1.7, (+2) 2.3, (+3) 2.8; protein identification confidence 99.9%; peptide identification confidence 95%; two peptide minimum. Spectra were manually inspected to ensure quality and confidence. GraphPad Prism 5 was used for figure preparation and data analysis. Student's t test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni's correction were calculated within the GraphPad software. Significance is expressed as *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01. Albino tadpoles anesthetized with 3 μm propofol or 4 μm AziPm (approximate EC99 doses) recovered on similar time scales following transfer to fresh pond water (Fig. 1A, left). The tadpoles are equilibrated with the alkylphenol, and recovery under these conditions is largely a function of drug diffusion back into the water. In this study, we hypothesized that covalent occupation of ligand binding sites in vivo would result in prolonged anesthetic effects following washout of unadducted compound. The diazirine of AziPm has a peak absorbance of ∼370 nm, undergoing photolysis to form a reactive carbene, whereas propofol absorbs wavelengths less than 300 nm. Albino tadpoles immobilized with AziPm and exposed to UVA before transfer to fresh water exhibited prolonged immobility not observed with propofol control groups (Fig. 1A, right). Further, a relationship between lamp exposure time and recovery time was evident, suggesting progressive occupancy of functionally relevant sites. No toxicity (premature death) or differences in body mass were observed between tadpoles treated with either alkylphenol anesthetic or alkylphenol anesthetic with UVA following emergence (measured up to 10 days). Covalent adduction would concentrate ligand into protein sites with infinitely low off-rates, increasing the apparent potency of the molecule. In vivo photolabeling for 10 min after equilibration with a sub-EC99 AziPm dose markedly increased the population of immobilized tadpoles (Fig. 1B). Further, we hypothesized that retained attachment of AziPm in functionally relevant targets after washout and emergence would manifest as a decrease in the effective concentration of propofol for immobility. Thus, 20 h after emergence, tadpoles treated as above were exposed to 2 or 0.8 μm propofol. Animals photolabeled in vivo displayed increased sensitivity (more rapid induction, slower emergence, and induction with a lower dose) relative to controls (Fig. 1C). Lastly, 4 μm AziPm in pond water was photolyzed for a period corresponding to twice the diazirine half-life (i.e. to a final concentration of ∼1 μm (measured by absorption spectroscopy) plus whatever the product(s) of photolysis are). Tadpoles were then placed in this solution, and after 30 min, immobility was not observed, ruling out the possibility that a more potent, “caged” anesthetic with slower washout kinetics was released with light (data not shown). Together, these data suggest prolonged anesthetic influence due to photoadduction of ligand in vivo, a phenomenon we termed optoanesthesia. Because general anesthetics are assumed to exert their effects through CNS targets, retention of photoactivated AziPm in neural tissue was measured following optoanesthesia. Brains and spinal cords from control tadpoles and those photolabeled in vivo with [3H]AziPm were isolated to quantify radioactivity after recovery in fresh water (Fig. 2A). Following [3H]AziPm induction, without washout, no difference is seen between groups treated ± UVA. However, 8-fold more radioactivity was noted in the neuronal tissue of photolabeled animals at 165 min, the point of emergence for all tadpoles exposed to 4 μm AziPm and 10 min of UVA. Optoanesthesia indicates that neuronal substrates photolabeled in vivo are relevant targets of AziPm and possibly propofol anesthesia. For protein identifications, neuronal membrane protein from tadpoles equilibrated with [3H]AziPm and photolabeled for 10 min was subjected to IEF/SDS-PAGE. Duplicate gels were stained, and 100 random spots were excised for scintillation counting (Fig. 2B). Mean background radiation (from three spots excised from each gel containing no detectable Coomassie Blue staining in a region through which the SDS-PAGE separated proteins migrated) was 18.0 dpm, and the mean for all 100 spots was 18.8 dpm. Seven spots contained dpm greater than two standard deviations from the background mean (Fig. 2C). No protein spots from control tadpoles incubated with [3H]AziPm but not exposed to the lamp contained counts exceeding this background threshold. We hypothesized that for tadpoles to regain movement (“emerge”), the cellular components contributing to mobility must adapt by removing photolabeled proteins whose activity is altered and/or by replacing these photolabeled macromolecules with newly synthesized proteins. To test this, neuronal membranes were isolated 165 min after tadpoles were photolabeled (when all had emerged) as above for IEF/SDS-PAGE, with the previously identified spots from duplicate gels assayed for dpm. The mean from three spots contained counts within 10% of the initial value (12, 22, and 33), whereas decreases of 46, 35, 42, and 28% were noted in spots 4, 6, 41, and 85, respectively. Coomassie Blue intensity was quantified to assess changes in protein expression, and with the exception of spot 4, little variation was observed (Fig. 2D). Spot dpm was normalized to corresponding Coomassie Blue intensities for the in vivo experiments. We proposed that proteins with decreased radioactivity content coincident with emergence gain additional credibility as functionally important targets. Thus, we calculated the ratio of normalized photolabel incorporation at 165 min to that at the zero time point for each spot (Fig. 2E). A ratio of 1 would indicate that the fraction of adducted protein did not change over the 165 min. We found that the ratios from spots 6, 33, 41, and 85 are significantly less than 1, suggesting potential relevance in emergence from optoanesthesia. In vitro photolabeling of neuronal homogenates with 4 μm [3H]AziPm ± 400 μm propofol was performed to investigate the conserved, saturable specificity of protein sites. Protein spots identified as photolabeled in vivo were analyzed, and all contained dpm above background. A significant effect of propofol on normalized dpm was revealed with decreased photolabel incorporation ranging from 2 to 75% in each spot (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA; n = 3 and n = 2 for each spot (−) and (+) propofol, respectively) (Table 1). A separate gel was run for protein identification. Six spots were unambiguously identified as containing a single protein, whereas two high confidence identifications were possible in the seventh (Table 1).TABLE 1Protein spot analysis and LC-MS/MS identificationSpot% of displacementa[3H]AziPm displacement by propofol from in vitro photolabeling experiments.Protein IDNCBI accession numberTheoreticalbTheoretical values were computed with the ExPASy Compute pI/Mw tool.

Open table in a new tab We describe optoanesthesia, a light-induced anesthetic potentiation, and present a method through which novel general anesthetic targets can be discovered. Reconciling proteomic data with a behavioral phenotype provides a powerful means to assign relevance to identified binding partners. The mechanisms of recovery from optoanesthesia are likely to reside in adducted, relevant proteins being targeted for accelerated degradation and/or being replaced by newly synthesized protein. An alternative hypothesis, not tested here, is that the activities of proteins that are not targets of AziPm are altered to compensate for the covalent modification of the alkylphenol binding partners. Although emergence pathways may be distinct from induction pathways (20Friedman E.B. Sun Y. Moore J.T. Hung H.-T. Meng Q.C. Perera P. Joiner W.J. Thomas S.A. Eckenhoff R.G. Sehgal A. Kelz M.B. A conserved behavioral state barrier impedes transitions between anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and wakefulness: evidence for neural inertia.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), emergence must still require an offloading of the anesthetic from induction targets; thus, we view our initial hypothesis, that label intensity should decrease in functionally relevant targets, as reasonable. Performing photolabeling in live organisms assured that molecular targets were in a functional state, and because the primary effect of the anesthetic (immobility) was prolonged, confirmed that relevant targets were adducted. Further evidence for ligand incorporation to relevant general anesthetic sites was seen by the increased sensitivity to propofol after in vivo photolabeling. Despite label attachment to the identical proteins in vitro, substantial displacement of photoactive ligand by the parent propofol was most evident with VDACs. These mitochondrial porins with multiple phosphorylation states were also the most prominently labeled proteins in vivo. Protection of photolabeling by propofol suggests conserved and specific alkylphenol site(s). An alternative explanation for propofol competition is allosterism, which would require separate specific cavities for AziPm and for propofol, a possibility we view as unlikely. Although VDACs are highly abundant proteins, this binding is not interpreted as ”nonspecific.“ Specificity can be viewed as specific to a particular physiological outcome or, on the molecular level (and favored here), high occupancy, saturable binding. Other general anesthetics have been shown to bind VDACs in vitro, but functional consequences have yet to be reported. VDACs bind GABAA receptors (21Bureau M.H. Khrestchatisky M.

Knock-out of VDAC-2 in mice is embryonic lethal, and interestingly, our time-resolved approach implicates VDAC-2 over VDAC-1 and VDAC-3 (Fig. 2E). However, this may reflect a general ”protective“ effect of VDAC-2 from cellular apoptosis (23Cheng E.H.Y. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Of the other identified proteins, SNAP-25 and Gβ4 exhibited decreases in the ratio of photolabeled to unmodified protein at the time of emergence. Published evidence has suggested that anesthetic interactions with SNAP-25 and/or Gβ4 might contribute to depressed neuronal signaling. For example, SNAP-25, a component of the ternary SNARE complex, binds volatile anesthetics at physiologically relevant concentrations (24Nagele P. Mendel J.B. Placzek W.J. Scott B.A. D'Avignon D.A. Crowder C.M. Volatile anesthetics bind rat synaptic snare proteins.Anesthesiology. 2005; 103: 768-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and isoflurane and propofol inhibit neurotransmitter release through interactions with SNAREs or associated proteins (25Herring B.E.

Mutagenesis in SNARE complex proteins (including SNAP-25) alters organism sensitivity to general anesthetics (27van Swinderen B. Saifee O. Shebester L. Roberson R. Nonet M.L. Crowder C.M.

Gβ (as part of Gβγ) can also directly inhibit presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (32Ikeda S.R.

The lack of [3H]AziPm displacement by propofol on some proteins can be interpreted in several ways. For instance, anesthetic site(s) (e.g. on SNAREs) may not be conserved among ligands; isoflurane and halothane bind to the SNARE complex in a noncompetitive and nonsaturable manner (24Nagele P. Mendel J.B. Placzek W.J. Scott B.A. D'Avignon D.A. Crowder C.M. Volatile anesthetics bind rat synaptic snare proteins.Anesthesiology. 2005; 103: 768-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic interior of the coiled-coil complex likely harbors multiple sites of varying affinities, each capable of binding ligands with low occupancy. Alternatively, protein substrates (including Gβ) may be specific to AziPm but not propofol (propofol specificity was tested as the photolabel parent). Regardless, these interpretations do not preclude functional involvement in hypnosis or optoanesthesia, as we did not test competition with nontritiated AziPm, but also, little evidence suggests that saturable binding underlies these states. With our approach in a model vertebrate organism, the tadpole, we provide in vivo evidence for the functional involvement of synaptic targets previously suspected only from in vitro or lower organism studies. Proving this involvement will require extensive genetic manipulations. Additionally, we have identified only a subset of targets bound by AziPm in vivo, not including ion channels (such as the GABAA receptor) that are the object of some general anesthetic hypotheses. Resolving low abundance proteins with multiple transmembrane domains is not feasible with IEF/SDS-PAGE (36Bunai K. Yamane K.

Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE): advances and perspectives.BioTechniques. 2008; 44 (700): 697-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and thus, a priori we did not anticipate their identification. The development of proteomic approaches complimentary to IEF/SDS-PAGE, and those that are capable of expanding the dynamic range of neuronal protein detection, will further the investigative power of optoanesthesia. In conclusion, we anticipate the translation of in vivo photolabeling and behavior-paired proteomics to a wider variety of model organisms and photoactive molecules to investigate molecular mechanisms of general anesthetic pharmacology.

Selection of the translation initiation codon in eukaryotic mRNA generally occurs by the scanning mechanism, beginning with attachment of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit harboring the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex and various other initiation factors (the 43S PIC) 2The abbreviations used are: PICpreinitiation complexPABPpoly(A)-binding proteinFOAfluoroorotic acidWCEwhole cell extracthchigh copyIPimmunoprecipitationWBWestern bloteIF4A-RHtetramethylrhodamine-labeled eIF4AyeIF4Byeast eIF4BmRNPmessenger ribonucleoprotein. to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the mRNA. This reaction is stimulated by eIF4F, bound to the m7G cap structure of the mRNA, composed of cap-binding protein eIF4E, eIF4G, and the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A. Mammalian eIF4G acts as a scaffold harboring binding domains in its N terminus for poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and eIF4E and in its middle and C-terminal regions for eIF4A and eIF3. Through its eIF4E and PABP binding domains and ssRNA-binding activity, eIF4G coordinates multiple, independent interactions with the mRNA to assemble a stable eIF4F·mRNA·PABP complex. The helicase activity of eIF4A is thought to generate an ssRNA binding site for the ribosome in the 5′-UTR, and in mammals, eIF4G·eIF3 association stabilizes interaction between this activated mRNP and the 43S PIC. After attaching to the mRNA, the 43S PIC scans the 5′-UTR for an AUG triplet, and AUG recognition triggers irreversible hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2, with dissociation of eIF1 enabling release of Pi from eIF2-GDP, to produce a stable 48S PIC. Following release of eIF2-GDP, the large (60S) subunit joins to produce an 80S initiation complex competent for polypeptide synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Pestova T.V. Lorsch J.R. Hellen C.U.T.

Hence, eIF4B might stimulate helicase activity by enhancing domain closure in the eIF4A·ATP·mRNA complex, by stabilizing a conformation of this complex incompatible with mRNA duplex formation, or by helping to recruit eIF4A·ATP to single-stranded stretches in the mRNA. There is also evidence that eIF4B increases the efficiency of coupling ATP hydrolysis to duplex unwinding by eIF4F (20Özeş A.R. Feoktistova K. Avanzino B.C. Fraser C.S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Other proposals envision a role for eIF4B in conferring 5′–3′ directionality to scanning. In one scenario, eIF4B interacts with eIF4A·eIF4G complexes bound to unwound mRNA at the exit channel of the 40S subunit to prevent backsliding of the PIC (23Spirin A.S. How does a scanning ribosomal particle move along the 5′-untranslated region of eukaryotic mRNA? Brownian Ratchet model.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10688-10692Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In another model, eIF4A·eIF4G complexes disrupt helical structures in advance of the PIC, and eIF4B prevents reannealing of the unwound mRNA until it feeds into the 40S entry channel (18Marintchev A.

Both models feature an eIF4G·eIF4A·eIF4B heterotrimer; however, there is evidence that eIF4A binding by eIF4G and eIF4B is mutually exclusive and that prior association with eIF4G enables eIF4A to form a stable mRNP with eIF4B following its dissociation from eIF4G (19Nielsen K.H.

Budding yeast harbors two eIF4G isoforms (1 and 2) that are ∼50% identical in sequence and related to mammalian eIF4G (24Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford Jr., J.L.

Yeast eIF4A and the yeast homolog of eIF4B (yeIF4B/Tif3) enhance the translation of reporter mRNAs with structured leaders but are also required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short unstructured 5′-UTRs (27Blum S.

Although yeIF4B is nonessential, tif3Δ cells grow poorly, especially at low temperatures (28Altmann M. Müller P.P. Wittmer B. Ruchti F. Lanker S. Trachsel H.

The available genetic evidence is consistent with the possibility that yeIF4B stimulates translation in vivo by promoting eIF4F function (28Altmann M. Müller P.P. Wittmer B. Ruchti F. Lanker S.

A new yeast translation initiation factor suppresses a mutation in the eIF-4A RNA helicase.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and we showed previously that eIF4F and yeIF4B are both required for rapid recruitment of 43S PICs on native capped mRNAs in vitro (30Mitchell S.F. Walker S.E. Algire M.A. Park E.H. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R.

Cell. 2010; 39: 950-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, yeIF4B does not stimulate eIF4A helicase activity in vitro (31Altmann M. Wittmer B. Méthot N. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation initiation factor Tif3 and its mammalian homologue, eIF-4B, have RNA annealing activity.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3820-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although yeast eIF4A can be activated by mammalian eIF4B (27Blum S. Schmid S.R. Pause A. Buser P. Linder P. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. ATP hydrolysis by initiation factor 4A is required for translation initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and mammalian eIF4B can functionally replace yeIF4B in a cell-free translation system (28Altmann M. Müller P.P. Wittmer B.

A Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of mammalian translation initiation factor 4B contributes to RNA helicase activity.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3997-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, either the conditions required for activation of yeast eIF4A by yeIF4B remain to be identified, or this is not the critical function of yeIF4B. Moreover, direct interaction of yeIF4B with eIF4A or eIF4G has not been described. Hence, it is currently unclear how yeIF4B stimulates 48S PIC assembly and whether this function involves eIF4A-dependent or eIF4A-independent activities. Interestingly, despite a relatively high affinity of yeast eIF4A for eIF4G in vitro (10Dominguez D. Altmann M. Benz J. Baumann U. Trachsel H.

Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. New initiation factor activity required for globin mRNA translation.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been suggested that eIF4G-eIF4A interaction in yeast cells is transient, being modulated by post-translational modifications or regulatory proteins, and depends on prior interaction of eIF4G with another factor that can expose the eIF4A binding site in the HEAT domain (10Dominguez D. Altmann M. Benz J. Baumann U. Trachsel H. Interaction of translation initiation factor eIF4G with eIF4A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we uncovered evidence for interaction between yeast eIF4G and yeIF4B in vivo that can restore complex formation between eIF4A and mutant eIF4G proteins harboring particular HEAT domain substitutions, and we reconstituted the ability of yeIF4B to rescue eIF4A·eIF4G interaction for one such mutant using purified components. We also found that yeIF4B enhances eIF4A·eIF4G interaction in vivo even in the case of WT eIF4G. Our results suggest that one aspect of yeIF4B function is to promote binding of eIF4A to the eIF4G·eIF4E subassembly of eIF4F with attendant recruitment of eIF4A to the cap structure of mRNA to promote 43S PIC attachment and subsequent scanning for the start codon.

Mutations in tif4631-HA-Bam or tif4632-HA were introduced into pEP88 or pEP41, respectively, by the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis system (Agilent Technologies) and verified by sequencing the entire coding sequence. Yeast strains YAS2282 and YAS2069 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All novel yeast strains in Table 3 were constructed by introducing a TRP1 CEN4 plasmid with the appropriate TIF4631-HA or TIF4632-HA allele into YAS2282.

Minneman K.P. α1-Adrenoceptor subtypes.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, their relative roles are poorly understood given the lack of selective α1-AR antagonists that can distinguish between the different α1-subtypes. This lack of discrimination is not surprising because current small molecule inhibitors act competitively at the relatively conserved norepinephrine (NE) binding pocket and fail to take advantage of the potential offered by more structurally divergent allosteric sites. Recent NMR studies of the β2-adrenoceptor have revealed that agonists and antagonists stabilize distinct GPCR conformations, demonstrating conformational coupling between the extracellular surface (ECS) and the orthosteric binding site (14Bokoch M.P. Zou Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu C.W. Nygaard R. Rosenbaum D.M. Fung J.J. Choi H.J. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Puglisi J.D. Weis W.I. Pardo L. Prosser R.S. Mueller L. Kobilka B.K. Ligand-specific regulation of the extracellular surface of a G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2010; 463: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, GPCR structure-function studies have focused on relatively conserved 7TM residues, and the role of residues that form the ECS remains poorly defined, despite their potential to allosterically modulate GPCR signaling. ρ-TIA, a conopeptide from the piscivorous Conus tulipa, acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the α1-AR (15Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34451-34457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given that ρ-TIA is a small and highly positively charged peptide that is unlikely to cross cell membranes, we systematically mutated residues associated with the ECS of the α1B-AR. Using a refined NMR structure of ρ-TIA and a turkey β1-AR-derived homology model of the α1B-AR to guide docking simulations and mutagenesis studies, we established the specific molecular interactions between ρ-TIA on the ECS of the α1B-AR that were confirmed by double mutant cycle experiments. These findings, which reveal that peptide binding to ECS residues on TMH6 and TMH7 at the base of ECL3 can inhibit α1-AR signaling, may prove useful in guiding the design of new classes of allosteric inhibitors. The hamster α1B-AR cDNA in the pMT2′ vector was a kind gift from Prof. Bob Graham (Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney, Australia). In vitro site-directed mutagenesis of the α1B-AR subunit cDNA was achieved using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. A series of mutation primers were designed to produce the following point mutations in the α1B-AR: V107A, L108A, G109A, Y110A, W111A, V112A, L113A, G114A, R115A, I116A, C118A, P180A, L181A, L182A, G183A, W184A, K185A, E186A, P187A, P189A, N190A, D191A, D192A, K193A, E194A, C195A, G196A, V197A, T198A, E199A, E200A, P201A, F202A, E289K, W307A, F310A, F311A, L314A, L316A, G317A, S318A, S319A, F320A, S321A, T322A, L323A, K324A, P325A, P326A, D327A, V329A, F330A, K331A, F334A, and the double mutants E186A/E199A, S318A/F330A, and D327A/F330A. Primers used to generate the mutants were from Proligo. TOP10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) was transformed with wild type (WT) and mutant cDNA and subsequently used for plasmid preparation using a Mini or High Speed Maxi kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNA was used to confirm all mutations by sequencing performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility. COS-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with purified plasmid DNA encoding WT or mutant α1B-ARs, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (25 μg of DNA/145 cm2) or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) (36 μg of DNA/145 cm2), following the manufacturers' protocol. Cell membranes were prepared 48 h post-transfection as follows. Cells were harvested and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) in HEM buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in HEM buffer containing 10% v/v glycerol and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. The affinity of ρ-TIA and analogs at the α1B-AR mutants were determined using the radiolabeled α1-AR antagonist [3H]prazosin (0.5 nm) or 125I-(±)β-(iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyl-tetralone (125I-HEAT; 70 pm). Reactions containing radioligand, membranes from α1B-AR-transfected COS-1 cells (5 μg of protein), and increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA or analogs (10 pm-10 μm) in HEM buffer were established in clear round bottom 96-well plates. Saturation binding experiments were also performed to determine the Kd value for prazosin at each of the mutants. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine. Each assay was performed in triplicate in a total reaction volume of 150 μl. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the membranes were harvested onto Whatman GF/B filter mats (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) pretreated with 0.6% polyethyleneimine using a TomTec harvester. Beta Plate scintillant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was then applied, and the filter-bound radioactivity detected using a Wallac MicroBeta (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured and transiently transfected with WT or mutant α1B-AR DNA following the manufacturer's protocol (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen or FuGENE HD, and Roche Applied Science). Assays measuring IP1 accumulation were performed 48 h post-transfection following the manufacturer's instructions (IPone HTRF assay kit, Cisbio International). In brief, increasing concentrations of NE, prazosin, or ρ-TIA were added to 30,000 transfected cells in stimulation buffer in a white 384-well plate (Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then lysed by the addition of HTRF reagents, the europium cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody, and the d2-labeled IP1 analog and diluted in lysis buffer (IPone HTRF assay kit, Cisbio International), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The emission signals were measured at 590 and 665 nm after excitation at 340 nm using the Envision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the signal was expressed as the HTRF ratio: F = ((fluorescence665 nm/fluorescence590 nm) × 104). The WT α1B-AR was routinely run each day to control for any batch-to-batch variation in response. In addition, antagonist-induced inhibition of the basal IP1 mediated by the constitutive active mutant E289K was also determined (three separate experiments performed in replicates of six). Peptides were synthesized with standard Fmoc chemistry (18Brust A. Palant E. Croker D.E. Colless B. Drinkwater R. Patterson B. Schroeder C.I. Wilson D. Nielsen C.K. Smith M.T. Alewood D. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. χ-Conopeptide pharmacophore development. Toward a novel class of norepinephrine transporter inhibitor (Xen2174) for pain.J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 6991-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using Fmoc-amino acid derivatives purchased from Novabiochem or Auspep P/L. The following side chain-protected amino acids were used: Cys(Trt), His(Trt), Hyp(tBu), Tyr(tBu), Lys(t-butoxycarbonyl), Trp(t-butoxycarbonyl), Arg(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyl-dihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl), Asn(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Glu(OtBu), Gln(Trt), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), and Tyr(tBu). All other Fmoc amino acids were unprotected. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane, diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were supplied by Auspep P/L (Melbourne, Australia) as peptide synthesis grade. 2-(1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, triisopropyl silane, HPLC grade acetonitrile, acetic anhydride, and methanol were supplied by Sigma. The resin used was Fmoc-Rink resin (0.65 mmol/g) supplied by Auspep P/L. Ethane dithiol was supplied by Merck. ρ-TIA and its analogs are peptide amides and were synthesized on a Protein Technologies Symphony automated peptide synthesizer using Rink amide resin (0.1 mmol). Assembly of the peptides was performed using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/DIEA in situ activation protocols (19Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. In situ neutralization in Boc-chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis. Rapid, high yield assembly of difficult sequences.Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) to couple the Fmoc-protected amino acid to the resin (5 eq excess, coupling time 5 min). Fmoc deprotection was performed with 30% piperidine/DMF for 1 min followed by a 2-min repeat. Washes were performed 10 times after each coupling as well as after each de-protection step. Acetylation of ρ-TIA was performed by using a 10-fold excess of acetic acid anhydride/DIEA in DMF. The success of the acetylation was monitored by the quantitative ninhydrin test (20Sarin V.K. Kent S.B. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Quantitative monitoring of solid-phase peptide synthesis by the ninhydrin reaction.Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). After chain assembly and final Fmoc deprotection, the peptide resins were washed with methanol and dichloromethane and dried in a stream of N2. The cleavage of peptide resin was performed at room temperature (RT) in TFA/H2O/triisopropyl silane/ethane dithiol (87.5:5:5:2.5) for 3 h. Cold diethyl ether (30 ml) was then added to the filtered cleavage mixture, and the peptide was precipitated. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with further cold diethyl ether to remove scavengers. The final product was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and lyophilized to yield a white solid product. The crude reduced peptide was examined by reversed phase-HPLC for purity and the correct molecular weight confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). Pure reduced peptides (1 mg/ml) were oxidized by stirring at RT in 30% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 m NH4HCO3 at pH 7.0 for 16 h. The solutions were subsequently diluted to an isopropyl alcohol concentration <5%, prior to reversed phase-HPLC purification. The obtained single main oxidized product with the cysteine connectivity (1–3, 2–4) (17Sharpe I.A. Thomas L. Loughnan M. Motin L. Palant E. Croker D.E. Alewood D. Chen S. Graham R.M. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Lewis R.J. Allosteric α1-adrenoceptor antagonism by the conopeptide ρ-TIA.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34451-34457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was purified to >95% purity and lyophilized. Analytical HPLC runs were performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system LC10A with a dual wavelength UV detector set at 214 and 254 nm. A reversed phase C-18 column (Zorbax 300-SB C-18; 4.6 × 50 mm) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min was used. Gradient elution was performed with the following buffer systems: A, 0.05% TFA in water, and B, 0.043% TFA in 90% acetonitrile in water, from 0% B to 80% B in 20 min. The crude peptides and oxidized peptides were purified by semi-preparative HPLC on a Shimadzu HPLC system LC8A associated with a reversed phase C-18 column (Vydac C18, 25 × 10 mm) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with a 1%/min gradient of 5% B to 50% B. The purity of the final product was evaluated by analytical HPLC (Zorbax 300SB C-18: 4.6 × 100 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a 1.67%/min gradient of B (5–45%). Purities of synthesized peptides were all >95%. Peptide concentrations used in in vitro screening were calculated based on peak size detected at 214 nm by HPLC. Peak size was calibrated using a peptide standard (in this case 1) with known peptide content established by amino acid analysis. Molecular extinction coefficients are calculated for the standard and the peptide of interest applying increments established by Buck et al. (21Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Protein estimation by the product of integrated peak area and flow rate.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using Lambert Beer Law, the peptide concentration was calculated based on absorptions of standard and sample using calculated extinction coefficients. Quantitation was confirmed using averaged IC50 values for ρ-TIA displacement of [3H]prazosin determined for each batch of ρ-TIA. Electrospray mass spectra were collected in line during analytical HPLC runs on an Applied Biosystems API-150 spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode with a declustering potential of 20, a focusing potential of 220, and Turbo spray of 350°. Masses between 300 and 2200 atomic mass units were detected (step 0.2 atomic mass units, dwell 0.3 ms). Samples of ρ-TIA prepared for NMR analysis included 1 mg/ml peptide in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 4.5. All data, including two-dimensional TOCSY, NOESY, and DQF-COSY, were acquired on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer at 298 K with 4k data points in the direct dimension and 512 increments in the indirect dimension (22Andersson H.S. Figueredo S.M. Haugaard-Kedstrom L.M. Bengtsson E. Daly N.L. Qu X. Craik D.J. Ouellette A.J. Rosengren K.J. The α-defensin salt-bridge induces backbone stability to facilitate folding and confer proteolytic resistance.Amino Acids. 2012; 43: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data were processed using Topspin 2.1 with the free induction decay multiplied by a 90° phase-shifted sine square window function, and zero filled to 1k data points in the indirect dimension prior to Fourier transform. The data were analyzed using the program CARA and assigned using standard two-dimensional homonuclear sequential assignment methods. Inter-proton distance restraints were derived from cross-peak intensities in a NOESY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 250 ms. Backbone dihedral angles were derived from 3JHαHN coupling constants, with residues <5 Hz (Trp-3, Arg-4, Cys-5, Ala-10, Arg-12, Arg-13, Lys-16, Lys-17, and Cys-19) being restrained to −60 ± 30° and residues >8 Hz (Asn-2, Leu-7, Ile-8, Cys-11, Asn-14, and His-15) being restrained to −120 ± 30°. Side chain χ1 angles and stereo specific assignments of Hβ protons were derived from a combination of 3JHαHβ coupling constants and Hα-Hβ and HN-Hβ NOESY peak intensities. Residues found to be in a t2g3 conformation (Arg-4, Cys-5, Cys-6, Leu-7, His-15, and Cys-19) were restrained to −60 ± 30°, and residues in a g2t3 conformation (Cys-11 and Arg-12) were restrained to −180 ± 30°. No residues could be confirmed to be in a g2g3 conformation. The amide protons of Cys-5, Cys-6, Leu-7, and Ile-8, Cys-11, and Cys-19 have previously been reported to be slow exchanging. During preliminary structure calculations, backbone carbonyl groups acting as hydrogen bond acceptors were unambiguously identified for all these amides, and thus restraints for these hydrogen bonds could be introduced in the calculations (Cys-5 → Asn-2, Cys-6 → Trp-3, Leu-7 → Arg-4, Ile-8 → Cys-5, Cys-11 → Ile-8, and Cys-19 → His-15). Structures were calculated using restrained simulated annealing within the program CNS using the topallhdg5.3.pro/parallhdg5.3.pro force field. Initial structures were calculated using torsion angle dynamics with a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps at 50,000 K and a cooling phase during which the temperature was lowered from 50,000 to 0 K through 4000 steps of 0.015 ps, followed by 5000 steps of Powell energy minimization. In a second step, these structures were refined through Cartesian dynamics in a water shell. This refinement involves the following: (i) a heating phase where the temperature was increased to 500 K in steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005-ps dynamics; (ii) a high temperature phase comprising 2500 steps of 0.005-ps dynamics at 500 K; (iii) a cooling phase where the temperature was lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005-ps dynamics, and finally (iv) an energy minimization phase comprising 3000 steps of Powell minimization. In the final round, 50 structures were calculated, and the 20 structures with lowest overall energy were chosen to represent the solution structure of ρ-TIA. These structures were analyzed and visualized using the programs MolProbity (23Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J.

https://openalex.org/W2092640710,"Ure2 is a phosphoprotein and central negative regulator of nitrogen-responsive Gln3/Gat1 localization and their ability to activate transcription. This negative regulation is achieved by the formation of Ure2-Gln3 and -Gat1 complexes that are thought to sequester these GATA factors in the cytoplasm of cells cultured in excess nitrogen. Ure2 itself is a dimer the monomer of which consists of two core domains and a flexible protruding αcap. Here, we show that alterations in this αcap abolish rapamycin-elicited nuclear Gln3 and, to a more limited extent, Gat1 localization. In contrast, these alterations have little demonstrable effect on the Gln3 and Gat1 responses to nitrogen limitation. Using two-dimensional PAGE we resolved eight rather than the two previously reported Ure2 isoforms and demonstrated Ure2 dephosphorylation to be stimulus-specific, occurring after rapamycin treatment but only minimally if at all in nitrogen-limited cells. Alteration of the αcap significantly diminished the response of Ure2 dephosphorylation to the TorC1 inhibitor, rapamycin. Furthermore, in contrast to Gln3, rapamycin-elicited Ure2 dephosphorylation occurred independently of Sit4 and Pph21/22 (PP2A) as well as Siw14, Ptc1, and Ppz1. Together, our data suggest that distinct regions of Ure2 are associated with the receipt and/or implementation of signals calling for cessation of GATA factor sequestration in the cytoplasm. This in turn is more consistent with the existence of distinct pathways for TorC1- and nitrogen limitation-dependent control than it is with these stimuli representing sequential steps in a single regulatory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2143240884,"Appropriate innate immune responses are required to protect an organism against foreign pathogens, and the immune response must be tightly controlled. Here, we report a new microRNA (miRNA) identified from a small RNA library from the epididymis, termed miR-7578, that acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses. It was abundantly expressed in immune-related organs and induced by lipopolysaccharide in the lung and epididymis, as well as macrophages stimulated with diverse Toll-like receptor ligands, in an NF-κB-dependent manner. mmu-miR-7578 inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα and IL6, by regulating its target gene Egr1, which encodes a transcription factor that activates TNFα and NF-κB expression. Transgenic mice overexpressing mmu-miR-7578 displayed higher resistance to endotoxin shock and lower plasma levels of TNFα and IL6, indicating that this miRNA acted as a negative molecule of immune response. In sum, we report a previously uncharacterized LPS-responsive miRNA that controls inflammatory response in a feedback loop by fine-tuning a key transcription factor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2078757530,"Minocycline protects against asthma independently of its antibiotic function and was recently reported as a potent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. In an animal model of asthma, a single administration of minocycline conferred excellent protection against ovalbumin-induced airway eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and Th2 cytokine production (IL-4/IL-5/IL-12(p70)/IL-13/GM-CSF) and a partial protection against airway hyperresponsiveness. These effects correlated with pronounced reduction in lung and sera allergen-specific IgE. A reduction in poly(ADP-ribose) immunoreactivity in the lungs of minocycline-treated/ovalbumin-challenged mice correlated with decreased oxidative DNA damage. The effect of minocycline on PARP may be indirect, as the drug failed to efficiently block direct PARP activation in lungs of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine-treated mice or H(2)O(2)-treated cells. Minocycline blocked allergen-specific IgE production in B cells potentially by modulating T cell receptor (TCR)-linked IL-4 production at the mRNA level but not through a modulation of the IL-4-JAK-STAT-6 axis, IL-2 production, or NFAT1 activation. Restoration of IL-4, ex vivo, rescued IgE production by minocycline-treated/ovalbumin-stimulated B cells. IL-4 blockade correlated with a preferential inhibition of the NF-κB activation arm of TCR but not GSK3, Src, p38 MAPK, or ERK1/2. Interestingly, the drug promoted a slightly higher Src and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of NF-κB was linked to a complete blockade of TCR-stimulated GATA-3 expression, a pivotal transcription factor for IL-4 expression. Minocycline also reduced TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation and expression of dependent genes. These results show a potentially broad effect of minocycline but that it may block IgE production in part by modulating TCR function, particularly by inhibiting the signaling pathway, leading to NF-κB activation, GATA-3 expression, and subsequent IL-4 production."
https://openalex.org/W1968909044,"Mitochondrial inner membrane proteins that carry an N-terminal presequence are sorted by one of two pathways: stop transfer or conservative sorting. However, the sorting pathway is known for only a small number of proteins, in part due to the lack of robust experimental tools with which to study. Here we present an approach that facilitates determination of inner membrane protein sorting pathways in vivo by fusing a mitochondrial inner membrane protein to the C-terminal part of Mgm1p containing the rhomboid cleavage region. We validated the Mgm1 fusion approach using a set of proteins for which the sorting pathway is known, and determined sorting pathways of inner membrane proteins for which the sorting mode was previously uncharacterized. For Sdh4p, a multispanning membrane protein, our results suggest that both conservative sorting and stop transfer mechanisms are required for insertion. Furthermore, the sorting process of Mgm1 fusion proteins was analyzed under different growth conditions and yeast mutant strains that were defective in the import motor or the m-AAA protease function. Our results show that the sorting of mitochondrial proteins carrying moderately hydrophobic transmembrane segments is sensitive to cellular conditions, implying that mitochondrial import and membrane sorting in the physiological environment may be dynamically tuned."
https://openalex.org/W1512525754,"IL-13 is a potent stimulator of alternative monocyte/macrophage activation. During alternative activation, the expression of several proteins is induced including 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), a lipid-peroxidating enzyme and the scavenger receptor CD36. We previously reported that αMβ2 integrin activation or clustering suppresses the expression of both 15-LO and CD36. In this study we focused on exploring the molecular mechanisms that down-regulate CD36 expression and CD36-mediated foam cell formation in IL-13-stimulated monocytes/macrophages after αMβ2 activation. Our studies reveal that αMβ2 integrin activation inhibits the IL-13 activation of several critical pathways that are required for macrophage alternative activation; namely, blocking Jak2 and Tyk2 phosphorylation, which bind to the cytoplasmic tails of the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. This leads to the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6) and prevents the formation of a signaling complex (containing p38MAPK, PKCδ, and Stat3) that are critical for the expression of both 15-LO and CD36. Jak2-mediated Hck activation is also inhibited, thereby preventing Stats serine phosphorylation, which is essential for downstream Stat-dependent gene transcription.

IL-13 is a potent stimulator of alternative monocyte/macrophage activation. During alternative activation, the expression of several proteins is induced including 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), a lipid-peroxidating enzyme and the scavenger receptor CD36. We previously reported that αMβ2 integrin activation or clustering suppresses the expression of both 15-LO and CD36. In this study we focused on exploring the molecular mechanisms that down-regulate CD36 expression and CD36-mediated foam cell formation in IL-13-stimulated monocytes/macrophages after αMβ2 activation. Our studies reveal that αMβ2 integrin activation inhibits the IL-13 activation of several critical pathways that are required for macrophage alternative activation; namely, blocking Jak2 and Tyk2 phosphorylation, which bind to the cytoplasmic tails of the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. This leads to the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6) and prevents the formation of a signaling complex (containing p38MAPK, PKCδ, and Stat3) that are critical for the expression of both 15-LO and CD36. Jak2-mediated Hck activation is also inhibited, thereby preventing Stats serine phosphorylation, which is essential for downstream Stat-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, inhibition of Jak2, Tyk2, or their downstream target 15-LO with antisense oligonucleotides profoundly inhibits IL-13-induced CD36 expression and CD36-dependent foam cell formation, whereas13(S) Hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), a 15-LO product and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligand, completely restores CD36 expression in monocytes treated with 15-LO antisense. αMβ2 integrin activation controls CD36 expression and foam cell formation in alternatively activated monocyte/macrophages by blocking Tyk2/Jak2 phosphorylation via a 15-LO-dependent pathway. The discovery of this mechanism helps our understanding of the potential role of alternatively activated macrophages in atherogenesis and highlights the impact of integrin αMβ2 on this process. Background: CD36, a macrophage receptor critical for oxidized lipid uptake during atherogenesis, is up-regulated after IL-4/IL-13 stimulation. Results: The mechanism whereby integrin αMβ2 inhibits CD36 gene expression and related foam-cell formation is elucidated. Conclusion: Activated integrin αMβ2 suppresses CD36-mediated lipid uptake by blocking Tyk2- and Jak2-mediated signaling pathways. Significance: αMβ2 integrin regulation of CD36 expression and function reveals a new mechanism that may control atherogenesis. Monocytes/macrophages play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity and are crucial mediators of the inflammatory response (1Varin A. Gordon S. Alternative activation of macrophages. Immune function and cellular biology.Immunobiology. 2009; 214: 630-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). They have been shown to display phenotypic plasticity depending on their environment and cytokine exposure. During inflammation macrophages can be activated by the classical activation pathway mediated by IFNγ producing macrophages with the M1 phenotype (2Dalton D.K. Pitts-Meek S. Keshav S. Figari I.S. Bradley A. Stewart T.A. Multiple defects of immune cell function in mice with disrupted interferon-γ genes.Science. 1993; 259: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) or by the alternative activation pathway induced by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, producing M2 macrophages (3Gordon S. Alternative activation of macrophages.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4721) Google Scholar, 4Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Alternative activation of macrophages. Mechanism and functions.Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). The relative roles of the various macrophage phenotypes in different inflammatory diseases have not been definitively elucidated. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which macrophages play a central role. In response to inflammatory stimulation, monocytes migrate to the vessel intima, differentiate to macrophages, and accumulate lipids, forming foam cells, the hallmark of atherosclerosis. Current observations demonstrate that early lesions in apoE−/− mice are formed mostly by M2 macrophages, which are later transformed to the M1 phenotype due to proinflammatory cytokines (5Khallou-Laschet J. Varthaman A. Fornasa G. Compain C. Gaston A.T. Clement M. Dussiot M. Levillain O. Graff-Dubois S. Nicoletti A. Caligiuri G. Macrophage plasticity in experimental atherosclerosis.PloS one. 2010; 5: e8852Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, another study revealed that in vitro treatment of M2 macrophages with oxLDL initiates the development of a strong proinflammatory response that shifts the M2 phenotype toward M1 (6van Tits L.J.

These studies show the potential pro-atherogenic role of M2 macrophages. Our study focuses on the mechanistic pathways mediated by alternative activation of monocytes/macrophages, which regulate the expression of a critical component of foam cell formation, the scavenger receptor CD36. CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor expressed in a variety of cells including monocytes and macrophages. Macrophage CD36 has been implicated in atherogenesis by contributing to foam cell formation in the atherosclerotic blood vessel intima (7Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. CD36.

Immunol. 2007; 37: 1642-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and may account for the potential pro-atherogenic functions of M2 macrophages. We recently found that the stimulation of another essential macrophage pathway interferes with IL-13-mediated expression of CD36: the activation of integrin αMβ2 (12Yakubenko V.P. Bhattacharjee A. Pluskota E. Cathcart M.K. αMβ2 integrin activation prevents alternative activation of human and murine macrophages and impedes foam cell formation.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Integrin αMβ2 (CD11b/CD18, MAC-1) is a cell surface receptor that is involved in adhesion/migration of monocytes and serves as a dynamic link between extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton (13Patarroyo M. Adhesion molecules mediating recruitment of monocytes to inflamed tissue.Immunobiology. 1994; 191: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Integrin activation, which regulates the adhesion/migration capability of cells, is a critical step during the recruitment of monocytes to the inflamed intima. In parallel, integrin-mediated signaling regulates many important cell responses during macrophage adhesion and migration (14Cabodi S. Di Stefano P. Leal Mdel P. Tinnirello A. Bisaro B. Morello V. Damiano L. Aramu S. Repetto D. Tornillo G. Defilippi P. Integrins and signal transduction.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 674: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The purpose of our current work was to analyze the detailed mechanism of αMβ2-mediated regulation of CD36 expression during the alternative activation of macrophages and to evaluate the possible effect of this regulation on foam cell formation. In our previous work we found that αMβ2 activation also suppresses the induction of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) 3The abbreviations used are: 15-LO15-lipoxygenaseBCSbovine calf serumODNoligodeoxyribonucleotideDiI1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorateoxLDLoxidized LDLPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorHODEHydroxyoctadecadienoic acidHPODEHydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid.

These products are potent mediators of inflammation (17Serhan C.N. Chiang N. Van Dyke T.E. Resolving inflammation. Dual anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution lipid mediators.Nat. Rev.

Previous studies demonstrated the potential link between 12/15-LO and CD36 expression in IL-4-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages (21Huang J.S. Guh J.Y. Hung W.C. Yang M.L. Lai Y.H. Chen H.C. Chuang L.Y. Role of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducters and activators of transcription (STAT) cascade in advanced glycation end-product-induced cellular mitogenesis in NRK-49F cells.Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that αMβ2-mediated inhibition of 15-LO and CD36 expression in human monocytes are related events during the activation of a single linear pathway rather than representing independent parallel pathways. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that αMβ2-mediated inhibition of CD36 expression and related foam cell formation are regulated via signaling pathways, which are critical for 15-LO induction. 15-lipoxygenase bovine calf serum oligodeoxyribonucleotide 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate oxidized LDL peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid Hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. We have found that inhibition of CD36 expression due to integrin αMβ2 activation is mediated by blocking the activation of the IL-13 receptor-associated Jak kinases (Jak2 and Tyk2), disruption of signaling complex Stat3/PKCδ/p38MAPK, and inhibition of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat transcription factors. We further demonstrate that αMβ2 integrin activation reduces CD36-dependent foam cell formation via 15-LO-dependent mechanism. Thus, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism of αMβ2-mediated inhibition of foam cell formation and demonstrate the influence of 15-LO in controlling CD36 expression and function in alternatively activated human monocytes/macrophages by IL-13. Recombinant human IL-13 was purchased from Invitrogen. The rabbit reticulocyte 15-LO antibody, cross-reacting with human 15-LO, was raised in sheep and was obtained as a gift from Dr. Joseph Cornicelli (Parke-Davis). Anti-phosphotyrosine-Stat (Tyr(P)-701-Stat1, Tyr(P)-705-Stat3, and Tyr(P)-641-Stat6), anti-phosphoserine-Stat3 (Ser(P)-727-Stat3), and p38MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and diluted 1:1000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stat3 monoclonal antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. The other primary antibodies used in this study were mouse anti-human p-Tyr (PY99), anti-Jak1, anti-Jak2, anti-Tyk2, anti-Hck, anti-phospho-(Tyr-411)-Hck (affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a short amino acid sequence containing phosphorylated Tyr-411 of Hck of human origin), rabbit anti-human PKCδ (C-20), and β-tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CD36 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). FITC-conjugated anti-CD36 mAb was obtained from BD Biosciences. FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 mAb (Clone 61D3) was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). The mAb 44a directed against the αM integrin subunit was purified from the conditioned media of the hybridoma cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) using protein A-agarose (GE Healthcare). Activating anti-β2 antibody (clone MEM48) was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Rosiglitazone, GW9662, PD146176, 13(S) HPODE and 13(S) HODE were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored either at 4 °C or at −20 °C as concentrated stock solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated and purified from whole blood as described previously (22Roy B. Cathcart M.K. Induction of 15-lipoxygenase expression by IL-13 requires tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and Tyk2 in human monocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, PBS-diluted blood was layered over a Ficoll-Paque density solution and centrifuged. The mononuclear cell layer was collected, and contaminating platelets were removed by centrifugation through bovine calf serum (BCS) after overlaying the serum with the mononuclear cells. Monocytes were isolated from the platelet-free mononuclear cells by adherence to flasks precoated with BCS and containing DMEM and 10% BCS. The flasks were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing the flasks with DMEM. Adherent cells were detached with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. The monocytes were collected, washed 3 times, and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for at least 2 h before use in experiments. The purity of the monocytes was 90%, which was confirmed for each experiment by FACS analysis with anti-CD14 mAb. In some experiments primary human monocytes were incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in the presence of DMEM and 10% BCS for another 5 days to be differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages. We refer to these cells as “macrophages” and activated them with IL-13 at this stage. These studies complied with all relevant federal guidelines and institutional policies regarding the use of human subjects. FACS analyses were performed to assess the expression of CD36 on the surface of monocytes. Monocytes were harvested and washed in Hanks' buffer two times. The cell pellet was resuspended in Hanks' buffer, and then 2 × 106 cells were preincubated with 4% normal goat serum for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in Hanks' buffer, and incubated with specific FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD36 mAb (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C according to a protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Finally, the cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and then analyzed using a FACScan™ (BD Biosciences). For each experiment an appropriate nonspecific isotype antibody was used as a negative control. Peripheral blood monocytes were treated with IL-13 (2 nm) for different time intervals as indicated, and postnuclear and total cell extracts were prepared as described previously (23Roy B. Bhattacharjee A. Xu B. Ford D. Maizel A.L. Cathcart M.K. IL-13 signal transduction in human monocytes. Phosphorylation of receptor components, association with Jaks, and phosphorylation/activation of Stats.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar). After determining the protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, lysate proteins (50 μg/well) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, blocked with 5% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, and subjected to immunoblotting with CD36, phospho-Stats or phospho-Hck antibodies overnight. The hybridization signal was detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). 15-LO protein was detected on Western blots following a previously described protocol (22Roy B. Cathcart M.K. Induction of 15-lipoxygenase expression by IL-13 requires tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and Tyk2 in human monocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with either Jak2, Tyk2, or PKCδ antibodies and precipitated with prewashed Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting as described above. In several experiments immunoblots were stripped and reprobed to assess equal loading according to our previously published protocol (23Roy B. Bhattacharjee A. Xu B. Ford D. Maizel A.L. Cathcart M.K. IL-13 signal transduction in human monocytes. Phosphorylation of receptor components, association with Jaks, and phosphorylation/activation of Stats.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes (5 × 106 in 2 ml 10% BCS/DMEM) were plated in six-well culture plates. After plating overnight for peripheral blood monocytes, cells were treated with recombinant IL-13 (2 nm) for 24 h. In some experiments, monocytes were pretreated with different pharmacological inhibitors for 30 min followed by IL-13 treatment for 24 h. After treatment monocytes were collected and washed with PBS. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to established protocols (24Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Interleukin-13 induction of 15-lipoxygenase gene expression requires p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated serine 727 phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The sequences of the 15-LO primers were: forward (5′-GCTGGAAGGATCTAGATGACT-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGCTACAGAGAATGACGTTG-3′). The sequences of the CD36 primers were: forward (5′-CAGAGGCTGACAACTTCACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-AGGGTACGGAACCAAACTCAA-3′). GAPDH was used as an internal control with the primer sequences of: forward (5′-CACCAACTGCTTAGCACCCC-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACG-3′). Monocytes (5 × 106/2 ml) were incubated overnight, and then the activation antibody to β2 integrin (clone MEM48, 10 μg/ml) was added to the cells and incubated for 3 min before IL-13 stimulation. Mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) was added to a separate well as a control. For integrin clustering monocytes were treated with anti-αM antibody (clone 44a, 5 μg/ml) for 20 min. After incubation goat-anti-mouse antibody was added (2 μg/ml) for an additional 5 min followed by treatment with IL-13. For the clustering control only anti-αM antibody (5 μg/ml) was added to the monocytes before IL-13 treatment. The antisense ODN sequences for human Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 were selected based on our previously published studies (22Roy B. Cathcart M.K. Induction of 15-lipoxygenase expression by IL-13 requires tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and Tyk2 in human monocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Control ODN for Jak2 and Tyk2 consisted of complementary sense ODN. The sense ODN sequence for Jak1 was predicted to possibly serve as an antisense for human γ adaptin mRNA. Hence we chose a scrambled ODN as a control for the Jak1 antisense. All ODNs were end-modified (phosphorothioated, three bases at the 5′ and 3′ ends) to limit DNA degradation, and all were HPLC-purified before use (Invitrogen). The sequences of the ODNs are as follows: Jak2 antisense, 5′-TCTTAACTCTGTTCTCGTTC-3′; Jak2 sense, 5′-GAACGAGAACAGAGTTAAGA-3′; Tyk2 antisense, 5′-CCAACTTTATGTGCAATGTG-3′. Tyk2 sense, 5′-CACATTGCACATAAAGTTGG-3′; Jak1 antisense, 5′-GGTTGCATCTGGAATCTTT-3′; Jak1 scrambled, 5′-TTGTGAACTGCCTGTGATT-3′. Primary human monocytes were transfected with Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 antisense ODNs along with the sense and scrambled ODN controls for 48 h with one re-feed at 24 h before the addition of IL-13. 15-LO antisense and sense ODNs were obtained from Invitrogen and handled according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 15-LO antisense ODN sequence was 5′-CCTGCACAGAGATCCAGTTGC-3′. A complementary 15-LO sense ODN sequence was used as a control. All ODNs were end-modified (phosphorothioated, three bases of 5′ and 3′) to limit DNA degradation, and all were HPLC-purified before use. 15-LO antisense or sense ODNs were boiled for 2–3 min and then cooled at room temp before being added to cells. Human monocytes (5 × 106 in 2 ml 10% BCS/DMEM) were fed either with 15-LO sense or antisense ODNs (5 μm). To check the effect of 15-LO antisense ODN on 15-LO protein expression, IL-13 (2 nm) was added to the appropriate samples 2 h after the antisense treatment. Cells were allowed to incubate at 37 °C and were re-fed with 15-LO sense and antisense ODNs (5 μm) after 24 h. Cells were then harvested and assayed for silencing 48 h after 15-LO antisense treatment. For real-time PCR experiments with the 15-LO antisense ODNs, cells were treated with 15-LO sense or antisense ODNs (5 μm) for a total period of 48 h with one re-feed after 24 h before the stimulation with IL-13 for 24 h. The phosphorothioated ODNs used for Stat1 and Stat3 decoys were purchased from Invitrogen. These decoys were used in previous studies and shown to provide specific inhibition of Stat1 and Stat3 activities (21Huang J.S. Guh J.Y. Hung W.C. Yang M.L. Lai Y.H. Chen H.C. Chuang L.Y. Role of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducters and activators of transcription (STAT) cascade in advanced glycation end-product-induced cellular mitogenesis in NRK-49F cells.Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The sequences for the decoys were 5′-ATA TTC CTG TAA GTG-3′ and 3′-TAT AAG GAC ATT CAC-5′ for Stat1, 5′-ATA TTG GAG TAA GTG-3′ and 3′-TAT AAC CTC ATT CAC-5′ for the mismatched Stat1 decoy, 5′-GAT CCT TCT GGG AAT TCC TAG ATC-3′ and 3′-CTA GGA AGA CCC TTA AGG ATC TAG-5′ for the Stat3 decoy, and 5′-GAT CCT TCT GGG CCG TCC TAG ATC-3′ and 3′-CTA GGA AGA CCC GGC AGG ATC TAG-5′ for the mismatched Stat3 decoy. The single-stranded ODNs were annealed by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature for 2 h. Double-stranded decoys were transfected into monocytes at a final concentration of 2 μm by using Superfect (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of transfection cells were treated with IL-13 for 24 h to assess CD36 mRNA expression. Double-stranded decoy ODNs containing the conserved promoter binding site of the Stat6 transcription factor and a scrambled decoy ODN sequence were prepared from complementary single-stranded phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (ordered from Invitrogen) by melting at 90 °C for 3 h during which time the temperature was reduced from 90 °C to 25 °C. Human monocytes were plated in six-well culture plates overnight. Cells were then transfected with decoy ODNs using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 24 h. Monocytes were then incubated in the absence or presence of IL-13 for another 24 h for CD36 mRNA quantification. The single-stranded sequences of the decoy ODNs were as follows: Stat6 decoy ODN (5′-GAT CAA GAC CTT TTC CCA AGA AAT CTA T-3′ and 3′-CAT GTT CTG GAA AAG GGT TCT TTA GAT A-5′); scrambled decoy ODN (5′-CGA AAA TTC GTT AAA TCA CTA GCT TAC C-3′ and 3′-GCT TTT AAG CAA TTT AGT GAT CGA ATG G-5′). The LDL, modified by reactive nitrogen species generated by the leukocyte myeloperoxidase system (NO2 oxLDL) was kindly provided by Dr. David Kennedy (from Dr. Roy Silverstein laboratory, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH). Fluorophor-labeled NO2 oxLDL was generated using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Primary human monocytes were plated on coverslips (2.5 × 106/ml) and differentiated 5 days in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum. 1 h before the oxLDL treatment, the medium was exchanged to serum-free DMEM medium. Cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 5 μg/ml DiI-oxLDL. After incubation, coverslips were washed 3 times with cold PBS, fixed with 10% formaldehyde, and mounted on slides in DAPI solution. DiI-oxLDL was detected by fluorescence microscope. Five randomly selected fields from each slide were analyzed. The intensity of the DiI fluorophor was quantified using computer-assisted image analysis software Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for the FACS analysis and foam cell formation experiments and Student's paired t test for the real-time PCR experiments. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The up-regulation of CD36 and 15-LO expression after IL-13/IL-4 treatment has been shown before (11Berry A. Balard P. Coste A. Olagnier D. Lagane C.

https://openalex.org/W1996193561,"Discovering proteins that modulate Akt signaling has become a critical task, given the oncogenic role of Akt in a wide variety of cancers. We have discovered a novel diacylglycerol signaling pathway that promotes dephosphorylation of Akt. This pathway is regulated by diacylglycerol kinase δ (DGKδ). In DGKδ-deficient cells, we found reduced Akt phosphorylation downstream of three receptor tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation upstream of Akt was not affected. Our data indicate that PKCα, which is excessively active in DGKδ-deficient cells, promotes dephosphorylation of Akt through pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeats protein phosphatase (PHLPP) 2. Depletion of either PKCα or PHLPP2 rescued Akt phosphorylation in DGKδ-deficient cells. In contrast, depletion of PHLPP1, another Akt phosphatase, failed to rescue Akt phosphorylation. Other PHLPP substrates were not affected by DGKδ deficiency, suggesting mechanisms allowing specific modulation of Akt dephosphorylation. We found that β-arrestin 1 acted as a scaffold for PHLPP2 and Akt1, providing a mechanism for specificity. Because of its ability to reduce Akt phosphorylation, we tested whether depletion of DGKδ could attenuate tumorigenic properties of cultured cells and found that DGKδ deficiency reduced cell proliferation and migration and enhanced apoptosis. We have, thus, discovered a novel pathway in which diacylglycerol signaling negatively regulates Akt activity. Our collective data indicate that DGKδ is a pertinent cancer target, and our studies could lay the groundwork for development of novel cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2073697308,"Protein biosynthesis and extracellular secretion are essential biological processes for therapeutic protein production in mammalian cells, which offer the capacity for correct folding and proper post-translational modifications. In this study, we have generated bispecific therapeutic fusion proteins in mammalian cells by combining a peptide and an antibody into a single open reading frame. A neutralizing peptide directed against interleukin-17A (IL17A) was genetically fused to the N termini of an anti-IL22 antibody, through either the light chain, the heavy chain, or both chains. Although the resulting fusion proteins bound and inhibited IL22 with the same affinity and potency as the unmodified anti-IL22 antibody, the peptide modality in the fusion scaffold was not active in the cell-based assay due to the N-terminal degradation. When a glutamine residue was introduced at the N terminus, which can be cyclized to form pyroglutamate in mammalian cells, the IL17A neutralization activity of the fusion protein was restored. Interestingly, the mass spectroscopic analysis of the purified fusion protein revealed an unexpected O-linked glycosylation modification at threonine 5 of the anti-IL17A peptide. The subsequent removal of this post-translational modification by site-directed mutagenesis drastically enhanced the IL17A binding affinity and neutralization potency for the resulting fusion protein. These results provide direct experimental evidence that post-translational modifications during protein biosynthesis along secretory pathways play critical roles in determining the structure and function of therapeutic proteins produced by mammalian cells.

Ever since human tissue plasminogen activator was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1986, cultivated mammalian cells have become important host cells for the production of recombinant proteins for clinical applications, due to their relevant post-translational modifications and stringent protein quality control mechanisms for correct protein folding and assembly (1Wurm F.M. Production of recombinant protein therapeutics in cultivated mammalian cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 2Omasa T. Onitsuka M. Kim W.D. Cell engineering and cultivation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2010; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis and extracellular secretion of therapeutic proteins in mammalian cells are complicated biological processes. Physiological and pharmacological properties of therapeutic proteins produced therein can vary significantly due to the impacts on cellular biosynthetic machineries by cell culture conditions and cell lineages. A better understanding of these fundamental biological processes and their relationships with the primary sequences of the proteins can potentially improve the quality, efficacy, and safety of the next generation of therapeutic products through protein engineering and process engineering. Recombinant therapeutic proteins generally include therapeutic antibodies and Fc-like fusions, therapeutic enzymes, and small protein therapeutics (3Carter P.J.

Recent examples of these therapeutic peptides include a 36-amino acid enfuvirtide for HIV treatment (7Bray B.L. Large-scale manufacture of peptide therapeutics by chemical synthesis.Nat. Rev.

One of the major obstacles for peptide therapeutics development is short serum half-life in vivo due to a rapid clearance from circulation and little resistance to serum and tissue proteases. There are a number of recent technology developments addressing these issues. Chemical attachment of a polyethylene glycol moiety is commonly used for half-life extension (15Fishburn C.S.

Although these advanced modalities attempt to solve the issue of poor pharmacokinetics of peptides, they do not utilize existing therapeutic antibodies, and some have manufacturing complexity, requiring an additional in vitro production step. We have developed an approach to combine one or more peptides with an antibody using genetic engineering to make use of the well established mammalian production system for recombinant proteins. This bispecific peptide-antibody fusion protein should extend the peptide half-life while targeting two unique and potentially synergistic therapeutic targets.

The data from the study reveal that the peptide modality in the resulting fusion proteins is much more susceptible to loss of function than antibody modality when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293). For generating a bispecific fusion molecule fully functional with both in vitro binding and cell-based activities, N-terminal pyroglutamate addition and removal of an unexpected O-linked glycan are required. A PCR fragment encoding a murine IgG1 leader sequence, anti-IL17A CVX-5484, six-glycine linker, and antibody IL22-104 mature light chain was cloned into a murine cytomegalovirus promoter containing vector pSMED2 (pWZ1237, G6-LC). A similar PCR fragment encoding a murine IgG1 leader sequence, CVX-5484, GSE21 linker (GSGEGEGSEGGGEGEGSEGSG), and antibody IL22-104 mature light chain, was cloned into pSMED2 vector (pWZ1236, GSE21-LC). G6-HC (pWZ1238) encodes a murine IgG1 leader sequence, CVX-5484, a G6 linker, and antibody IL22-104 mature heavy chain in pSMED2. GSE21-HC (pWZ1239) encodes a murine IgG1 leader sequence, CVX-5484, GSE21 linker, and antibody IL22-104 mature heavy chain in pSMED2. Q-G6-HC (pWZ1246) and Q-GSE21-HC (pWZ1247) inserted a glutamine codon 5′ to the CVX-5484 coding fragment in pWZ1238 and pWZ1239, respectively. Q-GSE12-HC (pWZ1248) replaced the G6 linker in Q-G6-HC with GSE 12 (GSGEGEGSEGSG). Q-GSE21-LC (pWZ1256) inserted a glutamine codon 5′ to CVX-5484 coding fragment in GSE21-LC. Q-G-HC (pWZ1257) replaced the G6 linker in Q-G6-HC with glycine. Q-HC (pWZ1258) removed glycine from Q-G-HC. Q-G6-LC (pWZ1260) inserted a glutamine codon 5′ to the CVX-5484 coding fragment in G6-LC. Q-G-LC (pWZ1263) replaced the G6 linker in Q-G6-LC with glycine. Q-GSE21-LC-T5A (pWZ1269) and Q-GSE21-HC-T5A (pWZ1274) contained a TCC → GCC change in Q-GSE21-LC and Q-GSE21-HC, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293F cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) were cultured in freestyle 293 medium (Invitrogen). Cells were grown and maintained in a humidified incubator with 7% CO2 at 37 °C. Conditioned medium for the peptide-antibody constructs were produced from a large scale transient HEK293 transfection process. Essentially, for the culture volume of 10 liters, 5 mg of heavy chain and light chain plasmid DNAs were mixed with 20 mg of polyethyleneimine (25 kDa, linear, neutralized to pH 7.0 by HCl, 1 mg/ml, Polysciences (Warrington, PA)) in 500 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). Then the mixtures were mixed with 10 liters of HEK293F cells preseeded in a wave bioreactor at a cell density of 1.25 × 106 cells/ml. 0.5% tryptone N1 (Organotechnie, Quebec, Canada) was added 24 h post-transfection. The wave bioreactors were incubated at 37 °C with a rocking rate of 20 rpm for 120 h before harvest. The conditioned media were filtered at 0.22 μm prior to purification. The conditioned medium was batch-bound to 4 ml of rmpProtein A resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2 (PBS), at 4 °C overnight. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS and then with 10 column volumes of PBS + 0.02% Tween 20. The column was then washed with an additional 30 column volumes of PBS before a step elution with 100 mm citric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3. Peak fractions were neutralized to pH 7.0 with 2 m Tris, pH 9.0, pooled, buffer-exchanged into PBS, and then concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml using a 50,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal device. Kinetic analysis was performed using a Biacore 2000 or 3000 (GE Healthcare). All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and all reagents were coupled using N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide to activate the surface, and the surface was subsequently blocked following immobilization with ethanolamine. For IL22 kinetics experiments, the antibodies/fusions were directly immobilized. Antibody/fusion immobilization levels ranged from 75 to 1,700 RU. Kinetic measurements were performed at 30 μl/min. Various concentrations of IL22, ranging from 15.6 to 1 μm, or buffer were prepared in PBS-NET buffer (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 287 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 3.2 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20). All surfaces were regenerated using one 30-s pulse of 10 mm glycine HCl at pH 1.7, followed by PBS-NET. Two independent experiments were acquired, with injections acquired in duplicate, on two different surfaces of immobilized antibody or fusion. For measurement of peptide kinetics to IL17A, IL17A was directly immobilized. Kinetic measurements were performed at 50 μl/min. Various concentrations of each peptide, ranging from 7.8 to 500 nm, or buffer were prepared in PBS-NET buffer. All surfaces were regenerated at 50 μl/min using three 30-s pulses of a solution of 33 mm NaPO4, 333 mm NaCl, 6.7% DMSO, 6.7% formamide, 6.7% ethanol, 6.7% acetonitrile, and 6.7% 1-butanol, followed by PBS-NET. Three independent experiments were acquired, with injections acquired in duplicate, each over three surfaces of immobilized IL17A. For IL17A binding kinetics to the genetic fusions, anti-human IgG antibody (GE Healthcare) was coupled to a research grade CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling as instructed by the manufacturer at surface densities between 4,000 and 7,500 RU. Genetic fusions were captured to the anti-human IgG surface at surface densities between 60 and 560 RU. Kinetic measurements were performed at 50 μl/min. Various concentrations of the human IL17A, ranging from 3.9 nm to 4 μm, or buffer were prepared in PBS-NET. All surfaces were regenerated at 50 μl/min using three 30-s pulses of 3 m MgCl2, followed by 2 mm glycine HCl at pH 1.7, followed by PBS-NET. Two independent experiments were acquired, with injections acquired in duplicate or in triplicate, each over three surfaces of captured genetic fusion. For all experiments, data were double referenced using Scrubber version 2.0c software (BioLogic Software) (29Myszka D.G. Improving biosensor analysis.J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The transformed data were fit to a 1:1 binding model in BiaEvaluation version 4.1.1 (GE Healthcare). Human foreskin fibroblast cells and BJ cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. BJ cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well into 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates in which IL17A had been prediluted in culture medium at a final concentration between 1 and 5 ng/ml. In treatments where IL17A inhibitors were used, genetic fusions were added to the wells and serially diluted 3× in a 150-μl total volume. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h, and supernatants were collected and analyzed for growth-related oncogene-α (GRO-α) production by ELISA. GRO-α assays were performed to assess the antibody's ability to block the IL22-induced GRO-α secretion from HT29 cells. HT29 cells where seeded in a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (catalog no. 3595, Corning Inc.) in DMEM medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine) at 5 × 104/well. 10 ng/ml IL22 was mixed with serially diluted antibody in DMEM medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. 24 h after seeding, medium was removed from HT29 cells, and premixed IL22 and antibody were added to the cells in a 96-well plate. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, medium was collected, and secreted GRO-α was tested using a human GRO-α immunoassay kit (catalog no. DGR00, R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's directions. The ELISA was run according to the manufacturer's protocol (catalog no. DY275E, R&D Systems). Plates were coated with anti-human GRO-α (catalog no. MAB275, R&D Systems) at 4 μg/ml. A standard curve was run from a 4 ng/ml recombinant human GRO-α standard (catalog no. 275-GR, R&D Systems) diluted serially 2×. Samples were added in supernatant from assay plate, diluted 2× into PBS plus 1% BSA, pH 7.2. Bound GRO-α was detected with anti-human GRO-α biotin (catalog no. BAF275, R&D Systems) at 40 ng/ml, followed by streptavidin-HRP (catalog no. DY998, R&D Systems), followed by a 1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine substrate (catalog no. DY999, R&D Systems), followed by 2 n H2SO4. An end point measurement was taken using the SpectraMax instrument at 450–550 nm. GRO-α levels were calculated from ELISA absorbance units by fitting the binding curve for the GRO-α internal standard to a four-parameter fit using the XLfit Excel Add-In version 4.3.2 build 11 and MathIQ version 2.2.2 build 152. IC50 values were determined by fitting sample data to a four-parameter dose-response curve. Data shown are for a single representative experiment. Reported values are averages ± S.D. from two independent experiments, one of which was run in duplicate. Peptide-antibody fusion protein samples were deglycosylated by peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) and further reduced by TCEP (Thermo Fisher). The samples were acidified by diluting 1:1 with 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Peptide-antibody fusion protein samples were reduced with DTT (20 mm) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (50 mm) and separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The band corresponding to the fusion protein containing the anti-IL17A peptide was excised and incubated with 70% ethylamine at 50 °C for 18 h. The band was then digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed using a Waters Xevo Q-TOF G2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) 1100 capillary HPLC. The deglycosylated and reduced samples were separated over an Agilent Poroshell 300SB-C8 (0.5 × 75-mm) column maintained at 80 °C with a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Mobile phase A was water with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with 2% water and 0.1% formic acid. Proteins are eluted from the column using a gradient: 2–20% B in 0.5 min, 20–40% B in 6 min, and 40–100% B in 4 min. The mass spectrometer was run in positive MS only mode, scanning from 800 to 2,000 m/z, and data were acquired with MassLynx (Waters) version 4.1 software. The TOF-MS signals corresponding to the light and heavy chains were summarized and deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 (Waters) program. For LC-MS/MS analysis, recovered peptides were loaded onto a Pico-frit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed with reversed-phase Magic (Michrom, Auburn, CA) C18 material (5 μm, 200 Å, 75 μm × 10 cm) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Waltham, MA). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min using a 90-min linear gradient ranging from 2 to 40% B (mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile; mobile phase B: 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The instrumental method consisted of a full MS scan (scan range 375–2,000 m/z, with 30,000 full width at half-maximum resolution at m/z 400, target value 2 × 106, maximum ion injection time of 500 ms) followed by data-dependent collision-induced dissociation scans of the four most intense precursor ions. Peptide precursor ions were selected with an isolation window of 2.5 Da and a target value of 1 × 105. The normalized collision energy was set to 35% for collision-induced dissociation and 40% for higher energy collisional dissociation, respectively. The mass spectra were searched against a public antibody database, with the sequences of our constructs added, using the Proteome Discoverer version 1.2 search algorithm (ThermoElectron). The mass accuracy was set to 5 ppm for precursor ions and to 0.5 Da tolerances for fragment ions. The search parameters took into account two missed cleavages for trypsin, static modification of carboxamidomethylation at cysteine (+57.0215 Da), and dynamic modification for methionine oxidation (Met +15.9949 Da), and the addition of ethylamine was also considered on serine and threonine (+27.0473 Da). As shown in Fig. 1, the 15-amino acid peptide CVX5484 was fused genetically to IL22-104 antibody. Because the peptide requires a free N terminus for its anti-IL17A neutralization activity, it was only fused to N-terminal ends of the antibody polypeptides. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the DNA sequence encoding the peptide was inserted into the 5′ DNA sequence encoding either the heavy chain (HC-divalent), the light chain (LC-divalent), or both chains (tetravalent) of the IL22-104 antibody downstream of the signal sequence. According to structural modeling (Fig. 1), the hydration shell (30Ebbinghaus S. Kim S.J. Heyden M. Yu X. Heugen U. Gruebele M. Leitner D.M. Havenith M.

We therefore added three different linker lengths (6 glycines (G6) and glycine-serine-glutamate repeats (GSE12 and GSE21)) between the peptide and antibody in order to minimize any loss of binding for either the peptide to IL17A or the antibody to IL22. The resulting DNA constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the proteins were purified from the conditioned media, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first determined if the peptide-antibody fusion retained any anti-IL22 binding activity.

Cells infected by viruses produce type I interferons to signal the presence of the invader to uninfected neighboring cells (1Parham P. The Immune System. 2nd Ed. Garland Science, New York2005: 250Google Scholar). These cytokines are called interferon because they bind to specific cell-surface receptors to activate specific genes that will interfere with virus replication. The discovery of their biological functions led to the development of these proteins as therapeutics. In fact, type I interferons are among the most widely used human recombinant protein therapeutics for the treatment of several cancers and viral infections. Within the 13 α-subtypes, only two, IFNα2a (Roferon-A®) and IFNα2b (Intron-A®), are marketed for therapeutic use. Recombinant IFNα2 is a polypeptide of 165 amino acids. Subtypes a and b differ only by one residue at position 23 (Lys to Arg). The three-dimensional structure was determine by Klaus et al. (2Klaus W. Gsell B. Labhardt A.M. Wipf B. Senn H. The three-dimensional high resolution structure of human interferon α2a determined by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 661-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) using NMR spectroscopy in solution. The fold consists of five α-helices (labeled A–E), four of which are arranged in an antiparallel fashion to form a left-handed four-helix bundle. Two disulfide bonds stabilize the conformation. During the development of recombinant versions of IFNα2 from Escherichia coli for therapeutic use, Adolf et al. (3Adolf G.R. Kalsner I. Ahorn H. Maurer-Fogy I. Cantell K. Natural human interferon α2 is O-glycosylated.Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) discovered that three subtypes (a–c) of native IFNα2 are O-glycosylated at Thr-106. This residue is located in the CD loop at one end of the helix bundle and may not interact with the receptor. In fact, the recently reported structures of complexes between IFNα2a and its receptor by NMR (4Nudelman I. Akabayov S.R. Scherf T. Anglister J. Observation of intermolecular interactions in large protein complexes by 2D-double difference nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy: application to the 44 kDa interferon-receptor complex.J. Am.

Structural linkage between ligand discrimination and receptor activation by type I interferons.Cell. 2011; 146: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) do not shed light on such possible interactions. This may explain the similar biological activity observed for both the recombinant IFNα2 produced in bacteria and the glycosylated version purified from human leukocytes. However, Loignon et al. (6Loignon M. Perret S. Kelly J. Boulais D. Cass B. Bisson L. Afkhamizarreh F. Durocher Y. Stable high volumetric production of glycosylated human recombinant IFNα2b in HEK293 cells.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that O-glycosylated IFNα2b produced in HEK293 cells inhibits viral activity more than IFNα2b prepared in E. coli. This suggests that the glycan does modulate biological activity. In general, glycosylation of serine/threonine residues of proteins plays important roles in protein localization and trafficking, protein solubility, antigenicity, and cell-cell interactions (7Brockausen I. Schachter H. Stanley P. Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 115-128Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggested that the glycan at Thr-106 might not improve the stability of the conformation under thermal stress. Using far-UV circular dichroism and calorimetry to monitor thermal unfolding, Johnston et al. (8Johnston M.J. Frahm G. Li X. Durocher Y. Hefford M.A. O-Linked glycosylation leads to decreased thermal stability of interferon α2b as measured by two orthogonal techniques.Pharm. Res. 2011; 28: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that glycosylated IFNα2b is less thermostable by ∼2 °C than the non-glycosylated form. In contrast, the opposite effect was observed for glycosylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The latter is more thermostable by ∼5 °C compared with the non-glycosylated E. coli-derived version (9Oh-eda M. Hasegawa M. Hattori K. Kuboniwa H. Kojima T. Orita T. Tomonou K. Yamazaki T. Ochi N. O-Linked sugar chain of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor protects it against polymerization and denaturation, allowing it to retain its biological activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11432-11435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports thus suggest that glycosylation modulates conformational stability. It may also play a role in protein solubility and half-life in serum (10Youngster S. Wang Y.S. Grace M. Bausch J. Bordens R. Wyss D.F. Structure, biology, and therapeutic implications of pegylated interferon α2b.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2139-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, IFNα2 with covalently linked PEG exhibits a significantly increased bioavailability. One injection per week of the N-terminally PEGylated version of IFNα2b achieved the same therapeutic result as three injections per week of the non-PEGylated protein (11Glue P. Fang J.W. Rouzier-Panis R. Raffanel C. Sabo R. Gupta S.K. Salfi M. Jacobs S. Pegylated interferon α2b: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and preliminary efficacy data.Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 68: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Moreover, a PEGylated version of GalNAcα-IFNα2b, in which the PEG moiety was linked to the sugar, had a significantly greater plasma concentration and half-life and 25-fold greater antiviral activity than E. coli-derived IFNα2b (12DeFrees S. Wang Z.-G. Xing R. Scott A.E. Wang J. Zopf D. Gouty D.L. Sjoberg E.R. Panneerselvam K. Brinkman-Van der Linden E.C. Bayer R.J. Tarp M.A. Clausen H. GlycoPEGylation of recombinant therapeutic proteins produced in Escherichia coli.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The role played by the glycan in modulating these biophysical properties (thermostability and solubility) may be explained in terms of perturbations of the conformation and/or dynamics of the polypeptide chain. Therefore, we aimed to apply NMR spectroscopy techniques to study the effects of glycosylation of IFNα2a on its structure and dynamics. The main challenge of using NMR spectroscopy lies in the production of glycoprotein samples enriched with stable isotopes such as carbon-13 and nitrogen-15, which are required to determine the three-dimensional structure and measure parameters sensitive to protein dynamics. Recently, a eukaryotic expression system based on human cell lines (HEK293) has been reported to produce high levels of glycosylated IFNα2b (6Loignon M. Perret S. Kelly J. Boulais D. Cass B. Bisson L. Afkhamizarreh F. Durocher Y. Stable high volumetric production of glycosylated human recombinant IFNα2b in HEK293 cells.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although isotope incorporation may be feasible using defined serum-free media with such eukaryotic expression systems, it is a very expensive endeavor. In addition, this approach produces glycosylated IFNα2b with a heterogeneous glycan composition. Adolf et al. (3Adolf G.R. Kalsner I. Ahorn H. Maurer-Fogy I. Cantell K. Natural human interferon α2 is O-glycosylated.Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) detected three major glycan structure variants in naturally produced IFNα2: the core-1 (or T antigen) structure Gal(β1,3)GalNAc and the latter substituted with either lactosamine linked to the GalNAc unit or sialic acid linked to the Gal moiety. Less abundant structures may incorporate fucose (3Adolf G.R. Kalsner I. Ahorn H. Maurer-Fogy I. Cantell K. Natural human interferon α2 is O-glycosylated.Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, to address both challenges of isotope incorporation and glycan heterogeneity, we chose a strategy based on the production of labeled IFNα2a in E. coli, followed by an in vitro enzymatic stepwise addition of the various monosaccharide units. This approach, first proposed by Wong and co-workers (13Brik A. Ficht S. Wong C.-H. Strategies for the preparation of homogenous glycoproteins.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), provides a flexible labeling scheme and facilitates the production of a homogeneous glycoprotein for NMR studies. A priori, one may consider making a fully 13C,15N-labeled O-glycoprotein to take full advantage of triple resonance NMR techniques. Because UDP-[13C,15N]GalNAc is not commercially available, its synthesis from the very expensive [13C,15N]GlcNAc (14Zhao G. Guan W. Cai L. Wang P.G. Enzymatic route to preparative-scale synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc/GalNAc, their analogues and GDP-fucose.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto K. Kawai H. Tochikura T. Preparation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylgalactosamine from uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine by using microbial enzymes.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1981; 41: 392-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would be required. The many steps involved would further increase the final cost of producing a fully labeled sample. Instead, we opted for the preparation of a fully labeled polypeptide chain bearing unlabeled glycans. This labeling scheme was more practical in view of our intention to first study the effects of a single GalNAc residue on the protein structure and dynamics. The procedure for the preparation of [13C,15N]IFNα2a has been described (16Panjwani N. Hodgson D.J. Sauvé S. Aubin Y.

Sci. 2010; 99: 3334-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Enzymatic addition of GalNAc to [13C,15N]IFNα2a was carried out using human polypeptide GalNAc-transferase 2 (GalNAc-T2). 2The abbreviations used are: GalNAc-T2GalNAc-transferase 2HSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation.

The reaction was followed by capillary electrophoresis analysis using a Beckman Coulter P/ACE MDQ system equipped with a photodiode array detector. The aliquots were denatured at 50 °C for 5 min in 0.1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, and 2.5 mm EDTA.

Enzymatic addition of a Gal unit to purified GalNAcα-[13C,15N]IFNα2a was carried out using a MalE fusion of the Campylobacter jejuni β1,3-galactosyltransferase (MalE-CgtB) (17Bernatchez S. Gilbert M.

Variants of the β1,3-galactosyltransferase CgtB from the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni have distinct specificities.Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at 25 °C for 4 h with 1 mg/ml GalNAcα-[13C,15N]IFNα2a in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0) containing 6 mm MnCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 2.5 mm UDP-Gal, and 100 milliunits/ml MalE-CgtB. The reaction was followed by capillary electrophoresis as described above. The reaction mixtures were desalted on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The column was eluted at 5 ml/min with 1.5 column volumes of 25 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0). The desalted fractions were pooled and loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm NaOAc buffer (pH 5.0). The material was eluted at 5 ml/min using a 0–0.8 m NaCl gradient over 16 column volumes. Fractions (2 ml) absorbing at 280 nm were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) to determine which fractions contained the labeled glycoprotein. NMR measurements were performed at 25 °C on Bruker AVANCE III 600-MHz and AVANCE 700-MHz spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance cryogenic probe head. Samples were made of 0.7–0.9 mm labeled proteins ([15N]IFNα2a, [13C,15N]IFNα2a, GalNAcα-[13C,15N]IFNα2a, or Gal(β1,3)GalNAcα-[13C,15N]IFNα2a) in buffer containing 25 mm deuterated acetic acid (pH 3.5), 0.1 mm 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium, and 5% deuterium oxide. Resonance assignments of the backbone atoms were obtained from two-dimensional 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) and 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation and three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. Side chain resonances were assigned using three-dimensional HCCH total correlation spectroscopy, three-dimensional HCCH COSY, Aro-CB(CGCD)HD, and Aro-CB(CGCDCE)HE. For structure calculation purposes, three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC, four-dimensional CC NOESY, and four-dimensional CN NOESY experiments were recorded with mixing times of 150 ms. Resonances for GalNAc were assigned using two-dimensional filtered NOESY with 0.7 mm GalNAcα-[13C,15N]IFNα2a in buffer containing 100% D2O. All spectra were referenced relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium, processed using NMRPipe (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A.

SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2008Google Scholar). The protein chemical shifts were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) under accession numbers 18135 and 18344 for GalNAcα-IFNα2a and Gal(β1–3)GalNAcα-IFNα2a, respectively. The 15N{1H} steady-state heteronuclear Overhauser enhancement experiment, described by Farrow et al. (20Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Comparison of the backbone dynamics of a folded and an unfolded SH3 domain existing in equilibrium in aqueous buffer.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 868-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), was used to measure backbone dynamics at 298 K. The pulse sequence from the Bruker library was modified to add a relaxation delay of 3 s at the start of the pulse sequence. Three measurements at both fields (600 and 700 MHz) were performed for error estimation. Structure calculations were performed using CYANA 2.1 (21Güntert P. Automated NMR protein structure calculation with CYANA.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The amino acid library of CYANA had been modified to incorporate torsion angle parameters for an O-glycosylated threonine residue, where the hydroxyl oxygen of threonine was covalently attached to the reducing end (C1) of the GalNAc moiety in an axial orientation, resulting in an α-glycosidic bond. Cartesian coordinates of the GalNAcα-Thr residue were obtained by linking a threonine residue and GalNAc using the Chimera software package (22Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera–a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27922) Google Scholar). A new CYANA entity was then created using the generated atomic coordinates and editing torsion angle definitions following the template for threonine (from the CYANA standard library) and the template for GalNAc. A total of 258 backbone torsion angles were derived from chemical shifts using TALOS+ (23Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 4: 213-223Crossref Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). In addition, calculations were performed with 66 hydrogen bond constraints inferred from the sequential short- and medium-range NOE pattern (Table 1). Structure validation was performed using the following packages: the Protein Structure Validation Software Suite (PSVS; version 1.4) from the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (24Bhattacharya A. Tejero R. Montelione G.T. Evaluating protein structures determined by structural genomics consortia.Proteins. 2007; 66: 778-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), the structure validation program PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A.

No further refinement was necessary to obtain a well resolved NMR ensemble of structures. The NMR structure ensemble was deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), under code 2LMS.

Open table in a new tab The preparation of glycosylated IFNα2a was carried out in two steps. First, the polypeptide was produced with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 enrichment in E. coli. Then, an unlabeled GalNAc unit was added enzymatically in vitro to the fully labeled folded protein. This labeling scheme has two advantages: the cost effectiveness of using unlabeled monosaccharide units and the possibility to use isotope-filtered NMR experiments that can distinguish between protein and glycan resonances. The polypeptide contains 14 serine and 10 threonine residues, half of which are well exposed to the bulk water. Considering that there are no consensus sequences for the addition of O-GalNAc at Ser/Thr residues, the choice of the appropriate glycosyltransferase isoform was determined from the work of DeFrees et al. (12DeFrees S. Wang Z.-G. Xing R. Scott A.E. Wang J. Zopf D. Gouty D.L. Sjoberg E.R. Panneerselvam K. Brinkman-Van der Linden E.C. Bayer R.J. Tarp M.A. Clausen H. GlycoPEGylation of recombinant therapeutic proteins produced in Escherichia coli.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The authors subjected a synthetic peptide (residues 100–113) covering the potential glycosylation site of IFNα2a to six isoforms of GalNAc-T. Analysis of the reaction products by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry suggested that GalNAc-T2 added a single GalNAc unit at Thr-106. The addition of the first unit of the core-1 glycan, also referred to as the Tn antigen, was quantitative as showed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1). The initial analysis of the glycosylation reaction product was carried out using two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC experiments to verify that GalNAc-T2 added the GalNAc unit at Thr-106 only. Comparison of the proton-nitrogen NMR correlation spectra of GalNAcα-IFNα2a and non-glycosylated IFNα2a showed that the small glycan induced the largest chemical shift perturbations at the glycosylation site and surrounding residues (Fig. 1A). The overlay revealed that both Thr-106 and Thr-108 showed large chemical shift differences. Considering that amide chemical shifts are very sensitive to the smallest change in the local magnetic environment, the large differences indicated either that Thr-108 was highly perturbed by the glycosylation of Thr-106 or that both residues had been glycosylated. Fortunately, carbon chemical shifts are better probes to detect changes in the covalent structure of the side chains of amino acids after post-translational modification. The large change in chemical shift (+9.92 ppm) observed for the β-carbon of Thr-106 in the HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH experiments confirmed this residue as the glycosylation site (Fig. 1B). Indeed, an average difference of 0.17 ppm was measured for the β-carbon chemical shifts of all other Ser/Thr residues. Protein resonance assignment was carried out following the standard protocol based on the usual array of triple resonance NMR techniques. Resonance assignment of the GalNAc unit was carried out using 13C,15N-filtered experiments that select glycan (unlabeled) resonances by filtering out all carbon- and nitrogen-bound proton signals. After several attempts, direct observation of the GalNAc anomeric proton using filtered experiments was not successful. However, spectra from filtered experiments did show what could be attributed to a correlation between H1 and H2, from which we could obtain the chemical shift of H1. However, the symmetrical correlation (H2 to H1) was not observed (supplemental Fig. 2A). Using a two-dimensional 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation experiment recorded over 5 days, it was possible to measure unambiguously the unique anomeric 1H and 13C chemical shift pair at natural abundance. Although this proton-carbon correlation resonates in a specific region of the spectrum that is sufficiently distant from the intense protein signals (supplemental Fig. 2B), it is not the case for all other proton-carbon correlations of the pyranose ring. These resonate at the edge of the fully labeled α-carbon region and are masked by the latter. The remaining GalNAc proton chemical shifts were assigned using two-dimensional 13C,15N-filtered NOESY (supplemental Fig. 2A). The steady-state heteronuclear Overhauser effect between nitrogen-15 and proton was measured at two different field strengths to assess the effects of glycosylation on the protein backbone dynamics. The addition of a single GalNAc unit at Thr-106 resulted in a reduction of the backbone motions of the neighboring residues (Fig. 2), whereas the motions of all other residues were not significantly changed (supplemental Fig. 3). Elongation of the glycan chain with a galactose unit further reduced the motions of the loop surrounding the glycosylation site. Although the effects of the disaccharide on the dynamics were small, they were nevertheless significant. However, we did not pursue the determination of the three-dimensional structure of Gal(β1,3)GalNAcα-IFNα2a. The ensemble of structures of GalNAcα-IFNα2a shown in Fig. 3A was calculated using NOE-derived distance constraints and backbone torsion angle constraints derived from chemical shifts. The calculations were carried out with a fully extended polypeptide chain as a starting point to eliminate the possibility of any bias. The ensemble of structures shows the same overall conformation as reported by Klaus et al. (2Klaus W. Gsell B. Labhardt A.M. Wipf B. Senn H. The three-dimensional high resolution structure of human interferon α2a determined by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 661-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) for the non-glycosylated protein in solution (Protein Data Bank code 1ITF) with two differences. The first nine residues at the N-terminal end of GalNAcα-IFNα2a adopt a well defined pseudo-helical (twisted coil) conformation, whereas these residues are not as well defined in the IFNα2a structure. The glycosylation loop (residues 101–108) is also better defined in the GalNAcα-IFNα2a ensemble compared with the IFNα2a ensemble (Fig. 3B). The orientation of the GalNAc unit (Fig. 3C) results from the measurement of 20 distance constraints between the glycosylation loop residues and the methyl and anomeric protons of the GalNAc moiety. Among the sugar-protein NOE contacts, most constraints are measured between the acetyl group methyl and Val-105 on one side and between the anomeric proton and residues Glu-107 and Thr-108 on the other. The structure of IFNα2a is a five-helix bundle fold with mobile segments. These are the first eight residues in N-terminal residues 42–52 and the glycosylation loop comprising residues 101–108 linking helices 3 and 4. The dynamic behavior of the N terminus is somewhat surprising considering that the first residue in the sequence is a cysteine involved in a disulfide bridge with Cys-98 located in helix 3. In contrast, residues 22–44 adopt an elongated peptide stretch terminated by a one-turn helix that displays a similar rigidity to all α-helices. Therefore, the presence of backbone motions produced an averaging of interproton distances, resulting in the measurement of fewer NOE-derived distance constraints (see Fig. 1a in Ref. 2Klaus W. Gsell B. Labhardt A.M. Wipf B. Senn H. The three-dimensional high resolution structure of human interferon α2a determined by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 661-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, these mobile segments were not well defined (low root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.)) in the ensemble of conformers shown in Fig. 3B. This dynamic behavior is probably an important factor responsible for the absence of coordinates for these residues in the x-ray structure of the IFNα2a-IFN receptor complex (5Thomas C. Moraga I. Levin D. Krutzik P.O. Podoplelova Y. Trejo A. Lee C. Yarden G. Vleck S.E. Glenn J.S. Nolan G.P. Piehler J. Schreiber G. Garcia K.C. Structural linkage between ligand discrimination and receptor activation by type I interferons.Cell. 2011; 146: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Attenuation of backbone dynamics was induced upon addition of a single GalNAc unit at Thr-106 (Fig. 2). A priori, this attenuation should reduce the averaging of interproton distances, thus facilitating the measurement of more distance constraints involving flexible segments. The ensemble of structures (Fig. 3A) determined in solution by NMR for GalNAcα-IFNα2a shows that the glycosylation loop and the N-terminal residues have a lower r.m.s.d. compared with the ensemble obtained for IFNα2a (Fig. 3B). This suggests that glycosylation-induced rigidification of the mobile segment neighboring Thr-106 may have contributed to obtaining a better defined structure; it is most probably not the major factor. The total number of restraints used by the software CYANA to calculate the structure of GalNAcα-IFNα2a is almost double the number used for IFNα2a. Although the same three- and four-dimensional versions of NOESY experiments were recorded on both proteins, the use of cryogenic probe head technology in this study was certainly the major factor explaining the difference. Indeed, a plot of the number of restraints per residues for each amino acid in the sequence (Fig. 4) revealed that the N terminus and the glycosylation loop both show a similar increase in the number of restraints. Although it is not possible to tease apart the respective contributions of the more sensitive instrumentation and the glycosylation to this increase in the number of constraints, the latter probably benefited from the less mobile glycosylation loop. A first glance at Fig. 3A suggests that the conformation of the GalNAc unit is not well defined. This is partly due to the fact that the glycosylation loop experiences mobility, and it is not as well defined as the helices. Therefore, we assessed the conformation of the GalNAc unit in relationship to the protein backbone of tripeptide 105–107. This was accomplished with a superimposition of the backbone atoms from residues 105–107 (Fig. 3C) to use these atoms as a common reference for all conformers. Considering that few distance restraints were measured between the sugar (anomeric and methyl protons of the acetyl group only) and protons on the glycosylation loop, the conformation of the GalNAc unit was well defined with respect to the backbone of this loop (average r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å). The orientation of the GalNAc moiety brings the amide proton of the acetyl group in proximity to the backbone carbonyl of Thr-106 with an average distance of 3.0 Å over all 20 structures. A similar conformation has been observed in synthetic O-GalNAc glycopeptides (28Coltart D.M. Royyuru A.K. Williams L.J. Glunz P.W. Sames D. Kuduk S.D. Schwarz J.B. Chen X.-T. Danishefsky S.J. Live D.H. Principles of mucin architecture: structural studies on synthetic glycopeptides bearing clustered mono-, di-, tri-, and hexasaccharide glycodomains.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9833-9844Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggesting that the acetyl group modulates the orientation of the GalNAc unit with the peptide backbone. In addition, the 3-hydroxyl, the attachment point of the next sugar, is pointing away from the protein, toward the bulk of the solvent. This indicates that the sugar unit adopts an appropriate conformation to allow recognition by glycoprotein-GalNAc 3β-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1). This enzyme is responsible for elongation of the chain with galactose to make the core-1 glycan. Because a three-dimensional structure of C1GALT1 was not available, it was not possible to model the interaction. The higher potency observed for glycosylated IFNα2b (6Loignon M. Perret S. Kelly J. Boulais D. Cass B. Bisson L. Afkhamizarreh F. Durocher Y. Stable high volumetric production of glycosylated human recombinant IFNα2b in HEK293 cells.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) triggered our interest to determine whether glycan-protein interactions could be present during the receptor-binding event. Using the structure of the ternary complex that includes both the α- and β-chains of the type I interferon α/β receptor (5Thomas C. Moraga I. Levin D. Krutzik P.O. Podoplelova Y. Trejo A. Lee C. Yarden G. Vleck S.E. Glenn J.S. Nolan G.P. Piehler J. Schreiber G. Garcia K.C. Structural linkage between ligand discrimination and receptor activation by type I interferons.Cell. 2011; 146: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we substituted IFNα2a with our NMR structure of GalNAcα-IFNα2a into the complex to look for possible glycan-protein interactions (Fig. 3D). Before searching potential interactions with the receptor, it is worth mentioning that polar (hydrogen bonds) and hydrophobic contacts stabilize carbohydrate-protein complexes. Usually, a residue with an aromatic side chain mediates the latter. One example of this can be seen in the structure of the complex between lectin II from Ulex europaeus and its Gal(β1,3)GalNAc ligand (29Loris R. De Greve H. Dao-Thi M.H. Messens J. Imberty A. Wyns L. Structural basis of carbohydrate recognition by lectin II from Ulex europaeus, a protein with a promiscuous carbohydrate-binding site.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 987-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), where a tyrosine interacts with the hydrophobic side of the GalNAc residue. Examination of the receptor area susceptible to interaction with the GalNAc unit revealed that a number of side chain atoms of residues on the α-chain near the glycosylation loop of GalNAcα-IFNα2a were missing from the crystal structure of the ternary complex. Of particular interest, tryptophan at position 183 was missing, but it was manually added. The resulting model suggests that an interaction between the hydrophobic side of the pyranose ring of the sugar and Trp-183 is possible. The ideal geometry to properly position the hydrophobic face of the sugar on top of the aromatic ring is not present. However, a minor reorientation of the backbone would achieve this accommodation. In fact, among the 20 conformers of the NMR ensemble, the model was built using the one conformer that best positioned the sugar near the tryptophan side chain. We refrained from manually fitting the interactions, but a model from a theoretical simulation might produce a realistic model. In addition, the heteronuclear Overhauser enhancement data indicate that this loop does remain sufficiently mobile and could accommodate the appropriate conformation with a negligible energy penalty. Furthermore, this reorientation of GalNAc would still leave the 3-hydroxyl pointing away toward the solvent, thus indicating that the interaction between GalNAc and Trp-183 could exist with the core-1 glycan or longer chains. This interaction may also explain the higher potency of O-glycosylated IFNα2b versus the non-glycosylated version. The additional contact between the GalNAc unit and Trp-183 would provide an increase in affinity between the cytokine and its receptor. Therefore, additional sugar residues on the glycan that increase glycan complexity and heterogeneity would display a similar potency if the longer chains did not possess excessive dynamics or steric interference. Moreover, the lower thermostability observed by Johnston et al. (8Johnston M.J. Frahm G. Li X. Durocher Y. Hefford M.A. O-Linked glycosylation leads to decreased thermal stability of interferon α2b as measured by two orthogonal techniques.Pharm. Res. 2011; 28: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) for O-glycosylated IFNα2b may be explained by intermolecular interactions involving hydrophobic surfaces of the protein exposed during the unfolding process and the hydrophobic faces of sugar units of the glycan. The absence of such carbohydrate-protein interactions in non-glycosylated IFNα2b might explain the higher melting temperature observed. In summary, the application of the reported enzymatic synthesis approach and the simple labeling scheme utilized to produce GalNAc-αIFNα2a allowed the determination of a three-dimensional structure at high resolution and the study of the dynamics. It is noteworthy that a single GalNAc unit suffices to modulate the backbone dynamics near the glycosylation site. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the characterization of the structure and dynamics of an O-GalNAc glycoprotein in solution. In conjunction with the recently reported structures of IFN complexes, our results shed light on the biological role of glycans. We thank Drs.

Significance: These studies reveal a novel role of And-1 in the regulation of chromosome congression during mitosis. Accurate segregation of chromosomes to each daughter cell during mitosis relies on a specialized chromatin domain called the centromere. The centromere serves as a platform for the assembly of the large multiprotein kinetochore complex that mediates chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules and regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint (1Cleveland D.W.

With the exception of budding yeast, where centromeres are sequence-specific, the mechanisms governing centromere specification in other eukaryotes remain elusive but appear to be epigenetic in nature (3Black B.E.

CENP-A-containing nucleosomes define the site of kinetochore assembly and are interspersed with canonical histone H3-containing nucleosomes (3Black B.E. Bassett E.A.

Although constitutively present at the centromeres throughout the cell cycle, parental CENP-A is diluted after every S phase by DNA replication. Unlike canonical histones, deposition of new CENP-A onto centromeric chromatin occurs during early G1 phase (6Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Cleveland D.W.

The deposition of CENP-A at centromeres appears to be a two-part process composed of chromatin “priming” in late anaphase that prepares chromosomes to receive CENP-A followed by the recruitment of newly synthesized CENP-A to centromeres via a complex process involving multiple proteins including histone chaperones at early G1 phase (8Black B.E.

Chromatin priming is carried out by several proteins including the human Mis18 complex, which may prepare chromatin for CENP-A deposition by altering histone acetylation (9Fujita Y. Hayashi T.

Ctf4, the homolog of And-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was originally identified as a critical gene for chromosome transmission fidelity (20Miles J. Formosa T.

Indeed, mcl1, the homolog of And-1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was shown to be required for the centromeric localization of Cnp1 (CENP-A ortholog) (22Mamnun Y.M. Katayama S. Toda T.

However, how And-1/Ctf4/mcl1 regulates CENP-A/Cnp1 centromeric localization remains unknown. Here, we report that And-1 is required for the centromere-specific deposition of new CENP-A in early G1 phase. Down-regulation of And-1 results in the accumulation of cells in early stages of mitosis with chromosome congression defects. And-1 interacts with both CENP-A and HJURP in chromatin-free extracts and is required for the centromeric localization of both CENP-A and HJURP. Consistently, overexpression of And-1 enhances the assembly of CENP-A at centromeres. Thus, And-1 is a new HJURP-CENP-A-interacting partner that is required for the assembly of new CENP-A at centromeres.

For assays involving immunoprecipitation of proteins from chromatin-free extracts, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in 400 μl of solution A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, protease inhibitors, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), and incubated on ice for 5 min. Soluble proteins were separated from nuclei by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 4 min and the resulting supernatant collected (chromatin-free extract). The pellet was washed once with solution A and the resulting supernatant collected and combined with the first collection. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with solution A and associated proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer. HCT116, U2OS, and 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 supply. HCT116 and U2OS cells expressing FLAG-And-1 or FLAG were constructed by infecting cells with retrovirus expressing FLAG or FLAG-And-1, followed by single colony selection. Cell cycle synchronization was achieved by treating cells with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h, washed three times in PBS, and then released into medium. siRNA oligonucleotides And-1-1 and And-1-2 were as described previously (16Zhu W.

YFP-CENP-A, H3.1-YFP, H3.3-GFP, H4-GFP, and GFP-HJURP were gifts from Dr. Daniel Foltz (University of Virginia). Flow cytometry analysis was performed as described previously (24Zhu W. Chen Y.

To make total protein, cells were lysed in radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) followed by sonication. Chromatin binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (25Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J.

A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using the ChIP assay kit from Millipore following the supplied protocol. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-And-1 antibody (16Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A.

DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit. DNA samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. PCR primers for BG40.9, BG72, α-satellite (Satα), and pericentromeric (Sat2) regions were as described (26Sibani S. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M.

Acta. 2007; 1769: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine the consequence of the loss of And-1 in human cells, we depleted And-1 in HCT116 cells using siRNA oligonucleotides against And-1 or firefly luciferase (Gl2 control). Transfection with two independent siRNAs significantly reduced And-1 protein levels (Fig. 1). Following And-1 depletion, the population of round mitotic cells was increased compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). To confirm and quantify mitotic arrested cells after And-1 depletion, we examined the mitotic index. The mitotic index of siAnd-1-treated cells increased ∼3-fold compared with siGl2-treated cells (Fig. 1C). We further examined the mitotic progression of And-1-depleted cells by immunofluorescence analyses. In contrast with siGl2-treated cells that distributed throughout mitosis, And-1-depleted cells accumulated in metaphase or prometaphase (Fig. 1D). The arrest of cells in mitosis by And-1 depletion suggests the possibility of chromosome alignment defects. To test this possibility, we examined chromosome alignment by DAPI and α-tubulin co-staining. Strikingly, And-1-depleted cells failed to align chromosomes at the spindle equator (Fig. 1E). In addition, the metaphase spindle of And-1-depleted cells was 49% (p < 0.001) longer than that of siGl2-treated cells, indicating a deficiency of pulling forces from kinetochore fibers (Fig. 1E). Thus, we conclude that And-1 is important for proper chromosome congression. The failure to properly align chromosomes at the spindle equator in And-1-depleted cells suggests the possibility of a centromeric nucleosome defect. To test this possibility, we screened the localization of centromere proteins in And-1-depleted cells by immunostaining. Strikingly, we found that there was a dramatic reduction of endogenous CENP-A at centromeres 48 or 72 h after And-1 siRNA transfection (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). Although total cellular levels of CENP-A were not affected after And-1 depletion, chromatin association of CENP-A was mildly decreased after And-1 depletion (Fig. 2C). To rule out that the reduced centromeric localization of CENP-A by And-1 depletion is due to siRNA off-target effects, we depleted And-1 using a siRNA targeting a 3′-UTR mRNA sequence in a HCT116 cell line stably expressing FLAG-And-1 from cDNA. Consistent with results shown in Fig. 2A, depletion of And-1 by this siRNA significantly reduced the localization of CENP-A at centromeres in HCT116 expressing FLAG alone (Fig. 2D). However, CENP-A centromeric assembly defects by And-1 depletion were restored in HCT116 cells expressing FLAG-And-1 (Fig. 2D). Thus, CENP-A assembly defects are specifically due to the loss of And-1. And-1 depletion also resulted in the loss of centromeric localization of CENP-A in U2OS cells (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that And-1 is critical for CENP-A centromeric localization. To further investigate the significance of CENP-A reduction by And-1 depletion, we examined whether And-1 and CENP-A form a complex by a co-immunoprecipitation assay using chromatin-free cell extracts from 293T cells co-expressing FLAG-And-1 and YFP or YFP-CENP-A. YFP-CENP-A but not YFP was readily detected in FLAG-And-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A), suggesting that And-1 interacts with prenucleosomal CENP-A. Having found the interaction between And-1 and CENP-A, we predicted that And-1 may associate with centromeres. To test this possibility, we performed ChIP assays. In agreement with the role of And-1 in DNA replication, we detected the accumulation of And-1 at a human β-globin replication origin BG40.9 but not a surrounding nonreplication origin BG72 (26Sibani S. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Ku80 binds to human replication origins prior to the assembly of the ORC complex.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7885-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Significantly, we could detect the stronger association of And-1 with α-satellite repeat region at centromere (Satα) and weaker association with pericentromeric region (Sat2). And-1 contains WD40 repeats at its amino terminus, a SepB domain in the middle, and a HMG domain at its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 3C). We next tested which domains of And-1 are responsible for interacting with CENP-A by expressing CENP-A together with And-1 or its truncation mutants in 293T cells (Fig. 3D). CENP-A-And-1 interactions were detected in immunoprecipitates from full-length And-1 and the mutant And-1(330–1129), suggesting that the CENP-A binding site on And-1 covers the SepB region. No interaction was detected between CENP-A and And-1(1–336) or And-1(984–1129), suggesting that both the WD40 repeats and the HMG domain are dispensable for the interaction between And-1 and CENP-A. Taken together, our data indicate that And-1 forms a complex with prenucleosomal CENP-A. Because And-1 is involved in DNA replication (16Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15628-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we next asked whether the CENP-A localization defects by And-1 depletion were due to DNA replication defects associated with And-1 depletion. To this end, we arrested And-1-depleted cells in G1 phase using l-mimosine, a plant amino acid that reversibly arrests cells in G1 phase (Fig. 4A) (28Lalande M. A reversible arrest point in the late G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle.Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Replication defects by And-1 depletion caused an S/G2/M accumulation (Fig. 4B) (16Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase α to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); however, addition of l-mimosine arrested siRNA-treated cells in G1 phase (Fig. 4B). Thus, we successfully obtained And-1-depleted cells which do not undergo DNA replication and therefore could not have DNA replication defects. A significant reduction of CENP-A localization at centromeres was observed in And-1-depleted G1-arrested cells (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that And-1 depletion but not aberrant DNA replication leads to CENP-A assembly defects. To further confirm that DNA replication impairments are not the cause of CENP-A centromere localization defects, we down-regulated two additional factors required for DNA replication, Cdc6 and Mcm7. We observed no defect in CENP-A localization when either Cdc6 or Mcm7 was down-regulated by siRNA (data not shown). Moreover, we found that DNA damage did not have effects on CENP-A localization (data not shown). These results are consistent with the observation that in contrast to the replication-dependent H3 deposition, CENP-A assembly is not a DNA replication-dependent process (29Shelby R.D. Monier K. Sullivan K.F. Chromatin assembly at kinetochores is uncoupled from DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 30Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Centromeres are specialized replication domains in heterochromatin.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that And-1 plays a direct role in the CENP-A centromeric assembly. And-1 forms complexes with prenucleosomal CENP-A, suggesting that And-1 may regulate newly synthesized CENP-A assembly at centromeres. To test this possibility, we first examined the localization of And-1 and CENP-A throughout the cell cycle by co-immunostaining. And-1 was diffusely localized throughout the nucleus during interphase, dissociated from chromatin from prometaphase through anaphase, and reassociated with chromatin during telophase (Fig. 5A). And-1 associates with chromatin at late mitosis, suggesting that And-1 may be involved in the assembly of newly synthesized CENP-A in early G1 phase. To test this possibility, we performed a transient transfection assay as described by two groups previously (9Fujita Y. Hayashi T. Kiyomitsu T. Toyoda Y. Kokubu A. Obuse C. Yanagida M.

Forty-eight h after YFP-CENP-A transfection, siGl2-treated cells repeatedly showed that newly synthesized YFP-CENP-A was properly targeted to centromeres (Fig. 5C). Strikingly, when And-1 was depleted the number of cells with YFP-CENP-A centromeric signals was greatly reduced, and YFP-CENP-A was detected as diffusely localized throughout the nucleus (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that And-1 is required for the recruitment of newly synthesized CENP-A to chromatin at centromeres. Because And-1 is required for the centromeric assembly of newly synthesized CENP-A, we hypothesized that And-1 would associate with CENP-A during late telophase or early G1 to load new"
https://openalex.org/W2010157393,"Streptococcus suis, one of the most important and prevalent pathogens in swine, presents a major challenge to global public health. HP0197 is an S. suis surface antigen that was previously identified by immunoproteomics and can bind to the host cell surface. Here, we investigated the interaction between HP0197 and the host cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) using indirect immunofluorescence and cell adhesion inhibition assays. In addition, we determined that a novel 18-kDa domain in the N-terminal region of HP0197 functions as the GAG-binding domain. We then solved the three-dimensional structures of the N-terminal 18-kDa and C-terminal G5 domains using x-ray crystallography. Based on this structural information, the GAG-binding sites in HP0197 were predicted and subsequently verified using site-directed mutagenesis and indirect immunofluorescence. The results indicate that the positively charged residues on the exposed surface of the 18-kDa domain, which are primarily lysines, likely play a critical role in the HP0197-heparin interaction that mediates bacterium-host cell adhesion. Understanding this molecular mechanism may provide a basis for the development of effective drugs and therapeutic strategies for treating streptococcal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2060369462,"Mammals have two cysteine- and histidine-rich domain (CHORD)-containing Hsp90 cochaperones, Chp-1 and melusin, which are homologs of plant Rar1. It has been shown previously that Rar1 CHORD directly interacts with ADP bound to the nucleotide pocket of Hsp90. Here, we report that ADP and ATP can bind to Hsp90 cochaperones Chp-1 and PP5, inducing their conformational changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Chp-1 and melusin can interact with cochaperones PP5 and Sgt1 and with each other in an ATP-dependent manner. Based on the known structure of the Rar1-Hsp90 complex, His-186 has been identified as an important residue of Chp-1 for ADP/ATP binding. His-186 is necessary for the nucleotide-dependent interaction of Chp-1 not only with Hsp90 but also with Sgt1. In addition, Ca(2+), which is known to bind to melusin, enhances the interactions of melusin with Hsp90 and Sgt1. Furthermore, melusin acquires the ADP preference for Hsp90 binding in the presence of Ca(2+). Our newly discovered nucleotide-dependent interactions between cochaperones might provide additional complexity to the dynamics of the Hsp90 chaperone system, also suggesting potential Hsp90-independent roles for these cochaperones."
https://openalex.org/W2055267952,"A retroviral capsid (CA) protein consists of two helical domains, CA(N) and CA(C), which drive hexamer and dimer formations, respectively, to form a capsid lattice. The N-terminal 13 residues of CA refold to a β-hairpin motif upon processing from its precursor polyprotein Gag. The β-hairpin is essential for correct CA assembly but unexpectedly it is not within any CA oligomeric interfaces. To understand the β-hairpin function we studied the full-length CA protein from equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), a lentivirus sharing the same cone-shaped capsid core as HIV-1. Solution NMR spectroscopy is perfectly suited to study EIAV-CA that dimerizes weaker than HIV-1-CA. Comparison between the wild-type (wt) EIAV-CA and a variant lacking the β-hairpin structure demonstrated that folding of the β-hairpin specifically extended the N terminus of helix α1 from Tyr(20) to Pro(17). This coil to helix transition involves the conserved sequence of Thr(16)-Pro(17)-Arg(18) (Ser(16)-Pro(17)-Arg(18) in HIV-1-CA). The extended region of helix α1 constituted an expanded EIAV-CA(N) oligomeric interface and overlapped with the HIV-1-CA hexamer-core residue Arg(18), helical in structure and pivotal in assembly. Therefore we propose the function of the maturational refolding of the β-hairpin in CA assembly is to extend helix α1 at the N terminus to enhance the CA(N) oligomerization along the capsid assembly core interface. In addition, NMR resonance line broadening indicated the presence of micro-millisecond exchange kinetics due to the EIAV-CA(N) domain oligomerization, independent to the faster EIAV-CA(C) domain dimerization."

However, RasGRP1 likely possesses other physiological functions in addition to its regulation on lymphocytes. RasGRP1 is expressed in neurons in the brain (17Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S.

However, whether or not RasGRP1 is involved in vascular or lymphatic development remains elusive.

Du, Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were maintained under standard conditions. Zebrafish studies were approved by the Institute of Neuroscience, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Morpholinos (MOs) were purchased from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). The first rasgrp1 morpholino (RasGRP1-MO) was designed to cover the start codon region and 5′ untranslated region with a sequence of 5′-TGCGATTCATGGTGTCAAATCCCAT-3′. The second rasgrp1 morpholino (RasGRP1-MO2) was targeted at a splice junction between exon 13 and intron 13 of rasgrp1 pre-mRNA with a sequence of 5′-GTTGGTTTAAATACGTACAAATCCT-3′. The flt4 morpholino (Flt4-MO) was used as reported previously with a sequence of 5′-CTCTTCATTTCCAGGTTTCAAGTCC-3′ (8Hermans K. Claes F. Vandevelde W. Zheng W. Geudens I. Orsenigo F. De Smet F.

Role of synectin in lymphatic development in zebrafish and frogs.Blood. 2010; 116: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The control morpholino was a standard control MO with no target in zebrafish embryos, and its sequence was 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. The morpholinos were diluted in nuclease-free water (Ambion, Austin, TX), pressure-injected into 1- or 2-cell-stage zebrafish embryos using an mn-151 joystick micromanipulator and an IM-300 microinjector (Narishige, Japan). RasGRP1-MO was injected at a concentration of 6 ng/embryo, and RasGRP1-MO2 was used in 14 ng/embryo after titration with various concentrations. Flt4-MO was injected at a concentration of 1 ng/embryo. A lymphatic dye uptake assay was performed as described previously (22Yaniv K. Isogai S. Castranova D. Dye L. Hitomi J. Weinstein B.M. Live imaging of lymphatic development in the zebrafish.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In brief, embryos at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were injected below the skin in the trunk region with a fluorescent dye Alexa-Fluor 568 dextran (Invitrogen) using glass capillary needles and were photographed 3–6 h after injection. Probes labeled with digoxigenin (Roche) were synthesized with linearized plasmids by using Sp6 or T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was carried out as described previously (23Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 3rd Ed. University of Oregon, Eugene, OR1995: 144Google Scholar). For cross-section analysis, the stained embryos were treated with 75, 80, 95, and 100% ethanol, followed by paraffin treatment before being embedded in paraffin and sectioned (8 μm in thickness) using a Lecia RM 2126 microtome. To make a morpholino-resistant form of RasGRP1, a full-length zebrafish RasGRP1 expression plasmid was generated to contain five same-sense mutations localized in the targeting region of RasGRP1-MO. The rasgrp1 mRNA was generated with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). In the rescue experiments, each 1-cell stage embryo was injected with 1–5 pg of synthesized zebrafish rasgrp1 mRNA. The zebrafish embryos were mounted in 1.0–1.5% low-melt agarose for observation and photographing. The images were acquired by a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) or Olympus DP72 (Tokyo, Japan). The phenotypic severities of the zebrafish morphants was analyzed by Chi square analysis. The statistic difference between two groups was analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. We used WISH and RT-PCR in wild-type zebrafish embryos to investigate the spatial and temporal expression pattern of rasgrp1. Both WISH and RT-PCR results revealed that rasgrp1 was maternally provided, as its mRNAs were detected at the 1-cell stage before onset of zygotic gene expression (Fig. 1). From 24 h post fertilization (hpf) on, restricted expression of rasgrp1 was observed in the dorsal aorta (DA), posterior cardinal vein (PCV), and cardinal vein plexus (Pl) regions. The signal of rasgrp1 expression was mostly lost in DA but still persistent in PCV and Pl regions at 36 hpf (Fig. 1A), at a time when the lymphatic precursors begin to migrate toward the horizontal myoseptum region from the PCV (9Hogan B.M. Bos F.L. Bussmann J. Witte M. Chi N.C. Duckers H.J. Schulte-Merker S. Ccbe1 is required for embryonic lymphangiogenesis and venous sprouting.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). By 48 hpf, rasgrp1 expression in the PCV and Pl regions was decreased markedly (Fig. 1A). In addition, we found apparent staining of rasgrp1 in the notochord from approximately at 36 hpf, as well as in the head region (Fig. 1A). In control experiments, no hybridization signal was seen in the DA, PCV, and Pl regions with rasgrp1 sense probe (supplemental Fig. 1). The tissue-specific expression pattern of RasGRP1 in endothelia cells and the nervous system is consistent with the findings in mammals (17Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. A Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor enriched highly in the basal ganglia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Besides, we analyzed rasgrp1 mRNA expression in zebrafish embryos at different stages from the 1-cell stage to 6 dpf using RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). It appeared that rasgrp1 was expressed in all stages of early embryos and larvae up to 6 dpf (Fig. 1B). These data, therefore, indicate that RasGRP1 may play a functional role in the development of neural system, notochord, vascular, or lymphatic vessels. To study the roles of RasGRP1 during early zebrafish embryogenesis, we used an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (RasGRP1-MO) to block the translation of RasGRP1 (Fig. 2A). To validate the knockdown efficiency, we constructed a fusion gene, drRasGRP1-GFP, with the 5′ untranslated region sequence of rasgrp1 that included the targeting sequence of RasGRP1-MO and a GFP reporter. The expression of the GFP fusion protein was abolished when RasGRP1-MO was injected into the zebrafish embryos, indicating efficient silence of rasgrp1 expression by the morpholino (Fig. 2B). As rasgrp1 was expressed in the vascular/lymphatic system during early zebrafish development (Fig. 1), we investigated the possible function of RasGRP1 in the development of vessel systems. The zebrafish embryos injected with 10 ng or a higher dose of RasGRP1-MO exhibited blood accumulation, curl tails, and blood flow retardation (supplemental Fig. 2). These defects could be partially rescued by rasgrp1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. 2) that was mutated in the region targeted by RasGRP1-MO so that it was resistant to the morpholino. Intriguingly, embryos injected with a lower dose of RasGRP1-MO (at 6 ng/embryo) gradually developed severe edema in the pericardial sac and around gut after 4 dpf (Fig. 2A), resembling the phenotype of thoracic duct (TD) defect, as described previously (9Hogan B.M. Bos F.L. Bussmann J. Witte M. Chi N.C. Duckers H.J. Schulte-Merker S. Ccbe1 is required for embryonic lymphangiogenesis and venous sprouting.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 22Yaniv K. Isogai S. Castranova D. Dye L. Hitomi J. Weinstein B.M. Live imaging of lymphatic development in the zebrafish.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, these morphants showed normal morphology during the first 3 days of development (Fig. 2C). In summary, about 34% of RasGRP1 morphants developed edema at 5 dpf (Fig. 2D). In contrast, almost all embryos injected with 6 ng of control morpholino developed normally (Fig. 2D). To assure the specificity of RasGRP1-MO in the induction of edema, we analyzed another morpholino that affected splicing of rasgrp1 mRNA (RasGRP1-MO2, supplemental Fig. 3). Injection of the zebrafish embryos with RasGRP1-MO2 was able to successfully disrupt the splicing of rasgrp1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. 2). As expected, similar edema phenotypes were observed with RasGRP1-MO2 (supplemental Fig. 4). Furthermore, coinjection of rasgrp1 mRNA (at 1 pg/embryo) could significantly rescue the edema phenotype caused by RasGRP1-MO (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these observations indicate that RasGRP1 likely plays an important role in zebrafish lymphatic development. To explore whether RasGRP1 played a functional role in lymphatic development, we silenced RasGRP1 in Fli1:eGFPy1 zebrafish embryos in which enhanced GFP (eGFP) was expressed in both blood and lymphatic vessels (21Lawson N.D. Weinstein B.M. In vivo imaging of embryonic vascular development using transgenic zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). We first examined the formation of the TD, which was the first and largest lymphatic vessel formed between the DA and PCV. The TD was analyzed by measuring its length in 10 somites (supplemental Fig. 5) as described previously (7Geudens I. Herpers R. Hermans K. Segura I. Ruiz de Almodovar C. Bussmann J. De Smet F. Vandevelde W. Hogan B.M. Siekmann A. Claes F. Moore J.C. Pistocchi A.S. Loges S. Mazzone M. Mariggi G. Bruyère F. Cotelli F. Kerjaschki D. Noël A. Foidart J.M. Gerhardt H. Ny A. Langenberg T.

Biol. 2010; 30: 1695-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Hermans K. Claes F. Vandevelde W. Zheng W. Geudens I. Orsenigo F. De Smet F. Gjini E. Anthonis K. Ren B. Kerjaschki D. Autiero M. Ny A. Simons M. Dewerchin M. Schulte-Merker S. Dejana E. Alitalo K. Carmeliet P. Role of synectin in lymphatic development in zebrafish and frogs.Blood. 2010; 116: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon injection of 6 ng of RasGRP1-MO, 16% of the embryos failed to form any TD by 6.5 dpf, a stage when this vessel is fully formed (22Yaniv K. Isogai S. Castranova D. Dye L. Hitomi J. Weinstein B.M. Live imaging of lymphatic development in the zebrafish.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In 25% of RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos, only 10% to 30% of TD was formed, whereas 40% of the morphants had 30% to 90% TD formation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, TD was completely formed in 93% of control morpholino-injected embryos by 6.5 dpf (Fig. 3A). Similar results were also observed in RasGRP1-MO2-injected embryos (supplemental Fig. 6). To confirm the lack of TD formation in RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos, we performed a subcutaneous dye uptake experiment by injecting zebrafish embryos at 6.5 dpf blow the skin in the trunk region with a fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 568 dextran. The Alexa Fluor 568 dextran was absorbed by the TD in control embryos but not in the RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos (Fig. 3B). These results, therefore, provide further evidence that TD formation is disrupted by rasgrp1 knockdown in the zebrafish embryos. To verify that the observed lymphatic defects caused by RasGRP1 knockdown was not because of a secondary effect of angiogenic defects, we investigated whether knockdown of RasGRP1 could impair early vascular development. We did not observe any apparent cardiovascular defects upon injection of 6 ng of RasGRP1-MO (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, arteriovenous differentiation of the large axial vessels was apparently not altered in the RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos, as evidenced by normal expression patterns of arterial and venous markers including Flt4, Ephrin B2, and Eph B4 at 28 hpf (Fig. 4B). Similarly, no vascular defects were observed with RasGRP1-MO2-injected embryos (supplemental Fig. 7). Collectively, these data indicate that the lymphatic defects upon rasgrp1 knockdown are not due to a secondary effect of disrupted angiogenesis by the morpholino. We next analyzed whether knockdown of RasGRP1 could impair development of the parachordal lymphangioblast (PL) cells, which contribute to TD formation as they are precursors for lymphatic vessels (9Hogan B.M. Bos F.L. Bussmann J. Witte M. Chi N.C. Duckers H.J. Schulte-Merker S. Ccbe1 is required for embryonic lymphangiogenesis and venous sprouting.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Similar to TD analysis, PL string formation was analyzed by measuring its length in 10 somites. At 60 hpf in control embryos, PL cells were detected in nearly every somite segment (Fig. 5A). In contrast, PL cells were absent in 44% of RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos, whereas 22% of embryos had 10–30% of the normal length of PL cells, and 21% embryos had 30–90% of the normal length of PL cells (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the embryos injected with RasGRP1-MO2 were also defective in PL cell development (supplemental Fig. 8). These data, therefore, provide additional evidence that RasGRP1 is involved in early lymphatic development in zebrafish embryos. To determine whether the absence of PL cells was caused by lymphangiogenic sprouts defects, we analyzed the expression of Tie2, which marks both angiogenic and lymphangiogenic secondary sprouts at 48 hpf. The WISH results revealed that RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos had normal the total number of secondary sprouts compared with control embryos (Fig. 5B). We also counted the numbers of intersegmental vessels (ISVs) that connected to the PCV in Fli1:eGFPy1 embryos at 6 dpf. It appeared that the proportion of venous intersomitic vessels (vISVs) in rasgrp1 morphants was increased significantly (Fig. 5B). In control embryos, about 50% of the ISVs were vISVs, whereas about 75% of ISVs were vISVs in rasgrp1 morphant embryos (Fig. 5C). Because vISVs are formed through connection of secondary angiogenic sprouts, the rest of the sprouts should be the secondary lymphangiogenic sprouts contributing to TD formation. An increase in the number of vISVs would indicate a decrease in secondary lymphangiogenic sprouts forming the TD, in agreement with the finding that TD formation was disrupted by rasgrp1 knockdown (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that RasGRP1 is required for early lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish. Next we tried to explore the molecular basis underlying RasGRP1 knockdown-mediated lymphatic vessel defects during early development in zebrafish. As RasGRP1 is an activator of Ras proteins, we thus analyzed whether RasGRP1 affects lymphangiogenesis through modulation of Ras/ERK signaling. As expected, ERK phosphorylation was reduced by RasGRP1-MO in zebrafish embryos at 36 hpf (Fig. 6A). We constructed a constitutively active HRas (HRasV12) and a dominant negative HRas (HRasN17) (24Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Understanding Ras. 'It ain't over 'til it's over'.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). When these two Ras constructs were expressed in zebrafish embryos, they could alter ERK phosphorylation, consistent with the activity of the Ras proteins (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 9). In agreement with these observations, we also found that ERK phosphorylation in the PCV region was reduced by RasGRP1-MO (supplemental Fig. 10). As rasgrp1 knockdown is associated with a decrease in Ras/ERK signaling, we hypothesized that the lymphatic developmental defects caused by rasgrp1 down-regulation would be rescued by the constitutively active Ras. As expected, the percentage of edema caused by RasGRP1-MO was reduced significantly in the embryos coinjected with HRasV12 mRNA, whereas the percentage of edema was increased in embryos coinjected with HRasN17 mRNA (Fig. 6B). We also analyzed the effect of coexpression of Ras proteins on TD formation in Fli1:eGFPy1 zebrafish at 6.5 dpf. Consistently, HRasV12 could partially rescue the TD defects induced by RasGRP1-MO, whereas HRasN17 could not rescue the defects (Fig. 6C). The percentage of embryos without any TD formation upon rasgrp1 knockdown was reduced from 15.9% to 4.5% by HRasV12 overexpression (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these data revealed that an alteration of Ras/ERK signaling pathway is, at least partially, implicated in the observed lymphatic developmental defects caused by rasgrp1 knockdown. VEGFC and Flt4 (VEGFR3) are known to be essential for the formation of TD in zebrafish (25Küchler A.M. Gjini E. Peterson-Maduro J. Cancilla B. Wolburg H. Schulte-Merker S. Development of the zebrafish lymphatic system requires VEGFC signaling.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1244-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that Ras proteins regulate lymphatic vessel growth by modulating Flt4 signaling in mice (26Ichise T. Yoshida N. Ichise H. H-, N- and Kras cooperatively regulate lymphatic vessel growth by modulating VEGFR3 expression in lymphatic endothelial cells in mice.Development. 2010; 137: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As RasGRP1 is an activator of Ras proteins, we then explored whether RasGRP1 genetically interacts with Flt4. We used a morpholino oligonucleotide to block the translation of flt4, as characterized previously (8Hermans K. Claes F. Vandevelde W. Zheng W. Geudens I. Orsenigo F. De Smet F. Gjini E. Anthonis K. Ren B. Kerjaschki D. Autiero M. Ny A. Simons M. Dewerchin M. Schulte-Merker S. Dejana E. Alitalo K. Carmeliet P. Role of synectin in lymphatic development in zebrafish and frogs.Blood. 2010; 116: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that a low dose of Flt4-MO induced a minimal defect in TD formation, consistent with previous findings (8Hermans K. Claes F. Vandevelde W. Zheng W. Geudens I. Orsenigo F. De Smet F. Gjini E. Anthonis K. Ren B. Kerjaschki D. Autiero M. Ny A. Simons M. Dewerchin M. Schulte-Merker S. Dejana E. Alitalo K. Carmeliet P. Role of synectin in lymphatic development in zebrafish and frogs.Blood. 2010; 116: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Notably, knockdown of both flt4 and rasgrp1 caused much more severe defects in lymphatic development than knockdown of either gene alone (Fig. 7), shown as absence of TDs in 46% of embryos with double knockdown (Fig. 7). Thus, our findings provide a preliminary model that RasGRP1 may have a genetic interaction with Flt4 during lymphatic development in zebrafish. So far there are four RasGRP genes identified in mammals, whereas zebrafish have three RasGRPs, including RasGRP1, RasGRP2, and RasGRP3 (27Gomez G.A. Veldman M.B. Zhao Y. Burgess S. Lin S. Discovery and characterization of novel vascular and hematopoietic genes downstream of etsrp in zebrafish.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of the RasGRP family are largely unknown. RasGRP1 has been found to be required for T cell receptor signaling, thymocyte differentiation, and B cell proliferation (14Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M.

RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 regulate B cell proliferation by facilitating B cell receptor-Ras signaling.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RasGRP2 is required for proper platelet aggregation in mice (28Crittenden J.R. Bergmeier W. Zhang Y. Piffath C.L. Liang Y. Wagner D.D. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. CalDAG-GEFI integrates signaling for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 982-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), whereas RasGRP3 was reported to regulate angiogenesis in response to VEGF stimulation (29Roberts D.M. Anderson A.L. Hidaka M. Swetenburg R.L. Patterson C. Stanford W.L. Bautch V.L. A vascular gene trap screen defines RasGRP3 as an angiogenesis-regulated gene required for the endothelial response to phorbol esters.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10515-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, mice depleted of rasgrp1 were phenotypically normal except for defects in T cell development (15Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A. Ebinu J.O. Dickie P. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. RasGRP is essential for mouse thymocyte differentiation and TCR signaling.Nat.

RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 regulate B cell proliferation by facilitating B cell receptor-Ras signaling.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This study reveals for the first time a new physiological function of RasGRP1 in lymphatic development in zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of rasgrp1 impaired the formation of lymphangiogenic sprouts, development of PL cells, and formation of TD. It is worth noting that at a low dose of RasGRP1-MO, the development of blood vessels was not affected (Fig. 4), and the development of notochord, somite, and heart are also not affected (supplemental Fig. 11). Meanwhile, injection of a high dose of rasgrp1 mRNA appeared to have no effect to promote lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish embryos (supplemental Fig. 12). Interestingly, silencing of both rasgrp1 and flt4/vegfr3 in zebrafish embryos aggravated the lymphatic defects. Collectively, these observations have pinpointed a critical role of RasGRP1 in lymphatic development in zebrafish. Zebrafish is a well established model to study lymphatic development. According to previous reports (8Hermans K. Claes F. Vandevelde W. Zheng W. Geudens I. Orsenigo F. De Smet F. Gjini E. Anthonis K. Ren B. Kerjaschki D. Autiero M. Ny A. Simons M. Dewerchin M.

Arteries provide essential guidance cues for lymphatic endothelial cells in the zebrafish trunk.Development. 2010; 137: 2653-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), TD development is initiated at ∼36 hpf when the secondary sprouts branch off from the PCV. About half of these sprouts are angiogenic, and they further develop into venous ISVs, whereas the other half of the sprouts are lymphangiogenic and further develop into the string of PC cells at the horizontal myoseptum region. Beyond 60 hpf, PL cells migrate along the arterial intersegmental vessels dorsally to contribute to the formation of the dorsal longitudinal lymphatic vessel or ventrally to contribute to the formation of the TD between the DA and PCV. On the basis of this study, lymphatic formation defects upon rasgrp1 knockdown were unlikely due to a secondary effect of alterations in blood vascular development. In RasGRP1-MO-injected embryos, the differentiation of PCV and DA occurred normally, as revealed by properly formed venous-arterial-specific markers (Fig. 4). In addition, the formation of the PCV, DA, and primary ISVs were all unaltered by RasGRP1 knockdown (Fig. 4). Our observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that disruption of arterial development in zebrafish cannot impair lymphangiogenic sprouting nor cause TD defects (9Hogan B.M. Bos F.L. Bussmann J. Witte M. Chi N.C. Duckers H.J. Schulte-Merker S. Ccbe1 is required for embryonic lymphangiogenesis and venous sprouting.Nat.

Diamond B.A. Weinstein B.M. phospholipase C γ-1 is required downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor during arterial development.Gene Dev. 2003; 17: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although we found that Ras/ERK signaling is implicated in RasGRP1-mediated lymphangiogenesis (Fig. 6), the molecular details underlying the regulation of lymphatic development by RasGRP1 remains to be determined in the future. As RasGRP1 expression was detected in the PCV from 24–40 hpf, at a time when the secondary sprouts occurs, we speculate that RasGRP1-mediated Ras/ERK signaling may directly induce venous endothelial cells to form lymphangiogenic sprouts. As we found that knockdown both flt4 and rasgrp1 has a synergistic effect on the defects of lymphatic development (Fig. 7), we propose that RasGRP1 may function downstream of Flt4 to activate Ras proteins, thereby regulating lymphangiogenic sprout formation in zebrafish. It is also possible that Ras activation by RasGRP1 is implicated in the expression of Flt4, which in turn modulates lymphangiogenesis, as supported by a recent report showing that Ras proteins are involved in Flt4 expression and lymphatic development in mice (26Ichise T. Yoshida N. Ichise H. H-, N- and Kras cooperatively regulate lymphatic vessel growth by modulating VEGFR3 expression in lymphatic endothelial cells in mice.Development. 2010; 137: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the lymphangiogenic sprout formation is due to the inhibition of venous angiogenic sprouts by RasGRP1-mediated Ras/ERK signaling, similar to a model proposed to explain the segregation and generation of the DA and PCV in early vascular development in zebrafish embryos (32Hong C.C. Peterson Q.P. Hong J.Y. Peterson R.T. Artery/vein specification is governed by opposing phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and MAP kinase/ERK signaling.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1366-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that Ras/ERK signaling is required for both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Intriguingly, injection of RasGRP1-MO at a low dose only affects development of lymphatic system but not angiogenesis (Fig. 4). We speculate that the subtle change of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway mediated by RasGRP1 may dictate whether angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis is affected. Nevertheless, the finding that RasGRP1 is implicated in lymphangiogenesis not only reveals a new physiological function for RasGRP1 but also paves the way for future studies to unravel the unique role of RasGRP1-mediated Ras/ERK signaling in lymphatic development.

Small molecule DPP-IV inhibitors have been used as treatments for type 2 diabetes to improve glucose tolerance. However, each of the marketed small molecule drugs has its own limitation in terms of efficacy and side effects. To search for an alternative strategy of inhibiting DPP-IV activity, we generated a panel of tight binding inhibitory mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against rat DPP-IV. When tested in vitro, these mAbs partially inhibited the GLP-1 cleavage activity of purified enzyme and rat plasma. To understand the partial inhibition, we solved the co-crystal structure of one of the mAb Fabs (Ab1) in complex with rat DPP-IV. Although Ab1 does not bind at the active site, it partially blocks the side opening, which prevents the large substrates such as GLP-1 from accessing the active site, but not small molecules such as sitagliptin. When Ab1 was tested in vivo, it reduced plasma glucose and increased plasma GLP-1 concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test in rats. Together, we demonstrated the feasibility of using mAbs to inhibit DPP-IV activity and to improve glucose tolerance in a diabetic rat model."

(1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9389–9393) A γ-Aminobutyric Acid/Benzodiazepine Receptor Complex of Bovine Cerebral Cortex (Sigel, E., Stephenson, F. A., Mamalaki, C., Barnard, E. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6965–6971) In 1982, two papers appeared in the Journal of Biological Chemistry that laid the foundation for our current understanding of certain molecular aspects of neurotransmission. Eric A. Barnard of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in the United Kingdom led a team to purify the first receptor for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; which later became known as the GABAA receptor) from bovine brain samples (1Sigel E. Stephenson F.A. Mamalaki C. Barnard E.A. A γ-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex of bovine cerebral cortex.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6965-6971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Germany, Heinrich Betz at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry and his team purified the glycine receptor from rat spinal cord (2Pfeiffer F. Graham D. Betz H. Purification by affinity chromatography of the glycine receptor of rat spinal cord.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9389-9393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical purification of these proteins eventually led to the cloning of their genes; the analysis of the genes revealed the existence of the Cys loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily of neurotransmitters. By the early 1980s, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was the only neuronal ion channel that was understood in some detail, simply because it was plentiful in the organs of electric eels and fish and easy to purify. “There was very little other information and molecular detail about other neurotransmitter receptors,” explains F. Anne Stephenson at University College London, who was a member of the Barnard team. For this reason, researchers were hotly pursuing the purification of other neurotransmitter receptors. Both the glycine and GABA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that conduct chloride ions. When glycine and GABA bind to their respective receptors, the channels open up to allow chloride ions into the neuron. The ions cause the neuron to hyperpolarize and be less willing to undergo an action potential, so the glycine and GABA receptors are also known as inhibitory receptors. The introduction of radioligand binding activity assays in the 1970s allowed researchers to measure the activity of neurotransmitter receptors in biochemical preparations. Researchers radiolabeled a molecule that bound to a receptor and tracked the radioactive signal to detect the receptor. The investigators on the two JBC papers here coupled the radioligand binding assay with affinity chromatography. Because a receptor naturally bound to its ligand, “you could use that property to purify the protein and study it in the test tube,” explains Richard Olsen, a molecular neuroscientist at the University of California at Los Angeles who was not affiliated with the two papers. The Barnard and Betz teams knew it was going to be impossible to get the tiny molecules of radiolabeled GABA and glycine molecules on appropriate purification columns without affecting their structure and abilities to bind to the receptors, so they took another tack and used other molecules that bound to the receptors. For example, the poison strychnine binds to the glycine receptor with nanomolar affinity. The Betz team attached radiolabeled strychnine to beads (Fig. 1). They poured rat spinal cord preparations solubilized in detergent over the beads so that only the glycine receptor bound. After washing away all of the unbound material, the researchers eluted the purified receptor from the beads with glycine and cleaned up the preparation to get the pure protein. A similar approach was taken with the purification of the GABA receptor from bovine brain, for which the Barnard team used a benzodiazepine, a class of neuroactive molecules that include the famous Valium, on their purification column (Fig. 2). They used a radiolabeled benzodiazepine for detecting the GABA receptors after the purification process.FIGURE 2The Betz team attached radiolabeled strychnine to beads to pull out the glycine receptor from rat spinal cord preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified proteins revealed that the receptors were composed of multiple subunits, but as time and further research showed, all of the details in the two papers were not accurate. For the GABA receptor, Barnard's group reported two bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. These two polypeptides were used to obtain protein sequence, which then led to the cloning of the GABA receptor. However, molecular neuroscientists soon learned that the GABA receptor family actually consists of 19 different polypeptides classified into groups such as α, β, and γ. These polypeptides combine in different ways to form heteropentamers that result in various GABA receptor subtypes. For the glycine receptor, Betz's group observed three polypeptides on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 48, 58, and 93 kDa, but research later showed that the 93-kDa band was a different protein called gephyrin. The protein is important because it “forms a matrix in the synaptic region to cluster receptor proteins together,” Olsen says. “Gephyrin was another breakthrough step in understanding neurotransmitter receptors that just happened to co-purify with the receptor [in the Betz study] because it binds the receptor tightly.” The purification of the two receptors led to the cloning of their genes in 1987 (3Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A.

The strychnine-binding subunit of the glycine receptor shows homology with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Nature. 1987; 328: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Peter Seeburg, now at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Germany, was enlisted by Barnard for the GABAA receptor gene cloning project. Seeburg explains that the cloning approach for the two receptors was similar. The proteins were broken into fragments by peptidases and cyanogen bromide. The small peptide fragments were sequenced. From the amino acid sequence, the researchers created complementary oligonucleotide probes. They then used the probes to screen cDNA libraries to find the gene that encoded the protein fragment. Stephenson points out that the two JBC papers “had no functional data to show that they were actually ion channels,” but with the cloning of the genes, two avenues of research were now possible. First, the individual genes for the GABA and glycine receptors were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and analyzed by electrophysiology to prove the receptors were bona fide ion channels that conducted chloride ions. Second, the clones revealed the relationship between the ion channels. Both glycine and GABA receptors are inhibitory chloride channels, so it was logical to expect them to be similar. However, when the researchers extended the sequence alignment to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which conducts sodium ions, all three receptors had similar predictions in the number of membrane-spanning regions. Olsen says, “The amazing outcome was that the GABA and glycine receptors are related to each other in a family, and they are also in the same superfamily of genes as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.” The three receptors bore similarities in their transmembrane domains but also had a conserved N-terminal motif called a Cys loop. For this reason, the receptor class is sometimes referred to as the Cys loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Both Olsen and Seeburg point out that these two papers and the subsequent cloning papers were the last of their kind. The two JBC papers represent “a superhuman effort to purify these proteins that took years,” says Olsen. “It's fair to say, after these were done and the protein sequences were used to identify the clones, almost nobody ever did that [approach] again. The technology had advanced so much that we didn't need to do protein purifications in order to clone.” Molecular biologists could now use homologies to pull out related sequences and exploit functional expression of cDNA and mRNA libraries. Seeburg says that the GABA and glycine receptor purification and cloning stories reveal how resourceful nature is. “The interesting lesson, especially for the GABAA receptor, holds true for most of these ligand-gated ion channels. The lesson is that you have a single neurotransmitter like GABA but then you have a whole plethora of receptors that respond to the same neurotransmitter in different ways.” F. Anne Stephenson at the University of London (JBC Associate Editor) nominated the papers as Classics, and Rajendrani Mukhopadhyay (ASBMB's Senior Science Writer) wrote the introduction."
