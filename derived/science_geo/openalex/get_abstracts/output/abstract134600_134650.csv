https://openalex.org/W2040686597,"Mutations in the gene encoding the homeobox transcription factor NKX2-5 were found to cause nonsyndromic, human congenital heart disease. A dominant disease locus associated with cardiac malformations and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities was mapped to chromosome 5q35, where NKX2-5 , a Drosophila tinman homolog, is located. Three different NKX2-5 mutations were identified. Two are predicted to impair binding of NKX2-5 to target DNA, resulting in haploinsufficiency, and a third potentially augments target-DNA binding. These data indicate that NKX2-5 is important for regulation of septation during cardiac morphogenesis and for maturation and maintenance of atrioventricular node function throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W2092770422,"A two-dimensional columnar phase in mixtures of DNA complexed with cationic liposomes has been found in the lipid composition regime known to be significantly more efficient at transfecting mammalian cells in culture compared to the lamellar (LalphaC) structure of cationic liposome-DNA complexes. The structure, derived from synchrotron x-ray diffraction, consists of DNA coated by cationic lipid monolayers and arranged on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice (HIIC). Two membrane-altering pathways induce the LalphaC --> HIIC transition: one where the spontaneous curvature of the lipid monolayer is driven negative, and another where the membrane bending rigidity is lowered with a new class of helper-lipids. Optical microscopy revealed that the LalphaC complexes bind stably to anionic vesicles (models of cellular membranes), whereas the more transfectant HIIC complexes are unstable and rapidly fuse and release DNA upon adhering to anionic vesicles."

Refined crystal structures of the 11-subunit bc 1 complex from bovine heart reveal full views of this bifunctional enzyme. The “Rieske” iron-sulfur protein subunit shows significant conformational changes in different crystal forms, suggesting a new electron transport mechanism of the enzyme. The mitochondrial targeting presequence of the “Rieske” protein (subunit 9) is lodged between the two “core” subunits at the matrix side of the complex. These “core” subunits are related to the matrix processing peptidase, and the structure unveils how mitochondrial targeting presequences are recognized."

The T cells were initially activated in the T cell areas when the B cells were still randomly dispersed in the B cell–rich follicles. Both populations then migrated to the edges of the follicles and interacted there, resulting in CD154-dependent B cell proliferation and germinal center formation. These results provide visual documentation of cognate T-B cell interactions and localize them to the follicular border."
https://openalex.org/W2045923054,"Actin filament assembly at the cell surface of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes requires the bacterial ActA surface protein and the host cell Arp2/3 complex. Purified Arp2/3 complex accelerated the nucleation of actin polymerization in vitro, but pure ActA had no effect. However, when combined, the Arp2/3 complex and ActA synergistically stimulated the nucleation of actin filaments. This mechanism of activating the host Arp2/3 complex at the L. monocytogenes surface may be similar to the strategy used by cells to control Arp2/3 complex activity and hence the spatial and temporal distribution of actin polymerization."

Venter

https://openalex.org/W2051284243,"Tropical forest fragmentation threatens biodiversity, yet basic information on population responses for major groups such as plants is lacking. Hypervariable genetic markers were used to reconstruct a population-level pedigree in fragmented tropical forest for the tree Symphonia globulifera. Though seedlings occurred only in remnant forest, the pedigree showed that most seedlings had been produced by sequentially fewer adults in pasture, creating a genetic bottleneck. The pedigree also implicated shifts in the foraging of animals that disperse pollen and seed in a secondary constriction of the bottleneck. These results suggest that tropical conservation strategies should anticipate complex, cryptic responses to fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2050166373,"Methanogenic and sulfate-reducing Archaea are considered to have an energy metabolism involving C1 transfer coenzymes and enzymes unique for this group of strictly anaerobic microorganisms. An aerobic methylotrophic bacterium, Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, was found to contain a cluster of genes that are predicted to encode some of these enzymes and was shown to contain two of the enzyme activities and one of the methanogenic coenzymes. Insertion mutants were all unable to grow on C1 compounds, suggesting that the archaeal enzymes function in aerobic C1 metabolism. Thus, methylotrophy and methanogenesis involve common genes that cross the bacterial/archaeal boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W1974258673,Some glacial sediment samples recovered from beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet at ice stream B contain Quaternary diatoms and up to 10 8 atoms of beryllium-10 per gram. Other samples contain no Quaternary diatoms and only background levels of beryllium-10 (less than 10 6 atoms per gram). The occurrence of young diatoms and high concentrations of beryllium-10 beneath grounded ice indicates that the Ross Embayment was an open marine environment after a late Pleistocene collapse of the marine ice sheet.
https://openalex.org/W2044095291,"An expression cloning strategy in Xenopus laevis was used to isolate a homeobox-containing gene, Mixer , that can cause embryonic cells to form endoderm. Mixer transcripts are found specifically in the prospective endoderm of gastrula, which coincides with the time and place that endodermal cells become histologically distinct and irreversibly determined. Loss-of-function studies with a dominant inhibitory mutant demonstrate that Mixer activity is required for endoderm development. In particular, the expression of Sox17 α and Sox17 β, two previously identified endodermal determinants, require Mixer function. Together, these data suggest that Mixer is an embryonic transcription factor involved in specifying the endodermal germ layer."
https://openalex.org/W2122990823,"Infrared wavelength observations of Io by the Galileo spacecraft show that at least 12 different vents are erupting lavas that are probably hotter than the highest temperature basaltic eruptions on Earth today. In at least one case, the eruption near Pillan Patera, two independent instruments on Galileo show that the lava temperature must have exceeded 1700 kelvin and may have reached 2000 kelvin. The most likely explanation is that these lavas are ultramafic (magnesium-rich) silicates, and this idea is supported by the tentative identification of magnesium-rich orthopyroxene in lava flows associated with these high-temperature hot spots."
https://openalex.org/W2135372169,"The NH2-terminal fragments of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are released from endoplasmic reticulum membranes by proteases whose activities depend upon SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. The activity of SCAP is inhibited by sterols, which appear to interact with the polytopic membrane domain of SCAP. Here, we use protease protection and N-linked glycosylation site-mapping techniques to define the topology of the eight membrane-spanning domains of SCAP. The data indicate that the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus of SCAP face the cytosol. The long intralumenal loops after membrane-spanning segments 1 and 7 are glycosylated, confirming their lumenal location. The region comprising membrane-spanning segments 2–6 shows sequence resemblance to putative sterol-sensing domains in three other proteins: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, and the morphogen receptor Patched. The orientation of the eight membrane-spanning segments in SCAP is consistent with the model proposed for HMG-CoA reductase (Olender, E. H., and Simoni, R. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4223–4235). The membrane-spanning domains of SCAP and HMG-CoA reductase confer sterol sensitivity upon the functional activities of the two molecules. The common membrane topology of the two proteins is consistent with the notion that sterols regulate both proteins by a common mechanism. The NH2-terminal fragments of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are released from endoplasmic reticulum membranes by proteases whose activities depend upon SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. The activity of SCAP is inhibited by sterols, which appear to interact with the polytopic membrane domain of SCAP.

The membrane-spanning domains of SCAP and HMG-CoA reductase confer sterol sensitivity upon the functional activities of the two molecules. The common membrane topology of the two proteins is consistent with the notion that sterols regulate both proteins by a common mechanism. Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl; HSV, herpes simplex virus; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LDLR, LDL receptor; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are membrane-bound transcription factors that activate the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids in animal cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). Their activities are regulated by SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic membrane protein that forms complexes with membrane-bound SREBPs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Formation of this complex is a necessary step in the pathway by which the NH2-terminal fragments of SREBPs are released proteolytically from the ER membrane, so that they can enter the nucleus to stimulate transcription (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The SREBPs are bound to ER membranes in a hairpin fashion (4Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains, each about 500 amino acids in length, project into the cytosol. They are joined by a membrane-attachment domain consisting of two membrane-spanning sequences separated by a short hydrophilic loop of 31 amino acids that projects into the ER lumen. The NH2-terminal domain is a transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain binds SCAP, thereby facilitating the proteolytic release of the NH2-terminal domain (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In cells deprived of cholesterol, the two-step release process begins when a protease clips the SREBPs at Site-1, which is a Leu-Ser bond in the lumenal loop (5Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This cleavage requires the SREBP·SCAP complex, and it is prevented by a variety of maneuvers that disrupt this complex (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The cleavage separates the two halves of the SREBPs, but the NH2-terminal domain remains bound to membranes by virtue of its single membrane-spanning segment. Release is completed when a second protease cleaves the NH2-terminal segment at a site within the first membrane-spanning domain (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). The responsible enzyme, designated Site-2 protease, was recently identified by molecular cloning as a novel type of polytopic intramembranous metalloprotease (6Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Molecular Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Cholesterol inhibits its own synthesis by abolishing the cleavage of SREBPs at Site-1 (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). This regulation is thought to be mediated by the interaction of sterols with the membranous domain of SCAP, which contains a segment whose sequence resembles the sterol-sensing domain of HMG-CoA reductase (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and two other proteins that are thought to interact with sterols, i.e. the Niemann-Pick C1 gene product and the developmental protein Patched (8Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Sterols do not disrupt the SREBP·SCAP complex, but rather they abolish the ability of this complex to activate the Site-1 protease (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The latter has not been defined in molecular terms. Upon entering the nucleus, the NH2-terminal domains of the SREBPs activate transcription of several genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol synthesis (e.g. HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and others), cholesterol uptake (LDL receptor), fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase), and triglyceride synthesis (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) (1Brown M.S.

Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Sterols down-regulate transcription of each of these genes by blocking proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). This allows cells to maintain a relatively constant membrane composition in the face of widely varying amounts of cholesterol supply and demand. A full understanding of the mechanism of sterol regulation requires a more complete structural and functional analysis of SCAP, the protein that mediates this control. Studies to date have shown that SCAP comprises two distinct domains: an NH2-terminal polytopic membranous domain of ∼730 amino acids and a COOH-terminal water soluble domain of ∼540 amino acids that projects into the cytosol (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar,7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain contains five more or less degenerate copies of a sequence of ∼40 residues, which has been called the WD repeat. Found in a variety of proteins, WD repeat domains are felt to mediate protein-protein interactions (14Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). This has been shown directly in the crystal structures of heterotrimeric G proteins, whose β-subunits contain seven WD repeats that are required for contacts with the α and γ subunits (15Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). As one might expect, the COOH-terminal domain of SCAP is the region that interacts with the COOH-terminal regulatory domains of SREBPs (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The structure of the membranous NH2-terminal domain of SCAP has not yet been studied directly. Analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests that this region contains multiple membrane-spanning segments separated by hydrophilic loops of varying length (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Five of these putative membrane-spanning segments show a sequence resemblance to membrane-spanning segments 2–6 of HMG-CoA reductase (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) whose NH2-terminal membranous domain (17Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to contain eight membrane-spanning segments (18Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-spanning segments 2–6 of hamster HMG-CoA reductase show 25% sequence identity and 55% similarity to a similar region of SCAP (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, this same region is shared with the Niemann-Pick C1 gene product and with Patched (8Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), supporting the concept that this region interacts with sterols. For this reason, the sequence corresponding to membrane-spanning segments 2–6 of HMG-CoA reductase has been called the sterol-sensing domain (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar, 7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

In the current studies we have tested the model for the membrane topology of SCAP through protease protection experiments and through an examination of patterns of N-linked glycosylation. The data are consistent with the proposed polytopic model. We obtained monoclonal antibodies IgG-HSV-Tag™ and IgG-T7-Tag™ from Novagen, Inc.; monoclonal anti-BiP antibody from StressGene Biotechnologies Corp.; bromelain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.; trypsin and Triton X-100 from Boehringer Mannheim; Nonidet P-40 andN-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal (ALLN) from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.; and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs, Inc. Other reagents were obtained from sources as described previously (19Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Eisenberg R.J. Siebert G.R. Heilman C.J. Wilcox W.C. Cohen G.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and two novel amino acids (ID, encoded by the sequence for aBspDI restriction site). This plasmid is derived from pTK-HSV-SCAP(D443N) (see Ref. 7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) by replacement of aBstEII-FseI fragment containing the wild-type codon 443. pTK-HSV-LDLR-SCAP encodes a fusion protein consisting of an initiator methionine, two tandem copies of the HSV epitope, amino acids 811–860 of the human LDL receptor (23Yamamoto T.

All other expression plasmids used in this study were derived from the above-mentioned vectors by polymerase chain reaction-based, site-directed mutagenesis (24Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The structures of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing of the ligation junctions and all other modified regions. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were set up on day 0 (5.5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) and cultured in 8–9% CO2 at 37 °C in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 2, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using an MBS kit (Stratagene) as described previously (4Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Three h after transfection, the cells were switched to fresh medium as indicated in the figure legends, incubated overnight, and harvested on day 3. Stock cultures of CHO-7 cells, a clone of CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, catalog number CCL-61) adapted to growth in lipoprotein-deficient serum (19Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Colonies of CHO-7 cells stably transfected with a vector expressing epitope-tagged, wild-type hamster SCAP (pTK-HSV-SCAP-T7) were isolated by growth in G418 and 25-hydroxycholesterol as described previously (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Individual surviving colonies were dilution-cloned, and one clone (LB343-9a-1) was expanded and used for the experiments reported here. Cells were set up for experiments on day 0 (5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) in medium C supplemented with 5% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum and harvested on day 3. Each monolayer of 293 or CHO-7 cells was scraped into the culture medium, centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged again as above. The cell pellet from each dish was resuspended in 0.4 ml sucrose-containing buffer D (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium EGTA, 250 mm sucrose), passed through a 22-gauge needle 20 times, and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Each supernatant was centrifuged at 1.5 × 104 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was designated as the membrane fraction. Each monolayer of CHO-7 cells was scraped into the culture medium, centrifuged, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline as described above. The cell pellet from each dish was resuspended in 0.2 ml of sucrose-free buffer E (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium EGTA) and allowed to swell for 10 min at 0 °C on ice. The suspension was passed through a 22-gauge needle 15 times and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Each supernatant was subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor at 105 × g for 45 min, and the resulting pellet was designated as the membrane fraction. 293 or CHO-7 cells were harvested, and cell membranes were prepared by Protocol 1 except that protease inhibitors (see below) were added to buffer D. The membrane pellets were suspended in 0.1 ml buffer F (buffer D supplemented with 0.1m NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1.9 μg/ml aprotinin) or in buffer F containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and rocked at 4 °C for 5 min. Varying amounts of bromelain were added in a volume of 2 μl, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 92 μl. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 50 mm tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone followed by 25 μl of buffer G (150 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 15% (w/v) SDS, 12.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The samples were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. 293 or CHO-7 cells were harvested, and the membrane fraction was prepared by Protocol 1 or 2 as indicated in the figure legends. Membrane pellets from 293 cells were suspended in 0.14 ml of buffer H (buffer D plus 0.1 m NaCl), rocked at 4 °C for 5 min, and divided into 56-μl aliquots for trypsin treatment. Membrane pellets from CHO-7 cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of buffer I (buffer E plus 0.1 m NaCl). Aliquots (90 μl) were supplemented with 10 μl of buffer I or buffer I containing 10% Triton X-100 and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min before trypsin treatment. Varying amounts of trypsin were added in a volume of 2 μl, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated time. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 400 units of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 μl) and 25 μl of buffer G. The samples were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membrane fractions from transfected 293 cells were prepared as described in Protocol 1 and suspended in 0.14 ml of buffer H. Aliquots (56 μl) were treated with 1 μg of trypsin as described above, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (400 units) followed by addition of 10 μl of solution containing 3.5% SDS and 7% 2-mercaptoethanol. After heating at 100 °C for 10 min, the samples received sequential additions of 7 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 7 μl of 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 2 μl of varying amounts of PNGase F (1 unit = 15.4 IUBMB microunits) as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time, reactions were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of buffer G. The mixtures were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured with a BCA kit (Pierce). Monoclonal antibody IgG-9D5 directed against amino acids 540–707 of hamster SCAP was prepared as described previously (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All other antibodies used in this study were obtained from commercial sources as described above. Gels were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Bio-Rad). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose sheets (Amersham) and incubated with monoclonal antibodies at the indicated concentration. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) using the SuperSignal substrate system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filters were exposed to Reflection™ NEF-496 film (NEN Life Science Products) at room temperature for the indicated time. Fig. 1 A shows a hydropathy plot of the amino acid sequence of SCAP and the predicted membrane topology of the protein. For comparison, we show similar diagrams for HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 1 B) based on the studies by Simoni and co-workers (18Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of SCAP is predicted to contain eight membrane-spanning regions (numbered 1–8 in the hydropathy plot). The assignment of these predicted segments is based not only upon their relative hydrophobicity but also upon analogy with the eight membrane-spanning segments of HMG-CoA reductase (18Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As discussed in the Introduction, putative membrane-spanning regions 2–6 of hamster SCAP show a 25% identity and 55% similarity with membrane-spanning regions 2–6 of hamster HMG-CoA reductase (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This region of both proteins is called the sterol-sensing domain. The box in Fig. 1 highlights the similar hydropathy plots of the two sterol-sensing domains. Fig. 1 A also shows the position of three potential sites ofN-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) that occur in relatively long loops of SCAP that are postulated to project into the ER lumen. SCAP has two other potential N-linked glycosylation sites, but these are located between WD repeats 1 and 2 in the COOH-terminal domain that faces the cytosol (2Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the single site of N-linked glycosylation in HMG-CoA reductase occurs in the loop between membrane-spanning segments 7 and 8 (Fig. 1 B). In SCAP, this loop contains two potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 A). The model of Fig. 1 A predicts that the NH2terminus and COOH terminus of SCAP face the cytosol. To test this hypothesis, we prepared an expression vector encoding SCAP with two copies of an epitope tag from the HSV envelope glycoprotein D at the NH2 terminus and three copies of an epitope from bacteriophage T7 at the COOH terminus (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that this epitope-tagged version of SCAP has wild-type activity in its ability to stimulate cleavage of SREBPs (7Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The plasmid was introduced into CHO-7 cells by transfection, and a stable cell line expressing the tagged protein was isolated. Membranes were prepared from these cells and digested with increasing amounts of bromelain in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. The proteolytic reaction was stopped, and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with an antibody against the COOH-terminal T7 epitope. Membranes from nontransfected CHO-7 cells did not show any reactivity with the anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4). In the transfected cells, the epitope-tagged SCAP appeared as a band at ∼150 kDa (lanes 5,9, and 13). In the absence of detergent, low concentrations of bromelain produced fragments of ∼47, 39, and 30 kDa, indicative of three bromelain-sensitive sites within the COOH-terminal domain (lanes 6 and 7). At higher concentrations, bromelain abolished all immunoreactivity (lane 8). The results were identical in the presence of Triton X-100 (lanes 10–12). As a control for the integrity of the membrane vesicles, we blotted duplicate filters with an antibody against grp78 (BiP), a known intralumenal protein of the ER (26Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The anti-BiP antibody (directed against the COOH-terminal KSGKDEL sequence (StressGene Biotechnologies Corp.)) also reacts with grp94, another intralumenal KDEL-terminating protein of the ER (26Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 27Koch G.L.E. Macer D.R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). The grp94 protein was resistant to bromelain in the absence of detergent (lanes 6–8), but it was destroyed in the presence of detergent (lanes 4, 10–12). These results confirm that the membrane vesicles were impermeant to bromelain in the absence of detergent. The grp78 band was not useful for this analysis because it resisted bromelain digestion both in the absence and presence of detergent, indicating that the protein itself is bromelain-resistant under the conditions of these experiments. In earlier studies (4Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), w"

At Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations below 100 nm, characteristic of light-adapted photoreceptors, guanylate cyclase-activating protein (GCAPs) activate RetGC, and at free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations above 500 nm, characteristic of dark-adapted photoreceptors, GCAPs inhibit RetGC. A mutation, Y99C, in human GCAP-1 was recently found to be linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy in a British family (Payne, A. M., Downes, S. M., Bessant, D. A. R., Taylor, R., Holder, G. E., Warren, M. J., Bird, A. C., and Bhattachraya, S. S. (1998) <i>Hum. Mol. Genet.</i> 7, 273–277). We produced recombinant Y99C GCAP-1 mutant and tested its ability to activate RetGC <i>in vitro</i> at various free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The Y99C mutation does not decrease the ability of GCAP-1 to activate RetGC. However, RetGC stimulated by the Y99C GCAP-1 remains active even at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration above 1 μm. Hence, the cyclase becomes constitutively active within the whole physiologically relevant range of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. We have also found that the Y99C GCAP-1 can activate RetGC even in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded nonmutant GCAPs. This is consistent with the fact that cone degeneration was dominant in human patients who carried such mutation (Payne, A. M., Downes, S. M., Bessant, D. A. R., Taylor, R., Holder, G. E., Warren, M. J., Bird, A. C., and Bhattachraya, S. S. (1998) <i>Hum. Mol. Genet.</i> 7, 273–277). A similar mutation, Y104C, in GCAP-2 results in a different phenotype. This mutation apparently does not affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of GCAP-2. Instead, the Y104C GCAP-2 stimulates RetGC less efficiently than the wild-type GCAP-2. Our data indicate that cone degeneration associated with the Y99C mutation in GCAP-1 can be a result of constitutive activation of cGMP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051545925,"The 31-kDa integral membrane protein stomatin (protein 7.2b) is not only an important component of the red cell membrane but can also be found in abundance in different tissues and cell lines. The protein is thought to be anchored to the membrane by a hydrophobic domain while both N and C termini are exposed to the cytoplasm. We have previously shown in the human cell line UAC that stomatin concentrates preferentially in plasma membrane folds and protrusions. There is also evidence that stomatin is linked to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role in cortical morphogenesis of the cell. In this study, we demonstrate that the fundamental structure of stomatin is oligomeric. Whereas interaction of stomatin with itself was suggested by cross-linking experiments, we show by density gradient centrifugation analysis that soluble homo-oligomeric complexes of this protein are present in Triton X-100 extracts of UAC cells. We also show the existence of these oligomers by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous stomatin and a recombinantly expressed myc-tagged stomatin, using an anti-myc antibody. The data indicate that these complexes comprise between 9 and 12 monomers of stomatin. Two C-terminally truncated forms of stomatin do not incorporate into these oligomers, suggesting an involvement of the C terminus in the homo-oligomeric interaction.

The 31-kDa protein stomatin was first identified and purified from the erythrocyte membrane as a major component of band 7 (band 7.2b) (1Wang D. Mentzer W.C. Cameron T. Johnson R.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1151: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analysis of stomatin expression allowed its presence to be detected in abundance in most tissues (although significantly lower in brain tissue) as well as in various cell lines (2Hiebl-Dirschmied C.M. Adolf G.R. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Stewart G.W. Hepworth-Jones B.E. Keen J.N. Dash B.C.J. Argent A.C. Casimir C.M.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26358-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the wide distribution of stomatin and its constitutive expression suggest an important role for this protein in cell biology, perhaps as a “house-keeping” component, its function remains undetermined. However, some clues to a possible function are provided by features related directly to stomatin or to homologous proteins. First, stomatin is apparently absent in the red cell membrane of patients suffering from overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, an autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia (8Lande W.M. Thiemann P.V.W. Mentzer W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Stewart G.W. Argent A.C. Dash B.C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As this disease is associated with an increase in erythrocyte membrane permeability, the protein may play an important role in the maintenance of membrane integrity. Notably, stomatin was also found to interact specifically with phospholipids in the erythrocyte membrane (10Desneves J. Berman A. Dynon K. La Greca N. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, at least two proteins related to human stomatin exist in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. MEC-2 appears to be one of the essential components of mechano-sensory neurons and is specifically expressed in these cells (11Huang M. Gu G. Ferguson E.L. Chalfie M. Nature. 1995; 378: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). UNC-24 is required for normal locomotion of the worm but was not assigned to any type of cell or tissue (12Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of these proteins display some homology with stomatin, they also show important differences that might imply modified or different functions. We have described the 5–6-fold up-regulation of stomatin in the human amniotic cell line UAC after treatment with interleukin-6 (IL-6) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FCS, fetal calf serum. 1The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FCS, fetal calf serum. and dexamethasone (13Snyers L. Content J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The same treatment induces expression of metallothionein in these cells and a correlated increase of resistance against oxidative stress. While the significance of stomatin induction in this system remains hypothetical and may be related to a more complex tissue response, in a previous study we took advantage of the high expression to analyze the cellular localization of stomatin by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). These data showed that the protein concentrates preferentially in plasma membrane protrusions and also in a juxta-nuclear region that might represent vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus. In addition, stomatin appears to co-localize to some extent with cortical actin microfilaments, even after disruption of actin filaments by cytochalasin D. The massive presence of stomatin in membrane-protruding folds and extensions (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar) suggests a possible structural role for this protein in the formation of these structures and/or the anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton. Other proteins involved in cortical morphogenesis typically form oligomers (15Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We also noticed that gold particles often appeared as doublets or triplets on immunoelectron microscopy with an anti-stomatin antibody (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence, using two different approaches, that stomatin actually forms oligomers. One is the analysis of detergent extracts of UAC cell membranes by density gradient centrifugation and the other is co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous stomatin when a constitutively expressed epitope-tagged stomatin is immunoprecipitated with an epitope-specific antibody. The results of both studies led to the conclusion that stomatin is present in the membrane in an oligomeric form. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 directed against the myc epitope was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. A stock solution of 0.4 mg/ml was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Monoclonal anti-stomatin antibody GARP 50 has been described (2Hiebl-Dirschmied C.M. Adolf G.R. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar) and was used from hybridoma supernatant. Polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody was a kind gift of Dr. I. Ivessa (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria), and monoclonal anti-epidermal surface antigen was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Eukaryotic expression vector pEF-Puro.PL3 was derived from pEF-BOS (16Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Dr. J.-C. Renauld (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) cross-linking agent was from Pierce. Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene. [35S]methionine (1368 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). UAC cells (human epithelial cells of amniotic origin) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For maximum expression of stomatin, they were grown to confluence and treated with IL-6 (200 units/ml) and dexamethasone (0.1 μm) 1 day before experiments as described (13Snyers L. Content J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). To express an epitope-tagged stomatin in UAC cells, we used the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-Puro.PL3. This vector contains a BstXI site downstream of the promoter of elongation factor 1α and a puromycin resistance gene. A double-stranded oligonucleotide having the sequence coding for the myc epitope EKLISEEDL followed by a STOP codon and preceded by a KpnI site was inserted into theBstXI site. The resulting plasmid contains a uniqueKpnI site. Another double-stranded oligonucleotide was created with the myc epitope coding sequence and two KpnI compatible ends, of which only the 5′ end reconstituted a cleavable site. This was inserted four times into the same vector, resulting in a unique KpnI site followed in frame by five copies of the myc-epitope (pEFKmyc5). A full-length cDNA of stomatin cloned from a UAC cell cDNA library (13Snyers L. Content J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) served as a template to amplify, usingPfu DNA polymerase, the coding region of this protein with an in-frame KpnI site at both ends. The resulting fragment was cloned into pEFKmyc5 leading to the C-terminal tagged stomatin (pEFSTmyc5). The construct was checked by dideoxy sequencing which showed that no mutations were introduced through the cloning process (3Hiebl-Dirschmied C.M. Entler B. Glotzmann C. Maurer-Fogy I. Stratowa C. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Unfried I. Entler B. Prohaska R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). UAC cells were stably transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as transfection reagent. After selection in medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin, individual clones were picked by trypsinization using cloning rings. Expression of the recombinant protein was screened by Western blot analysis using the anti-stomatin antibody GARP 50, and correct membrane localization was monitored by immunofluorescence using the anti-myc antibody. C-terminally truncated forms of stomatin fused to an myc tag at the C terminus were prepared as described above. Amino acids from 1 to 198 were fused to three copies of the myc epitope for better visualization on Western blot. Clones expressing epitope-tagged stomatin were grown to confluence in a 10-cm dish and treated with IL-6 and dexamethasone or left untreated. They were rinsed in methionine-free medium supplemented with dialyzed serum and incubated for 5 h in 5 ml of the same medium containing 50–100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. After rinsing twice with PBS, cells were lysed in 1 ml of TNCT (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin,10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5% FCS. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g and supernatants were incubated 45 min with either 50 μl of monoclonal anti-stomatin antibody GARP 50 hybridoma supernatant or 1 μg/ml anti-myc antibody, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with TNCT, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After drying, gels were exposed on autoradiographic films (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Quantitative measurement of autoradiographs was accomplished by laser densitometry (Ultroscan, LKB). UAC cells membranes were lysed in TNCT (replacement of Ca2+ by 5 mm EDTA had no influence on the results presented in this paper). Lysates were cleared at 20,000 × g for 10 min or in some experiments at 100,000 × g for 20 min before loading onto a 5–25% linear sucrose gradient (12.4 ml) in TNCT and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm (280,000 × g) for 21 h at 4 °C in a SW 40 rotor (Beckman). Note that the entire gradient contained 1% Triton X-100. Nineteen fractions (0.66 ml) were collected from above and separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained using the Protein Silver Staining Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or subjected to immunoblotting for stomatin detection. For gradient calibration, molecular weight standards were used in parallel centrifugations (gel filtration molecular weight markers, Sigma) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels. The different markers correspond to carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). IL-6 and dexamethasone-treated UAC cells (four confluent 15-cm dishes) were rinsed twice with PBS and scraped in 2–3 ml of homogenization medium (50 mmTris/Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm mannitol, and 5 mmCaCl2) containing protease inhibitors. Homogenization was performed on ice in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted at 5700 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was used directly for lysis and subsequent gradient centrifugation as described above. Fractions collected from the gradients were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Rainbow molecular weight marker was used (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Blots were blocked for 60 min in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5% non-fat dry milk. After incubation with anti-stomatin antibody GARP 50 (diluted 1/15 in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 60 min, they were incubated with anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI) before visualization with the substrate (NBT, BCIP). In Fig. 2, a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used and visualized with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Immunofluorescence of IL-6 and dexamethasone-treated UAC cells with anti-stomatin antibody was performed as described (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). The same procedure was used to visualize myc epitope-tagged stomatin in stably transfected cells except that anti-myc monoclonal antibody served as a primary antibody at 1 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% FCS. Preparations were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and photographed with a Quantix camera (Photometrics). IL-6 and dexamethasone-treated UAC cells were washed twice with PBS. DSS first dissolved in Me2SO was applied onto the cells at a final concentration of 2 mm in PBS. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, cells were washed and directly dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 units/ml Benzon Nuclease (Merck) to digest genomic DNA. The resulting extract was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-stomatin antibody. The first evidence of an oligomeric structure of stomatin in UAC cells came from cross-linking experiments. Cells were treated with IL-6 and dexamethasone and total proteins were subjected to chemical cross-linking using DSS. Western blots of whole cell extracts were performed using the stomatin specific antibody GARP 50 (Fig. 1). In addition to the 31-kDa stomatin monomer, we observed bands that the mobility of which suggested the presence of cross-linked dimers, trimers, and hexamers as well as higher order oligomers. Other minor bands might correspond to covalent linking of stomatin to different cytoplasmic or membrane proteins or result from intramolecular bonds. Various other chemical or light-activated cross-linkers were used and gave identical results (not shown). Because of the inefficiency inherent in the cross-linking reaction, we thought that higher order oligomers might be the major stomatin species found in the cell. Triton X-100 readily solubilizes the majority of UAC cell stomatin, although a significant proportion of the protein (20 to 30%) remains in the pellet, which might represent the part of stomatin linked to the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2). Oligomers would be present in the soluble part of these extracts if interaction between monomers would be resistant to disruption by Triton X-100. Purified membranes of induced UAC cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to 5–25% sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Proteins of the different fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-stomatin antibody or by silver staining (Fig. 3 A). The results show that the major stomatin species has a high molecular weight (fractions 10, 11, and 12) and migrates away from the bulk of other proteins in the extract. Comparison with molecular weight standards separated under the same conditions indicates that stomatin oligomers have an apparent mass of 250–300 kDa. As stomatin oligomers are likely to exist in a micellar form, fractions were also probed with antibodies against two other membrane proteins (Fig. 3 B). Calnexin and epidermal surface antigen (ESA) separate at an apparent molecular mass slightly lower than that expected from the globular markers, demonstrating that the size of the oligomers is not overestimated. The stomatin immunoblot shows that very little stomatin is present between fraction 10 and fractions 2 and 3, where a small amount of monomer can be detected. This indicates that the oligomers are very stable under these conditions. They are also stable in 0.5m KCl (not shown). Analysis of total protein in the fractions does not show any other protein co-migrating with stomatin in the gradient. In conclusion, if no other protein of the same molecular weight is masked by stomatin, this implies the presence of homo-oligomers. To rule out the presence of unspecific aggregates of stomatin, samples were routinely centrifuged at 20,000 ×g after lysis in Triton X-100. Also, ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min resulted in only partial loss of the complexes (not shown). We further investigated the homo-oligomeric interaction of stomatin by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous protein with a C-terminal tagged stomatin expressed in UAC cells. Cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing the whole coding region of stomatin fused at the C terminus to five copies of the myc epitope (STmyc5) to increase affinity for the specific antibody 9E10. Individual clones were isolated and screened for the presence of the expected 38–40-kDa product, using immunoblotting with anti-stomatin and anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 4 A). They were also checked by immunofluorescence for the correct cellular localization of STmyc5. Fig. 4 B shows that the C-terminal tagged stomatin displays a staining pattern identical to endogenous stomatin in UAC cells. Fluorescence is concentrated in fine plasma membrane folds and extentions and also in the intra-cytoplasmic pool within the Golgi region. Interestingly, stomatin fused to the myc-epitope at the N terminus did not reach the plasma membrane but was blocked in the Golgi apparatus and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (not shown). One clone expressing STmyc5 was metabolically labeled, after having been induced by IL-6 and dexamethasone or left untreated, and Triton X-100 extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc monoclonal antibody. Fig. 5, left panel, shows that two proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated. One has the expected size of STmyc5 (38–40 kDa) and the other has the molecular weight of stomatin. This latter appears more abundant in induced cells, where it overwhelms the band corresponding to STmyc5. The right panel, where proteins immunoprecipitated from IL-6 and dexamethasone-treated cells were analyzed by immunoblotting, demonstrates the immunoreactivity of these two proteins with the anti-stomatin antibody. This experiment indicates that STmyc5 is engaged in an oligomeric complex with stomatin and that no other protein seems to interact with it.Figure 5Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous stomatin with epitope-tagged stomatin. UAC cells stably expressing STmyc5 were treated with IL-6 and dexamethasone or left untreated as indicated. They were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and lysed in 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using anti-myc antibody before SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (left panel). As negative controls, the same extracts were incubated in the presence of secondary antibody only. In the right panel, an immunoprecipitation similar to that in left panel, IL-6+dex, was transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-stomatin antibody. As a control, the extract was immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (anti-annexin, IgG1). Arrowsindicate the positions of endogenous and recombinantly expressed stomatin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To better show that stomatin is engaged in high order oligomers, new clones were selected which express lower amounts of recombinant stomatin. Immunoprecipitations with anti-myc antibody were performed using these clones (Fig. 6 A). In all clones, an excess of stomatin was co-immunoprecipitated with STmyc5. Ratios between the amounts of endogenous stomatin and STmyc5 were measured by laser densitometry and were 5.2, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 4.8, 12.5, and 7.4 (± 0.5), respectively, for clones 1 to 7. Clones 4, 6, and 7 gave the highest relative amount of stomatin compared with STmyc5, which was confirmed in independent immunoprecipitations using the same three clones (Fig. 6 B). It is noteworthy that clone 6, which has the lowest expression of STmyc5, shows the highest relative amount of co-immunoprecipitated endogenous stomatin, possibly reflecting a higher probability of having only one single molecule of STmyc5 for every stomatin oligomer. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of high order oligomers of stomatin having a size estimated at 9 to 12 monomers. Two truncated proteins containing either residues 1–198 (ST198myc3) or 1–174 (ST174myc5) of stomatin were fused at the C terminus to 3 and 5 copies, respectively, of the myc epitope. When stably expressed in UAC cells, ST198myc3 was found by immunofluorescence in intracellular vesicles and also in the plasma membrane, although much less staining could be seen in membrane protrusions than with full-length stomatin. ST174myc5 expression was restricted to intracellular compartments (not shown). Fig. 7 shows that, when Triton X-100 extracts of cells expressing these two truncated stomatin forms were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody, no co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous stomatin was observed, in contrast to full-length STmyc3 and STmyc5. However, the use of the more sensitive chemiluminescent detection system in similar experiments allowed us to see marginal amounts of stomatin co-immunoprecipitated with ST198myc3 but to a level far below what is observed for STmyc3 and STmyc5 (not shown). This experiment confirms that oligomers of stomatin do not result from artifactual aggregation of the protein during lysis, through the hydrophobic domain or the membrane proximal part of the molecule, because the truncated polypeptides (which contain these regions) do not incorporate into the complexes. It also suggests that the C terminus of stomatin is involved in the homomeric interaction of this protein. The data presented in this study demonstrate the homo-oligomeric organization of the integral membrane protein stomatin in an epithelial cell line. This was suggested by chemical cross-linking and confirmed and characterized by density gradient centrifugation analysis and co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous stomatin with a recombinant form of this protein. Both approaches led to the conclusion that stomatin oligomers detected in Triton X-100 extracts of UAC cells contain at least 9 monomers and might comprise up to 12 monomers per complex. Oligomers of stomatin are not a peculiarity of UAC cells because we also observed complexes of the same size in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation. 2L. Snyers, unpublished results. Throughout this study we have examined stomatin from total cellular membranes or whole cellular extracts. It is likely that stomatin exists in an oligomeric form in both the plasma membrane and the juxta-nuclear region detected by immunofluorescence (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar) because almost the totality of the protein is in the high molecular weight form in the sucrose gradient. This would be consistent with a model in which oligomers of stomatin are built very early in the biosynthetic pathway and processed to the plasma membrane via Golgi-derived vesicles. In addition, a specific role of stomatin in these vesicles is not excluded. Various proteins playing a structural role in the plasma membrane have been shown to oligomerize. Ezrin, in particular, is a peripheral membrane protein believed to function as a membrane cytoskeletal linker. It is abundant underneath the dorsal plasma membrane in all actin-containing structures and is partially detergent-insoluble (17Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar,18Vaheri A. Carpén O. Heiska L. Helander T.S. Jääskeläinen J. Majander-Nordenswan P. Sainio M. Timonen T. Turunen O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ezrin oligomer formation has been proposed to drive the assembly of cell surface structures, a process regulated by phosphorylation in certain types of cells (15Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). While some aspects of stomatin staining (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar) are reminiscent of ezrin, there is no indication of a post-translational control of stomatin. Moreover, stomatin is an integral membrane protein, which would fit to a more constitutive role. Another integral membrane protein, caveolin, has drawn our attention as it has topological features similar to stomatin, with a ‘hairpin-like’ membrane domain and cytoplasmic N and C termini (19Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and, like stomatin, contains three palmitoylated cysteine residues (20Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Preliminary data indicate that stomatin is also palmitoylated on cysteine residues in UAC cells2 as has been described for red cells (1Wang D. Mentzer W.C. Cameron T. Johnson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17826-17831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caveolin is thought to have a scaffolding function in caveolae membranes by forming homo-oligomers (21Sargiacomo M. Sherer P.E. Tang Z. Kübler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 22Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These oligomers interact side-by-side to form more complex particles (23Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that stomatin oligomers could also serve as a basis for building up a widespread structure. Such a possibility is also suggested by staining of stomatin and actin by double immunofluorescence in cytochalasin D-treated cells. In these studies, stomatin staining appears as a reticular structure centered around actin patches, suggestive of a meshwork-like organization (14Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-100 action could be sufficient to disaggregate this meshwork, whereas the oligomeric complex would remain intact in this detergent. In which part of stomatin is the homo-oligomerization domain localized? In caveolin, such a domain has been mapped to the membrane proximal region of the more important cytoplasmic N terminus (21Sargiacomo M. Sherer P.E. Tang Z. Kübler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to think that part of or the whole cytoplasmic C terminus of stomatin could act as a domain responsible for interaction of the protein with itself, as this is part of the region conserved in the two homologous proteins described in C. elegans. MEC-2, a membrane component of mechano-sensory neurons, is thought to act as a linker between the cytoskeleton and an ion channel MEC-4/MEC-10 (24Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition to the stomatin-like region, MEC-2 possesses two extended regions: one at the N terminus, possibly linked to microtubules (11Huang M. Gu G. Ferguson E.L. Chalfie M. Nature. 1995; 378: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the other at the C terminus, possibly regulating the ion channel. Genetic studies indicate a probable interaction of MEC-2 with itself (24Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A likely candidate region for this homomeric interaction could be the stomatin-like part of the protein. UNC-24 homology extends only from amino acid 25 to 198 of stomatin (12Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The remaining C-terminal portion of UNC-24 resembles a nonspecific lipid transfer protein, which suggests a biochemical function. Interestingly, truncated stomatin containing residues 1–198 had a reduced plasma membrane localization when stably expressed in UAC cells. When further reduced to amino acids 1–174, the protein access to the plasma membrane was blocked almost completely and staining was confined to intracytoplasmic compartments. Furthermore, these truncated forms of stomatin do not associate into oligomeric complexes when stably expressed in cells. Because protein-protein interaction and correct assembly into complexes are thought to be essential for efficient processing of membrane and secreted proteins (25Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), these data represent an indication that the C terminus is involved in stomatin interaction with itself.

Both cells expressing endogenous and transfected AR produce multiple cellular and soluble forms of AR with an N-glycosylated 50-kDa pro-AR form being predominant. Our results demonstrate that sequential proteolytic cleavage within the ectodomain of the 50-kDa pro-AR form leads to release of a predominantN-glycosylated 43-kDa soluble AR, as well as the appearance of other cellular and soluble AR forms. Cell surface biotinylation studies using a C-terminal epitope-tagged pro-AR indicate that all cell surface forms are membrane-anchored and support that AR is released by ectodomain cleavage of pro-AR at the plasma membrane. We also show that pro-AR ectodomain cleavage is a regulated process, which can be stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor, batimastat. In addition, we provide evidence that high molecular mass AR forms may retain the full-length N-terminal pro-region, which may influence the biological activities of these forms.

AR, which was originally isolated from conditioned medium of a PMA-treated human breast carcinoma cell line, is a cell type-dependent bifunctional modulator of cell growth (1Shoyab M. McDonald V. Bradley J. Todaro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). AR protein is synthesized as a 252-amino acid transmembrane glycoprotein, and two major soluble forms of 78 and 84 amino acids, which migrate between 20 and 25 kDa on SDS-PAGE, have been characterized (1Shoyab M.

Physiol. 1996; 169: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The variety of soluble AR forms implies intricacies in AR processing that have not yet been elucidated. AR mRNA has been isolated from normal human tissues including ovary, placenta, testis, pancreas, spleen, kidney, lung, breast, and colon (3Plowman G. Green J. McDonald V. Neubauer M. Disteche C. Todaro G. Shoyab M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For normal colonic mucosa, AR protein expression has been localized to more differentiated cells in the non-proliferative compartment (9Johnson G. Saeki T. Gordon A. Shoyab M. Salomon D. Stromberg K.

Heterodimerization of EGFR/HER-1 with other HER family members enables AR to activate other HER family members, such as HER-2 (23Johnson G. Saeki T. Auersperg N. Gordon A. Shoyab M. Salomon D.

Whereas initial receptor binding assays suggested that AR has a lower affinity for EGFR/HER-1 than EGF (2Shoyab M. Plowman G. McDonald V. Bradley J. Todaro G. Science. 1989; 243: 1074-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that the affinities of EGF and AR for EGFR/HER-1 may be more similar than previously observed (13Cook P.

Studies of recombinant AR forms with extensions C-terminal to mature AR have indicated that these forms have increased biological activity (25Adam R. Drummond D. Solic N. Holt S. Sharma R.

The present studies provide a detailed analysis of the biosynthesis and processing of AR in epithelial cells, both endogenous AR in human colorectal and mammary cancer cells, as well as various human pro-AR forms stably expressed in MDCK cells. We show that a predominant 50-kDa pro-AR form can be detected at the cell surface and is preferentially cleaved at the distal site within the ectodomain to release a major 43-kDa AR form into the medium. Sequential ectodomain cleavage of 50-kDa cell surface pro-AR, however, can lead to the appearance of other cell surface pro-AR forms and to the release of several soluble AR forms. The distal cleavage event can be stimulated by PMA and inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor, batimastat. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Tran35S-label was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and protein A-agarose were purchased from Pierce.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2087-2091PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Brown (British Biotech, Oxford, UK). Monoclonal antibodies to human AR (AR 6R1C2.4 (AR mAb), AR 4.14.18, and AR 12.38.4) were used in this study (6Thorne B. Plowman G. Mol. Cell.

Monoclonal antibodies to the 9E10 epitope of c-MYC (MYC mAb) and to heparan sulfate were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and Seikagaku America, Inc. (Ijamsville, MD), respectively. Monoclonal antibody to human EGFR (mAb 528) was generously provided by Dr. Hideo Masui (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, NY). Affinity purified rabbit antisera to mouse immunoglobulin was purchased from Cappel Laboratories (Durham, NC). Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (HRP) and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (SA-HRP) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. MDCK strain II and Caco-2 cells were obtained from Dr. Enrique Rodriguez-Boulan (Cornell University Medical College, NY). HCA-7 (clone 29) and MCF-7 cell lines were obtained from Dr. Susan Kirkland (ICRF, London, UK) and Dr. Lynn Matrisian (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), respectively. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines CHO-K1, CHO-745, and CHO-677 were obtained from Dr. Jeffrey Esko (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). The CHO-677 mutant lacks N-acetylglucosaminyl- and glucuronosyltransferases and cannot make heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (29Esko J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 313: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The CHO-745 mutant lacks xylosyltransferase and cannot make heparan or chondroitin sulfate GAGs (30Esko J. Stewart T. Taylor W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For each cell line, all experiments were performed within 10 passages. MDCK-II, Caco-2, HCA-7, and MCF-7 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), as described previously (31Dempsey P. Coffey R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CHO cell lines were grown in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (30Esko J. Stewart T. Taylor W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For culture on Transwell filters (0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA), cells were seeded at 1 × 105 and 5 × 105 cells on 12- and 24-mm Transwell filters, respectively. For cells grown on Transwell filters, medium was changed daily, except for Caco-2 and HCA-7 which were changed every other day. For polarizing cell lines, integrity of tight junctions was assessed by measuring transepithelial resistance across the Transwell filter with a Millicell Electrical Resistance System (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Experiments were performed when resistance was >200 ohms·cm2. Two human AR cDNAs encoding the wild type AR precursor were obtained from Dr. Gary Shipley (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) (13Cook P. Mattox P. Keeble W. Pittelkow M. Plowman G. Shoyab M. Adelman J. Shipley G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and Dr. Greg Plowman (Sugen, Redwood City, CA) (3Plowman G. Green J. McDonald V. Neubauer M. Disteche C. Todaro G. Shoyab M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and were subcloned into the pCB6 CMV expression vector. Both human AR cDNAs were used in these studies and gave equivalent results. A secreted AR construct (ARsec184) which ends in … ERCGEK184 was generated by excising theEcoRI-NotI fragment (885 base pairs) from the full-length pro-AR cDNA, digesting with HphI to isolate a 576-base pair fragment, and ligating the HphI fragment with HphI/BamHI annealed adapter oligonucleotides (5′-GGGAAAAGTGATAAG-3′ and 3′-CCCCTTTTCACTATTCCTAGG-5′) into Bluescript II (SK−). Subsequently, an XbaI-EcoRI fragment was excised and subcloned into pCB6. A secreted AR construct (ARsec190) which ends in … SMKTHS190 was generated in the same manner as ARsec184 using annealed adapter oligonucleotides (5′-GGGAAAAGTCCATGAAAACTCACAGCTGATAAG-3′ and 3′-CCCCTTTTCAGGTACTTTTGAGTGTCGACTATTCCTAGG-5′). The C-terminalMYC-tagged AR construct (AR/c-MYC) was generated by isolating an EcoRI-RsaI fragment and ligating the RsaI fragment withRsaI/BamHI-annealed oligonucleotides (5′-ACATGCTATAGCAGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTTTAATGAG-3′ and 3′-TGTACGATATCGTCTCGTCTTCGACTAGAGGCTCCTCCTGGAAATTACTCCTAG-5′). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs were transfected into MDCK II and CHO cells by calcium-phosphate precipitation method as described previously (31Dempsey P. Coffey R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected MDCK II and CHO cells were selected in medium containing 500 and 1000 μg/ml G418, respectively. Individual clones were initially screened by indirect immunofluorescence, and high expressing clones were subsequently screened by metabolic labeling combined with immunoprecipitation. All cells were grown on 24-mm Transwell filters in the appropriate medium for 4–6 days. To increase AR expression in transfected cell lines, cells were treated with 5 mm sodium butyrate in the appropriate medium for 16–18 h before labeling. For pulse and 2-h labeling, cells were rinsed 2 times with serum-free, l-cysteine/l-methionine-free DMEM (DME−) and incubated in DME− for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with 1–2 mCi/ml Tran35S-label as described previously (31Dempsey P. Coffey R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled at 37 °C for the indicated amount of time, rinsed once with 18 °C chase medium (DMEM containing 10 times excess l-cysteine and l-methionine), and incubated at 37 °C with chase medium for the specified times. Cells were grown on 24-mm Transwell filters as described above. All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. Prior to biotinylation, cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2(PBS+). For polarizing cells, 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in PBS+ was added to the basal compartment, and PBS+ was added to the apical compartment, and cells were incubated for 30 min. Non-polarizing cells were incubated with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in both the apical and basal compartments. Following biotinylation, cells were rinsed and washed 2 times with ice-cold 100 mm glycine in PBS+ and were rinsed 3 times with PBS+ containing 0.2% BSA (PBS/BSA). For biotinylation-chase experiments, cells were rinsed once with 4 °C serum-free DMEM and twice with PBS+. Cells were biotinylated as described above. Following biotinylation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS+, rinsed once with serum-free DMEM, and incubated at 37 °C with the indicated chase medium for the specified time. All immunoprecipitation protocols were performed at 4 °C or on ice, unless otherwise stated. After final washes, filters were cut out, and cell lysates were prepared as described previously (31Dempsey P. Coffey R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated overnight with AR mAb (0.2 μg/ml). Specificity of AR mAb for the different forms of AR was determined by preincubating the antibody with an excess (10–100 ng/sample) of recombinant human AR before immunoprecipitation. In order to precipitate antibody-AR complexes, affinity purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody was added for 1 h followed by addition of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose for 2 h. For immunoprecipitation from conditioned medium, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to 2 mm, and the medium was precleared, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI), and incubated overnight with AR mAb (0.05 μg/ml). Protein A-agarose was pelleted and complexes were stringently washed. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed under reducing conditions on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, unless otherwise specified. For metabolically labeled samples, gels were fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, and dried, and fluorography was performed with BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Enzymatic digestion of immunoprecipitates with endo H,N-glycosidase F, O-glycosidase, and neuraminidase was performed using the manufacturer's protocol. Biotinylated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and non-labeled samples were separated under non-reducing conditions to eliminate confounding detection of heavy and light immunoglobulin chains. After separation by SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitates for biotinylated or non-labeled samples were electrophoretically transferred overnight at 30 V to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). All steps were performed at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed twice in TBS-T (1× TBS, Tween 20) and blocked for 30 min in TBS-T containing 3% BSA (TBS-T/BSA). Once blocked, membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in TBS-T/BSA (AR mAb at 5 μg/ml or MYC mAb at 10 μg/ml) and then rinsed and washed with TBS-T. After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody in TBS-T/BSA (SA-HRP at 1:20,000 or donkey anti-mouse IgG-HRP at 1:5,000) for 30 min, washed extensively with TBS-T, and rinsed with TBS. Membranes incubated in SA-HRP received no primary antibody. The ECL Western blotting kit was used per manufacturer's directions, and fluorography was performed using BioMax MR film. Cells seeded on 24-mm Transwell filters were biotinylated and washed for chase experiments as described above. For the first 5 min of chase, cells were incubated at 37 °C in either serum-free DMEM containing Me2SO (control) or 5 μm batimastat. After 5 min, the chase medium was changed to serum-free DMEM containing either Me2SO, 5 μm batimastat, 1 μmPMA, or a combination of batimastat and PMA, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time. Cells and conditioned medium were collected, and AR immunoprecipitation combined with detection of biotinylated AR by Western blotting was performed as described previously. To identify the forms of AR produced in epithelial cells under basal conditions, we examined newly synthesized AR in two human colon cancer cell lines, HCA-7 and Caco-2, as well as a human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, that produce AR. Cell lysates and conditioned medium from cells metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label for 2 h were immunoprecipitated with AR mAb, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. A predominant diffuse 43-kDa AR form, a less intense 19- and 21-kDa doublet, and weak immunoreactive form of <14.3 kDa running at the dye front were detected in conditioned medium (Fig. 1 A). In separate experiments on higher percentage SDS-PAGE, the weak immunoreactive form was resolved as a 9-kDa band (data not shown). In addition, clonal MDCK cell lines stably transfected with a cDNA for wild type human pro-AR (MDCK-AR) released similar AR forms (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of total cell lysates of HCA-7 cells revealed 50-, 45-, 26- and 28-kDa doublet and 16-kDa forms of AR (Fig. 1 B). All cellular AR bands had a diffuse appearance, except for 45-kDa AR which appeared as a very narrow band. A similar profile was observed for total cell lysates from MDCK-AR cells (Fig. 1 B). The 50-kDa AR appeared to be the predominant cellular form. All AR forms were also detected with other AR antibodies to demonstrate AR specificity (data not shown), and AR Western blotting confirmed that each form contained AR immunoreactivity (data not shown). A summary of the biosynthesis and processing of pro-AR is shown in Fig. 8. To delineate potential relationships among cellular and soluble AR forms, we performed pulse-chase experiments using MDCK-AR cells. Cells were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label for 20 min and chased for various times, and total cell lysates were analyzed. At 0 min of chase, a narrow band of 45 kDa and a diffuse band of 50 kDa were detected (Fig. 2 A). In independent pulse-chase experiments examining total cell lysates, only the 45-kDa band was detected by 0 min of chase after 5 min of metabolic labeling, indicating it was a more immature pro-AR form (data not shown). By 20 min of chase, the 45-kDa band had diminished, which coincided with an increase in intensity of the 50-kDa AR. Intensity of the 50-kDa AR peaked at 20 min of chase and decreased with a half-life of ∼20 min. At 20 min of chase, a 26- and 28-kDa doublet and a 16-kDa AR form were also detected; however, intensities of these forms were significantly less than the 50-kDa form. Based on an independent pulse-chase experiment involving a 5-min metabolic labeling with Tran35S-label, increasing intensities of the 26- and 28-kDa doublet and the 16-kDa band were concurrent with loss of the 50-kDa AR through 40 min of chase, suggesting that the 26- and 28-kDa doublet may be derived from the 50-kDa AR (data not shown). By 4 h chase, no cellular AR forms were detectable. To examine specifically cell surface AR forms, we performed pulse-chase experiments in combination with cell surface biotinylation. Cells were pulsed with Tran35S-label, chased for various periods, and cell surface-biotinylated at the end of each chase. AR immunoprecipitates from total cell lysates were eluted, re-immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The 50-kDa, 26- and 28-kDa doublet, and 16-kDa forms were detected at the cell surface. The inability to detect 45-kDa pro-AR at the cell surface, together with its rapid kinetics of appearance in pulse-chase experiments, support that it represents an immature intracellular pro-AR form. Several forms of soluble AR were released into the medium during the 4-h chase period (Fig. 2 C). The 43-kDa, 19- and 21-kDa doublet, and 9-kDa-soluble AR forms were detected by 20 min of chase, with 43-kDa AR being the predominant form. Intensities of all soluble AR forms peaked by 1 h of chase. After 1 h of chase, the 43-kDa AR form gradually diminished through 4 h of chase. Both the 19- and 21-kDa doublet and 9-kDa AR forms persisted up to 2 h of chase and were diminished by 4 h. Interestingly, the increase in 43-kDa AR coincided with the loss of 50-kDa pro-AR from the cell surface, whereas increases in the 19- and 21-kDa AR doublet and 9-kDa forms more closely paralleled loss of the 26- and 28-kDa doublet and 16-kDa cell surface forms, respectively, suggesting a direct relationship between processing of cell surface forms and release of soluble forms (see Fig. 8). These data indicate that the predominant AR forms are a 50-kDa pro-AR and a 43-kDa soluble AR. The relative amounts of these forms were confirmed by metabolic labeling experiments using [35S]cysteine (data not shown). Previous studies suggest that the major species of soluble AR are low molecular mass forms of 18–35 kDa (1Shoyab M. McDonald V. Bradley J. Todaro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 6Thorne B. Plowman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One possibility to account for the high molecular mass AR forms detected in these studies is the presence of posttranslational modifica"
https://openalex.org/W2023604322,"Specific transport proteins mediate the packaging of neurotransmitters into secretory vesicles and consequently require targeting to the appropriate intracellular compartment. To identify residues in the neuron-specific vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) responsible for endocytosis, we examined the effect of amino (NH2-) and carboxyl (COOH-)-terminal mutations on steady state distribution and internalization. Deletion of a critical COOH-terminal domain sequence (AKEEKMAIL) results in accumulation of VMAT2 at the plasma membrane and a 50% reduction in endocytosis. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that replacement of the isoleucine-leucine pair within this sequence by alanine-alanine alone reduces endocytosis by 50% relative to wild type VMAT2. Furthermore, the KEEKMAIL sequence functions as an internalization signal when transferred to the plasma membrane protein Tac, and the mutation of the isoleucine-leucine pair also abolishes internalization of this protein. The closely related vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) contains a similar di-leucine sequence within the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain that when mutated results in accumulation of VAChT at the plasma membrane. The VAChT di-leucine sequence also confers internalization when appended to two other proteins and in one of these chimeras, conversion of the di-leucine sequence to di-alanine reduces the internalization rate by 50%. Both VMAT2 and VAChT thus use leucine-based signals for efficient endocytosis and as such are the first synaptic vesicle proteins known to use this motif for trafficking.

Endocytosis promotes the rapid and efficient internalization of many plasma membrane proteins. In addition, endocytosis contributes to the trafficking of membrane proteins that do not normally reside at the cell surface. For example, endocytosis retrieves the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; AP, adaptor protein complex; CMF-PBS, calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HA, hemaglutinin; LDCV, large dense core vesicle; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; Tac, interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit; VAChT, vesicular acetylcholine transporter; VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin. and endosomal proteins TGN38, furin, and the mannose 6-phosphate receptors from the plasma membrane, where they appear at low levels (1Kornfeld S.

Retrieval from the plasma membrane thus contributes to the steady-state accumulation of these proteins in the TGN and endosomes. Another class of proteins appears at the cell surface only after stimulation and requires endocytosis to reform the specialized secretory vesicles in which they usually reside. Neurons contain two types of secretory vesicle that undergo regulated exocytosis. Synaptic vesicles, or synaptic-like microvesicles in endocrine cells, store classical neurotransmitters (4Sollner T. Rothman J.E. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 344-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Large dense core vesicles (LDCVs), or secretory granules in endocrine cells, store neuromodulators such as neural peptides, hormones, and the monoamine neurotransmitters (7Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Despite a common function in regulated exocytosis, synaptic vesicles and LDCVs differ in their biogenesis. Synaptic vesicles form through recycling of their integral membrane proteins at the nerve terminal (8De Camilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Indeed, newly synthesized synaptic vesicle proteins traffick via the constitutive secretory pathway to the plasma membrane before they appear in synaptic vesicles (9Regnier-Vigouroux A. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3589-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Matteoli M. Takei K. Perin M.S. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, LDCVs derive directly from the TGN as part of the regulated secretory pathway (11Tooze S.A. Chanat E. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. Loh P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 157-177Google Scholar). In the TGN, LDCV proteins sort to the regulated secretory pathway and away from the constitutive secretory pathway (12Cutler D.F. Cramer L.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, endocytosis does not appear to have a direct role in LDCV formation. However, endocytosis presumably functions to retrieve LDCV membrane proteins after exocytosis. Indeed, the LDCV proteins glycoprotein III and ICA512 reappear in secretory granules after exposure at the cell surface (13Patzak A. Winkler H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Solimena M. Dirkyx Jr., R. Hermel J.M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rubin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins subject to efficient endocytosis contain specific, cytoplasmically disposed amino acid sequences for internalization (15Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have shown that endocytic targeting often involves either a tyrosine- or leucine-based motif. For example, mutagenesis of tyrosine 807 in the low density lipoprotein receptor disrupts localization to clathrin-coated pits and so prevents the uptake of low density lipoprotein (16Davis C.G.

Mutation of the di-leucine motif in CD3γ disrupts the interaction with AP-2, supporting a role for this interaction in endocytosis (19Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The sequences required for internalization of synaptic vesicle and LDCV membrane proteins have not previously been identified. We have now examined the endocytosis of two vesicular proteins that function to package classical neurotransmitters into secretory vesicles prior to regulated exocytosis (23Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Liu Y. Edwards R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These proteins use a proton electrochemical gradient generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase to drive the active transport of neurotransmitter into vesicles. Molecular cloning has identified two vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT1 and 2) and a closely related vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) (25Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S.

The sequences of the VMATs and VAChT show 41% amino acid identity and predict 12 transmembrane segments flanked by cytoplasmic amino (NH2)- and carboxyl (COOH)-terminal domains. In addition, a large lumenal loop occurs between transmembrane segments 1 and 2. Despite these similarities in structure and function, VMATs and VAChT localize to distinct secretory vesicles. In PC12 cells, VMATs occur predominantly in LDCVs (29Liu Y. Schweitzer E.S. Nirenberg M.J. Pickel V.M. Evans C.J. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) whereas VAChT resides predominantly in synaptic-like microvesicle (30Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Localization of these proteins to distinct compartments presumably derives from different sorting signals. To assess the role of endocytosis in the distribution of VMAT2, we have produced mutations within the cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini and examined their effect on internalization. We find that an isoleucine-leucine pair within the COOH-terminal domain is required for the intracellular localization and efficient endocytosis of VMAT2. Similarly, a leucine-leucine pair within the COOH-terminal domain of VAChT also functions as an endocytic signal. These transporters thus use leucine-based sequences for efficient endocytosis. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in medium containing penicillin and streptomycin. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-H21 medium supplemented with 5% Cosmic calf serum and 10% equine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and were transfected by electroporation at 250 V and 500 microfarads as described previously (31Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-H21 medium with 10% Cosmic calf serum and were transfected with 10 μg of DNA per 15-cm plate by electroporation at 300 V and 950 microfarads in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 5% Cosmic calf serum and were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). For CHO transfection, 0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE in 20 μl of Opti-MEM media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature. 500 μl of Opti-MEM media was then added and the lipid-DNA complexes were transferred to cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After incubation of the cells at 37 °C for 6 h, an equal volume of Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% Cosmic calf serum without antibiotics was added. Following overnight incubation, the media was removed and replaced by regular CHO cell media. All cell lines were assayed 1.5 to 3 days after transfection. Mutagenesis was performed either by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or by the Kunkel method (32Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using single-stranded DNA prepared according to Ref. 33Tan P.K. Howard J.P. Payne G.S. J.

The dideoxy sequencing method was used to verify all the desired mutations and to exclude unwanted mutations. cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To facilitate the subcloning of VMAT2 mutants, we used a cDNA with two silent mutations that create aBglII and a SalI site at nucleotides 440 and 1302, respectively (34Finn III, J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A sequence encoding the hemaglutinin epitope, YPYDVPDYA, was inserted after the codon for glycine 96 in the VMAT2 cDNA (35Krantz D.E. Peter D. Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6752-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and after the codon for glycine 105 in the VAChT cDNA (28Roghani A. Feldman J. Kohan S.A. Shirzadi A.

The MAc chimeric transporter was produced by first using PCR to introduce a ClaI site at nucleotide 1450 of the VMAT2 cDNA. A PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1493–1860 of VAChT cDNA was then subcloned into the junction usingClaI and XbaI, replacing nucleotides 1456–1637 of VMAT2. This construct encodes amino acids 1–461 of VMAT2 (the NH2-terminal and 12 transmembrane domains) followed by the COOH-terminal residues 460–530 of VAChT. The Tac chimeras were produced by first using PCR to introduce anXbaI site at nucleotide 982 within the Tac (interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit) cDNA (36Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Crabtree G.R. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Robb R.J. Kronke M. Svetlik P.B. Peffer N.J. Waldmann T.A. Greene W.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) (a gracious gift of Maria Warmerdam and Warner Greene, University of California, San Francisco). PCR fragments from either VMAT2 or VAChT were then subcloned into this site using XbaI. All chimeras encode the full-length unmodified Tac protein fused either to the VMAT2 COOH terminus beginning with Lys-477, the VAChT COOH terminus beginning with Arg-479, or the 8 amino acid peptides corresponding to the VMAT2 leucine-based endocytosis motif. The transport activity of VMAT2 mutants was measured in membranes from COS1 cells. One day before membrane preparation, the medium of transfected cultures was replaced by fresh medium. To prepare membranes, cells from a 10-cm plate at 80% confluency were washed in calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS), detached from the plate with trypsin in CMF-PBS, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 200 μl of cold 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose containing 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The cell suspension was then disrupted in a chilled water bath sonicator (Branson, Danbury, CT) at medium intensity for 30 s and the cell debris removed by sedimentation at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was then transferred to a fresh tube. To measure transport activity, the uptake of [1,2-3H]serotonin (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) was assayed as described previously (34Finn III, J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using 10 μl of PNS. For immunoblotting, 50 μl of PNS from the transport assay was sedimented at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 3 × SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and 100 μg separated by electrophoresis through 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and HA-tagged VMAT2 visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using monoclonal anti-HA.11 antibodies (Babco, Berkeley, CA) at a 1:2000 dilution and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:2000 (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Immunofluorescence was performed using transfected PC12 or CHO cells grown to 20–50% confluence on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. For steady-state localization, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, at 4 °C for 20 min and permeabilized at room temperature for 40 min in CMF-PBS containing 0.02% saponin, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 1% fish skin gelatin (IF buffer). Cells were then incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-HA.11 antibodies diluted 1:250, polyclonal anti-VMAT2 antibodies diluted 1:100 (39Peter D. Liu Y. Sternini C. de Giorgio R. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), or polyclonal anti-VAChT antibodies diluted 1:500–1,000 (30Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in IF buffer. After three 10-min washes in IF buffer, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine (ICN/Cappell, Costa Mesa, CA) at 1:250 in IF buffer. Cells were then washed twice in IF buffer for 10 min each, rapidly rinsed twice in PBS, and the coverslips mounted in Slowfade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). To assess endocytosis, intact cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with monoclonal anti-HA or monoclonal anti-interleukin-2 (Tac) antibodies (Babco) diluted 1:250 in standard medium, and then washed three times in ice-cold PBS. The cells were then either fixed as described above or incubated in medium at 37 °C for 1 h before fixation. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were incubated with polyclonal antibodies to VMAT2 or VAChT followed by simultaneous incubation with FITC-conjugated antibodies to mouse Ig and rhodamine-conjugated antibodies to rabbit Ig. The mounted coverslips were examined by epifluorescence at × 400 magnification. The internalization assay was performed as described previously (37Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Affinity-purified monoclonal HA.11 antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co.) was biotinylated using the Molecular Probes FluoReporter mini-biotin XX protein labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The wells of 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc, Thousand Oaks, CA) were coated for 3 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) diluted 1:1000 in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6. After rinsing twice in PBS, the wells were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2% BSA (blocking buffer) and stored at 4 °C. To measure endocytosis, each 15-cm plate of transiently transfected COS1 cells at 80–90% confluence was rinsed in CMF-PBS and incubated for 5 min in CMF-PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. After addition of an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-H21 medium containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, and 0.2% BSA (SFM), the cells were harvested mechanically, sedimented at 1000 rpm for 3 min in a table top centrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA), resuspended in 1 ml of SFM prewarmed to 37 °C and transferred to 1.5 ml in Eppendorf tubes. 100 μl of biotinylated HA antibody (25 μg/ml) in SFM was then added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C on a rotator (Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). At various times after addition of the antibody, a 200-μl cell suspension was transferred to pre-chilled Eppendorf tubes containing 5 μl of 1 m sodium azide and 5 μl of 1 m sodium fluoride to arrest endocytosis. The cells were then pelleted, the unbound antibody removed by washing in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2% BSA, and divided in two equal aliquots. One aliquot was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in 0.1 ml of PBS, 0.2% BSA while the other aliquot was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotator with 0.1 ml of PBS, 0.2% BSA containing 50 μg/ml avidin to sequester cell surface-associated biotin. After this treatment, 10 μl of 0.5 mg/ml biocytin in PBS, 0.2% BSA was added and the cells incubated on the rotator for an additional 15 min. The cells were then solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of blocking buffer and 90 μl was transferred in duplicate to the ELISA plates for an overnight incubation at 4 °C. The next day, the wells were washed twice in PBS, once in blocking buffer for 5 min, twice more in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted 1:5000 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). After washing in PBS, 0.2% BSA, blocking buffer and PBS, 0.2% BSA, the wells were incubated for 2 min in 200 μl of 2 mm o-phenyldiamine-HCl and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, 27 mm sodium citrate. 50 μl of sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction and the absorbance at 490 nm determined using a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Absorbance readings for each sample were quantified from standard curves of biotinylated HA antibody on each ELISA plate using the SOFTmax PRO software program (Molecular Devices). Standard curves showed linearity up to 40 ng, and the amount of antibody associated with transfected cells not treated with avidin ranged from 5 to 20 ng. Control cells transfected with vector alone bound 0.2–1 ng of antibody. The percentage of internalized biotinylated antibody was calculated using the equation: [(Ca −Va)/(Ct −Vt)] × 100, where Ca andCt are amounts of antibody associated with transfected cells incubated with and without avidin, respectively, andVa and Vt the amounts of antibody associated with control cells incubated with and without avidin. To identify the sequences in VMAT2 responsible for internalization, we produced deletions and point mutations in the cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini (Fig. 1 A). Since COOH-terminal truncations eliminate the epitope recognized by available VMAT2 antibodies (39Peter D. Liu Y. Sternini C. de Giorgio R. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we inserted a hemaglutinin (HA) epitope tag into the large lumenal loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 (35Krantz D.E. Peter D. Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6752-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and used this tagged gene to produce all of the VMAT2 constructs (Fig. 1 A). Importantly, the HA tag neither perturbs the activity of VMAT2 nor affects its subcellular localization in PC12 cells. 2P. K. Tan, C. Waites, Y. Liu, D. E. Krantz, and R. H. Edwards, unpublished observations. The lumenal orientation of this epitope also enables us to monitor plasma membrane localization and endocytosis of the wild type and mutant proteins. Fig. 1 A lists the informative mutations and summarizes the findings. To assess the effect of the mutations on VMAT2 processing, we analyzed the expression and activity of VMAT2 mutants from extracts of transiently transfected COS1 cells. Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 A) reveals low and high molecular weight forms of VMAT2 (lanes 2–7) that are absent from untransfected cells (lane 1). The smaller 55-kDa form of wild type VMAT2 (lane 2, upper arrow) is sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H)2 and so presumably resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the larger 75-kDa species (arrowhead) is resistant to endo H digestion, indicating residence in post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments. Point mutations do not alter the mobility or amount of both VMAT2 species (L484A, lane 7). As anticipated, small deletions (lanes 3 and 6) increase slightly the mobility of the larger as well as smaller species (middle arrow) and larger deletions (lanes 4 and 5) increase the mobility further (lower arrow). However, the larger truncations also appear to reduce the amount of the larger species relative to the smaller (lanes 4 and 5, arrowhead), suggesting impaired transit through the endoplasmic reticulum. Functional analysis shows that all the mutants retain serotonin transport activity (Fig. 2 B), indicating that at least a fraction of each folds normally, exits the endoplasmic reticulum and sorts to an acidic compartment such as endosomes that can support function (25Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Consistent with the impaired processing of the larger truncations 476* and 2-18Δ/476*, these mutants exhibit reduced activity (Fig. 2 B). However, the reduced activity observed for many of the mutants may also result from impaired internalization. Since mutants defective in endocytosis should accumulate at the cell surface, we first examined the distribution of VMAT2 mutants in transfected PC12 cells. Taking advantage of the lumenal orientation of the epitope tag, we used a monoclonal HA antibody to detect cell surface VMAT2 in intact cells (Fig. 3, panels B, D, F,and G). After incubation with the HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with polyclonal VMAT2 antibodies to identify transfectants (Fig. 3,panels A, C, and E), followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies. Cells expressing wild type VMAT2 (Fig. 3 A) show faint or absent cell surface staining (Fig. 3 B), consistent with previous results indicating that VMAT2 has a predominantly intracellular localization (25Liu Y.

Deletion of the NH2 terminus (2–18Δ) does not affect this localization (data not shown), suggesting that this domain lacks signals for endocytosis. In contrast, deletion of the COOH-terminal 39 amino acids of VMAT2 (476*) results in high levels of expression at the cell surface (Fig. 3 G). To locate the endocytic signal within the COOH terminus, we examined mutants with smaller deletions. A mutant lacking the last 31 residues of the COOH terminus (484*) is not detectable at the plasma membrane (data not shown), suggesting that the region present in this mutant but absent from 476* contain an endocytosis signal. Indeed, the internal deletion 476–484Δ (Fig. 3 C) appears at high levels on the cell surface (Fig. 3 D). Since the 9 residues deleted in this mutant (AKEEKMAIL, Fig. 1 B) contain an isoleucine-leucine sequence that resembles leucine-based endocytosis motif, we replaced both residues with alanine. This double point mutant (I483A/L484A, Fig. 3 E) also occurs at high levels on the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 F). Since VMAT2 resides in endocytic compartments in non-neuronal cells (25Liu Y. Peter D.

PCC 6803 cells results in the loss of photosystem II activity, which can be repaired via de novosynthesis of the D1 (and D2) reaction center subunits. In this study, we investigated the effect of UV-B irradiation on the transcription of the psbA2 and psbA3 genes encoding identical D1 proteins. We show that UV-B irradiation increases the level ofpsbA2 mRNA 2–3-fold and, more dramatically, it induces a 20–30-fold increase in the accumulation of the psbA3mRNA even at levels of irradiation too low to produce losses of either photosystem II activity or D1 protein. The induction ofpsbA3 transcript accumulation is specific for UV-B light (290–330 nm). Low intensity UV-A emission (330–390 nm) and white light induce only a small, at most, 2–3-fold enhancement, whereas no effect of blue light was observed. Expression patterns of chimeric genes containing the promoter regions of the psbA2,psbA3 genes fused to the firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene indicate that (i) transcription ofpsbA2/luc and psbA3/luc transgenes was elevated, similarly to that of the endogenous psbA genes, by UV-B irradiation, and that (ii) a short, 80-base pairpsbA3 promoter fragment is sufficient to maintain UV-B-induced transcription of the luc reporter gene. Furthermore, our findings indicate that UV-B-induced expression of thepsbA2 and psbA3 genes is a defense response against UV-B stress, which is regulated, at least, partially at the level of transcription and does not require active electron transport.

PSII is a large pigment-protein assembly embedded in the thylakoid membrane. Inhibition of PSII activity by UV-B radiation is accompanied by the degradation of the D1 and D2 protein subunits (15Trebst A. Depka B. Z.

Styring S. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 1-81Crossref Google Scholar). Photoheterotrophic cyanobacterium species are very useful model organisms for studying the adverse effects of UV-B irradiation on the activity of PSII because (i) cyanobacteria were among the earliest oxygenic photosynthetic organisms that were exposed early in their evolution to UV-B fluxes much higher than the relatively low present day UV levels (20Kasting J.F. Science. 1993; 259: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), and (ii) they have evolved efficient mechanisms to cope with the stress of UV exposure (21Castenholz R.W. Garcia-Pichel F. Whitton B.A. Potts M. Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998Google Scholar). Indeed, in a previous study, we have provided evidence that intact Synechocystis 6803 cells are able to repair UV-B-induced damage of PSII via de novo synthesis of the D1 and D2 proteins (22Sass L. Spetea C. Máté Z. Nagy F. Vass I. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 55-62Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Just recently, Campbell et al. (23Campbell D. Erikson M.-J. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Clarke A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have reported that the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus appears to resist UV-B-induced PSII damage by selectively exchanging the PSII reaction center D1:1 protein (encoded by psbAI) for the different D1:2 form (encoded by thepsbAII and psbAIII genes). InSynechocystis 6803, the D1 protein is also encoded by three genes, psbA1, psbA2, and psbA3 (24Jansson C. Debus R.J. Osiewacz H.D. Gurevitz M. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Synechococcus,Synechocystis has only one form of the D1 polypeptide encoded by the psbA2 and psbA3 genes. The expression of both psbA2 and psbA3 is under light control (25Mohamed A. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Mohamed A. Eriksson J. Osiewacz H.D. Jansson C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), with psbA2 accounting for the majority (>90%) of the psbA transcripts under normal growths conditions (26Mohamed A. Eriksson J. Osiewacz H.D. Jansson C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The third psbA gene, psbA1, encodes a slightly different D1 protein (see Ref. 27Svensson B. Vass I. Styring S. Z. Naturforsch. 1991; 46C: 765-776Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but there are no indications that it is expressed in wild-type cells (25Mohamed A. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Mohamed A. Eriksson J. Osiewacz H.D. Jansson C. Mol. Gen.

In this study, we show that expression of the two activepsbA genes of Synechocystis 6803, is induced, although differentially, in response to UV-B light. UV-B-induced elevation of the expression of the endogenous psbA genes or the chimeric psbA/luc genes is regulated, at least partially, at the level of transcription, and elevation ofpsbA transcript levels does not require de novoprotein synthesis or active electron transport. These data suggest that transcriptionally regulated expression of the psbA2 and especially that of the psbA3 helps to maintain functional PSII under conditions of UV-B exposure and provide evidence for the role of duplicate psbA genes in cyanobacteria. Synechocystis 6803 cells were routinely grown at 40 μE m−2 s−1 light intensity in BG-11 medium at 30 °C, gently bubbled with air containing 5% CO2. Cells in the exponential growth phase (A730 nm of 0.6–0.8) were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g at room temperature. The chlorophyll a content was determined by methanolic extraction, and the cells were diluted to 30 μg of chlorophylla ml−1 by fresh BG-11 medium. UV-B light was produced by a Vilbert-Lourmat VL-215M lamp in combination with a 0.1-mm cellulose acetate filter (Clarfoil, Courtaluds Chemicals, UK) in order to screen out any UV-C contribution, below 290 nm. Under these conditions, our UV-B source provided maximal emission at 312 nm with 60 μE m−2s−1 intensity at the surface of the cell suspension. For some experiments, this intensity was decreased to 6 μE m−2 s−1 by applying eight layers of cellulose acetate filters. Due to the high optical density of the irradiated samples, the average UV-B irradiance within the cell suspension was attenuated by about a factor of 30, as calculated by taking into account the absorption by the optically dense sample according to Ref. 29Rontó G. Fekete A. Gáspár S. Módos K. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 3B: 497-507Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, corresponding to 2 and 0.2 μE m−2 s−1average intensity in the above irradiation protocols, respectively. These intensities are in the physiologically relevant range, because in full sunshine of about 2000 μE m−2 s−1 the UV-B contribution is approximately 7 μE m−2s−1. UV-B irradiation was performed in open, flat glass containers in which 330 ml of cell suspension (30 μg of cholorophyll/ml) of 15 mm depth was continuously stirred at room temperature. Before UV-B treatment, the cells were incubated under visible light of 40 μE m−2 s−1 intensity for 1 h. For monitoring the recovery process after UV-B exposure, the irradiated cells were transferred to visible light of 40 μE m−2 s−1 intensity and were kept at room temperature under continuous stirring. Steady-state rates of oxygen evolution were measured using a Hansatech DW2 O2 electrode at a light intensity of 1000 μE m−2 s−1 in the presence of 0.5 mm2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone as electron acceptor. D1 protein analysis was performed as described previously by Sass et al. (22Sass L. Spetea C. Máté Z. Nagy F. Vass I. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 55-62Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted as described by Nagy et al. (30Nagy F. Kay S.A. Chua N. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1-29Crossref Google Scholar). S1 nuclease protection analysis was performed according to Fejes et al. (31Fejes E. Páy A. Kanevsky I. Széll M. Adám É. Kay S. Nagy F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequences of the synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides employed in these assays were: (i) luc, 5′-ATAGAATGGCGCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCATTACAGCTTTACATAT-3′; (ii) psbA2, 5′-CGCTGTTGGAGAGTCGTTGTCATTTGGTTATAATTCCTTATGTATTTGTCGATGTTCAGATTGGAACTGACTAAACTTAGTC-3′; (iii) psbA3, 5′-CGCTGTTGGAGAGTCGTTGTCATTTGGTTATAATTCCTTATGTATTTGTCAATGTTCAAAGGATTTGGCCTCAAGCTC-3′. All DNA manipulations were performed according to Maniatiset al. (32Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic fragments containing sequences of thepsbA2 and psbA3 genes upstream of the ATG start codon (530 and 580 base pairs, respectively) were amplified by PCR, subcloned into a pKS plasmid containing the luc reporter gene (a gift from Dr. G. Neuhaus-Url) asSalI-NcoI fragments, and sequenced. The resultingpsbA2/luc and psbA3/luc chimeric genes were then inserted into the cyanobacterial expression vector plasmidpSB2A (a gift from Dr. Chauvat) and introduced intoSynechocystis cells. Transgenic cells were selected according to Kreps et al. (33Kreps S. Ferino F. Mosrin C. Gerits J. Mergeay M. Thuriaux P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 129-133Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 5′-Truncation of thepsbA3 promoter and replacement of the psbA2, psbA3 leader regions in the chimeric genes were also performed by PCR using specific synthetic oligonucleotides. For detailed sequence information about the promoter regions used in these experiments, see Refs. 34Ravnikar P.D. Debur R. Sevrinek J. Saetaert P. McIntosh L.

Repair of PSII via de novo synthesis of the D1 reaction center protein following its damage by UV-B radiation is a multistep process (22Sass L. Spetea C. Máté Z. Nagy F. Vass I. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 55-62Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we studied in detail the first step of this process and monitored changes in psbA transcript levels during UV-B exposure and throughout the following recovery period. To ensure gene-specific detection of the psbA2, psbA3 transcripts, synthetic oligonucleotides were employed in S1 nuclease protection assays. First, we showed that UV-B radiation elevated the expression level of the psbA genes. Fig. 1 A (lanes 1–3) shows that after 90 min of UV-B radiation the level of the accumulatedpsbA mRNA increased about 5–7-fold. More importantly, Fig. 1 B (lanes 1–3) indicates that the level ofpsbA3 mRNA was elevated about 20–25-fold. In contrast, Fig. 1 C (lanes 1–3) shows only a 2–3-fold induction of the psbA2. When the UV-B-irradiated cells were transferred back to white light of 40 μE m−2s−1, the amount of psbA3 transcripts decreased again dramatically, whereas the amount of psbA2 transcripts showed a more moderate, about 2–3-fold decrease (Fig. 1, Band C, lanes 4–6). In order to compare the relative abundance of the two psbAtranscripts with PSII activity, the autoradiograms shown in Fig. 1(B and C) were quantified by a phosphoimage analyzer and plotted together with changes in oxygen evolving activity and D1 protein amount. Fig. 1 D illustrates that during UV-B irradiation the rate of oxygen evolution, the measure of electron transport activity through PSII, and the net amount of the D1 protein declined in a closely parallel manner. After 180 min of UV-B irradiation, both the rate of oxygen evolution and the amount of the D1 protein decreased to about 15% of the respective control values. Under the same experimental conditions, the relative amount ofpsbA3 transcripts was increased 20-fold, as compared with that in nonirradiated control cells. After transferring the UV-B-irradiated cells to white light, the damaged PSII protein structure and the inhibited oxygen evolving activity were rapidly restored. During a 3-h recovery period, the rate of oxygen evolution and the amount of the D1 protein reached about 80% of the control values. In the recovery phase of the experiment, the relative amount ofpsbA3 transcripts gradually declined to levels close to those in the nonirradiated control cells. In contrast, the level ofpsbA2 transcripts changed only to a small extent during recovery and stayed at the slightly elevated level up to 3 h. The signal transduction pathway that leads to UV response of photosynthetic genes in cyanobacteria has not been studied in detail, and no specific UV-B receptor has been reported yet. However, data in the literature indicate that blue light of low fluence triggers a differential response in the psbA gene family inSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (36Tsinoremas N.F. Schaefer M.R. Golden S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16143-16147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to exclude any accidental effect of blue light, which might be emitted from our lamp, as well as to probe the effect of other spectral ranges on thepsbA3 gene response, six different irradiation protocols were compared. Exposure of cells, incubated at 10 μE m−2s−1 white light as control condition, to white light of 100 μE m−2 s−1 resulted in only a small increase in psbA3 transcript level (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Illumination of the cells with the same white light through a narrow band blue filter with maximal transmission at 450 nm (Fig. 2 B, dotted line) induced a response (lane 5) similar to that evoked by white light. Exposure of cells to UV-B light, whose irradiance profile is shown in Fig. 2 B(solid line a) alone (lane 4) or in combination with visible light (lane 3) led to the already described (Fig. 1) immense induction of the psbA3 gene. Combination of the UV-B light source with an UG-11 filter in order to cut all blue and visible light in the 390–690-nm range, producing the irradiance profile shown in Fig. 2 B, line b(dark shading), resulted in the same extent ofpsbA3 induction (lane 6) as nonfiltered UV-B light (lane 3). This excludes the possibility of an accidental blue component of our lamp being responsible for the induction of the psbA3 gene. The possible effect of the small but not negligible UV-A emission from the lamp in the 330–400-nm range was also checked. To this end, the UV-B component of the lamp was blocked by a 330-nm cut-off filter, which produced the irradiance profile shown by line c (light shading) in Fig. 2 B. Illumination with this light protocol resulted in some enhancement of the psbA3transcript level (lane 7), which was, however, much smaller than that induced by UV-B (plus UV-A) light (lane 4). These results demonstrate that the remarkable induction of psbA3gene expression observed in response to illumination with our UV source was specific for the UV-B component (290–330 nm) of the lamp, and unrelated to the small UV-A emission or any accidental blue (visible) illumination. In order to check the possible involvement of redox regulation in the UV-B-induced expression of psbA3, two different experimental approaches were used. In the first experiment, the intensity of UV-B light was decreased to 10% of that used in Fig. 1 and de novo protein synthesis was blocked by the translation inhibitor lincomycin. Under these conditions, the oxygen evolving activity was not decreased by up to 60 min of irradiation (data not shown). This indicates that the applied UV-B light did not damage the function and protein structure of PSII complexes, because in the absence of protein repair any damage should have led to a decreased oxygen evolution rate. Surprisingly, even this very low fluence of UV-B light was sufficient for a strong induction of the psbA3 gene after a 10-min exposure, as shown in Fig. 3 A. Because the very weak UV-B light applied (average intensity within the cell suspension 0.2 μE m−2 s−1), was certainly below the limit of driving PSII electron transport, this finding indicates that direct redox control via reduction of the plastoquinone pool is unlikely to play a role in UV-B induction of psbA3. This hypothesis was further corroborated by another experiment, showing that inhibition of electron transport through PSII by DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) did not affect the induction of psbA3 in response to UV-B light either. According to the data in Fig. 3 B, 60-min exposure of cells to UV-B light in the absence (lane 2) and in the presence of DCMU (lane 4) induced psbA3 expression to similar extents. To determine whether the UV-B-induced expression of the psbA3 and psbA2genes is regulated at the level of transcription as well as to identify important regulatory regions, a series of chimeric genes were constructed and their expression in transgenic cyanobacteria cells analyzed. These chimeric genes contained various fragments of the 5′-upstream regions of the psbA2 and psbA3 genes fused to the luc gene encoding firefly luciferase. For these experiments, a low intensity UV-B light was used in order to ensure that gene expression is monitored under conditions when damage to PSII is minimal. The most important results obtained are summarized in Fig. 4. It was first established that the induction of the psbA2 and psbA3 genes followed the same pattern as observed under strong UV-B light (shown in Fig. 1),i.e. psbA3 mRNA accumulation was enhanced to 20–30-fold by UV-B irradiation and declined gradually to control levels during a 4.5-h recovery period. In contrast, psbA2mRNA accumulation pattern showed only 2–3-fold changes either during induction or the recovery phase (Fig. 4, top left). The two chimeric reporter strains containing the longestpsbA2 and psbA3 upstream regions (including the 5′-nontranslated leader sequences) fused to the luc gene (psbA2/luc and psbA3/luc, respectively) exhibited the same expression patterns as observed for the endogenouspsbA genes, i.e. luc mRNA levels increased strongly upon UV-B exposure and declined under white light for the psbA3/luc construct and showed only minor fluctuations for the psbA2/luc construct. Truncation of thepsbA3 promoter to positions −160 and −80 (+1 being the transcription start site) had no effect on the UV-B-induced accumulation of the luc mRNA; however, the decline during recovery seemed to occur more rapidly. Furthermore, replacement of the psbA3 nontranslated leader sequence with that ofpsbA2 (in the psbA3/luc construct where thepsbA3 promoter is truncated to the −160 position) did not change significantly either the UV-B-induced accumulation or the following rapid decline of luc mRNA levels during the recovery period. Neither did the replacement of the leader sequence ofpsbA2 with that of psbA3 in thepsbA2/luc construct alter the expression pattern of thepsbA2/luc mutant. These data indicate that (i) UV-B-induced expression of psbA3 is regulated mainly at the transcription level, (ii) the majority of important cis-regulatory elements or site(s) mediating this defense response against UV-light stress should be located within a short 80-base pair promoter region, and (iii) the leader sequences of the psbA transcripts do not have important regulatory functions. In the present work, the effect of UV-B light on the expression of the Synechocystis psbA genes encoding the D1 protein was studied as an approach to gain information about the early steps of the protein repair process that was shown by Sass et al. (22Sass L. Spetea C. Máté Z. Nagy F. Vass I. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 55-62Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) to be required for restoring the activity of the UV-B damaged PSII. It was found that Synechocystis 6803 cells respond to UV-B by the differential expression of the two active psbA genes,i.e. transcript levels of psbA3 were increased 20–30-fold in contrast to those of psbA2, which were increased only 2–3-fold. The immense induction of the psbA3gene was highly specific for the UV-B spectral range (290–330 nm in our conditions), but this response was not influenced by the presence of background visible light (Fig. 2). Any major contribution topsbA3 induction by the low intensity UV-A component of our lamp or by an accidental blue illumination can be excluded. These data strongly suggest that up-regulation of the psbA3 gene can occur under natural conditions where UV-B light is always accompanied by visible illumination and provide the first demonstration for the existence of a specific UV-B-responsive gene inSynechocystis cells. Besides the different extent of induction under UV-B exposure, thepsbA2 and psbA3 transcript levels also showed different kinetic behavior during the course of UV-B and subsequent visible illumination. The 20–30-fold induction of psbA3 was more rapid, and after having reached a transient maximum exhibited a slight decline even under UV-B light. This decline was accelerated after transferring the cells to visible light, and the enhancedpsbA3 transcripts decreased close to control levels after a 2–3-h recovery period (Fig. 1). In contrast, the 2-fold induction ofpsbA2 appeared to be slower, and the slightly higher levels induced by UV-B exposure were maintained for a longer period of time under the conditions of recovery in visible light. These observations support the idea that the elevation of psbA3 transcript level is a rapid response to UV-B light, which may be very important for cyanobacterial cells in coping with the stress situation caused by enhanced UV-B fluxes from solar radiation. Our data on the chimeric reporter strains suggest that the UV-B-induced differential accumulation of the psbA2 and psbA3transcripts is likely regulated at the level of transcription for the following reasons: (i) the expression pattern of thepsbA2/luc and psbA3/luc transgenes is identical with those of the respective endogens and (ii) exchange of thepsbA2 and psbA3 leader sequences in the reporter gene constructs does not affect the expression pattern (Fig. 4), which places the site of the UV-B-responsive element(s) in thepsbA3 promoter. Furthermore, we show that truncation of thepsbA3 promoter region to −160 and −80 positions does not eliminate the basic UV-B response. These latest observations indicate that cis-regulatory element(s) responsible for UV-B-induced transcription should reside within the first 80 bases of thepsbA3 promoter. The psbA2 and psbA3 genes encode identical D1 polypeptides (the psbA1 gene is not expressed under conditions checked so far), and the physiological role of producing the same protein from two different genes is an intriguing open question. Based on our data, we postulate that the Synechocystis 6803 cyanobacterium regulates the repair of its-UV-damaged PSII reaction center by increasing the pool of psbA mRNA available for producing new D1 proteins by switching on the psbA3 gene, which we consider to be a UV-stress gene. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations; (i) under normal growth conditions, in visible light, the majority (at least 90%) of psbAtranscripts arises from the psbA2 gene (25Mohamed A. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Mohamed A. Eriksson J. Osiewacz H.D. Jansson C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and most likely the majority of the D1 protein is also translated from these messages; (ii) mainly because of the highly induced transcription of the psbA3 genes by UV-B irradiation, the overall level ofpsbA mRNA is about 5–7-fold higher in UV-B-irradiated as compared with nonirradiated cells (Fig. 1 A); and therefore it is likely (iii) that under these conditions the amount of D1 protein translated from the psbA3 message is also significantly increased. Considering, however, that even under the conditions of maximal UV-B induction the psbA3 andpsbA2 transcript levels are more or less identical, it follows that a considerable amount of D1 protein mobilized for repair should also be translated from the psbA2 mRNA. Therefore, we suggest that the psbA3 gene serves as a fast-reacting backup copy that can be relied on under conditions of UV-B stress in order to comply with the demand for higher D1 protein production. The utilization of duplicate psbA genes seems to be a common trait of various cyanobacteria. However, there are species, likeSynechococcus 7942, that contain three activepsbA genes, which produce two distinct forms of the D1 protein. The psbAI genes encodes the D1:1 protein, and thepsbDII and psbDIII genes encode identical D1:2 proteins (37Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to high intensity visible light, the constitutive D1:1 form is transiently replaced by the D1:2 form in the PSII reaction center (38Clarke A.K. Soitamo A. Gustafsson P. Oquist G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9973-9977Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, parallel with our work, Campbellet al. (23Campbell D. Erikson M.-J. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Clarke A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported that UV-B irradiation ofSynechoccocus 7942 cells also induces expression of the otherwise lowly expressed psbAII and psbAIIIgenes and leads to a transient exchange of D1:1 for D1:2 protein in the PSII reaction center. Furthermore, these authors found that constitutive over-expression of the psbAII andpsbAIII genes renders the cells to be UV-B resistant, whereas deletion of these genes results in an increased UV-B sensitivity. Based on these observations, Campbell et al. (23Campbell D. Erikson M.-J. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Clarke A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) concluded that resistance to UV-B irradiation is mediated by the exchange of the D1:1 and D1:2 forms in Synechococcus cells. This explanation is clearly not applicable to Synechocystiscells, where the various psbA genes encode identical D1 proteins. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we propose the following hypothesis. In both Synechococcus andSynechocystis cells, resistance to UV-B irradiation is brought about mainly by the selectively induced transcription of one or two of the psbA genes. Induced transcription leads to an increased psbA mRNA pool that is used by the translation machinery to produce large amounts of new D1 proteins to replace the damaged D1 molecules in the PSII. Accordingly, we suggest that UV-B resistance in different cyanobacterial species is controlled mainly at the level of transcription, and the exchange of the various forms of D1 proteins merely represents the ratio of various psbAmRNAs available for translation. Cyanobacteria were among the earliest oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, which most likely experienced much higher UV-B fluxes early in their evolution (2.5–0.6 × 109 years ago) than the relatively low present day UV levels. The development of a readily inducible spare gene copy for the D1 protein, located in the heart of the highly UV sensitive PSII complex, is most likely one of the strategies applied by cyanobacteria for coping with the stress of UV exposure. The fact that this gene arrangement has been maintained over 1–2 billion years indicates that UV stress has been a sustained condition during evolution. At present, the components of the signal transduction pathway or the UV-B receptor(s) mediating the UV-B-induced transcription of the psbA3, psbAII,psbAIII, or other genes in cyanobacteria are not known. Redox control of photosynthetic gene expression, includingpsbA, has recently been supported by various observations (41Allen J.F. Alexciev K. Kakansson G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 869-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), pointing to the central role of electron flow through PSII that modifies the redox level of the plastoquinone pool, which is then transmitted by a not yet clarified mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the induction of psbA3 in the absence of PSII electron transport, observed at very low levels of UV-B light, or in the presence of the electron transport inhibitor DCMU (Fig. 3). This argues against a direct involvement of redox signaling in the transcriptional activation of the psbA3 gene under UV-B light. From these data, it is more likely that a specific UV-B-related signal transduction pathway is involved in the induction ofpsbA3.

https://openalex.org/W2065726248,"In experiments at 13.5 gigapascals and 1030°C, the growth rate of wadsleyite, which forms from transformation of olivine, was substantially enhanced by the presence of water. Wadsleyite had a low dislocation density and subgrain boundaries in wet runs. Water enhanced the dislocation recovery in wadsleyite and therefore caused inelastic relaxation of the localized pressure drop associated with the transformation, resulting in an increase of the growth rate in wet runs. These results imply that even a small amount of water of 0.05 weight percent can weaken wadsleyite in the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2019653259,"The ability of metallothionein (MT) to modulate DNA binding by a two-finger peptide of Tramtrack (TTK), a CCHH zinc transcription factor, was investigated using metal-bound and metal-deficient forms of rabbit MT-2 and the TTK peptide. Thionein inhibited DNA binding by zinc-bound TTK, and Zn-MT restored DNA-binding by zinc-deficient apo-TTK. “Free” zinc at low concentrations was as effective as Zn-MT in restoring DNA binding by apopeptide but was inhibitory at concentrations equal to zinc bound to 2 mol eq and higher of Zn-MT. Substitution of cadmium for zinc reduced the affinity of the peptide for its DNA binding site. This effect was reversed by incubation with Zn-MT. The circular dichroic spectra of the TTK peptide indicated that zinc removal resulted in loss of α-helical structures, which are sites of DNA contact points. Reconstitution with cadmium resulted in stoichiometric substitution of 2 mol of Cd/mol of peptide but not recovery of α-helical structures. Incubation of Cd-TTK with Zn-MT restored the secondary structure expected for zinc-bound TTK.

Roles for MT in dynamic intermolecular metal exchange reactions are consistent with the high thermodynamic stability (3Kägi J.H.R. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III: Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 29-55Google Scholar) and high kinetic lability of its metal binding sites (4Nettesheim D.G.

Metallothionein II: Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 57-74Google Scholar). Metal exchange can also be facilitated by cellular redox couples such as GSH and GSSG (6Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 7Jacob C. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3489-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 8Jiang L.J. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An early focus on enzyme activation by Zn-MT implicated MT as a zinc donor to apometallic forms of metalloenzymes such as aldolase, thermolysin, and carbonic anhydrase (10Udom U.O. Brady F.O. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and pyridoxal kinase (11Churchich J.E. Scholz G. Kwok F. Bioch. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the effect of MTs on interactions between zinc transcription factors and their cognate DNAs implicate MTs in gene regulation. Incubation of metal-free thionein with CCHH zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 (12Zeng J. Heuchel R. Schaffner W. Kägi J.H.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and TFIIIA (13Zeng J. Vallee B.L. Kägi J.H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9984-9988Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) inhibits DNA binding, suggesting zinc abstraction by thionein as a mechanism for regulating gene expression. Reciprocal zinc exchange is suggested as a mechanism for regulating gene expression in a study in which Zn-MT and thionein could activate or inhibit DNA binding by the estrogen receptor (14Cano-Gauci D.F. Sarkar B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a CCCC zinc finger protein. Zinc transcription factors appear uniquely qualified as potential partner molecules in metal exchange reactions with MT. Reported stability constants for zinc binding by zinc finger peptides and proteins are in a similar range, i.e. within 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, as that of MTs (15Krizek B.A. Merkle D.L. Berg J.M. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 937-940Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Posewitz M.C. Wilcox D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Zeng J. Kägi J.H.R. Goyer R.A. Cherian M.G. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 333-347Google Scholar). Additionally, it appears that the kinetics for zinc exchange in these structures are also relatively rapid (18Vašák M. Bogumil R. Hadjiliadis N. Cytotoxic, Mutagenic and Carcinogenic Potential of Heavy Metals Including Metals Related to Human Environment. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1997: 195-215Google Scholar). Direct examination of the metal transfer process has shown that zinc can be transferred from an α-domain peptide of human MT-2 (α-hMT-2) to a peptide derived from the third finger of Sp1 (16Posewitz M.C. Wilcox D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and from rabbit Zn-MT-2 to the Zn-transcription factor GAL4 (19Maret W. Larsen K.S. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2233-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The rate constant for zinc exchange for GAL4 is rapid and similar to that of MTs (18Vašák M. Bogumil R. Hadjiliadis N. Cytotoxic, Mutagenic and Carcinogenic Potential of Heavy Metals Including Metals Related to Human Environment. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1997: 195-215Google Scholar, 19Maret W. Larsen K.S. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2233-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the functional consequences of the transfers were not addressed in these studies; considered together with the preceding examples, it appears that MT can modulate DNA binding of zinc transcription factors by regulating the availability of zinc. The notion that Zn-MT can modulate intracellular zinc availability can also be extended to interactions of zinc metalloproteins with toxic metals whose toxicity is thought to be due, in part, to their displacement of zinc (20Vallee B.L. Ulmer D.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 91-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). This condition is considered to be reversible through reactions with Zn-MT, which has the potential to abstract a toxic metal and donate an essential metal. Inhibition of carboxypeptidase activity by cadmium, for example, can be reversed by incubation with Zn-MT (21Huang P.C. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III: Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 407-426Google Scholar). This model for participation of MT in metal detoxification has been designated as a “rescue” or “repair” function that confers on Zn-MT an active, as opposed to a passive, role in the protective response to metals (21Huang P.C. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III: Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 407-426Google Scholar, 22Roesijadi G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113C: 117-123Google Scholar). It is known that cadmium binding to some zinc finger proteins reduces the affinity of the latter for their DNA-binding sites (23Hanas J.S. Gunn C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and that metal-metal exchange can occur between Zn-MT and zinc transcription factors bound to other metals, e.g. between nickel-bound Sp1–3 zinc finger peptide and zinc-bound α-hMT-2 peptide (16Posewitz M.C. Wilcox D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that Zn-MT can restore DNA binding activity to zinc transcription factors through metal-metal exchange reactions. Our study addressed the ability of thionein and Zn-MT to modulate sequence-specific DNA binding by a two-zinc finger peptide (24Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) of Tramtrack (TTK) (25Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Brown J.L. Sonoda S. Ueda H. Scott M.P. Wu C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) prepared in different metallation states (i.e. as zinc-bound, apo-TTK, and cadmium-bound states). TTK is a classical CCHH transcription factor (27Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) that suppresses genes involved in regulating development and differentiation inDrosophila (28Badenhorst P. Harrison S. Travers A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The zinc atom in a single zinc finger of TTK is tetrahedrally coordinated in a motif that includes an antiparallel β-sheet containing two cysteine ligands and a short α-helix containing two histidine ligands (29Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The amino acid to base contacts reside in the α-helix of the zinc finger motif (29Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Experiments tested the feasibility of 1) reciprocal zinc exchange between TTK and MT in modulating the DNA binding by TTK and 2) cadmium-zinc exchange between Cd-TTK and Zn-MT as a mechanism for cadmium detoxification. Band shift gels were used to assess the effect of various metallation states of MT and the TTK peptide on sequence-specific DNA binding of the latter. Changes in the secondary structure of the TTK peptide and interactions between MT and TTK were monitored by measuring CD. Stepwise substitution of cadmium for zinc in TTK was followed by electronic absorption spectroscopy. The results showed that the peptide structure was dependent on its metallation state and implicated the Zn-MT-thionein conjugate pair in modulation of DNA-binding activity and detoxification of cadmium. The TTK peptide Δ911zf was cloned in pET11a (24Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Inc). The peptide was extracted from inclusion bodies in the zinc-renatured form basically as described in Fairall et al.(24Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with HiTrap Heparin affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in either 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm ZnSO4 or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 0.1m NaCl, 50 μm ZnSO4. The TTK peptide was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient with 1 mNaCl in the respective limit buffer. Purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% or 10–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The purified peptide was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 0.1m NaCl, 50 μm ZnSO4 and stored at −80 °C following the addition of glycerol to a 10% final concentration. Prior to the addition of glycerol, an aliquot of the peptide was dialyzed against 5 mm ammonium acetate and analyzed by ESI-MS with a SCIEX APIII+ triple quadrupole instrument under both acidic (sample diluted 1:1 with 50% methanol, 1% formic acid) and neutral (5 mm ammonium acetate) conditions for confirmation of the expected masses of the apo form and zinc-bound form, respectively. For use in band shift gels, TTK peptide was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm mercaptoethanol to remove unbound zinc or processed as described below for preparation of the apo and cadmium forms. For preparation of apo-TTK, peptide was acidified to about pH 2 with the addition of 0.1 m HCl and applied to a Sephadex G-25 Fast Desalting Column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 0.01m HCl. Glassware and plasticware were rinsed with 0.01m HCl prior to use. The desalted peptide was analyzed for zinc by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the flame mode (Instrumentation Laboratory, IL Video 12) and determined to be very low in one preparation (0.03 mol of zinc/mol of TTK) and below detection limits (<0.005 mol of zinc/mol of TTK) in another. Cd-TTK was prepared from apo-TTK using a method originally described for the reconstitution of metallated MT from thionein (30Vašák M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This was accomplished by the addition of 2.1 mol eq of cadmium to apo-TTK in 0.01 m HCl, followed by the addition of 1 volume 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.1 m NaCl and adjustment to about pH 7.3 with 1m Tris-base. The sample was concentrated in a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) and washed with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.1 m NaCl. The Cd-TTK prepared in this manner contained 1.7–1.8 mol eq of cadmium. Solutions used in these procedures and those below for MTs were passed over Chelex for removal of metal ions and purged with argon. A similar procedure was used to reconstitute zinc-bound TTK from apo-TTK. TTK concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 276 nm and applying a molar extinction coefficient of 5800m−1 cm−1 (ExPASy ProtParam tool (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar)). Cadmium-induced rabbit MT-2 purified by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography (32Vašák M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was used for preparation of apo- and Zn-MT (30Vašák M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). ESI-MS under acidic conditions showed that this MT-2 preparation consisted of roughly equivalent amounts of MT-2a and MT-2c (nomenclature of Ref. 33Hunziker P.E. Kaur P. Wan M. Kanzig A. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MT concentrations were estimated from absorbance at 220 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 48,200 m−1cm−1 at pH 1 (30Vašák M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The zinc content of the reconstituted Zn-MT was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and confirmed as Zn7MT. Band shift gels were conducted basically as described by Fairall et al. (24Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), substituting 10% polyacrylamide gels for agarose and omitting EDTA from the electrophoresis buffer and zinc from the peptide-DNA binding buffer. The electrophoresis buffer was 45 mm Tris borate; the binding buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml poly[d(I-C)], and 10% glycerol in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Binding site DNA was added to each reaction to a final concentration of 10 nm. Oligonucleotides for the binding site DNA encoded the 18-base pair oligonucleotide, 5′­CTAATAAGGATAACGTCCG­3′3′­ATTATTCCTATTGCAGGCT­5′ SEQUENCE1(29Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and were purchased from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). To prepare binding site DNA, the top strand was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and then annealed with the complementary strand in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 n NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Unincorporated label and EDTA present in the manufacturer's end labeling kit were removed by desalting in a Bio-Gel P10 (Bio-Rad) spin column equilibrated in deionized water, followed by dialysis against water as a further precaution against the presence of EDTA. To assess the effect of Zn-MT and thionein on DNA binding by zinc-bound or apo- TTK peptide, Zn-MT or thionein was incubated with the peptide for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of other reagents. The binding site DNA was added last and allowed to react for 15 min before the sample was centrifuged and loaded on the gel. Apo-TTK peptide and thionein, originally dissolved in 0.01 m HCl, were neutralized with Tris-base immediately prior to the addition of other reagents. Gels were preelectrophoresed for at least 2 h at 200 V to constant current. Dried gels were visualized by autoradiography using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant program. Data were further analyzed using the NIH Image program. Apparent dissociation constants (K′d) (34Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were estimated for TTK, Cd-TTK, and Cd-TTK + 1× Zn-MT complexes with binding site DNA. K′d values for Cd-TTK and Cd-TTK + 1× Zn-MT were compared against the mean of four estimates for theK′d of TTK in two-tailed ttests. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 3 spectrophotometer in a 1-cm quartz cuvette with the sample in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mNaCl. CD measurements were performed on a Jasco (model J-715) spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm cylindrical quartz cuvette. The CD data were expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (degrees dmol−1 cm2) or as ellipticity (millidegrees) as appropriate. Secondary structure analysis of the CD spectra utilized the method of Yang (35Yang J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar) as implemented in the protein secondary structure estimation program provided by the manufacturer (Jasco). The program estimates the content of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and unordered structures by a least-square method. The CD spectra for the zinc-bound TTK and Cd-TTK were determined in 2.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl. The buffer also contained 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (previously determined not to alter the CD spectrum of TTK) in measurements of apo-TTK at neutral pH and in titrations of TTK with cadmium or an excess of zinc (from stock solutions of 10–100 mm CdCl2 or ZnCl2). The formation of the zinc-bound TTK during interactions between Cd-TTK and Zn-MT was monitored by CD spectroscopy. After first measuring the CD spectrum of a Cd-TTK sample, a concentrated solution of Zn-MT was added so that final concentrations of Zn2+ and Cd2+ were equimolar. The CD spectrum of the Cd-TTK/Zn-MT mixture was remeasured after incubation for various times. The CD spectrum was also determined for a similar concentration of Zn-MT to which was added Cd2+ at the same final concentration as that in the Cd-TTK sample. This spectrum was subtracted from that of the Cd-TTK/Zn-MT mixture to generate a difference spectrum reflecting the contribution of the newly formed zinc-bound TTK. The TTK peptide was isolated from inclusion bodies and then renatured and purified in the zinc-bound form. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a single band of the expected molecular weight. The reconstructed ESI-MS spectra obtained under acidic and neutral conditions indicated the presence of a single major species corresponding to the masses of the metal-free apo-TTK under acidic conditions (observed mass, 8023.5; expected mass, 8025.3) and TTK with two zinc ions (hereafter referred to as TTK) under neutral conditions (observed mass, 8151.7; expected mass, 8152.0). When dialyzed against ammonium acetate prior to ESI-MS, minor peaks indicative of ammonia adducts were also detected under both acidic and neutral conditions and presumed to be artifacts of reactions with ammonium acetate; these peaks were not detected if apo-TTK was prepared by acidification and desalting and analyzed directly without prior dialysis against ammonium acetate. In titrations of 10 nm binding site DNA with different concentrations of the TTK peptide, band shifts were concentration-dependent with no detectable shift due to TTK-DNA complex formation in the absence of the peptide and a maximal shift at 12 μm peptide, a 1200-fold molar excess over binding site DNA. On subsequent gels, binding site DNA alone and binding site DNA plus 12 μm TTK peptide were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The addition of unlabeled binding site DNA as a competitor resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the band shift (not shown) and confirmed the previously reported specificity of this peptide for the binding site DNA (24Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Incubation of TTK with thionein resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of TTK-DNA complex formation at concentrations of thionein ranging from 0 to 300 μm (Fig. 1). However, a relatively high concentration of 300 μm thionein, corresponding to a 25-fold molar excess of thionein to TTK, was required to achieve complete inhibition of the TTK-DNA complex formation. A concentration between 37.5 and 75 μmthionein, which was equivalent to 3.1- and 6.3-fold molar excess, was needed for 50% inhibition. These findings were in agreement with earlier reports (12Zeng J. Heuchel R. Schaffner W. Kägi J.H.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13Zeng J. Vallee B.L. Kägi J.H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9984-9988Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that thionein is capable of inhibiting DNA binding by Sp1 and TFIIIA, zinc transcription factors with similar CCHH motifs. Incubation of apo-TTK with Zn-MT restored full DNA binding to apo-TTK at concentrations of thionein as low as 3 μm. This corresponded to a 0.25 molar ratio of MT to TTK (Fig. 2) and a ratio of zinc binding sites in MT to those in TTK of 0.9. Because of the high avidity of apo-TTK for Zn2+, full inhibition of DNA-binding by apo-TTK alone was not observed here, despite efforts to minimize zinc background concentrations. We showed above that complete inhibition could be achieved in the presence of a strong competing ligand such as thionein. Analyses for zinc indicated very low or undetectable concentrations in purified apo-TTK samples and solutions used for the band shift gels; however, it was difficult to control zinc in all phases of running the band shift gels, and this, rather than nonspecific binding, probably accounted for the apparent basal DNA binding activity of the apo-TTK peptide In a parallel experiment (Fig. 3), apo-TTK was incubated with Zn2+ (as ZnSO4) and sulfhydryl (as 2-mercaptoethanol) concentrations equivalent to those in the Zn-MT concentrations above. At the lowest concentrations of 21 and 42 μm Zn2+, Zn2+ was as effective as Zn-MT in restoring DNA binding activity to apo-TTK. These Zn2+ concentrations were equivalent to molar ratios of 0.9 and 1.75 for added Zn2+ to the total number of zinc-binding sites on apo-TTK. This corresponded to the amount of Zn2+in 0.25 and 0.5 molar ratios for Zn-MT to apo-TTK in the experiment described above Thus, roughly equimolar concentrations of Zn2+ and zinc-binding sites on TTK were sufficient to fully activate TTK. An increase in Zn2+ concentrations to 168 μm and higher resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA binding. The presence of mercaptoethanol, a sulfhydryl reagent with lower affinity for zinc than MT, was not able to provide protection at concentrations equivalent to the sulfhydryl groups in MT. To assess the effect of cadmium substitution on DNA binding and whether incubation of Zn-MT with cadmium-reconstituted Cd-TTK has any effect, the apparent dissociation constant,K′d, for complex formation with DNA was estimated by analyzing a range of concentrations of TTK, Cd-TTK, and Cd-TTK + 1× Zn-MT in band shift gels. Four independent measurements were made for the K′d of TTK. Single lanes that showed responses at equivalent concentrations of 6 μm for TTK, Cd-TTK, and Cd-TTK + 1× Zn-MT were selected for presentation in Fig. 4. DNA binding by Cd-TTK (K′d = 5.3 μm) was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) in comparison with the TTK peptide bound to two Zn2+ ions (K′d = 0.5 μm ± 0.1 (S.D.; n = 4). This estimate ofK′d for TTK agreed with a previously reported value of 0.4 μm (24Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TheK′d for Cd-TTK, indicating a 10.6-fold weaker binding to binding site DNA, was considered conservative, due to the possibility that low levels of background Zn2+ in the band shifts may have contributed to the formation of a small amount of folded TTK as described for band shifts with apo-TTK. Incubation of Cd-TTK with equimolar Zn-MT reduced theK′d to 0.9 μm, which was not significantly different from that of TTK (p > 0.05). This restoration of DNA binding activity to the previously inhibited Cd-TTK was probably due to zinc-cadmium exchange and recovery of secondary structure to that expected for the zinc-bound TTK. The CD spectrum of the native TTK peptide at pH 7.4, with negative maxima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 5, solid line), was consistent with a peptide conformation with significant α-helical structure components. A structural composition of 34.5% α-helix, 36.5% β-sheet, and 29% random coil obtained by secondary structure analysis (35Yang J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar) of this CD spectrum agreed with the 33% α-helix and 30% β-sheet structure of TTK obtained by x-ray crystallography of the TTK-DNA complex (29Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of apo-TTK (Fig. 5,dashed line), with a negative maximum at about 204 nm, showed features mainly of β-sheet and random coil structure, with low α-helical content (below 10% in this case). The addition of Zn2+ to apo-TTK at neutral pH significantly increased the negative maximum at 222 nm, signifying an increased α-helical structure (not shown). When TTK was prepared by adding Zn2+to apo-TTK at pH 2 and neutralizing to pH 7.3, the CD spectrum of the zinc-reconstituted TTK (Fig. 5, dotted line) resembled that of the native TTK. Thus, the folding of the TTK zinc finger domains to the native structure was coupled to the binding of zinc, a property also reported for other zinc finger domain peptides (36Berg J. Godwin H.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The incubation of 11 μm TTK with 0.5, 1, and 2 mm Zn2+ resulted in little change in the CD spectrum (data not shown). Zinc to TTK ratios in this experiment corresponded to those at the highest Zn2+ concentrations in the band shift gel of Fig. 3. Thus, the inhibited band shift at high Zn2+ concentrations was probably caused by a polyelectrolyte effect, which prevented formation of TTK-DNA complexes or favored dissociation of TTK-DNA complexes, not by alterations in the secondary structure of TTK. The electronic absorption spectrum of the TTK peptide, with a maximum at 277 nm and a shoulder at 283 nm, is diagnostic of the high tyrosine content (4 Tyr) and the absence of tryptophan (Fig. 6). The binding of Cd2+ to Cys-thiolate ligands in peptides and proteins can be followed by monitoring the absorption intensity of the Cys-S-Cd(II) ligand-metal charge-transfer transitions between 240 and 250 nm (37Willner H. Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Biochemstry. 1987; 26: 6287-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,38Henehan C.J. Pountney D.L. Zerbe O. Vašák M.

Titration of TTK (Fig. 6 A, curve a) with Cd2+ (Fig. 6 A,curves b–e) resulted in incremental increases in the CysS-Cd(II) charge transfer transitions in the lower wavelength range of the absorption spectrum. The difference absorption spectra (Fig. 6 A, inset), obtained by s"

The translocase of theouter mitochondrial membrane (TOM) was characterized in fungi, and it was shown that TOM from yeast comprises nine different subunits. This publication is the first report on the preparation of the TOM complex from plant mitochondria. The protein complex from potato was purified by (a) blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and (b) by immunoaffinity chromatography. On blue native gels, the potato TOM complex runs close to cytochrome c oxidase at 230 kDa and hence only comprises about half of the size of fungal TOM complexes. Analysis of the TOM complex from potato by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis allows separation of seven different subunits of 70, 36, 23, 9, 8, 7, and 6 kDa. The 23-kDa protein is identical to the previously characterized potato TOM20 receptor, as shown by in vitro assembly of this protein into the 230-kDa complex, by immunoblotting and by direct protein sequencing. Partial amino acid sequence data of the other subunits allowed us to identify sequence similarity between the 36-kDa protein and fungal TOM40. Sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding the 7-kDa protein revealed significant sequence homology of this protein to TOM7 from yeast.

Functional implications of these findings are discussed. Most mitochondrial proteins are nuclear encoded, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and posttranslationally transported into the organelles (1Hauke V. Schatz G. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 103-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The transport of proteins into mitochondria relies on two prerequisites: (i) targeting information of the proteins destined for mitochondria, which in most cases is encoded by N-terminal extensions called presequences, and (ii) a protein import apparatus within the mitochondrial membranes that recognizes the targeting information and translocates proteins from the cytoplasm to their subcellular destination. Central components of the protein import apparatus are two polymeric protein complexes called the “translocase of the outer mitochondrialmembrane” (TOM) 1The abbreviations used are: TOM,translocase of the outer mitochondrialmembrane; TIM translocase of theinner mitochondrial membrane; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; OM, outer mitochondrial membrane; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; BN, blue native; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-tris(hy- droxymethyl)methylglycine. and the “translocase of the inner mitochondrialmembrane” (TIM) (3Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R100-R103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During protein transport, the translocases are believed to interact dynamically as most nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins must cross both mitochondrial membranes. The TOM complex was isolated from outer mitochondrial membranes fromNeurospora crassa and yeast (4Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner S. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The yeast translocase consists of nine subunits designated TOM72, TOM70, TOM40, TOM37, TOM22, TOM20, TOM7, TOM6, and TOM5 according to their calculated molecular masses (for nomenclature, see Ref. 7Pfanner N.

Five of these proteins (TOM72, TOM70, TOM37, TOM22, and TOM20) are involved in the recognition of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins on the surface of the organelles forming two heterodimeric receptors (TOM20-TOM22 and TOM37-TOM70/TOM72) (8Gratzer S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). TOM40 is the main component of the pore for the translocation of proteins across the outer mitochondrial membrane (4Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner S. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Baker K.P. Schaniel A. Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is associated with the three low molecular weight subunits: TOM7, TOM6, and TOM5 (12Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G.

The TOM complex from N. crassa has a similar subunit composition; TOM complexes from other organisms have not been characterized so far. In a structural sense, the TOM complex is a rather dynamic association of polypeptide components. The receptors are partially present within TOM complexes but also occur independently within the outer mitochondrial membrane. Consequently, it is a difficult task to purify this protein complex. The TOM complexes from yeast andNeurospora were prepared by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against individual subunits of the translocase (4Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner S. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Söllner T. Rassow J. Wiedmann M. Schlossmann J. Keil P. Neupert W. Pfanner N.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The overall molecular mass of the TOM complex fromNeurospora was estimated by gel filtration and lies in the range of 500 kDa (4Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner S. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Little is known about the transport of proteins into plant mitochondria. Some components of the protein import apparatus could be defined, namely the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which excises the presequences of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins upon their import into the organelles. In plants only is this enzyme membrane-bound and an integral part of the cytochrome creductase complex of the respiratory chain (15Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Eriksson A.C. Sjöling S. Glaser E. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, an additional processing activity in the soluble fraction of plant mitochondria was described, which might be distinct from the membrane-bound mitochondrial processing peptidase (18Szigyarto C. Dessi P. Smith K. Knorpp C. Harmey M.A. Day D.A. Glaser E. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mitochondrial heat stress proteins HSP70, HSP60, and HSP10 were characterized, which are involved in the terminal steps of protein transport into mitochondria (19Watts F.Z. Walters A.J. Moore A.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Prasad T.K. Stewart C.R. Plant Mol.

Finally, one component of the TOM complex, TOM20 from potato, has been characterized at the molecular level (22Heins L. Schmitz U.K. Plant J. 1996; 9: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TOM20 from potato is a 23-kDa protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane that exhibits significant sequence identity to the TOM20 proteins from fungi and mammals. Antibodies directed against potato TOM20 specifically inhibit protein transport into mitochondria, as demonstrated by in vitro import experiments (22Heins L. Schmitz U.K. Plant J. 1996; 9: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the purification of the TOM complex from potato by native gel electrophoresis and by immunoaffinity chromatography. The protein complex has a molecular mass of 230 kDa and comprises seven different subunits that are characterized by direct protein sequencing and by sequencing corresponding clones encoding a 7-kDa polypeptide. TOM20 forms part of this complex, as shown by in vitroassembly of this protein into the 230-kDa complex, by direct sequence determination and by immunoblotting. The TOM complex from potato has a unique subunit composition. Mitochondria from potato tuber were prepared on Percoll step gradients as described by Braun et al. (23Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) 0.1 mm PMSF was added to all buffers, and (ii) after the gradient centrifugation the organelles were washed and suspended in a buffer containing 0.4 m mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mmPMSF, and 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2. The isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 7.5 ml of swelling buffer (5 mm KiPO4, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.2)/g of organelles for 8 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the same volume of swelling buffer was added and mitochondria were ruptured in a Potter homogenizer. Separation of outer mitochondrial membranes (OM) and mitoplasts was achieved by sucrose step gradient centrifugation, as reported by Heins et al. (24Heins L. Mentzel H. Schmid A. Benz R. Schmitz U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26402-26410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One gram of potato mitochondria (100 mg of mitochondrial protein) yielded about 1 mg of OM protein. The OMs were stored in a buffer containing 10 mmEDTA, 0.4 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 100 mmMOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml at −80 °C. Starting material for the purification of the potato TOM complex by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 40-μl OM aliquots (200 μg of OM protein) per lane of the gels. The aliquots were diluted by 100 μl of double-distilled H2O; the OMs were sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min and resuspended in 75 μl of ACA buffer (750 mm aminocaproic acid, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0). Membrane proteins were solubilized by addition of 75 μl of ice-cold digitonin solution (10% digitonin, 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0), and insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were supplemented with 15 μl of Coomassie solution (750 mm aminocaproic acid, 5% Coomassie Blue) and directly loaded onto the gel. BN-PAGE was carried out as described previously (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar, 26Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The potato TOM complex forms a band at about 230 kDa, which is visible without staining. The band was cut out, and the protein complex was electroeluted in a buffer containing 25 mmTricine, 7.5 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm PMSF using the electroeluter from CBS Scientific Co. (Del Mar, CA). For molecular weight determination of the potato TOM complex, 7 mg of mitochondria (0.7 mg of mitochondrial protein) from potato were resuspended in 75 μl of ACA buffer (see above) and supplemented with either 25 μl of a 10% digitonin solution or 15 μl of a 10% laurylmaltoside solution. The solubilized protein complexes in both fractions were separated by BN-PAGE as described above and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes as outlined by Jänsch et al. (26Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The respiratory protein complexes were directly visible due to bound Coomassie Blue, whereas the potato TOM complex was identified by immunostaining. The size of the potato TOM complex was determined by comparison to the sizes of the well characterized respiratory protein complexes from potato. Antibodies directed against TOM20 from potato (22Heins L. Schmitz U.K. Plant J. 1996; 9: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) according to the supplier's instructions. Potato outer mitochondrial membranes prepared from 0.8 g of isolated organelles were sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 70,000 ×g for 90 min and resuspended in 375 μl of coupling buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Membrane proteins were solubilized by addition of 375 μl of ice-cold digitonin solution (10% digitonin, 20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), and insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. About 2 ml of the anti-TOM20-Sepharose were equilibrated in a column with coupling buffer. After applying the solubilized membrane proteins to the column, it was washed with coupling buffer and bound protein was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5). Eluted proteins were neutralized by addition of 400 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The proteins were precipitated by the Roti-Collect system (Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), supplemented with loading buffer and directly analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar). The TOM20 protein from potato was synthesized in vitro by the coupled transcription/translation system from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Mitochondria were prepared on Percoll step gradients as described above. For an assembly assay, 600 μl of mitochondria (10 mg of protein/ml) were combined with 2.4 ml of assembly buffer (0.25 m mannitol, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm malate, 2 mm NADH, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and 37.5 μl of radiolabeled TOM20 protein in transcription/translation lysate. The assembly mixture was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, resuspended in 600 μl of resuspension buffer (0.4 m mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) and supplemented with 3.4 ml of untreated potato mitochondria (10 mg of protein/ml) in the same buffer. Subsequently, outer mitochondrial membranes were prepared as described above and proteins were separated by two-dimensional BN/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany) and exposed on x-ray films. The subunits of the potato TOM complex were separated either by SDS-PAGE of the electroeluted protein complex or directly by electrophoresis of a BN gel stripe in a second gel dimension in the presence of SDS. Tricine-SDS-PAGE according to Schägger and von Jagow (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar) gives best resolution because the TOM complex contains several very small subunits with similar molecular masses. The separated TOM subunits were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and TOM20 was identified by immunostaining using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Bands corresponding to other TOM subunits were cut out from the blots and analyzed directly on a Procise-HT protein sequencer (model ABI 494A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). N-terminally blocked proteins were digested with endoprotease LysC, and the generated peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by direct protein sequencing. Clones encoding TOM7 from potato were isolated by probing a λ ZAP-II cDNA library with a mixture of 23-nucleotide oligomers that were made degeneratively to an amino acid sequence close to the N terminus of the protein (Lys-Gly-Lys-Asn-Thr-Lys-Phe). Compared with the protein complexes of the respiratory chain, the TOM complex must be considered to be a dynamic supramolecular structure. Consequently, classical biochemical approaches to isolate the TOM complex has only had limited success. Recently, BN-PAGE was shown to be an alternative approach to characterize the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane from yeast (28Dekker P.J.T. Müller H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE was first used by Schägger and von Jagow (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar) to isolate the respiratory protein complexes from beef and yeast and was later adapted to characterize the respiratory and photosynthetic protein complexes from plant organelles (26Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29Kügler M. Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 35-44Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Prerequisite for the isolation of the potato TOM complex was a fraction containing highly pure outer mitochondrial membranes, which was generated as described in the experimental procedures. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of potato outer mitochondrial membranes allows to separate about 30 different proteins (Fig. 1 C). The two most dominant bands represent two isoforms of the pore-forming protein “porin,” which run at 30 kDa on Tricine SDS gels (34–36 kDa on glycine SDS gels according to Laemmli; Ref. 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) and which have been characterized previously (24Heins L. Mentzel H. Schmid A. Benz R. Schmitz U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26402-26410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BN-PAGE of digitonin-lysed outer mitochondrial membranes from potato revealed the presence of one dominant protein complex, which, under the conditions applied, migrates in the central part of the gel (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore some faint bands with higher electrophoretic mobility are visible on the BN gel. To characterize the subunit compositions of the separated protein complexes, a strip of the blue native gel was transferred horizontally onto a second gel dimension and electrophoresed in the presence of SDS. On Tricine SDS gels, the dominant protein complex could be resolved into seven subunits with apparent molecular masses of 70, 36, 23, 9, 8, 7, and 6 kDa (Fig. 1 B). If analyzed by the glycine SDS-PAGE system, the apparent molecular mass of the 36-kDa protein lies at 39 kDa. The subunit composition resembles the composition of the TOM complex from fungi, which was characterized previously. The protein complexes with higher electrophoretic mobility on the BN gel turned out to be aggregates of varying numbers of porin proteins (Fig. 1 B, proteins number 8). Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a suitable method for the size determination of protein complexes solubilized by laurylmaltoside (31Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). To determine the apparent molecular weight of the putative potato TOM complex, isolated mitochondria from potato were treated with laurylmaltoside and directly analyzed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). The separated protein complexes were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and stained by immunoblotting. The respiratory protein complexes of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which have well defined apparent molecular sizes, could be identified. An antibody directed against the potato TOM20 protein specifically reacted with a protein complex migrating close to the cytochrome c oxidase complex at about 230 kDa. Electrophoresis of the same sample on a second gel dimension in the presence of SDS revealed that the immunoreactive protein complex had an identical protein composition as described above for the putative TOM complex from potato after digitonin solubilization (data not shown). Determination of the molecular mass of the potato TOM complex after solubilization of mitochondria with digitonin gave similar results (Fig. 2 B). The separation of the respiratory protein complexes is slightly different if compared with the separation of laurylmaltoside lysed mitochondria. However, the TOM complex again migrates close to the cytochrome c oxidase at 230 kDa. So far, the TOM20 protein from potato is the only component of the preprotein translocase from plants that has been characterized at the molecular and physiological level (22Heins L. Schmitz U.K. Plant J. 1996; 9: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To prove that the TOM20 protein forms part of the putative potato TOM complex, antibodies directed against pTOM20 were used to immunoaffinity-purify the proteins of a fraction containing outer mitochondrial membranes from potato. The antibody was covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose and immunoaffinity chromatography was carried out using a small column. Bound protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine at pH 2.5 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The eluted fraction contains predominant proteins of 36, 30, 23, 9, 8, 7, and 6 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2). The 23-kDa protein was immunologically identified to be TOM20 (Fig. 3, lane 3), and the 30-kDa protein turned out to be the most abundant protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, porin (data not shown). The remaining proteins have identical molecular masses as the subunits of the potato TOM complex after purification by BN-PAGE. Hence, TOM20 seems to form part of the TOM complex from potato. In a second approach to monitor the presence of TOM20 in the 230-kDa protein complex of the outer mitochondrial membrane from potato,in vitro assembly of the TOM20 protein into the 230-kDa complex was tested. Radiolabeled TOM20 from potato was incubated with isolated mitochondria as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequently, the outer mitochondrial membrane was prepared and the proteins of this fraction were analyzed by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Indeed, the 23-kDa TOM20 protein from potato assembles into the 230-kDa protein complex as documented in Fig. 4. We conclude that the 230-kDa protein complex in the outer membrane from potato mitochondria corresponds to the preprotein translocase designated “TOM” in fungi. In an attempt to characterize the components of the potato TOM complex, the proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane from potato were separated by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE and blotted onto filter membranes. The subunits of the TOM complex were visualized by staining with Ponceau S, cut out, and subjected to direct protein sequencing. Subunits blocked for direct protein sequence determination were digested with endoprotease LysC to generate peptides, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and also analyzed by direct protein sequence determination. Table I summarizes the obtained amino acid data for the 36-, 23-, 9-, 8-, 7-, and 6-kDa subunits of the potato TOM complex. As expected, the peptide sequence for the 23-kDa subunit is identical to an internal amino acid stretch of potato TOM20. The peptide sequences for the 36-kDa protein exhibit some sequence similarity to the published TOM40 sequences from fungi. Sequence conservation was highest between peptide P1 and the fungal TOM40 proteins (Fig. 5). The partial sequence data generated for the 9-, 8-, 7-, and 6-kDa proteins of the potato TOM complex did not exhibit any significant sequence similarity to components of the TOM complex from other organisms.Table IPartial amino acid sequences of the TOM subunits from potatoNo. aThe proteins are numbered according to Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab In order to obtain complete sequences for the 9-, 8-, 7-, and 6-kDa proteins of the potato TOM complex, degenerate oligonucleotides designed from amino acid stretches of each protein were used to screen a cDNA library for potato tuber and to isolate corresponding clones. Screening with an oligonucleotide deduced from the N-terminal sequence of the 7-kDa protein of the potato TOM complex led to the isolation of two clones designated pTOM221 and pTOM222. Both clones contained inserts of 653 base pairs with identical sequences (Fig. 6). The inserts include an open reading frame of 216 base pairs encoding a protein of 72 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 7716 Da. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the deduced protein is identical to the sequence directly determined by cyclic Edman degradation of the 7-kDa protein of the potato TOM complex, with the exception of the initiator methionine, which is absent in the mature protein. Comparison between the complete amino acid sequence of the potato 7-kDa protein and the sequence entries of protein data bases revealed striking similarities to the sequence of the TOM7 protein from yeast (Fig. 7). The overall sequence identity lies at 25% and sequence similarity at 50%. Interestingly, the sequence conservation is rather low in the N-terminal half of the protein but high in the C-terminal half. We conclude that the 7-kDa protein of the potato TOM complex is the plant counterpart to TOM7 from yeast. Further analyses with nucleotide sequence data bases led to the discovery of some unidentified plant sequences, which encode proteins with high homology to the sequence of potato TOM7, including the expressed sequence tag D22755 from rice and L35838 from cabbage (Fig. 7). On the basis of amino acid sequences for TOM7 proteins from five different organisms, a consensus sequence for TOM7 could be defined, which should be useful for analysis of the function of TOM7 by site-directed mutagenesis.Figure 7The potato 7-kDa protein is homologous to yeast TOM7.

The subunit composition resembles the one reported for fungal TOM complexes. TOM20 from potato, a well defined receptor for the transport of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins into mitochondria, forms part of the 230-kDa complex as shown by in vitro assembly of this protein into the 230-kDa complex, by direct protein sequencing and by immunoblotting. Hence, the 230-kDa complex represents the potato TOM complex. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed previously to analyze the TOM complex from yeast (14Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Dekker P.J.T. Müller H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The procedure allows separation of two subcomplexes of the yeast TOM complex of 400 and 120 kDa. The larger subcomplex contains TOM40, TOM20, TOM5, and presumably TOM22, TOM7, and TOM6, whereas the smaller subcomplex contains TOM70 and possibly TOM37, as shown by immunoblotting. In contrast, the potato translocase seems to be stable during solubilization and native gel electrophoresis as no subcomplexes or singular subunits of the TOM complex are visible on the two-dimensional gels (Fig. 1). The TOM complexes from yeast and Neurospora were isolated by immunoprecipitations using antibodies against individual subunits of the TOM complex (4Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner S. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Moczko M. Dietmeier K. Söllner T. Segui B. Steger H.F. Neupert W. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, immunoprecipitation often does not lead to biochemically pure proteins or protein complexes because the antibodies can be present in the final fractions and because cross-reactions can occur. In contrast, antibodies are not needed during blue native gel electrophoresis and the capacity of this procedure to resolve proteins is high. BN-PAGE seems to be a powerful tool for the isolation of the potato TOM complex. The 230-kDa protein complex can be electroeluted from BN gels and used for further investigations. In fact, it was shown that the protein complexes of the respiratory chain from beef and potato are physiologically active after electroelution from BN gels (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar, 32Brumme S. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13143-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This also may be valid for the potato TOM complex after purification by BN-PAGE and electroelution. Sequence analyses of the subunits of the potato TOM complex allowed us to relate its subunits to the components of the TOM complex from yeast. The 23-kDa protein is homologous to fungal TOM20 and the 7-kDa protein to TOM7 from yeast. The 36-kDa protein from potato exhibits sequence similarity to fungal TOM40. It was previously shown that antibodies directed against TOM40 from Neurospora cross-react with a 42-kDa protein of the outer membrane of Vicia fabamitochondria and that antibodies against this 42-kDa protein inhibit protein import into mitochondria from V. faba in in vitro import experiments (33Perryman R.A. Mooney B. Harmey M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most likely, the 36-kDa protein from potato and the 42-kDa protein from V. faba are homologues. Furthermore, we speculate that the 70-kDa protein of the TOM complex from potato is the counterpart of TOM70 from fungi and that two of the three unidentified small proteins represent the TOM5 and TOM6 proteins. Based on these conclusions, the potato TOM complex differs in several respects from the translocase from fungi: (i) the TOM complex from potato is only about half the size of the fungal TOM complex, (ii) the TOM complex from potato comprises four instead of three low molecular mass subunits, and (iii) two of the four receptor proteins defined for yeast (TOM22 and TOM37) seem to be absent in potato. However, it cannot be excluded that the TOM complex from potato contains additional subunits in vivo that are lost during solubilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane with digitonin or during native gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, there are several arguments indicating that the TOM complex from potato was isolated in complete form; (a) different concentrations of digitonin during solubilization always led to the isolation of a protein complex with the same subunit composition (data not shown), (b) solubilization of outer mitochondrial membranes from potato with laurylmaltoside also gave identical results, and (c) two different purification procedures for the potato TOM complex (BN-PAGE and immunoaffinity chromatography) led to the isolation of a protein complex with identical subunit composition. Furthermore, the TOM37 protein has so far only been identified in yeast but not inNeurospora. Hence, the occurrence of two heterodimeric receptors (one of which is composed of the TOM20 and TOM22 proteins, the other of the TOM37 and TOM70/TOM72 proteins; see Refs. 8Gratzer S. Lithgow T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) might be an unique feature of yeast mitochondria. Possibly protein transport into plant mitochondria is based on the presence of two monomeric receptors of 23 kDa (TOM20) and 70 kDa (TOM70?). However, further experiments are needed to precisely define the structure and function of the plant TOM complex, including isolation of the translocase from other organisms. Preliminary characterization of the TOM complex fromArabidopsis thaliana also reveals the presence of four low molecular mass subunits. 2L. Jänsch, U. K. Schmitz, and H.-P. Braun, manuscript in preparation. The small proteins of the TOM complex are best characterized in yeast (13Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6196-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of them are associated with TOM40 forming part of the “general insertion pore” for the transfer of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins into mitochondria. TOM5 functionally links the receptors and TOM40, whereas TOM6 and TOM7 have antagonistic functions in the modulation of the assembly and dissociation of the TOM machinery: TOM6 supports the binding of the receptors with TOM40, whereas TOM7 destabilizes the same interactions. (If TOM7 from potato has a similar function, its presence within the 230-kDa TOM complex together with TOM20 and TOM70 would add a further argument supporting the absence of heterodimeric receptors in plants in vivo.) The mature TOM7 proteins from potato and yeast both lack the N-terminal methionine and have slightly different calculated molecular masses of 7.6 kDa (potato) and 6.7 kDa (yeast). The size difference is due to an N-terminal extension of the potato protein, which is very rich in basic amino acids (Fig. 7). TOM7 from potato is more hydrophilic than the corresponding yeast protein. Most striking is the presence of 11 lysines in the potato protein (yeast: 2 lysines). Similarly to TOM7 from yeast, the potato protein lacks a putative hydrophobic membrane-spanning helix and most likely is bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane by protein-protein interactions. Identification of some additional TOM7 sequences from plants allowed to define a consensus sequence for TOM7 proteins. There are two highly conserved amino acid stretches within the C-terminal half of TOM7 proteins (-H-Y-G-(W/F)-I-P-(F/L)-V- and -(N/Q)-L-L-S-P-(L/V)-). Site-directed mutagenesis may allow elucidation of the function of these sequence motifs in protein translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Due to its dynamic structure, the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane is difficult to characterize. Immunopurifications and blue native gel electrophoresis were employed to characterize both the TOM complex from fungi and the TOM complex from potato. The purified TOM complexes have several characteristics in common, but also differ in some respects. So far, it cannot be excluded that the differences are due to isolation artifacts. On the other hand, the structure and function of the mitochondrial protein import apparatus from different organisms is known to vary to some extent. One example is the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which is a soluble enzyme in fungi and mammals but forms an integral part of the cytochrome c reductase complex in plants. It should be interesting to analyze the structure and function of the TOM complex from some further organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2008724564,"During prolonged application of glutamate (20 min), patterns of increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) were studied in HEK-293 cells expressing metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR1α or mGluR5a. Stimulation of mGluR1α induced an increase in [Ca2+]i that consisted of an initial transient peak with a subsequent steady plateau or an oscillatory increase in [Ca2+]i. The transient phase was largely attributed to Ca2+mobilization from the intracellular Ca2+ stores, but the sustained phase was solely due to Ca2+ influx through the mGluR1α receptor-operated Ca2+ channel. Prolonged stimulation of mGluR5a continuously induced [Ca2+]i oscillations through mobilization of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Studies on mutant receptors of mGluR1α and mGluR5a revealed that the coupling mechanism in the sustained phase of Ca2+ response is determined by oscillatory/non-oscillatory patterns of the initial Ca2+response but not by the receptor identity. In mGluR1α-expressing cells, activation of protein kinase C selectively desensitized the pathway for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, but the mGluR1α-operated Ca2+ channel remained active. In mGluR5a-expressing cells, phosphorylation of mGluR5a by protein kinase C, which accounts for the mechanism of mGluR5a-controlled [Ca2+]i oscillations, might prevent desensitization and result in constant oscillatory mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Our results provide a novel concept in which oscillatory/non-oscillatory mobilizations of Ca2+ induce different coupling mechanisms during prolonged stimulation of mGluRs."

The role of chaperones and protein folding in peroxisomal protein transport is still unclear. Translocation of proteins into mitochondria requires that precursor proteins assume an extended conformation; cytosolic chaperones are thought to help maintain this conformation. In contrast, peroxisomal protein import does not require unfolding of the targeted protein. However, the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40 may be important for translocation. We present several lines of evidence that show that plant peroxisomal protein import is enhanced by chaperones.

Peroxisomes are nearly ubiquitous, single membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for the β-oxidation of fatty acids and for hydrogen peroxide degradation (1Olsen L.J. Harada J.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1995; 46: 123-146Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Higher plants possess several classes of peroxisomes, which are distinguished by the metabolic enzymes that constitute the peroxisomal matrix (2Kindl H. Cell Biochem.

Each class is present at different times and in various tissues, depending on the developmental stage of the plant (1Olsen L.J. Harada J.J. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, all matrix peroxisomal proteins are nuclear encoded, translated on free cytosolic ribosomes, and post-translationally translocated into the organelle. They are directed to the organelle by a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat-shock protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pex, peroxin; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; PTS1, peroxisomal targeting signal type 1; PTS2, peroxisomal targeting signal type 2. present either at the carboxyl terminus (PTS1) (4Gould S.J.

This interaction is dependent upon nucleotides and co-chaperones such as Hsp40 (20McKay D.B. Wilbanks S.M. Flaherty K.M. Ha J.-H. O'Brien M.C. Shirvanee L.L. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

Import into mammalian peroxisomes is dependent upon the presence of cytosol; the necessary cytosolic factors are most likely proteinaceous, since they are heat-labile (25Allen L.-A.H. Morand O.H.

In addition, an Hsp70 colocalizes with PTS-containing proteins and with peroxisomal membranes, and antibodies directed against bovine cytosolic Hsp73 inhibit peroxisomal protein import (27Walton P.A. Wendland M. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally, an Hsp40 and an Hsp70 have been localized to the glyoxysomal membrane (28Preisig-Muller R. Muster G. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Corpas F.J. Trelease R.N. Eur. J.

Subramani and co-workers (30Walton P.A. Hill P.E. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 9-nm gold particles could be imported into mammalian peroxisomes. In addition, “piggy-backing” experiments in which epitope-tagged protein constructs lacking a PTS were coexpressed with wild-type peroxisomal proteins (possessing a PTS) suggest that peroxisomal proteins assemble in the cytosol and perhaps can be imported as oligomers into Saccharomyces cerevisiaeperoxisomes (32McNew J.A.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, import of these large complexes into peroxisomes may have been inefficient; import was assayed only after lengthy incubation periods. Import is quantifiable after only 5 min in vitro and in vivo (35Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We developed an in vitro protein import assay to determine the molecular mechanisms of peroxisomal protein import (36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 53Brickner D.G. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This assay permits independent manipulation of the biochemical characteristics of the organelle, peroxisomal proteins, and cytosolic factors provided by the wheat germ lysate used for protein synthesis. Isocitrate lyase is a 248-kDa homotetrameric enzyme (37Ettinger W.F. Harada J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of the glyoxylate cycle; it catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to glyoxylate in the glyoxysomes of germinating seedlings. In this study, we used the in vitro assay to investigate the role of protein folding in peroxisomal protein import in two ways: 1) indirectly, by analyzing the effects of chaperone enrichment (through heat shock) and chaperone depletion (through immunodepletion) on the import of isocitrate lyase into isolated glyoxysomes, and 2) directly, by assessing the impact of the assembly state of isocitrate lyase on its import efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the folding and/or assembly state of isocitrate lyase is important for its efficient transport across the peroxisomal membrane. Redi-vue [35S]methionine (specific activity, 43.5 TBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pumpkin seeds (Cucurbita pepo, var. Half Moon) were purchased from Petoseed Co., Inc. (Saticoy, CA). Wheat germ Hsp70 antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. Kenneth Keegstra (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). Escherichia coli Hsp90 (HtpG) antiserum was generated by Dr. Michael Ehrmann (University of Konstanz) and generously provided by Dr. Ursula Jakob (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). The plasmid pILZf, containing a cDNA insert of the entire coding region of the peroxisomal enzyme isocitrate lyase in the pGEM7Zf(+) vector (Promega), was linearized with BbuI or SphI and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase as described by Brickner et al.(36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled isocitrate lyase was synthesized in a cell-free system in the presence of [35S]methionine. All experiments were performed with translation products synthesized in a wheat germ lysate system. Time course experiments were also executed using protein synthesized in a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) for optimal resolution of the resulting translation products by nondenaturing PAGE. The efficiency of translation was assessed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation onto glass fiber filters, followed by ethanol washes and then quantitation in a liquid scintillation counter (model LS 6800, Beckman). To study the influence of chaperones on protein import, translations were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of total antiserum protein, as measured by BCA protein assays (Pierce). Pumpkin seedlings were grown in moist vermiculite for 5–7 days in the dark at 25–28 °C. For experiments using heat-shocked tissue, dark-grown pumpkin seedlings were incubated in the dark at 40 °C for 1–3 h. Following heat shock, either the cotyledons were harvested immediately for glyoxysome isolation or the seedlings were allowed to recover for 15–18 h at 25–28 °C prior to glyoxysome isolation. All glyoxysomes were isolated as described previously (36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The glyoxysomal pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m mannitol, and 0.1 μg/ml each antipain and leupeptin) to a final concentration of 30–60 mg/ml total protein. Standard in vitroprotein import reactions were initiated by the addition of radiolabeled isocitrate lyase (0.5–1.0 × 106 trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts) to 300–600 μg of glyoxysomes in the presence of import buffer (25 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.0, 0.5m sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, and 0.1 μg/ml each antipain and leupeptin) in a final volume of 200 μl. After a 30-min incubation, the glyoxysomes were protease-treated, repurified on a sucrose cushion, solubilized in SDS-PAGE buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 53Brickner D.G. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Note that only proteins protected by an intact glyoxysomal membrane would be protease-resistant. Lysed or compromised organelles would not be recovered from the sucrose cushion. Previous control studies established that protein aggregation could not account for the observed protease-protected proteins (36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 51Behari R. Baker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7315-7322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of relative import was determined by phosphor-imaging analysis (Bio-Rad) or by excision, solubilization, and scintillation counter quantitation of the radiolabeled full-length isocitrate lyase gel band as described previously (36Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 53Brickner D.G. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Translation reactions performed in the presence of antiserum (Fig. 2) resulted in varying levels of translation efficiency, so different volumes of translation products (always equivalent to 0.5 × 106 trichloroacetic acid-precipitable translation counts) were added to import reactions. Mock translation mixtures (containing all components except mRNA) were added to the protein import reactions so that the concentration of cytosolic factors (present in the wheat germ lysate) and total counts of translation products were the same for all import samples. The native protein structure of isocitrate lyase in the translations was determined by nondenaturing PAGE on 6% polyacrylamide (pH 8.0) gels prepared using standard PAGE buffers without SDS (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.44-18.46Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with sample buffer lacking SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Molecular weights were estimated by comparison of the sample lanes on the autoradiographs with a lane of Coomassie-stained high molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from the same gel. Additionally, the heme molecule (68 kDa) present in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the translation reactions served as a visible internal molecular weight marker. The 62-kDa (monomer), 124-kDa (dimer), and 248-kDa (tetramer) bands were quantified by phosphor-imaging analysis. Total protein in heat-shocked and control glyoxysome fractions from standard organelle preparations was measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE; 80 μg total protein was loaded per lane. Proteins on the resulting gel were transblotted onto Immobilon PVDF transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.) in a semidry transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with antiserum in TBS-Tween only. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent reagents (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize the results. Standard procedures for immunoprecipitations using radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) were followed (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.44-18.46Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose. All incubations and washes were performed at 4 °C with gentle agitation. To examine the role of chaperones in peroxisomal protein import, we tested the import competence of glyoxysomes isolated from heat-shocked pumpkin seedlings. Chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 were among the proteins identified whose expression is up-regulated during the heat shock response (39Tissieres A. Mitchell H.K. Tracy U.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Hsp70 and Hsp40 have been localized to peroxisomal membranes (27Walton P.A. Wendland M. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Preisig-Muller R. Muster G. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Corpas F.J. Trelease R.N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar), and the amount of Hsp40 associated with these membranes increases after heat stress (28Preisig-Muller R. Muster G. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An Hsp70 has also recently been identified in the matrix of watermelon glyoxysomes (50Wimmer B. Lottspeich F. van der Klei I. Veenhuis M. Gietl C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13624-13629Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that if any of these chaperones are involved in peroxisomal protein import, glyoxysomes from heat-stressed tissues might show enhanced import capabilities compared with glyoxysomes from control tissues. Pumpkin seedlings were heat-shocked at 40 °C for 1, 2, or 3 h. As shown in Fig. 1 A, glyoxysomes isolated from 1–3-h heat-shocked tissues exhibited a 30–80% increase in the import of isocitrate lyase (assessed as protease-protected protein) when compared with protein import into glyoxysomes from control tissues. When the plants were heat-shocked for 1 h and then allowed to recover at 25–28 °C for approximately 18 h, protein import levels were approximately 3 times greater than the controls. Glyoxysomes, isolated from heat-shocked or control tissues, that were no longer intact were not recovered from the final sucrose cushion. In addition, isocitrate lyase in organelles with compromised membranes would be protease-accessible; the results presented represent only protease-protected (imported) protein. These results indicated that heat shock-related proteins might indeed affect the import of proteins into glyoxysomes. To test whether the increased levels of protein import were correlated with increased levels of chaperones associated with the peroxisomes, we performed immunoblot analysis of isolated glyoxysomes from different heat shock treatments using antibodies directed against Hsp70. Fig. 1 B shows that the amount of Hsp70 detected in these samples increased with increasing duration of heat shock. Hsp70 levels were greatest in the glyoxysomes isolated from tissue that had been subjected to 1 h heat shock followed by 18 h of recovery; these glyoxysomes also exhibited the highest level of isocitrate lyase import (Fig. 1 A). No attempt was made to further localize this Hsp70. Hsp70 has been reported on cucumber peroxisomal membranes (29Corpas F.J. Trelease R.N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar) and in the matrix of watermelon glyoxysomes (50Wimmer B. Lottspeich F. van der Klei I. Veenhuis M. Gietl C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13624-13629Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To further test the role of chaperones in peroxisomal protein import, we assayed the import of isocitrate lyase in the presence of polyclonal antibodies raised against wheat germ cytosolic Hsp70 and E. coli Hsp90. Radiolabeled translation products were synthesized in cell-free wheat germ lysate; this lysate is enriched in chaperones. 2W. Crookes, unpublished results. Peroxisomal import of radiolabeled isocitrate lyase that was synthesized in the presence of Hsp70 or Hsp90 antibodies was reduced to 20% of control levels (Fig. 2,closed circles). This effect was specific to the interactions between the chaperones and their antibodies, since translation products synthesized in the presence of preimmune serum (Fig. 2, open circles) or BSA (data not shown) were not altered in their import competence. Because Hsp70 is known to interact with newly synthesized proteins, post-translational addition of Hsp70 antiserum should not significantly affect import. As expected, when added after translation, Hsp70 antibodies did not affect isocitrate lyase import (Fig. 3 A). Thus, Hsp70 must influence import early in the import pathway, perhaps during folding of the nascent polypeptide. In contrast, post-translational addition of Hsp90 antiserum to translation products still decreased import of isocitrate lyase to 40% of control levels (Fig. 3 B). This result strongly suggests that Hsp90 interacts with isocitrate lyase post-translationally, later in the import pathway. Alternatively, Hsp90 may not interact directly with isocitrate lyase but may instead affect import via another factor required for translocation. Next we wanted to determine whether peroxisomal proteins directly associate with cytosolic Hsp70s. Radiolabeled isocitrate lyase from an in vitro translation reaction was incubated with antibodies directed against wheat germ cytosolic Hsp70. The presence of radiolabeled isocitrate lyase (Fig. 4, lane 4) in the immunoprecipitate confirmed its association with wheat germ Hsp70. The interaction between the chaperones and isocitrate lyase was specific; isocitrate lyase was not precipitated by isocitrate lyase preimmune serum (Fig. 4, lane 1) or by wheat germ Hsp70 preimmune serum (Fig. 4, lane 3). We investigated the nucleotide specificity of the Hsp70-isocitrate lyase interaction by manipulating the ATP/ADP ratio during immunoprecipitation. Hsp70s bind to nascent polypeptides in an ADP-bound state, while ATP binding induces the release of the substrate (20McKay D.B. Wilbanks S.M. Flaherty K.M. Ha J.-H. O'Brien M.C. Shirvanee L.L. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 153-177Google Scholar). Therefore, excess ATP should lead to decreased levels of Hsp70-isocitrate lyase complex formed. As shown in Fig. 4,lane 5, isocitrate lyase was only weakly precipitable when 3 mm ATP was present during immunoprecipitation. One role for Hsp70 and Hsp90 in peroxisomal protein import could be in maintaining the peroxisomal protein in an import-competent state; attainment of a particular folding state may increase the efficiency of peroxisomal protein import. Time course experiments were designed so that the assembly state of isocitrate lyase could be controlled and compared with import efficiency. The rate-limiting step for the formation of oligomeric proteins is the association of subunits into functional oligomers (reviewed in Ref. 40Freedman R.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 455-540Google Scholar). Oligomerization is a second-order process dependent upon subunit concentration. Therefore, to analyze the relationship between the assembly state of isocitrate lyase and import efficiency, we asked whether import efficiency was dependent upon subunit concentration. Specifically, we predicted that if monomeric isocitrate lyase is imported"
https://openalex.org/W1985685372,"Abstract A comparison of noncollagenous matrix proteins from different types of bovine cartilage by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a prominent 240-kDa component in extracts of epiphyseal but not tracheal tissue. On amino-terminal sequence analysis, it gave two sequences. One matched the NH2terminus of cartilage matrix protein (CMP) as reported for tracheal cartilage. The other did not match any known protein sequence. Further analysis of the 240-kDa protein after reduction of disulfides resolved two bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isolation and sequence analysis of tryptic peptides confirmed that one was bovine CMP and the other a CMP homolog. A data base search identified the latter as matrilin-3, a molecule recently predicted from human and mouse cDNA sequences (Wagener, R., Kobbe, B., and Paulsson, M. (1997)FEBS Lett. 413, 129–134). Matrilin-3 and CMP (matrilin-1) were prominent in equimolar amounts in fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage and absent from adult articular cartilage. Adult tracheal cartilage contained almost exclusively CMP. Although the mechanism of polymeric assembly is unknown, the matrilin-3 chain appears to function in the matrix linked to matrilin-1 in the form of disulfide-bonded heteromeric molecules. The results indicate a molecular stoichiometry of (matrilin-1)2(matrilin-3)2."

One large, catalytic domain forms the binding site for the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and the catalytic center and harbors nine of the 10 conserved amino acid motifs. One smaller domain is responsible for DNA recognition. The catalytic mechanism of these enzymes involves flipping out the target base from the DNA helix (12Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Then a conserved cysteine (motif IV) performs a nucleophilic attack on the C6-position of the cytosine, forming a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. Thereby, the C5-position is activated and accepts the methyl group from AdoMet. Subsequently, the covalent intermediate is deprotonated at C5 leading to the elimination of the cysteine (16Wu J.C.

N-MTases contain nine conserved amino acid motifs. An FXGXG motif, also present in cytosine-C5-MTases, and a DPPY motif (consensus sequence, (S/N/D)PP(Y/F/W)) are moderately conserved (17Lauster R.

Consequently, these additional motifs only recently could be identified in structure-guided alignments (21Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Whereas some amino acid residues within the FXGXG and DPPY motifs have already been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis (22Guyot J.-P. Grassi J. Hahn U. Guschlbauer W.

According to the amino acid sequences and order of the conserved motifs, N-MTases can be subdivided into three distinct groups, viz. α-N-MTases (e.g. M.EcoRV, an adenine-N6 MTase), β-N-MTases (e.g. PvuII DNA methyltransferase, a cytosine-N4-MTase), and γ-N-MTases (e.g. M. TaqI, an adenine-N6-MTase) (20Wilson G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol.

RNA. 1997; 3: 1233-1247PubMed Google Scholar) are similar to DNA N-MTases. So far, structures are available only for β- and γ-type apoenzymes (M. TaqI (28Labahn J. Granzin J. Schluckebier G.

O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). LikeC-MTases, N-MTases are built up of two domains. Surprisingly, the catalytic domain of N-MTases has a similar structure as the catalytic domains of C-MTases, although the chemistry of catalysis is different (30Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conserved DPPY motif structurally corresponds to motif IV in C-MTases, which contains the catalytic cysteine residue. It is likely thatN-MTases, like C-MTases, flip their target base out of the DNA double helix (31Schluckebier G. Labahn J. Granzin J. Schildkraut I. Saenger W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 157: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Cal S.

Using multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 1) as well as secondary structure predictions the structure of M.EcoRV and other α-type N-MTases was predicted to contain a similar catalytic domain as the other MTases (Fig. 2) (21Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar,40Jeltsch A. Sobotta T. Pingoud A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis of these predictions, putative functional roles for several conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 1) can be derived,e.g. involvement in DNA binding, AdoMet binding, or catalysis (Fig. 2). In particular, a putative binding site for the flipped target base can be derived by comparison with C-MTases (31Schluckebier G. Labahn J. Granzin J. Schildkraut I. Saenger W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 157: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Here we report the results of an extensive mutational study of 17 conserved amino acid positions of M. EcoRV that allow us to draw conclusions as to (i) the validity of the structural model for M. EcoRV and α-N-MTases, (ii) the functional roles of some amino acid residues within the conserved motifs of N-MTases, and (iii) the catalytic mechanism of N-MTases. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive analysis of a DNA MTase by site-directed mutagenesis that covers positions located in all conserved motifs as well as in the DNA recognition domain. Thus, it complements the detailed structural information available for this important family of enzymes.Figure 1Alignments of M. EcoRV with other α-N-MTases. Amino acid exchanges introduced in M.

In this vector, the M.EcoRV gene is controlled by a synthetic promotor-operator sequence obtained by a combination of the T5 promotor and twolac operators. PCR mutagenesis was performed using a megaprimer protocol modified after Ito et al. (41Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly, the method employs three PCR primers (Fig. 3): pup binds to the coding strand upstream of the gene of M. EcoRV; plow1binds to the lower strand downstream of the gene and removes aSalI site 3′ to the gene; and plow2 binds downstream of plow1 but leaves the SalI site intact. The desired mutation is introduced into the gene (together with a marker site) by an additional upper primer (pmut) in a PCR together with plow2. The PCR product that consists of a part of the M. EcoRV gene and carries a SalI site 3′ to the gene was hybridized to a PCR product produced using pup and plow1, which contains aBamHI-site 5′ to the gene but no SalI site 3′ to the gene. After three PCR fill in steps, a PCR using pupand plow2 was carried out. After this procedure, only mutated products carry a SalI site on their 3′-ends and can be cloned into the large BamHI/SalI fragment of pRVMetH6. Usually 30–50% of the obtained clones contained the marker site and the desired mutation. All genes were completely sequenced after mutagenesis. Due to background expression, plasmids encoding a DNA MTase are resistant to cleavage by the corresponding restriction endonuclease. This property can be used to assay the catalytic activity of MTases in vivo. To this end, pRVMetHis (34Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 40Jeltsch A. Sobotta T. Pingoud A.

Chem. 1998; 379: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) plasmids were grown inEscherichia coli LK111(λ) cells containing chromosomally encoded lacIq. The transcription of the M. EcoRV genes was not induced. Plasmid preparations from overnight cultures and from growing cells (at 1 A600) were carried out using DNA minipreparation kits (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the supplier, except that in the case of growing cells 20 ml of cell culture was used instead of 3–4 ml as used in the case of stationary overnight cultures. Plasmid DNA (1–2 μg) was incubated with 100–200 nm R. EcoRV (corresponding to approximately 100 units) in 10 μl of Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl for 30–60 min. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Under these conditions, an unmethylated control plasmid was completely cleaved after 5 min, but no nonspecific DNA degradation of methylated plasmids was observed after incubation for 60 min. Mutant genes were amplified from pRVMetH6 by PCR and cloned into pGEXMRV using the BamHI andSalI sites (42Friedrich T. Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this vector, the M. EcoRV gene is fused in frame to the 3′-end of the gene for the glutathioneS-transferase. The GST-M. EcoRV gene is under control of a tac promotor. Purification of the GST fusion proteins was performed by chromatography over GSH-Sepharose and phosphocellulose as described (42Friedrich T. Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) except that cell lysis was carried out under low salt conditions (30 mm KPi, pH 7.2.; 0.1 mm dithioerythritol; 0.01% (v/v) Lubrol; 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). All mutant proteins purified in this study were obtained at similar concentrations as wild type M. EcoRV (viz. 5–25 μm). The specific activities of different GST-M. EcoRV preparations (50–100 units/μg) were slightly higher than those reported for untagged M. EcoRV (35Nwosu V.U. Connolly B.A. Halford S.E. Garnett J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3705-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). His6-M. EcoRV could be purified to a 10–50-fold higher specific activity (34Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Kinetics of restriction protection were carried out using λ-DNA (21 EcoRV sites) and pAT153-DNA (one EcoRV site) in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm AdoMet at ambient temperature as described (42Friedrich T. Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 1 unit is defined as the amount of M.EcoRV required to protect 1 μg of DNA from R.EcoRV attack in 1 h. Specific activities (units/μg of protein) for GST fusion proteins were calculated using the molecular mass only of the M. EcoRV part (35,000 g/mol) in order to make the activities comparable with those measured with His6 fusion proteins. Methylation of a 20-mer oligonucleotide d(GATCGACGATATCGTCGATC) was carried out using [14CH3]AdoMet in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at ambient temperature as described (34Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine Kmvalues for DNA and AdoMet, DNA concentrations were varied between 0.2 and 4 μm at a constant AdoMet concentration of 5 μm, AdoMet concentrations were varied between 1 and 10 μm at 1 μm DNA, and the determined rates of methylation of DNA were fit to the Michaelis-Menten model. DNA binding was analyzed by nitrocellulose filter experiments carried out in a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) as described (34Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a PCR product (382 base pairs) at 1 nmand a 20-mer oligonucleotide d(GATCGACGATATCGTCGATC) (5 nm) both containing one EcoRV site as substrates. The oligonucleotide substrate was labeled radioactively using [32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas). The DNA was incubated with different amounts of M. EcoRV variants (10–2500 nm) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μmsinefungin for 30 min at ambient temperature. The nitrocellulose filter membrane (Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany) was prerinsed with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl for 30 min. After membrane was transferred into the dot blot chamber, the slots were washed twice with 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl. The samples were transferred into the wells of the dot blot apparatus using a multiple pipette, immediately sucked through the nitrocellulose filter membrane, and washed several times with 100 μl of washing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl). The radioactivity of the spots was analyzed using an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard), and the results were fitted to the equation describing a bimolecular association equilibrium. AdoMet binding was analyzed by filter binding experiments using a positively charged nylon membrane (Nytran-plus, Schleicher & Schüll) and [carboxyl-14C]AdoMet (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (42Friedrich T. Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). M. EcoRV wild type and mutants were incubated at −20 °C overnight with 100 μm[carboxyl-14C]AdoMet (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in storage buffer (30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.01% (v/v) Lubrol, 0.3m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 77% glycerol). The nylon membrane was prerinsed with washing buffer for at least 60 min. After membrane was transferred into the dot blot chamber, the slots were washed twice with washing buffer. After the incubation, the reaction mixtures containing AdoMet and M. EcoRV were diluted 10-fold with washing buffer, transferred into the wells of the dot blot apparatus using a multiple pipette, immediately sucked through the nylon membrane, and washed several times with 100 μl of washing buffer. The radioactivity of the spots was analyzed using an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard) or PhosphorImager (Fuji). After background subtraction, the amounts of retained AdoMet were normalized to the concentrations of the enzyme preparations and compared with wild type binding determined in the same experiment. We have used multiple sequence alignments to identify conserved amino acid residues in the EcoRV adenine-N6-MTase. Two alignments were analyzed for conserved residues, one including all α-typeN-MTases (Fig. 1 A) (21Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and one in which only a subgroup of enzymes closely related to M. EcoRV are aligned (Fig. 1 B) (40Jeltsch A. Sobotta T. Pingoud A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis of these alignments, we have chosen 17 amino acid residues that are strongly (Lys16, Glu37, Phe39, Asp58, Glu104, Arg128, Asn130, Glu178, Asp193, Tyr196, Ser229) or moderately conserved (Asp78, Asp211, Glu217, Glu238, Tyr258) for this mutational study (cf. Fig. 2for their location in the structural model). All residues were substituted by alanine; at two positions within the conserved DPPY motif (Asp193 and Tyr196) in addition more conservative amino acid replacements were carried out (Asp → Asn and Tyr → Phe). Mutations were introduced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. All M. EcoRV variants were tested for their ability to methylate DNA in vivo, and most of the variants were purified and also characterized in vitro with respect to their catalytic properties as well as DNA binding and AdoMet binding affinities. We have cloned all mutants as His6 fusion proteins in pRVMetH6. This plasmid contains one EcoRV recognition site. During propagation of the expression plasmids coding for the individual mutants in E. coli cells, residual expression of the MTase variant takes place even under repressing conditions. Thus, the MTase variant can modify the plasmid DNA in vivo, with the result that purified plasmids are resistant against R. EcoRV cleavage to a degree corresponding to the catalytic activity of the MTase variant. We have carried out this in vivo activity test in two ways by isolating plasmids either from stationary E. coli cells or from growing E. coli cells (Fig. 4, TableI). Plasmids encoding wild type M.EcoRV are fully protected against R. EcoRV cleavage under both experimental conditions. Generally, the degree of methylation of EcoRV sites is lower under conditions of active growth, because then DNA replication takes place and, in comparison with stationary E. coli cells, higher M.EcoRV activities are required to achieve the same degree of methylation. Five of the variants fail to methylate the DNA even in stationary E. coli cells (D58A, R128A, D193A, D193N, and Y196A). In growing cells, many variants show a strongly reduced level of DNA methylation indicating a strongly reduced catalytic activity (− or − − in Table I) (K16A, E37A, F39A, D58A, R128A, N130A, D193(A/N), Y196(A/F), S229A, Y258A).Table ICompilation of in vivo catalytic activities of His6- and GST-M.

EcoRV and 18 of the variants (Table II). E104A and E178A that are fully active in vivo were not purified and further investigated. Since many mutants could not be overexpressed as His6 fusion proteins or remained in the pellet after cell disruption and centrifugation, we decided to express and purify all mutants as GST fusion proteins. To this end, all mutants were also cloned as GST fusion proteins in pGEXMRV. The catalytic activities of these variants in stationary E. coli cells are very similar to those of the His6 fusion proteins (data not shown). Wild type GST-M. EcoRV and the mutants were overexpressed in 500-ml scale and purified by two chromatography steps (glutathione-Sepharose and phosphocellulose) to >90% purity as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The concentrations of all preparations were between 5 and 25 μm. We have determined the catalytic activity of wild type GST-M. E"
https://openalex.org/W2078826829,"Myeloperoxidase secreted by phagocytes in the artery wall may be a catalyst for lipoprotein oxidation. High density lipoprotein (HDL) oxidized by peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical has a markedly enhanced ability to deplete cultured cells of cholesterol. We have investigated the structural modifications in tyrosylated HDL responsible for this effect. Spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing the whole apolipoprotein (apo) fraction of tyrosylated HDL reproduced the ability of intact tyrosylated HDL to enhance cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded human fibroblasts when reconstituted with the whole lipid fraction of either HDL or tyrosylated HDL. Free apoAI or apoAII showed no increased capacity to induce cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts following oxidation by tyrosyl radical, either in their lipid-free forms or in rHDL. The product of oxidation of a mixture of apoAI and apoAII (1:1 molar ratio) by tyrosyl radical, however, reproduced the enhanced ability of tyrosylated HDL to induce cholesterol efflux when reconstituted with the whole lipid fraction of HDL. HDL containing only apoAI or apoAII showed no enhanced ability to promote cholesterol efflux following oxidation by tyrosyl radical, whereas HDL containing both apoAI and apoAII did. rHDL containing apoAI-apoAIImonomer and apoAI-(apoAII)2heterodimers showed a markedly increased ability to prevent the accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol mass by sterol-depleted fibroblasts compared with other apolipoprotein species of tyrosylated HDL. These results indicate a novel product of HDL oxidation, apoAI-apoAII heterodimers, with a markedly enhanced capacity to deplete cells of the regulatory pool of free cholesterol and total cholesterol mass. The recent observation of tyrosyl radical-oxidized LDL in vivo suggests that a similar modification of HDL would significantly enhance its ability to deplete peripheral cells of cholesterol in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport. Myeloperoxidase secreted by phagocytes in the artery wall may be a catalyst for lipoprotein oxidation. High density lipoprotein (HDL) oxidized by peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical has a markedly enhanced ability to deplete cultured cells of cholesterol. We have investigated the structural modifications in tyrosylated HDL responsible for this effect. Spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing the whole apolipoprotein (apo) fraction of tyrosylated HDL reproduced the ability of intact tyrosylated HDL to enhance cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded human fibroblasts when reconstituted with the whole lipid fraction of either HDL or tyrosylated HDL. Free apoAI or apoAII showed no increased capacity to induce cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts following oxidation by tyrosyl radical, either in their lipid-free forms or in rHDL. The product of oxidation of a mixture of apoAI and apoAII (1:1 molar ratio) by tyrosyl radical, however, reproduced the enhanced ability of tyrosylated HDL to induce cholesterol efflux when reconstituted with the whole lipid fraction of HDL. HDL containing only apoAI or apoAII showed no enhanced ability to promote cholesterol efflux following oxidation by tyrosyl radical, whereas HDL containing both apoAI and apoAII did. rHDL containing apoAI-apoAIImonomer and apoAI-(apoAII)2heterodimers showed a markedly increased ability to prevent the accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol mass by sterol-depleted fibroblasts compared with other apolipoprotein species of tyrosylated HDL. These results indicate a novel product of HDL oxidation, apoAI-apoAII heterodimers, with a markedly enhanced capacity to deplete cells of the regulatory pool of free cholesterol and total cholesterol mass. The recent observation of tyrosyl radical-oxidized LDL in vivo suggests that a similar modification of HDL would significantly enhance its ability to deplete peripheral cells of cholesterol in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport. Lipoprotein oxidation is felt to be pivotal for the formation of macrophage foam cells in the developing atherosclerotic lesion (1Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar).

Numerous potential mechanisms for the oxidation of lipoproteinsin vivo have been proposed (6Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). One such pathway is the release of myeloperoxidase and oxygen radicals by activated phagocytes at sites of inflammation, such as the intima of the atherosclerotic artery (7Klebanoff S.J Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Function and Clinical Disorders. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1978Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase employs hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the oxidation of substrates, including chloride ion andl-tyrosine, in the extracellular fluid (8Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The likelihood of oxidation of lipoproteins by myeloperoxidase-generated tyrosyl radical in vivo is suggested by the presence of the active enzyme (9Daugherty A. Rateri A.L. Dunn J.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), micromolar concentrations of l-tyrosine (10Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill Inc., New York1995: 1077-1106Google Scholar), and tyrosyl radical-modified LDL (5Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E.

High density lipoprotein (HDL) is felt to protect against atherosclerosis in part by stimulating the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues, the initial step in a pathway referred to as reverse cholesterol transport (11Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous reports have suggested that HDL is at least or more susceptible to oxidation than LDL in vitro (12Babiy A.V. Gebicki J.M. Sullivan D.R. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 81: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Hofer G. Lichtenberg D. Kostner G.M. Hermetter A. Clin. Biochem. 1996; 29: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Hurtado I. Fiol C. Gracia V. Caldu P. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 125: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Viani P. Cazzola R. Cervato G. Gatti P. Cestaro B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, oxidatively modified HDL isolated from in vivo sources has not been reported. We have previously reported that HDL can be readily oxidized by peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In striking contrast to other reports of HDL oxidation (reviewed in 17), tyrosyl radical-oxidized or “tyrosylated” HDL has a markedly enhanced ability to promote the removal of cholesterol from cultured fibroblasts and macrophage foam cells (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This effect is due specifically to an increased ability of tyrosylated HDL to promote the translocation of cellular cholesterol from sites available for esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (the “ACAT-accessible” pool), to sites on the cell surface available for off-loading to acceptor particles (the “efflux-accessible” pool) (18Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). No differences are seen in the ability of HDL and tyrosylated HDL to promote diffusional efflux or to act as passive acceptors of cholesterol or phospholipids from the surface of cholesterol-loaded cells, nor in their ability to directly inhibit or stimulate cholesteryl ester cycle enzymes (18Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a mechanism activated by tyrosylated HDL exists that can deplete cellular cholesteryl esters and the cholesterol substrate pool for esterification by ACAT prior to the depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane. The existence of such a pathway has important implications for the development of pharmaceutical agents that could mimic this effect for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis. The efficient depletion by HDL of the regulatory pool of cellular cholesterol available for esterification is felt to depend on the presence of intact HDL apolipoproteins (19Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Slotte J.P. Johnson T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation plus our finding that tyrosylated HDL shows a markedly increased ability to deplete this cellular cholesterol pool suggested that oxidative modifications to HDL apolipoproteins might be responsible for this enhanced effect. Tyrosyl radical oxidation of HDL results in the formation of cross-linked oligomers of its apoproteins, which by molecular weight and immunoblotting include apoAI-apoAIImonomer and apoAI-(apoAII)2heterodimers, apoAI dimers, and apoAI trimers (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This form of oxidation also generates moderate levels of lipid peroxidation products on HDL, but no significant change in the percent content of major lipid classes compared with HDL (18Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have isolated the whole lipid and protein fractions of tyrosylated HDL to determine which of these modifications is responsible for its enhanced effect. Our results show that tyrosyl radical modification of HDL apoproteins mediates the enhanced cholesterol efflux by these particles, and that the specific modification responsible for this effect is the formation of apoAI-apoAII heterodimers. Cholesterol, l-tyrosine, hydrogen peroxide (30%, ACS grade), dietheylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA; free acid form), essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and CAPS were purchased from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. [1-14C]Oleate (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tissue culture medium was purchased from Bio-Whittaker, and fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. Chelex 100 resin was from Bio-Rad. HDL3 (d = 1.125–1.21 g/ml, hereafter referred to as HDL) was isolated by standard ultracentrifugation techniques from the pooled plasma of healthy male volunteers (21Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Greer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL was subjected to heparin-agarose affinity chromatography to remove apoE- and apoB-containing particles (22Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation of HDL or lipid-free apolipoproteins was carried out as described (18Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide to generate tyrosyl radical from l-tyrosine. DTPA (100 μm) is included in the reaction mixture to inhibit metal-ion-catalyzed oxidation. The modified HDL or apolipoproteins were passed over Bio-Rad 10-DG size exclusion columns equilibrated with buffer A (66 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA, pH 8.0, passed over Chelex 100 resin to remove transition metal ions) prior to fractionation, or with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm HEPES prior to use in cell culture studies, to remove free dityrosine and other reaction components. The whole protein fractions of HDL and tyrosylated HDL were obtained by extraction with ether:acetone (1:3, v/v) and purified apoAI and apoAII obtained as described (23Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 91: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Individual apolipoprotein species of tyrosylated HDL were isolated by separation on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and eluted with 60 mm Tris, 40 mm CAPS, pH 9.4 using a 30-channel Bio-Rad whole gel eluter (200 mA for 30 min) based on the method of Andersen and Heron (24Andersen P. Heron I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 161: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Eluted fractions were concentrated and their protein contents identified on subsequent SDS-PAGE using a 7–20% acrylamide gradient gel. Fractions enriched in individual tyrosylated HDL apoprotein species were pooled and passed over a 5 × 1.5-cm AG-11 ion retardation column (Bio-Rad) to remove SDS (25Kapp O.H. Vinogradov S.N. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Residual SDS was determined by the method of Hayashi (26Hayashi K. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 67: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and found to be in the range of 0.1–1 mol/mol of protein. The whole lipid fractions of control HDL and tyrosylated HDL were isolated by a modification of the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Some water-soluble lipid-peroxidation products may be lost during this isolation; however, control experiments showed no difference in the ability of tyrosylated HDL incubated with cells before or after gel filtration to remove these products to induce cholesterol efflux. Lyophilized HDL (10 mg) was mixed with 0.4 ml of water and 5 ml of methanol for 30 min; 2.5 ml of chloroform was added and after 30 min samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant plus two rinses of the residue (2 ml of methanol/chloroform (2:1 v/v) each) was evaporated under nitrogen and the dried extract dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform/methanol/0.74% KCl (8:4:3 v/v/v) (28Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The upper aqueous phase and any protein at the phase interface were discarded, and the organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen. This step was repeated as necessary (usually three times) until protein precipitate no longer appeared in the interface. Isolated lipid fractions were found to contain no residual intact or fragmented apoproteins by SDS-PAGE. The lipid extract was dissolved in chloroform and stored under argon at −20 °C until use. HDL particles containing apoAI only (LpAI) or both apoAI and apoAII (LpAI/AII) were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography of HDL3 (29Cheung M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HDL containing apoAII only were prepared as described (30Vadiveloo P.K. Fidge N.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, HDL was incubated with lipid-free apoAII at a ratio of 1 mg of HDL to 10 mg of apoAII, for 2 h at 25 °C. The mixture was then adjusted to d = 1.21 g/ml with KBr, centrifuged at 99,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C to remove free apoproteins, and the top fraction containing AII-HDL dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (buffer B). The absence of residual apoAI on the AII-HDL was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles were prepared using the cholate dialysis method (31Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Discoidal rHDL were prepared with egg PC, free cholesterol, and delipidated apoproteins using an initial molar ratio of 80:8:80:1, PC:cholesterol:sodium cholate:apoproteins. Spherical rHDL were prepared using a molar ratio of total phospholipid in the isolated whole lipid fraction, sodium cholate, and isolated apoproteins of 80:80:1. Cholate was removed by extensive dialysis against 10 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4 (buffer C), following which the density of the dialyzed samples was adjusted to d = 1.21 g/ml with KBr and a final volume of 3 ml, and samples centrifuged at 99,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C to isolate rHDL free of unbound or loosely bound apoproteins. The top 1 ml fractions were collected and dialyzed for another 3 days against buffer C. rHDL were stored at 4 °C under argon and used within 2 weeks of preparation. The incorporation of lipids into reconstituted particles was determined enzymatically (32Warnick G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and the conformation and size of rHDL were assessed by negative stain electron microscopy (33Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Normal human skin fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described (34Brinton E.A. Oram J.F. Chen C.H. Albers J.J. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were plated at 15,000 cells/16-mm well or 70,000 cells/35-mm well and grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to confluence (about 7 days). To cholesterol-load the cells, confluent cultures were washed twice with PBS containing 2 mg/ml BSA (PBS-BSA) and incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 2 mg/ml BSA and 30 μg/ml cholesterol (added from a 10 mg/ml solution in ethanol). To allow equilibration of added cholesterol, cell layers were rinsed twice with PBS-BSA and incubated for another 24 h in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA (DMEM-BSA). Cells used for cholesterol mass determination were initially depleted of cholesterol by growth from 60% to full confluence in DMEM containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum. To assess the ability of HDL, free apoproteins, and rHDL particles to deplete cellular free cholesterol available for esterification, cholesterol-loaded cells were incubated for 16 h in DMEM-BSA and the indicated additions, washed once with PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with DMEM containing 9 μm [14C]oleate bound to 3 μm BSA (19Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Slotte J.P. Johnson T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were chilled on ice and rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS-BSA, twice with PBS, and stored at −20 °C until extraction. Cell layers were extracted with hexane:isopropanol (3:2, v/v) as described (35Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Sterol species were separated by thin layer chromatography on PE SIL G plastic-backed plates (Whatman) developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (130:40:1.5 v/v/v). Lipid spots were identified by staining with I2 vapor and comigration with standard. After allowing I2 stain to evaporate, cholesteryl ester spots were taken for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. To assess the ability of rHDL containing individual tyrosylated HDL apoprotein species to prevent cholesterol accumulation by cells, cholesterol-depleted fibroblasts were coincubated for 24 h with 50 μg/ml LDL protein and the indicated rHDL additions (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cell washes, extraction, and separation of lipids by TLC were carried out as above, except that silica gel H plates were used, and cholesterol spots taken for determination of sterol mass (36Heider J.G. Boyett R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 514-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using 7–20% polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), followed by staining with 0.25% Coomassie Blue or silver. Immunoblot analysis of isolated tyrosylated HDL apoprotein species was performed using mouse anti-human apoAI and apoAII monoclonal antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim and Biodesign International, respectively) (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Protein content of intact and rHDL particles was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and cell protein by the method of Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Differences between groups were calculated using the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Structural modifications to HDL induced by tyrosyl radical oxidation, including protein cross-linking and formation of moderate levels of lipid peroxidation products, accompany the marked increase in capacity of these HDL particles to deplete cellular cholesterol (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,18Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we isolated the protein components and total lipid fractions of HDL and tyrosylated HDL to determine which of these modifications is responsible for this enhanced activity. The whole apolipoprotein and lipid fractions of HDL and tyrosylated HDL were isolated and incubated with cholesterol-enriched human fibroblasts to determine their ability to deplete the cellular cholesterol pool available for esterification. Our previous demonstration of a direct correlation between depletion of this regulatory, ACAT-accessible pool and cellular cholesteryl ester mass in the absence of a direct inhibitory effect on ACAT indicated the cholesterol esterification assay is an accurate measure of cholesterol efflux capacity by these particles (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 A, no increase was seen in the capacity of the isolated total protein fraction of tyrosylated HDL compared with that of HDL to stimulate removal of the pool of free cholesterol available for esterification during a subsequent 1 h incubation with [14C]oleate. In fact, the lipid-free tyrosylated HDL apoprotein fraction showed a diminished capacity to promote efflux from this pool compared with the control HDL apoprotein fraction. To determine whether the apolipoprotein fraction of tyrosylated HDL needs to be in a lipid-bound form to demonstrate its enhanced efflux capacity, HDL and tyrosylated HDL proteins were presented to cholesterol-loaded cells on the surface of both discoidal and spherical rHDL particles. Discoidal rHDL particles containing tyrosylated HDL apoproteins plus commercial phosphatidylcholine and free cholesterol showed a modest but significant increase in ability to deplete ACAT-accessible cholesterol compared with particles containing the HDL protein fraction at concentrations lower than 10 μg of protein/ml (Fig. 1 B). Particles generated using the total protein fraction of tyrosylated HDL and the whole lipid fraction of HDL or tyrosylated HDL, however, showed a markedly increased ability to deplete cholesterol available for esterification compared with particles generated with the HDL protein fraction and the whole lipid fraction of either HDL or tyrosylated HDL (Fig. 1 C). These results mirror closely our results obtained using this assay with intact HDL and tyrosylated HDL (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and provide evidence that modification of the apolipoprotein fraction of HDL by tyrosyl radical oxidation is responsible for the enhancement of cholesterol efflux by these particles. The whole lipid fraction of tyrosylated HDL showed no ability to alter cholesterol esterification by particles containing the whole apoprotein fraction of either HDL or tyrosylated HDL. In subsequent experiments, we used the whole lipid fraction of HDL plus the indicated apolipoproteins to generate rHDL for cell incubations. Reconstituted HDL particles with a neutral lipid core and spheroidal shape have previously been generated using the cholate dialysis method only with subsequent treatment with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (41Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequential gradient ultracentrifugation method we have used to isolate HDL3depletes HDL of most of their LCAT activity (42Cheung M.C. Wolf M.C. Lum K.D. Tollefson J.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We typically obtained, however, greater than 20% incorporation of cholesteryl esters and 80% of triglycerides into rHDL particles using cholate dialysis to combine the whole lipid fraction of HDL or tyrosylated HDL and apoprotein fractions, without the subsequent addition of LCAT. This level of incorporation suggested the presence of a neutral lipid core and therefore spherical rHDL particles. This was confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 2), which showed spheroidal particles mainly in the 11–33-nm range, equivalent to HDL2- to small VLDL-sized particles (43Scanu A.M. The Biochemistry of Atherosclerosis. Marcel Dekker Inc, New York1979Google Scholar). Reconstituted HDL generated in the absence of neutral lipids had the expected discoidal appearance (11–17 nm) (Fig. 2, inset). To determine the individual apolipoproteins required during tyrosyl radical oxidation to generate HDL particles with enhanced efflux capacity, we first produced rHDL containing control or tyrosylated apoAI or apoAII alone. As with the whole HDL and tyrosylated HDL apoprotein fractions, initial experiments showed no enhanced activity of lipid-free apoAI or apoAII oxidized by tyrosyl radical compared with control apoproteins (data not shown). SDS-PAGE of spherical rHDL generated using control or tyrosylated apoAI or apoAII and the whole lipid fraction of HDL indicated the presence of monomers and homooligomers of apoAI or apoAII (data not shown). Cell incubations with these rHDL also failed to show an enhanced capacity of the tyrosylated apoprotein-containing particles to deplete cells of cholesterol available for esterification (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis had previously indicated the presence in tyrosylated HDL of cross-linked heterodimers containing both apoAI and apoAII, in addition to apoAI dimers and trimers (16Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The lack of enhanced activity in particles containing homooligomeric species of apoAI and apoAII suggested that these heterooligomeric species might be responsible for the enhanced efflux capacity of tyrosylated HDL. To test this hypothesis, rHDL containing various combinations of control and tyrosyl radical-oxidized apoAI or apoAII were generated and their ability to promote the removal of cellular cholesterol available for esterification assessed. As seen in Fig. 4, only rHDL containing apoAI and apoAII oxidized by tyrosyl radical in the presence of each other (Tyr(AI+AII)) reproduced the ability of intact tyrosylated HDL to promote cholesterol removal from cultured fibroblasts. Reconstituted HDL particles containing control apoAI or apoAII or the tyrosylated forms of these proteins, oxidized separately from each other (e.g.TyrAI/TyrAII), all had similar abilities to deplete ACAT-accessible cholesterol, which was midway betw"
https://openalex.org/W2016507546,"Chemical cross-linking of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) heterodimer was used to determine whether the herpes simplex virus inhibitor of TAP, ICP47, induces a conformational change in TAP. Cross-linking of TAP in cellular membranes produced a major species of ∼220 kDa which was comprised solely of TAP.1 and TAP.2 and most likely represents the TAP heterodimer. Interestingly, prior treatment of TAP-containing membranes with TAP peptide substrates stimulated the formation of the cross-linked TAP heterodimer, whereas pretreatment of membranes with ICP47 completely blocked the formation of the cross-linked heterodimer. These data suggest that suitable substrates for TAP stabilize the TAP heterodimer, whereas ICP47 destabilizes the heterodimer. The results indicate that subtle conformational changes occur in the TAP heterodimer upon the binding of peptides and the inhibitor ICP47 and that ICP47 has a deleterious effect on TAP heterodimer structure, in addition to its role as a potent blocker of substrate binding to TAP. Chemical cross-linking of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) heterodimer was used to determine whether the herpes simplex virus inhibitor of TAP, ICP47, induces a conformational change in TAP. Cross-linking of TAP in cellular membranes produced a major species of ∼220 kDa which was comprised solely of TAP.1 and TAP.2 and most likely represents the TAP heterodimer. Interestingly, prior treatment of TAP-containing membranes with TAP peptide substrates stimulated the formation of the cross-linked TAP heterodimer, whereas pretreatment of membranes with ICP47 completely blocked the formation of the cross-linked heterodimer. These data suggest that suitable substrates for TAP stabilize the TAP heterodimer, whereas ICP47 destabilizes the heterodimer. The results indicate that subtle conformational changes occur in the TAP heterodimer upon the binding of peptides and the inhibitor ICP47 and that ICP47 has a deleterious effect on TAP heterodimer structure, in addition to its role as a potent blocker of substrate binding to TAP.

Once assembled, the stable complex of class I heavy chain, β2m, and peptide, is released from the endoplasmic reticulum and expressed on the cell surface for recognition by CD8+ T cells. Research over the past few years has greatly expanded our knowledge of the early events involved with the peptide loading of class I molecules. Central to this knowledge was the discovery of the transporter associated with antigen processing genes TAP.1 and TAP.2 (1Spies T. Bresnahan M. Bahram S. Arnold D. Blanck G. Mellins E. Pious D.

TAP is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters (for review, see Ref. 5Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar), which includes P-glycoprotein (6Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Previous evidence has shown that both TAP.1 and TAP.2 must be expressed to produce a functional transporter (9Androlewicz M.J.

Indeed, stoichiometric and size analysis of the TAP complex suggests that TAP exists as a heterodimer (12Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.J. Riddell S.R. Tampe R.

Recent evidence also indicates that TAP physically associates with other molecules that are involved in the loading of MHC class I molecules.

The precise roles that these accessory molecules play in TAP-dependent peptide transport and MHC class I loading remain to be seen; however, it is thought that their physical association with TAP helps to maximize peptide transport and loading.The herpes simplex virus immediate early gene ICP47 encodes a small polypeptide (88 amino acids) which can dramatically inhibit peptide transport by TAP in humans (17Hill A. Jugovic P. York I. Russ G. Bennink J. Yewdell J. Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 18Fruh K. Ahn K. Djaballah H. Sempe P. van Endert P.M. Tampe R. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). ICP47 binds tightly to the peptide binding site of TAP and prevents the binding of other peptides that are suitable substrates for TAP (19Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempe P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Fruh K. Tampe R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Tomazin R. Hill A.B. Jugovic P. York I. van Endert P.M. Ploegh H.L. Andrews D.W. Johnson D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3256-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). ICP47 effectively shuts down the TAP-dependent flow of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and severely impairs the assembly of MHC class I molecules. As a result, the presentation and recognition of herpes simplex antigens by CD8+ T cells are restricted, enabling the virus to persist longer within the infected cell. The functional domains of ICP47 have been delineated recently (21Galocha B. Hill A. Barnett B.C. Dolan A. Raimondi A. Cook R.F. Brunner J. McGeoch D.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the minimal functional region of the ICP47 molecule is comprised of residues 3–34 (22Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This means that more than half the molecule is not required for the inhibition of TAP. The current model for the action of ICP47 proposes that residues 3–13 interact with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through a membrane-induced α-helix, whereas residues 14–34 interact with the peptide binding site of TAP. Although it is clear that ICP47 competes efficiently for peptide binding to TAP, it is not clear what other effects ICP47 may have on TAP which facilitates its inhibition of TAP function.Here, we use chemical cross-linking of the TAP heterodimer to detect subtle conformational changes between the two subunits. We found that although peptides that are good substrates for TAP stabilize the formation of the TAP heterodimer as shown by cross-linking, ICP47 significantly destabilizes the TAP heterodimer so that no cross-links were detected. The results indicate that ICP47 induces a loose association of TAP.1 and TAP.2 in the heterodimer which most likely further contributes to the inhibition of TAP function by ICP47.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the TAP heterodimer can be chemically cross-linked using the homobifunctional cross-linker EGS. The major cross-linked species is 220 kDa, which, we argue, represents the TAP heterodimer. First, if it represented a TAP heterotrimer or heterotetramer one would expect to see intermediate cross-linked species. However, we do not detect any such intermediate species. Second, it is not unusual for cross-linked proteins to run aberrantly on SDS-PAGE, as the cross-links could induce structural changes and different SDS binding properties. Third, all attempts to detect another additional protein within the p220 complex have failed (see Fig. 2). In cell lines that lack class I heavy chain association with TAP (Daudi), lack calnexin (CEM-NKR), or lack tapasin (.220), the p220 adduct was still detected. Indeed, p220 was formed in TAP-expressing insect cells that do not express several of the molecules that associate with TAP. Fourth, p220 was generated from TAP heterodimers that were solubilized in Triton X-100, which is known to dissociate TAP from its accessory molecules (data not shown). Finally, when the cross-linker EGS was cleaved under basic conditions, p220 fell apart into subunits of ∼70 kDa only (data not shown) (note, any unlabeled molecules associated with TAP would not be detected under these conditions). For all of these reasons we feel that p220 is the cross-linked TAP heterodimer.Further, we show here that the herpes simplex virus inhibitor ICP47 destabilizes the TAP heterodimer as revealed by sensitivity to cross-linking with EGS. This finding provides significant insight into the mechanism of action of ICP47. Not only does ICP47 block peptide binding to TAP and therefore inhibit TAP function, but it also appears to affect the conformation of the TAP heterodimer such that the TAP.1 and TAP.2 subunits are in a “loose” association. We also provide data to show that the converse is true, i.e. suitable peptide substrates for TAP stabilize the heterodimer. This is not necessarily surprising, as the addition of exogenous peptides have been shown to stabilize the TAP heterodimer during reconstitution experiments. 2M. J. Androlewicz and P. Cresswell, unpublished observations. From the data, we can put forth a theory with regard to the conformation of the TAP heterodimer. In a completely unoccupied state the TAP heterodimer takes on a neutral or default conformation as indicated by a minimal degree of cross-linking (see Fig. 4). In the presence of peptide the heterodimer takes on a more stabilized or “tight” conformation as shown by an increase in cross-linked heterodimer. In contrast, in the presence of ICP47 the heterodimer is destabilized to the point where no efficient cross-links can be formed. It should be made clear, however, that ICP47 does not cause the complete dissociation of the heterodimer into individual subunits. The TAP.1 and TAP.2 subunits still remain associated as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Thus we find that the changes induced into the TAP heterodimer by peptides and inhibitors are subtle compared with the forces holding the two subunits together. However, these subtle conformational changes could have a dramatic effect on TAP function. In the case of ICP47, destabilization of the TAP heterodimer works in concert with the blockage of substrate binding to generate a potent inhibitor of TAP. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1The abbreviations used are: TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; β2m, β2-microglobulin; HSAB,N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; β2m, β2-microglobulin; HSAB,N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plays a critical role in the MHC class I antigen processing pathway by transporting antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum for assembly with MHC class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m). Once assembled, the stable complex of class I heavy chain, β2m, and peptide, is released from the endoplasmic reticulum and expressed on the cell surface for recognition by CD8+ T cells.

https://openalex.org/W2067065879,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) in mammalian cells is synthesized through the exchange of freel-serine with the base moiety of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The serine base exchange in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is catalyzed by at least two enzymes, PS synthase (PSS) I and II. A PSS I-lacking mutant of CHO-K1 cells, PSA-3, which exhibits ∼2-fold lower serine base exchange activity than CHO-K1, is defective in the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to PS but has the ability to convert PE to PS. The PSA-3 mutant requires exogenous PS or PE for cell growth. In the present study, from PSA-3 mutant cells, we isolated a mutant, named PSB-2, with a further decrease in the serine base exchange activity. The activity in the homogenate of PSB-2 mutant cells was ∼10% that of PSA-3 mutant cells and ∼5% that of CHO-K1 cells. The PSB-2 mutant exhibited an ∼80% reduction in the PSS II mRNA level relative to that in PSA-3 mutant and CHO-K1 cells. These results showed that the PSB-2 mutant is defective in PSS II. Like the PSA-3 mutant, the PSB-2 mutant grew well in medium supplemented with PS. However, in the medium supplemented with PE, the PSB-2 mutant was incapable of growth, in contrast to the PSA-3 mutant. In the medium with exogenous PE, the PSB-2 mutant was defective in PS biosynthesis, whereas the PSA-3 mutant synthesized a normal amount of PS. A metabolic labeling experiment with exogenous [32P]PE revealed that the PSB-2 mutant was defective in the conversion of exogenous PE to PS. This defect and the growth and PS biosynthetic defects of the PSB-2 mutant cultivated with exogenous PE were complemented by the PSS II cDNA. In addition, the cDNA of the other PS synthase, PSS I, was shown not to complement the defect in the conversion of exogenous PE to PS of the PSB-2 mutant, implying that PSS I negligibly contributes to the conversion of PE to PS in CHO-K1 cells. These results indicated that PSS II is critical for the growth and PS biosynthesis of PSA-3 mutant cells cultivated with exogenous PE and suggested that most of the PS formation from PE in CHO-K1 cells is catalyzed by PSS II.

Phosphatidylserine (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine. is one of the major phospholipids in mammalian cells, comprising about 10% of the total membrane phospholipids. To elucidate the mechanism underlying PS biosynthesis in mammalian cells, we have isolated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants defective in PS metabolism (1Nishijima M. Kuge O. Maeda M.

Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isolated through screening for PS auxotrophic mutants, has been successfully utilized for studying the PS biosynthetic pathway, as described below. The availability of PSA-3 mutant cells has made it possible to isolate the CHO cDNA of a PS synthase (PSS) gene, pssA, which is able to confer PS prototrophy on the mutant (5Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, the CHO cDNA of another PS synthase gene, pssB, was isolated through a computer search for sequences similar to those of the pssA gene product (6Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both the pssA gene product, PSS I, and pssB gene product, PSS II, catalyze the exchange of free l-serine with the polar head group (base) of preexisting phospholipid for PS formation (3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to serine base exchange, PSS I can catalyze the exchange of the base moiety of phospholipid with choline and ethanolamine, whereas PSS II can catalyze serine and ethanolamine base exchange, but not choline base exchange (3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The serine and ethanolamine base exchange activities in a homogenate of PS auxotrophic PSA-3 mutant cells are decreased to ∼50% of those in the parental strain, CHO-K1, and choline base exchange activity is virtually absent in the mutant cell homogenate (3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PSA-3 mutant has no detectable amounts of pssA mRNA and its product, PSS I (5Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the PSA-3 mutant is defective in PSS I. The PSS I-defective PSA-3 mutant is incapable of converting exogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) to PS, suggesting that PSS I catalyzes the exchange of the choline moiety of PC with serine for PS formation in CHO-K1 cells (8Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the PSA-3 mutant is cultivated without exogenous phospholipids for 2 days, the cellular levels of PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the majority of which in CHO-K1 cells is synthesized through the decarboxylation of PS (9Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are reduced by ∼70 and ∼50%, respectively (3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defects in the PS and PE biosynthesis of the PSA-3 mutant are complemented by thepssA cDNA (5Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA also complements the defect in the conversion of PC to PS of the PSA-3 mutant. 2K. Saito, M. Nishijima, and O. Kuge, unpublished data. Thus, PSS I is responsible for the PS formation from PC in CHO-K1 cells, and it functions as an essential enzyme for the production of normal amounts of PS and PE in CHO-K1 cells cultivated without phospholipid supplementation. The PSS I-defective PSA-3 mutant, as well as CHO-K1, has the ability to convert exogenous PE to PS (8Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the addition of PE to the medium, PSA-3 mutant cells recover the normal abilities to synthesize PS and to grow (8Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because two PS synthases, PSS I and II, exist in CHO-K1 cells, it is possible that PSS II is responsible for the PE-dependent restoration of PS biosynthesis in the PSA-3 mutant. However, the existence of more than two PS synthases in CHO-K1 cells has not been ruled out. In addition, it has not been resolved whether PSS I exclusively catalyzes the conversion of PC to PS or also catalyzes the conversion of PE to PS. Thus, the question of what enzyme or enzymes are responsible for the PS formation from PE in CHO-K1 cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we isolated CHO cell mutants defective in PSS II from PSA-3 cells to address the function of this enzyme. The results presented here suggest that thepssB gene product, PSS II, functions as the principal enzyme in the PS formation from PE in CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and routinely maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (ICN Biomedicals) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum (ICN Biomedicals), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 1.176 g/liter NaHCO3 at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 100% humidity. PSA-3 cells (3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PSB-1, PSB-2, and PSB-2/pssB cells obtained in this study were maintained under the same culture conditions except that the medium was supplemented with 30 μm PS (from bovine brain; Sigma) liposomes prepared as described (11Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSB-2/pssA cells obtained in this study were maintained under the same growth conditions as those for CHO-K1 cells. J774.1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained under the same culture conditions as those for CHO-K1 cells, except that the medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) instead of newborn calf serum. The suspension of PE (from egg yolk; Sigma) added to the growth medium was prepared as described (11Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mutagenesis, exponentially growing cells were treated with 300 μg/ml ethyl methanesulfonate (Sigma) at 33 °C for 18 h, followed by cultivation without ethyl methanesulfonate at 33 °C for 3 days. The mutagenized cells were seeded to a 100-mm-diameter dish containing 10 ml of growth medium supplemented with 30 μm PS and then grown clonally at 33 °C to yield about 300 colonies/dish. On day 7, the cells were overlaid with a polyester disc (12Raetz C.R.H. Wermuth M.M. McIntyre T.M. Esko J.D. Wing D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a filter paper (Whatman No. 50) (13Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1190-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and glass beads (12Raetz C.R.H. Wermuth M.M. McIntyre T.M. Esko J.D. Wing D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in that order. The cells were further cultivated with a medium change on days 10, 15, and 20. On day 20, the polyester disc bearing immobilized colonies was transferred to a new dish containing 7 ml of the same growth medium and incubated at 33 °C for 2 days. After additional cultivation at 39.5 °C for 1 day, the polyester disc was subjected to freezing and thawing in phosphate-buffered saline as described (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1926-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to lyse the cells. The polyester disc was then incubated in 2 ml of an assay mixture consisting of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmCaCl2, cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), and 40 μml-[U-14C]serine (20 μCi/μmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min at 39.5 °C and then soaked in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to terminate the serine base exchange reaction, followed by four rinses with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid as described (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1926-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After air drying, the radioactivity associated with the colonies was determined with a bioimage analyzer (FUJIX BAS2000). The colonies were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described (12Raetz C.R.H. Wermuth M.M. McIntyre T.M. Esko J.D. Wing D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutant clones exhibiting decreased serine incorporation, identified through comparison of the radioactivity and staining intensity of colonies, were retrieved using cloning cylinders from the master dish. These clones were subjected to two more cycles of colony screening and then purified by limited dilution. This mutant screening was performed to allow the isolation of temperature-sensitive conditional mutants, because the decrease in the serine base exchange activity might have a lethal effect on PSA-3 mutant cells. However, mutants actually obtained in this study were constitutively defective in the serine base exchange activity and were able to grow at the high temperature of 39.5 °C in the presence of exogenous PS. Therefore, biochemical characterization of the mutants, performed at this temperature, 39.5 °C, are presented in this report. Cells were suspended in a sonication buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and then disrupted on ice with a W-225R Ultrasonic disrupter (Heat System Ultrasonics) equipped with a No. 419 microtip. Undisrupted cells were removed by centrifugation at 750 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was used as the homogenate. The serine, ethanolamine, and choline base exchange activities in the homogenate were determined at 39.5 °C using radioactive substrates,l-[U-14C]serine, [1,2-14C]ethanolamine hydrochloride (ICN Biomedicals), and [methyl-14C]choline chloride (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), respectively, as described (3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from 1–2 × 108 cells using a FastTrackTM mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), with slight modifications. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 1.8-kilobase pair pssB cDNA fragment was cleaved from a plasmid, pSVpssB/neo(15Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), by KpnI/XbaI digestion according to the standard method as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and used as a pssB probe. A commercial β-actin cDNA fragment (CLONTECH) was used as a control probe. The 32P-labeledpssB probe was incubated with the membrane in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C overnight as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The final wash of the membrane was performed with 0.1× SSC (1× SSC consists of 0.15 m NaCl and 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0.) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C. Detection and quantification of the 32P-labeledpssB probe hybridized with the poly(A)+ RNA were performed with a bioimage analyzer (FUJIX BAS2000). After removal of the probe, the membrane was reprobed with the 32P-labeled actin probe and analyzed by the same methods. Lipid extraction from cells was performed according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). One- and two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for separation of phospholipids were performed as described (11Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). J 774.1 cells were seeded at 2 × 107 cells in a 150-mm-diameter dish containing 30 ml of phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and then labeled with 400 μCi of 32Pi (the Japan Atomic Energy Institute, Ibaragi, Japan) per dish at 37 °C for 3 days. The labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested. Phospholipids were extracted from the labeled cells and then separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (11Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the positions of the spots of [32P]PE and [32P]PC on silica gel plates had been located by autoradiography, these32P-labeled phospholipids were scraped off and then extracted from the silica gel as described (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The labeled lipids were dried up under a N2 stream and then sonicated in the growth medium using a bath-type sonicator. The plasmids pSVpssB/neo and pSVpssA/neo (15Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which carry pssB andpssA cDNAs, respectively, from CHO-K1 cells and a G418-resistant gene were individually introduced into PSB-2 mutant cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (17Lewis W.H. Srinvasan P.R. Stokoe N. Simonovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1980; 6: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The resulting G418-resistant tranfectants were selected in growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin®; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 30 μm PS. pssB-transfected G418-resistant clones exhibiting serine base exchange activity similar to that of the PSA-3 mutant were screened by means of the in situ colony assay for serine base exchange, as described above, and then purified by limited dilution. pssA-transfected G418-resistant clones were purified by limited dilution. The radioactive labeling, detection, and quantification of radioactive phospholipids were performed as described in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7. The amount of protein was determined as described (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Figure 4The PSB-2 mutant is defective in the conversion of exogenous PE to PS.

Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate mutants with a further decrease in the serine base exchange activity, PSA-3 mutant cells were mutagenized and screened by means of anin situ assay for serine base exchange. Among approximately 50,000 colonies of mutagenized cells, a mutant clone, named PSB-1, with significantly decreased serine base exchange activity was found. The serine base exchange activity in the homogenate of the PSB-1 mutant cells was ∼50% of that in the PSA-3 homogenate (TableI). The ethanolamine base exchange activity in the PSB-1 homogenate was also decreased to ∼50% of that in the PSA-3 homogenate (Table I). Regardless of the decreases in the serine and ethanolamine base exchange activities, the PSB-1 mutant showed no remarkable alteration in cell growth, PS biosynthesis, or phospholipid composition compared with the parental strain, PSA-3 (data not shown).Table IThe serine, ethanolamine, and choline base exchange activities in homogenates of CHO-K1, PSA-3, PSB-1, and PSB-2 cellsStrainSubstrateSerineEthanolamineCholinenmol/h/mg of proteinCHO-K14.25.21.6PSA-32.04.2<0.05PSB-11.02.0<0.05PSB-20.20.6<0.05Cells were seeded in growth medium supplemented with 30 μm PS at 5–10 × 105 cells per 150-mm-diameter dish, and then grown at 33 °C for 5 days followed by incubation at 39.5 °C for 1 day.

Among approximately 10,000 colonies of mutagenized cells, a mutant clone, named PSB-2, with further decreased serine base exchange activity was found. The serine base exchange activity in the homogenate of the PSB-2 mutant cells was ∼20% of that in the PSB-1 homogenate, ∼10% of that in the PSA-3 homogenate, and ∼5% of that in the CHO-K1 homogenate (Table I). The ethanolamine base exchange activity in the PSB-2 homogenate was also decreased, in proportion to the decrease in the serine base exchange activity (Table I). The choline base exchange activity in the PSB-2 homogenate was negligible, as observed in the PSA-3 homogenate (Table I), indicating that the PSB-2 mutant remained defective in PSS I activity. CHO-K1, PSA-3, PSB-1, and PSB-2 cells were examined as to the level of the mRNA of pssB-encoded PSS II, which catalyzes serine and ethanolamine base exchange, but not choline base exchange (6Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Poly (A)+ RNAs from these cells cultivated with exogenous PS were probed with a 32P-labeled pssB cDNA fragment. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a 2.4-kilobase pssB-specific mRNA was detected among the RNAs from all the cell lines. The levels of the pssBmRNA in CHO-K1 and PSA-3 cells were similar to each other (Fig. 1 A). However, the pssB mRNA levels in PSB-1 and PSB-2 cells were decreased by ∼40 and ∼80% relative to those in CHO-K1 and PSA-3 cells, respectively (Fig. 1 A), when the radioactivity of the 2.4-kilobase pssB-specific band was determined using a bioimage analyzer (FUJIX BAS2000). The levels of an internal standard, β-actin mRNA, in all the cell lines were similar, as determined by reprobing with the β-actin cDNA fragment (Fig. 1 B). These results, obtained through Northern blot analysis and enzyme assaying for phospholipid base exchange, indicated that the PSB-2 mutant is defective in PSS II. The PSS I-defective PSA-3 mutant and the PSS I- and PSS II-defective PSB-2 mutant were incapable of growth in the medium without phospholipid supplementation, whereas CHO-K1 cells with normal PSS I and II activities were able to grow well in this medium (Fig. 2). Although the growth defect of the PSA-3 mutant was suppressed by the addition of either PS or PE to the medium, exogenous PS, but not exogenous PE, suppressed the growth defect of the PSB-2 mutant (Fig. 2). These results implied that PSS II is required for the exogenous PE-dependent restoration of cell growth of the PSA-3 mutant. The phospholipid compositions of CHO-K1, PSA-3, and PSB-2 cells cultivated in the medium without phospholipid supplementation or in the medium supplemented with exogenous PS or PE were determined. Both the PSB-2 and PSA-3 mutant cells cultivated without phospholipid supplementation exhibited significant decreases in the levels of PS and its metabolite, PE, a"

Gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein, and ricin, previously described as ribosome-inactivating proteins, are shown to damage single-stranded DNA by removal of a protein-specific set of adenines and cleavage at the resulting abasic sites. Using an oligonucleotide as the substrate reveals that the reaction proceeds via the enzyme-DNA imino intermediate characteristic of DNA glycosylase/AP lyases. The adenine glycosylase activity on single-stranded DNA reported here challenges the concept that a normal base has to be in a mismatch to be specifically removed. By contrast to other glycosylases, these enzymes are expected to damage DNA rather than participate in repair processes. The significance of this DNase activity to the biological function of these plant proteins and to their toxicity to animal cells remains to be determined.

Ricin and other related plant proteins such as abrin, gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), 1The abbreviations used are: PAP, pokeweed antiviral protein; RIP, ribosome inactivating protein; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; ss, single-stranded; ODN, oligodeoxyribonucleotide; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; bp, base pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and trichosanthin have been classified as ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) in reference to the fact that they inhibit protein synthesis by inactivation of the ribosomes (1Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of inactivation, elucidated in a cell-free system by Endo and colleagues (2Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the removal of a specific adenine of the 28 S rRNA. This damage, which has been shown to occur in RIP-treated cells, has been generally accepted as responsible for cytotoxicity (1Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). However, inPlasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, intoxication by gelonin was reported to be associated with the elimination of the parasite 6-kb extrachromosomal (mitochondrial) DNA (3Nicolas E. Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, some reports of anti-viral or anti-tumor activities of RIPs also suggest the possibility of additional cytotoxic pathways (4Teltow G.J. Irvin J.D. Aron G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 23: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5McGrath M.S. Hwang K.M. Caldwell S.E. Gaston I. Luk K.-C. Wu P. Ng V.L. Crowe S. Daniels J. Marsh J. Deinhart T.

Wang T.P. Bioorg. Chem. 1994; 22: 395-404Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) has not been given serious consideration because of concerns about contaminating nucleases in the protein preparations. More recent reports have described a preference for single-stranded (ss) DNA (11Roncuzzi L. Gasperi-Campani A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The polypeptide responsible for the (zinc-activated) degradation of linear ssDNA by preparations of gelonin, from both native and recombinant bacterial sources, has been identified as gelonin by zymography (12Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Conflicting conclusions have been reached on the possible mechanism of DNA degradation. On the basis of the observation that the nicked and linear forms generated by the action of RIPs on supercoiled DNA were not labeled by 3H-labeled sodium borohydride, unlike the fragment generated by the action on rRNA (10Ling J. Liu W.-Y. Wang T.P. Bioorg. Chem. 1994; 22: 395-404Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it was suggested that RIPs do not act by a DNA glycosylase mechanism (13Ling J. Li X.-D. Wu X.-H. Liu W.-Y. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because boiling ricin-A totally destroyed the activity on 28 S rRNA but only reduced the ability to cleave DNA, the activities were described to be independent (9Ling J. Liu W.-Y. Wang T.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Stirpe and co-workers (14Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), however, suggested that DNA breakage could spontaneously occur because of the weakening produced by the removal of adenines. In this investigation, our primary aim was to study the mechanism of DNA degradation of ssDNA by different RIPs, to reconcile, if possible, the recent descriptions of RIPs as polynucleotide:adenosine nucleosidases (15Barbieri L. Gorini P. Valbonesi P. Castiglioni P. Stirpe F. Nature. 1994; 372: 624Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), polynucleotide:adenosine glycosidases (16Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P.

The results reveal a new class of DNA glycosylase/AP lyases that act on specific adenines in ssDNA. Gelonin and ricin were purchased from Sigma. PAP was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corporation (Freehold, NJ). The proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, prior to use. Protein concentration was determined by reaction with bicinchonic acid (Pierce) using albumin as a standard. The pUC18 DNA plasmid and the 100-bp ladder were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides 28GR-A25 (5′-GTTGGGTCTCGCCTGGGTTTTCCCAGTC-3′), 28P-A14 (5′-TGGCGTCTGGGGGATGTGCTGCTCGGCG-3′), 28GR-U25, and 28P-U14 (with uracil in place of adenine) were purchased from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). [α-32P]dATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and SequenaseTM T7 polymerase were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Promega (Madison, WI); HindIII, Asp700, and G-25 Quickspin columns were from Boehringer Mannheim; uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA); TrevigelTM500 was from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD); and SDS-PAGE precast gradients gels (4–20%) were from Bio-Rad. Linear pUC18 DNA was prepared by incubation with HindIII, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The concentration was determined by absorption spectroscopy. The HindIII-Asp700 restriction fragments generated from pUC18 were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and Sequenase™ T7 polymerase. The 791-bp fragment labeled at the 3′ end of the HindIII site was isolated on a preparative, nondenaturing, 4% polyacrylamide gel. In some instances, 7 mol % of the radioactive fragment was added to unlabeled, linear pUC18 DNA. ssDNA was prepared by heat denaturation as described in Ref. 12Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. The ODNs were 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a G-25 Quickspin column equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, to remove the unincorporated label. In the assays with ODNs, activity was assayed by the inclusion of 1 mol %32P-ODN with the unlabeled ODN. The amounts of protein and DNA are indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and the products were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 16 mmHEPES-KOH, 16 mm sodium acetate, 0.8 mm EDTA (18Povirk L.F. Houlgrave C.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 380-385Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the inhibition study with NaBH4, a stock solution (1 m) was freshly prepared immediately prior to use. Assays were performed in the presence of 10 mm NaBH4or 10 mm NaCl. To assay for DNA glycosylase activity in the absence of detectable cleavage, a post-treatment with alkali (0.2m NaOH, 50 mm EDTA, 30 min, 4 °C) was performed before electrophoresis. When the radioactive fragment was included in the reaction mixture, assays were terminated by addition of formamide loading dye for direct loading onto a denaturing, 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel for electrophoresis in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) and autoradiography. To determine the location of the DNA cleavage sites, the products of the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions (19Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar) on the radioactive fragment were run as markers. 1 μg of gelonin or PAP or 2 μg of ricin, in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 0.1 mmZnSO4, was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with the appropriate oligonucleotide in a reaction volume of 10 μl at protein/DNA molar ratios of 2:1. To assay for DNA glycosylase activity in the absence of spontaneous cleavage, a post-treatment with 10 mm spermidine for 30 min at 37 °C was performed. Assays were terminated by addition of formamide loading dye for direct loading onto a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel for electrophoresis in TBE buffer and autoradiography. The trapping assay was adapted from Ref. 20Girard P.-M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. The oligonucleotides were added after a preincubation for 5 min at 37 °C of the proteins in the reaction buffer used above but supplemented with 10 mmNaCl or NaBH4. After 5 min at 37 °C, the samples were post-treated with spermidine as above and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a polyacrylamide 4–20% gradient gel after addition of loading buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and boiling. The gel was fixed, Coomassie-stained, photographed, and analyzed by autoradiography. Photographs and autoradiograms were scanned using a Hewlett Packard Scanjet 4C and processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0. RIPs have been divided into two classes according to their structure. Class I-RIPs are single-chain, basic proteins with a molecular mass of about 30,000 daltons. Class II-RIPs are neutral proteins composed of two dissimilar chains, of approximately 30,000 Da each, connected by a disulfide bridge. Their active chain is homologous to the class I-RIPs (1Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In this study, three RIPs were used. Gelonin and PAP belong to class I, whereas ricin belongs to class II. We have previously reported that ssDNA was the preferred substrate for the nuclease activity of gelonin and that this activity was modulated by zinc (12Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that PAP (lane 3) and ricin (lane 4), like gelonin (lane 2), degraded ssDNA in the presence of zinc. On a molar basis, the activity was gelonin > PAP > ricin. Electrophoresis on agarose gels under nondenaturing conditions has been widely used to demonstrate the activity of various RIPs on supercoiled (7Li M.-X Yeung H.-W. Pan L.-P. Chan S.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6309-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Go T.T.M. Yeung H.W. Fong W.P. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Ling J.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or linear (12Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) ssDNA. The appearance of nicked and linear forms or smears was indicative of backbone cleavage. Our first aim was to determine whether the removal of adenines by RIPs described by Barbieri et al. (14Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) is the first event in the degradation of ssDNA. The presence of abasic sites is commonly demonstrated by their conversion to nicks upon treatment with alkali (21Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the effect of RIPs on ssDNA under conditions of limited reaction when compared with Fig. 1 A. The appearance of a smear, only after post-treatment with alkali, was indicative of the existence of intermediates containing abasic sites but no nicks. Fig. 1 C showed that the inclusion of 10 mm sodium borohydride (NaBH4) during the incubation of RIPs with DNA prevented the degradation observed in Fig. 1 A. The presence of 10 mm NaCl had no detectable effect (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition was not because of interference with ionic interactions between RIPs and DNA. Higher concentrations of NaCl (>50 mm) inhibited the degradation of ssDNA (data not shown). The inhibition of cleavage by NaBH4 (Fig. 1 C) suggested that the DNA breakage caused by the RIPs in Fig. 1 A was because of a β-elimination reaction at the abasic sites, possibly by an associated AP lyase activity (22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Primary amine-containing buffers were avoided in these experiments as they were reported to be unsuitable for the assay of enzymes utilizing aldehydes as substrates and for electrophoresis of DNA containing abasic sites, because they can cause DNA breakage (18Povirk L.F. Houlgrave C.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 380-385Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Ray T. Mills R.T. Dyson P. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1 B indicated a significantly greater quantity of alkali-labile sites to authentic single-stranded breaks, suggesting the AP lyase activity, if present, was weak. To identify the bases removed by the DNA glycosylase activity of the RIPs, the electrophoretic mobilities of the alkali-catalyzed, β-elimination products can be compared with those of the products obtained by the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing procedure (19Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). To apply this strategy, a 3′ 32P end-labeled radioactive fragment of pUC18 DNA was included in the reaction mixture. The reaction conditions were chosen so that the alkali post-treatment was performed on intermediates containing abasic sites but no nicks (data not shown). Electrophoresis in Tris/borate/EDTA did not cleave these intermediates (data not shown). In Fig. 2 A, which shows a portion (C30-T105) of the autoradiogram of the sequencing gel, it was seen that the bands revealed by alkali treatment corresponded to breaks at sugars without adenine. Each protein had a specific set of targets. Gelonin and ricin had similar cleavage patterns, removing adenines 34, 38, 49, 64, and 73. PAP, in addition to adenines 64 and 73, also excised adenines 55, 67, and 82. The excision of 5 adenines of the 17 available between C30 and T105 may explain the appearance of smears in Fig. 1 A, which were suggestive of a sequence-unspecific mode of degradation. An extended incubation of DNA with RIPs, without chemical post-treatment, also fragmented the substrate (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 7Li M.-X Yeung H.-W. Pan L.-P. Chan S.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6309-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Go T.T.M. Yeung H.W. Fong W.P. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Ling J.

The products generated under these conditions had the same electrophoretic mobilities as the products generated by alkali-catalyzed β-elimination (Fig. 2 B). This indicated that the cleavage occurred at the 3′ side of the abasic sites. Glycosylase/AP lyases cleave the phosphodiester bond 3′ of the abasic site via a β-elimination reaction (22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The results in Figs. 1and 2 suggested that the RIPs were DNA glycosylases that had an associated weak AP lyase activity. A major distinction between simple DNA glycosylases and DNA glycosylase/AP lyases is that the latter group uses an amino group as the nucleophile to attack the sugar of the damaged base nucleotide (22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,24Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the former use a nucleophile from the medium, most likely a hydroxide ion or an associated water molecule. The glycosylase/AP lyase-DNA covalent intermediate can be trapped by reduction of the imino intermediate with NaBH4 (22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE when a 5′ 32P end-labeled ODN is used as substrate (20Girard P.-M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To apply this strategy to the characterization of RIPs, their activity on 28GR-A25 and 28P-A14 was first investigated (Fig. 3). These ODNs were designed by modification of fragments of the DNA used in Fig. 2. 28GR and 28P were chosen for the presence of adenines 38 and 82 that appear to be selective targets for gelonin or ricin and PAP, respectively (Fig. 2). 28GR-A25 and 28P-A14 contain only these adenines. The activity was measured at a RIP/ODN molar ratio of 2:1. Fig. 3 A shows that no scission products were detected by direct analysis after incubation of RIPs with 28GR-A25. Incubation of gelonin with 28GR-A25 (lane 4) produced a smear similar to the one produced by incubation of the simple glycosylase UDG with 28GR-U25 (lane 2). Incubation of PAP with 28P-A14 produced a smear similar to the one produced by incubation of UDG with 28P-U14 (data not shown). These smears, ascribed to the instability of electrophoresis of abasic site containing oligonucleotides (29DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were suggestive of adenine-DNA glycosylase activity of the RIPs on ODNs. The preference of gelonin for A25 of 28GR over A14 of 28P and of PAP for A14 of 28P over A25 of 28GR was as predicted from the analysis of Fig. 2. To confirm the hypothesis of adenine removal, the products were analyzed after post-treatment with the β-elimination catalyst spermidine (Fig. 3 B). As expected, incubation of gelonin with 28GR-A25 (2:1 molar ratio) and post-treatment with spermidine (lane 4) totally converted the 28-mer into a labeled product that co-migrated with the product of the incubation of UDG with 28GR-U25 and post-treatment with spermidine (lane 2), whereas incubation of PAP with 28P-A14 and post-treatment with spermidine (lane 11) produced a band that co-migrated with the product of the incubation of UDG with 28P-U14 (lane 8). The activity of gelonin on 28P-A14 (lane 10) was low, as was the activity of PAP on 28GR-A25 (lane 5). Ricin had a detectable glycosylase activity on A25 of 28GR (lane 6). It was concluded from Fig. 3 that RIPs remove adenine from single-stranded 28-mers with preferences similar to that observed with an 800-base substrate. There was no evidence of AP lyase activity on the ODNs. Because it has been proposed in the model for the glycosylase/AP lyase pathway (22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that the imino intermediate could be reversed after base removal so that no strand break would occur, the possibility of its formation was investigated using a NaBH4 trapping assay (Fig. 4). 28GR-A25, shown to be a substrate for all three RIPs in Fig. 3, was used as the substrate. The RIP/ODN molar ratio of 2:1, similar to the one used in Fig. 3, was in the range of the ratios used in Ref. 22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar to demonstrate the validity of the borohydride trapping assay for distinguishing between the simple glycosylases and the glycosylase/AP lyases. The 2:1 ratio was 50 times lower than was used to demonstrate the formation of the MutY-DNA intermediate (25Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Experiments aimed at defining the trapping assay conditions indicated that 10 mm was a suitable concentration of NaBH4 or NaCl to be used with gelonin and PAP because the presence of 10 mm NaBH4 during the incubation totally inhibited the alkali sensitivity, whereas cleavage was obtained with 10 mm NaCl (data not shown). This concentration was also used with ricin, despite the observation that 10 mm NaCl greatly reduced the glycosylase activity, since 10 mm NaBH4 was determined to be the minimal concentration required to inhibit the alkali sensitivity (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of the proteins is shown in Fig. 4 A. The bands of reduced mobility detected by autoradiography (Fig. 4 B) were consistent with the NaBH4 trapping of covalent gelonin-ODN (lane 2) and PAP-ODN (lane 4) complexes. The absence of signal inlane 6 was not unexpected, given the weak glycosylase activity of ricin. Surprisingly, the presence of NaBH4 did not appear to be an absolute requirement for complex detection, especially in the case of gelonin (lane 1). Complexes of similar molecular mass were also detected as minor reaction products, with all three RIPs, when aliquots of the samples previously analyzed by sequencing gel (Fig. 3) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Formation of complexes via a Schiff base between depurinated DNA and proteins (e.g. histones) that were stable at neutral pH have been observed previously (30Shick V.V. Belyavsky A.V. Bavykin S.G. Mirzabekov A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 491-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the detection of RIP-ODN complexes was unexpected, given that stabilization of the transition states by modification of the substrate or the enzyme is usually required to observe complexes between DNA and catalytic DNA binding proteins (31Iwai S. Maeda M. Shirai M. Shimada Y. Osafune T. Murata T. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Schärer O.D. Kawate T. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 78: 2742-2746Google Scholar). On the basis of the results of our investigation, the RIPs meet the established criteria (22Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be classified as DNA glycosylase/AP lyases. The description of a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity on ssDNA is unique, because UDGs, which are the only described DNA glycosylases with in vitro activity on ssDNA, do not have an associated lyase activity (21Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As was the case for several other DNA glycosylases (33Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the associated AP lyase activity that nicks DNA at the site of base removal led to the description of RIPs as “endonucleases.” In our investigation, the lyase activity was evident when full-length, single-stranded pUC18 (Fig. 1) or an 800-base fragment (Fig. 2) were used as substrates. The ability to detect intermediates containing abasic sites but no nicks (Figs. 1 and 2) suggested that, similar to the pyrimidine dimer-glycosylase/AP lyase T4 endonuclease V (34Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2742-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the AP lyase activity was weak. ODNs were substrates for adenine-DNA glycosylase activity but were not cleaved (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the absence of AP lyase activity of a native DNA glycosylase/AP lyase on an unmodified ODN. Chemical attachment of a fluorine atom at the 2′ position of the 5′ component of a thymine dimer site has been shown to inhibit the strand cleavage, but not the glycosylase activity, by T4 endonuclease V (31Iwai S. Maeda M. Shirai M. Shimada Y. Osafune T. Murata T. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the classification of enzymes as simple DNA glycosylases or DNA glycosylase/AP lyases should not rely solely on assays using oligonucleotides as substrates nor the NaBH4 trapping procedure. The proposed mechanism for the DNA glycosylase/AP lyase pathway (24Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) predicts that the fate of the covalent imino intermediate is to be hydrolyzed, either before or after the DNA undergoes a β-elimination reaction, resulting in scission of the phosphodiester backbone. Dissociation of the intermediate before the β-elimination reaction could explain the absence of detectable levels of scission products in Fig. 3 A. The cleavage of the 3′ C–O bond occurs after enzyme-assisted abstraction of the 2′-H (31Iwai S. Maeda M. Shirai M. Shimada Y. Osafune T. Murata T. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4601-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 36Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Schärer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the absence of cleavage of ODNs by RIPs despite base removal, which takes into account the observation of formation of stable complexes in the absence of NaBH4, could be that an essential residue, such as Glu23 of T4 endonuclease V (35Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,37Manuel R.C. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2652-2661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) cannot play its role in β-elimination but instead stabilizes the intermediate. The removal of a RIP-specific set of adenines has been established in Figs. 2 and 3. Whereas certain engineered mutations in the active site of human UDG resulted in novel enzymatic activities that released normal pyrimidines from DNA (38Kavli B. Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Petersen S.B. Tainer J.A. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3442-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), RIPs are the first natural glycosylases able to remove normal bases from DNA. With their unique ability to excise a specific set of undamaged bases from single-stranded DNA, RIPs should be of interest for structural biologists investigating the basis of base recognition by DNA glycosylases, because their activity challenges the concept that a normal base has to be in a mismatch to be specifically removed. Moreover, RIPs could, similarly to UDG, have practical applications in molecular biology. The proteins used in this study are from plants. They are known as ribosome-inactivating proteins, but their physiological function is not clear (1Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A possible role of RIPs could be in adenine metabolism, because enzymes that catalyze cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond in nucleotides, nucleosides, or related compounds are central to salvage pathways. The observation of their induction upon stress or senescence (39Stirpe F. Barbieri L. Gorini P. Valbonesi P. Bolognesi A. Polito L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggests that they could be involved in macromolecular turnover. Viral infection of sugar beets has been shown to induce the expression of RIPs (40Girbès T. de Torre C. Iglesias R. Ferreras J.M. Méndez E. Nature. 1996; 379: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although DNA glycosylases can be seen as defenses against potentially injurious modifications of DNA, RIPs now described as adenine-ssDNA glycosylase/AP lyases could have a protective function by damaging the genetic material of invading pathogens. In addition to uses in agribiology (41Shah D.M. Rommens C.M.T. Beachy R.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 362-369Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar), RIPs are being evaluated for their anti-cancer (42Frankel A.E. Tagge E.P. Willingham M.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or anti-viral efficacy in humans (43Kahn J.O. Gorelick K.J. Gatti G. Arri C.J. Lifson J.D. Gambertoglio J.G. Bostrom A. Williams R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Some reports have suggested that their effects may not be (only) because of inhibition of protein synthesis (3Nicolas E. Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Teltow G.J. Irvin J.D. Aron G.M. Antimicrob.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The observations of selective inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by PAP (4Teltow G.J. Irvin J.D. Aron G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 23: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or elimination of the parasite 6-kb extrachromosomal (mitochondrial) DNA of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes by gelonin (3Nicolas E. Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are consistent with a DNA damaging activity of RIPs. The characterization of the activities on DNA of proteins such as the C-terminal deletion mutant of PAP that inhibits viral infection but does not depurinate host ribosomes (6Tumer N.E. Hwang D.-J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) might give a better insight into the origin of their anti-viral effect. DNA glycosylases are classically described as enzymes of the DNA repair pathway (44Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In the last few years, it has become clear that defects in genes that maintain the integrity of the genome may be causes of inherited predispositions to cancer (45Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 386: 761-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The expression of the UDG engineered mutants that release normal pyrimidines in Escherichia coli has been shown to cause mutations and cytotoxicity (38Kavli B. Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Petersen S.B. Tainer J.A. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3442-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fact that three of the four mutant pyrimidine-DNA glycosylases were produced by single nucleotide substitutions led to the suggestion of the possible natural existence of such enzymes (38Kavli B. Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Petersen S.B. Tainer J.A. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3442-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mutations in DNA glycosylase genes that lead to expression of proteins, which, similar to RIPs, are able to remove normal bases, could be linked to certain (human) diseases. Plant RIPs are a family of enzymes whose physiological function is unknown and whose pharmacological activities do not appear to be solely because of the “classical” property of inhibitors of protein synthesis after which they were named. On the basis of activities observed on various substrates in vitro, it had been proposed to reclassify them as polynucleotide:adenosine nucleosidases (15Barbieri L. Gorini P. Valbonesi P. Castiglioni P. Stirpe F. Nature. 1994; 372: 624Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or polynucleotide:adenosine glycosidases (14Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These terminologies appear to be inappropriate. We propose to postpone the renaming of these proteins until their physiological role and cytotoxic pathways are better characterized. We thank Dr. Mary-Ann Bjornsti for valuable discussions and Jolanta Fertala for technical advice in the Maxam- Gilbert sequencing procedure."

Recombination fragment imaging yields state-to-state reaction rates. These rates are converted to rate coefficients by using vibrational level populations of the stored ion beam, derived from nuclear coordinate distributions measured on extracted ions. The results show strongly increasing rate coefficients for high vibrational excitation, where additional dissociation routes open up, in agreement with a theoretical calculation. Very low rate coefficients are found for certain, isolated vibrational states."
https://openalex.org/W1992930517,"The phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide array of phosphotriesters and related phosphonates, including organophosphate pesticides and military nerve agents. It has now been shown that this enzyme can also catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters, albeit at a greatly reduced rate. However, the enzymatic hydrolysis of ethyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (compound I) by the wild-type enzyme was >108 times faster than the uncatalyzed reaction (kcat = 0.06 s−1 andKm = 38 mm). Upon the addition of various alkylamines to the reaction mixture, thekcat/Km for the phosphodiester (compound I) increased up to 200-fold. Four mutant enzymes of the phosphotriesterase were constructed in a preliminary attempt to improve phosphodiester hydrolysis activity of the native enzyme. Met-317, which is thought to reside in close proximity to the pro-S-ethoxy arm of the paraoxon substrate, was mutated to arginine, alanine, histidine, and lysine. These mutant enzymes showed slight improvements in the catalytic hydrolysis of organophosphate diesters. The M317K mutant enzyme displayed the most improvement in catalytic activity (kcat = 0.34 s−1 and Km = 30 mm). The M317A mutant enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester (compound I) in the presence of alkylamines up to 200 times faster than the wild-type enzyme in the absence of added amines. The neutralization of the negative charge on the oxygen atom of the phosphodiester by the ammonium cation within the active site is thought to be responsible for the rate enhancement by these amines in the hydrolytic reaction. These results demonstrate that an active site optimized for the hydrolysis of organophosphate triesters can be made to catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphate diesters.

These results demonstrate that an active site optimized for the hydrolysis of organophosphate triesters can be made to catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphate diesters. The bacterial phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide range of organophosphate nerve agents with high efficiency (1Dumas D.P. Caldwell S.R. Wild J.R.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4650-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Paraoxon, the best characterized substrate for the zinc-substituted phosphotriesterase, is hydrolyzed with akcat/Km of 4 × 107m−1 s−1 and akcat of 2100 s−1. The active site of this enzyme contains a coupled binuclear metal center, which is absolutely essential for catalytic activity (1Dumas D.P. Caldwell S.R. Wild J.R. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native enzyme contains two Zn2+ ions, but these metal ions can be replaced with Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, or Cd2+ with retention of full catalytic activity. From chemical, kinetic, and genetic studies, it has been demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via an Sn2-like associative mechanism in which a metal-bound hydroxide ion attacks the electrophilic phosphorus center of the substrate (2Donarski W.J.

The role of one of the two metal ions within the active site is thought to involve the activation of the hydrolytic water molecule, whereas the companion metal ion is most likely involved in the polarization of the phosphoryl oxygen bond of the substrate to increase the electrophilicity of the substrate for nucleophilic attack (16Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10904-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the substrate-binding site pocket consists predominantly of hydrophobic residues (12Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that can readily accommodate a variety of nonpolar organophosphate triesters, which explains, in part, the relatively broad substrate specificity of this enzyme. Phosphodiesters are chemically more resistant to hydrolysis than are phosphotriesters. For example, it has been estimated that ethyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (StructureFs1, compound I) spontaneously hydrolyzes with kobs ≤ 10−10s−1 at 25 °C and pH 8 (17Hendry P. Sargeson A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2521-2527Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas under the same reaction conditions, the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of paraoxon, diethyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Structure Fs1, compound II), proceeds with a rate constant of ∼10−7 s−1(1Dumas D.P. Caldwell S.R. Wild J.R. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exceptional chemical stability of the phosphodiester backbone in molecules such as RNA and DNA facilitates the conservation of genetic information.

However, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond is typically much faster than the small molecule mimics. Many enzymes are known to catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond, with kcat values ranging from 10−2 to 103 s−1. This class of enzymes includes, for example, the hammerhead ribozyme, which catalyzes the site-specific hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond withkcat ∼ 1 min−1 (24Birikh K.R. Heaton P.A. Eckstein F.

The existence of phosphotriesters in nature is decidedly quite rare, and thus, it is still unclear as to the origin of the metabolic pressure for the selection and enhancement of the enormous catalytic activity exhibited by the bacterial phosphotriesterase from P. diminuta. Since the catalytic machinery required for the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters is apparently similar to the binuclear metal center found within the active site of phosphotriesterase, we anticipated that phosphotriesterase would possess an inherent ability to hydrolyze phosphodiester substrates. However, the active site of phosphotriesterase is filled predominantly with hydrophobic residues, and thus, this site may not be suitable for the accommodation of the negatively charged phosphodiesters. In this paper, we provide direct experimental evidence to support the conclusion that the bacterial phosphotriesterase has a significant amount of phosphodiesterase activity. Moreover, the rate enhancement can be intensified by the incorporation of a positive charge within the active site, either through site-directed mutagenesis or the addition of alkylamines to the aqueous medium. The bacterial phosphotriesterase and the metal-substituted derivatives were isolated as described previously (29Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphotriesterase variants (M317A, M317H, M317K, and M317R) was carried out as described previously (8Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4265-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Kuo J.M. Chae M.Y. Raushel F.M.

Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the chemicals used in these experiments were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, Fisher, or U. S. Biochemical Corp. Biochemical supplies were purchased from Promega, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bio 101, Inc., Perkin-Elmer, or Hoffmann-La Roche. The synthesis of oligonucleotides and DNA sequencing reactions were carried out in the Gene Technology Laboratory of the Biology Department at Texas A&M University. Compound I was synthesized according to the procedure of Hendry and Sargeson (17Hendry P. Sargeson A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2521-2527Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Compounds III–VI (StructureFs2) were synthesized by a similar procedure with the following modifications. Ethyl dichlorophosphate (12.3 mmol, 1.46 ml) was mixed with triethylamine (12.3 mmol, 1.72 ml) in dry ethyl ether (10 ml). One equivalent of the substituted phenol, dissolved in dry ethyl ether (20 ml), was added dropwise to this solution over a period of 30 min at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred for 1 h; triethylamine (1.72 ml) was added to the mixture; and the stirring was continued for an additional 15 min. Finally, water (5 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The product was extracted three times with 30-ml portions of a solution of 0.2m aqueous triethanolamine hydrochloride, and then the water was removed in vacuo. The resulting white solid was resuspended in tetrahydrofuran, and then the insoluble salt was removed by filtration. The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent was removed. The resulting crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and subsequently washed with 30 ml of 2n hydrochloric acid to remove the phosphomonoester impurity. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo to obtain the desired phosphodiester. The structures of compoundsI–VI were confirmed by 1H and13C NMR spectroscopy. Spectroscopic determinations were made using a Gilford 260 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The reactions were followed by monitoring the appearance of the substituted phenol from the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester (1–20 mm) upon the addition of the phosphotriesterase at 25 °C. The pKa values, extinction coefficients at pH 9.0, and λmax values of the leaving group phenols were obtained from the literature (3Caldwell S.R. Newcomb J.R. Schlecht K.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7438-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients at different pH values were calculated using Equation 1, ε=εo/(10(pKa−pH)+1)Equation 1 where εo is the extinction coefficient of the substituted phenolate anion. Stock solutions of the various amines were made at 2.5–5.0 m concentrations, and pH values were adjusted using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The values of kcat andKm were determined by fitting the kinetic data to Equation 2, v=VmaxA/(Km+A)Equation 2 where v is the initial velocity,kcat is the maximum velocity,Km is the Michaelis constant, and A is the substrate concentration. The pH-rate profiles were analyzed by fitting the data to Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 to obtain the pKvalues. log(V/Km)=log[c/(1+[H+]/Ka)]Equation 3 log(V/Km)=log[c/(1+Kb/[H+])]Equation 4 log(V/Km)=log[c/(1+[H+]/Ka+Kb/[H+])]Equation 5 The Brønsted plots were fit to straight lines, and the β values were obtained directly from the slopes of these lines. The kinetic data from the experiment where the phosphodiester concentration was varied at different levels of methylamine were fit to Equation6, v=Vmax(KA+β/α[B])[A]KmKA+KA[A]+Km[B]+[A][B]/αEquation 6 where A is the concentration of phosphodiester,B is the concentration of amine, Km is the Michaelis constant of the phosphodiester in the absence of added amine, Vmax is the maximum velocity in the absence of added amine, Ka is the equilibrium constant for the formation of an enzyme-amine complex, and α and β are the ratios of Km (or KA) andVmax in the presence and absence of added methylamine, respectively. Compound I was tested as a substrate for the cobalt-substituted bacterial phosphotriesterase. The rate of hydrolysis of compound I catalyzed by the phosphotriesterase was very slow (kcat = 0.06 ± 0.01 s−1and kcat/Km = 1.6 ± 0.3m−1 s−1 at pH 9.0) compared with that of paraoxon (kcat = 8600 s−1and kcat/Km = 4.3 × 107m−1 s−1 at pH 9.0), but was >108 times faster than the uncatalyzed reaction under similar reaction conditions. The phosphotriesterase used for this study was purified by gel filtration. The phosphodiesterase and phosphotriesterase activities for compounds I andII were measured for each fraction during the purification in addition to the absorbance readings at 280 nm. A plot of these activities versus the fraction number is presented in Fig. 1 and serves to illustrate the coincidence of the two activities during the purification. Four mutant enzymes were also prepared in a preliminary attempt to enhance the overall rate of phosphodiesterase activity exhibited by the native enzyme. Of the four mutant enzymes, M317K catalyzed the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester test substrate (compound I) with the highest kinetic constants (kcat = 0.34 ± 0.03 s−1 andkcat/Km = 11 ± 1m−1 s−1 at pH 9.0). The kinetic constants for the other mutants (M317A, M317R, and M317H) are listed in Table I.Table IKinetic constants for the mutant enzymes with phosphodiester and paraoxonPhosphotriester (II)Phosphodiester (I)kcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kms−1mmm−1s−1s−1mmm−1s−1Wild-type86000.204.3 × 1070.06381.6M317A27500.299.5 × 1060.18355.1M317H36500.655.6 × 1060.05431.1M317K19700.663.0 × 1060.343011M317R1201.11.1 × 1050.09293.1Conditions were pH 9.0 and 25 °C for the cobalt-substituted phosphotriesterase.

The data were fit to Equation 2, and the standard errors for each of the kinetic constants reported below were <25% of the stated values. The slow hydrolysis rate of compound I was accelerated up to 200-fold when various alkylamines (0.1–2.0 m) were added to the reaction mixture. The kinetic constants for these rate enhancements are summarized in Table II. In general, a greater rate acceleration was observed for the wild-type enzyme when amines with shorter and/or branched alkyl chains were added. Secondary amines showed a larger enhancement than primary amines. The greatest rate enhancement was observed with 2.0m dimethylamine (kcat = 0.23 ± 0.01 s−1 andkcat/Km = 260 ± 30m−1 s−1 at pH 9.0). For the M317A mutant enzyme, amines with longer alkyl chains yielded greater enhancements (Table III).t-Pentylamine was the best activator for this mutant enzyme (kcat = 3.8 ± 0.1 s−1 andkcat/Km = 210 ± 10m−1 s−1 at pH 9.0). No enhancement of the phosphodiesterase activity of the wild-type phosphotriesterase was observed in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ at concentrations of <100 mm.Table IIEffect of added amines on phosphodiester (compound I) hydrolysis by phosphotriesteraseAmine[Amine]aConcentration of amine used to enhance the phosphodiesterase activity of phosphotriesterase.kcatKmkcat/Kmms−1mmm −1s−1Ammonia0.750.28309.2Methyl0.500.308.734Ethyl0.380.207.825Propyl0.250.12254.9Butyl0.100.06163.9i-Propyl0.500.331130i-Butyl0.250.18286.5t-Butyl0.503.53697t-Pentyl0.501.52462Dimethyl2.00.230.87260Diethyl0.350.14206.9Trimethyl0.505.138135Guanidine0.400.601835These assays were conducted at 25 °C and pH 9.0.

The pH-rate profiles of log(V/Km) versus pH were made without any amine added (Fig. 2 A) and also with either guanidine (Fig. 2 B) or dimethylamine (Fig. 2 C) in the reaction mixtures. In general, the reactions were very slow and theKm values were very large when no amine was added, and thus, only V/Km values could be determined with sufficient confidence. In the pH profile without added amine, it can be seen that protonation of a single group accelerates the catalytic reaction. The pKa value of this functional group could not be determined from the experimental data obtained over the pH range of 6.4–9.6. When guanidine was added, protonation of a single group diminished the reaction rate. From a least-square fit of the data to Equation 3, the pKavalue of this group was determined to be 6.5 ± 0.2. Two ionizable groups are involved in the enzymatic reaction in the presence of dimethylamine. Fitting of the data to Equation 5 yielded pKa values of 5.8 ± 0.2 and 9.1 ± 0.1 for these two groups. The pH-rate profiles for phosphodiester hydrolysis by the M317H and M317R mutant enzymes were also obtained. The profiles of log(V/Km)versus pH for both enzymes show a drop in activity above pH ∼7 (data not shown). From a fit of these data to Equation 4, pKa values of 7.7 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.1 were obtained for the M317H and M317R mutants, respectively. The effects of substitution of the binuclear metal center of the wild-type phosphotriesterase with Co2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ at pH 7 and 9 are presented in Table IV. The kinetic constants for paraoxon (compound II) hydrolysis are presented for comparison. The Co2+-substituted enzyme shows the highest kcat value for phosphodiester (compound I) hydrolysis as well as for paraoxon (compoundII) hydrolysis. The relative magnitude of thekcat values (Co2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+) at pH 9 is similar to that of paraoxon hydrolysis.Table IVHydrolysis of phosphodiester (compound I) and paraoxon by the metal-substituted enzymesEthyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphateParaoxon, pH 9pH 7pH 9No amineMe2NHNo amineMe2NHkcatKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatKms−1mms−1mms−1mms−1mms−1mmCo2+0.13180.191.70.06380.230.8786000.2Zn2+0.0086.30.087.1NDaThese constants could not be determined because the reaction rates were too slow to measure accurately.ND0.126.517000.05Cd2+0.014130.041.5NDND0.162639000.3These assays were conducted at 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab These assays were conducted at 25 °C. The data were fit to Equation2. The standard errors are <25% of the stated values. The added amine and phosphodiester concentrations were varied together in order to elucidate the kinetic mechanism for the enhancement reaction. The overall reaction rate was increased with increasing amounts of methylamine (Fig. 3), and these data were fit to Equation 5. The values of kcat andKm are 0.06 ± 0.01 s−1 and 38 ± 10 mm, respectively. The α and β values are 0.03 ± 0.02 and 7 ± 2, respectively. These values demonstrate that the addition of the amine decreasesKm and increases kcat. Kinetic constants were determined for compounds I andIII–VI in the presence and absence of trimethylamine. Trimethylamine was selected because primary and secondary amines form imine or iminium adducts with the carbonyl groups of compoundsIII and V. In the absence of added amine, onlyV/Km values could be determined because the Km values were too large to be accurately measured. The Brønsted plots (Fig. 4) show a linear relationship between the pKa values of the leaving group and log(Vmax) or log(V/Km). The β values are −1.3 ± 0.3 and −1.7 ± 0.1 for log V/Km in the absence and presence of added amine, respectively. The β value forVmax in the presence of added amine is −1.9 ± 0.4. The full negative charge within the phosphodiester substrate is thought to be primarily responsible for the slow rate of catalytic hydrolysis of these compounds by the phosphotriesterase. The active site of the phosphotriesterase is largely hydrophobic (12Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and thus, it would not be expected to accommodate the negative charge on the substrate very well. Furthermore, the nucleophile in the active site, i.e.metal-bound hydroxide ion, may not be able to attack the anionic substrate effectively. As a result, the phosphodiesters have diminishedkcat and elevated Km values. To enhance the hydrolytic reaction rate, cations were added to the reaction medium in an attempt to neutralize the negative charge of the substrate. Alkylamines were selected because they are cationic in the pH range used for this investigation, and the size and hydrophobicity could easily be controlled by varying the number and the length of the alkyl chains. For the wild-type enzyme, faster reaction rates were observed when amines with shorter alkyl chains were added, whereas the M317A mutant enzyme preferred amines with longer alkyl chains. Met-317 is located within the pro-S-binding pocket of the enzyme active site (12Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It was thought that by mutating the methionine residue to a smaller alanine residue, larger amines could be accommodated more effectively. Amines with branched alkyl chains accelerated the reaction faster than amines with straight chains, and secondary amines were more effective than primary amines in enhancing the reaction. The reasons for these preferences are not yet clear. The other three mutant enzymes, M317H, M317K, and M317R, were designed to incorporate a cationic group within the enzyme active site without adding amines from the external medium. The rate enhancements were not very large, and the pH-rate profiles showed a pattern similar to that of the wild-type enzyme without added amine. It appears that these mutant enzymes catalyze the phosphodiesterase reaction with little help from the substituted cationic residues, with the possible exception of M317K, which showed a 7-fold enhancement ofkcat/Km. The small rate enhancement by these mutations could, in part, be attributed to the distance between Met-317 and a substrate analogue bound in the enzyme active site (Fig. 5). The distance between the thiomethyl group of the side chain of Met-317 and the phosphorus center of the bound substrate analogue is 8.2 Å (12Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). When this methionine residue is replaced with other amino acid residues with cationic side chains (arginine and lysine), the distance between the positive charge of the new side chains and the negative charge of a bound phosphodiester substrate was estimated to be ∼6 Å using Insight II (Biosym Technologies) to model the approximate locations of the substrate and mutated amino acid. Many previous attempts have been made to construct mutant enzymes with altered substrate specificity. For example, the arginine residue of aspartate aminotransferase that ion pairs with the side chain carboxylate of the substrate was mutated to aspartate in an attempt to change the substrate specificity of this enzyme from aspartate to the cationic amino acids (lysine and arginine). Rate enhancements of 9–16-fold of the kcat/Kmvalues for lysine and arginine were observed (31Cronin C.N. Malcom B.A. Kirsch J.F. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2222-2223Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study using the same enzyme, thekcat/Km value for the transamination of phenylalanine was increased 1500-fold after mutation of six active-site residues (32Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pH profile for diester hydrolysis in the absence of added amine shows that a particular group needs to be protonated for catalytic activity. This group could be either the P-O− group of the phosphodiester substrate or the metal-bound hydroxide ion. The protonation of the substrate would accelerate the reaction by neutralizing the negative charge of the substrate and making it appear more like a phosphotriester. On the other hand, protonation of the metal-bound hydroxide would reduce the nucleophilicity of the attacking group, but charge repulsion would be reduced, and the overall reaction rate may be enhanced. The pH-rate profile in the presence of 1.0 m dimethylamine displays a bell-shaped curve, suggesting that there are two ionizable groups involved in the catalytic reaction. One of these may be the metal-bound water (pKa = 5.8), whereas the other may be dimethylamine (pKa = 9.1). The reaction rate decreases at low pH, where the bound hydroxide is protonated, and also at high pH, where the amine itself is deprotonated. The pH profile in the presence of 0.4 m guanidine shows a somewhat different behavior. The rate increases as the pH increases, until it is saturated at pH ∼8. The pKa of the group is 6.5, and from this value and the shape of the profile, it is thought that this group is the metal-bound water molecule (16Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10904-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Unlike the case with dimethylamine, the rate does not decrease at high pH because guanidinium cation cannot be deprotonated below pH 10. The pH profiles of the M317H and M317R mutant enzymes for phosphodiester hydrolysis were also measured. The patterns of these profiles were similar to the one obtained with the wild-type enzyme reaction without added amine. The M317R profile shows a loss of activity at high pH, whereas the profile of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 0.4 m guanidine shows a loss of activity at low pH. It appears that the guanidine group of the M317R mutant enzyme is not properly located for effective charge neutralization, and the reaction proceeds without significant assistance from the cationic residue. The relatively small 2-fold enhancement of thekcat/Km value supports this view. Kinetic measurements were made at six different methylamine concentrations in an effort to elucidate the kinetic mechanism of the amine-assisted enzymatic reaction. The data and the least-square fit are shown in Fig. 3. Equation 5, to which the kinetic data were fit, was derived from the mechanism shown in Scheme 1. E+A⇌Km+B⥮KAEB+A⇌αKmEA→kcatE+P+B⥮αKAEAB→βkcatE+P+B SCHEME1In this mechanism, the amine forms a complex with the enzyme, and then the substrate adds to form an enzyme-amine-substrate complex. This ternary complex is then hydrolyzed prior to the release of the products. When [B] = 0, the reaction mechanism becomes a simple Michaelis-Menten-type reaction with kcat= 0.06 s−1 and Km = 38 mm. The amine-assisted pathway has a faster kcat(β = 7) and a smaller Km (α = 0.03) than the non-assisted pathway. An alternative mechanism in which a substrate-amine complex (AB) is formed prior to binding to the active site did not fit the experimental data. The Brønsted plots for the dependence of log(V/Km) on the pKaof the leaving group in the absence and presence of trimethylamine have βlg values of −1.3 and −1.7, respectively (Fig. 4). The large negative βlg values strongly suggest that the chemical step is the rate-limiting step, and the transition state of the reaction has considerable product-like character. In the presence of trimethylamine, the plot of log(Vmax)versus pKa of the leaving groups has a slope of −1.9 and was slightly more negative than the slope of the log(V/Km) versuspKa plot of the same reaction (−1.7). The data presented in this paper demonstrate that the catalytic machinery that has evolved for the hydrolysis of phosphotriesters can be exploited to effectively hydrolyze phosphodiester substrates. The biggest obstacle the phosphotriesterase has in recognition of phosphodiester substrates is in accommodation of the negative charge and the loss of binding energy derived from the missing alkyl substituent. These factors can, in part, be overcome through chemical rescue via the addition of alkylamines from the external medium. Attempts to accomplish the same aim through site-directed mutagenesis were less successful. The most likely cause for this failure is the imprecise placement of the positive charge from the mutant residue. Therefore, further work is ongoing to construct and characterize mutant enzymes that can more effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds. A working model for phosphodiester hydrolysis as catalyzed by the bacterial phosphotriesterase is presented in Fig. 6. The phosphoryl oxygen bond is polarized by the metal ions, and the negative charge is neutralized by the added amine. The suggested mechanism is similar to that of the phosphotriester hydrolysis (16Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10904-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), where the metal ions polarize the phosphoryl oxygen bond and the metal-bound hydroxide attacks the phosphorus atom."
https://openalex.org/W2088225521,"Calnexin is a lectin-like chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that couples temporally and spatiallyN-linked oligosaccharide modifications with the productive folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Calnexin was originally identified as a major type I integral membrane protein substrate of kinase(s) associated with the ER. Casein kinase II (CK2) was subsequently identified as an ER-associated kinase responsible for thein vitro phosphorylation of calnexin in microsomes (Ou, W-J., Thomas, D. Y., Bell, A. W., and Bergeron, J. J. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23789–23796). We now report on the in vivo sites of calnexin phosphorylation. After 32PO4 labeling of HepG2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, immunoprecipitated calnexin was phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues. Using nonradiolabeled cells, we subjected calnexin immunoprecipitates to in gel tryptic digestion followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry employing selective scans specific for detection of phosphorylated fragments. Mass analyses identified three phosphorylated sites in calnexin from either HepG2 or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The three sites were localized to the more carboxyl-terminal half of the cytosolic domain: S534DAE (CK2 motif), S544QEE (CK2 motif), and S563PR. We conclude that CK2 is a kinase that phosphorylates calnexin in vivo as well as in microsomes in vitro. Another yet to be identified kinase (protein kinase C and/or proline-directed kinase) is directed toward the most COOH-terminal serine residue. Elucidation of the signaling cascade responsible for calnexin phosphorylation at these sitesin vivo may define a novel regulatory function for calnexin in cargo folding and transport to the ER exit sites. Calnexin is a lectin-like chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that couples temporally and spatiallyN-linked oligosaccharide modifications with the productive folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Calnexin was originally identified as a major type I integral membrane protein substrate of kinase(s) associated with the ER. Casein kinase II (CK2) was subsequently identified as an ER-associated kinase responsible for thein vitro phosphorylation of calnexin in microsomes (Ou, W-J., Thomas, D. Y., Bell, A. W., and Bergeron, J. J. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23789–23796). We now report on the in vivo sites of calnexin phosphorylation. After 32PO4 labeling of HepG2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, immunoprecipitated calnexin was phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues. Using nonradiolabeled cells, we subjected calnexin immunoprecipitates to in gel tryptic digestion followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry employing selective scans specific for detection of phosphorylated fragments. Mass analyses identified three phosphorylated sites in calnexin from either HepG2 or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The three sites were localized to the more carboxyl-terminal half of the cytosolic domain: S534DAE (CK2 motif), S544QEE (CK2 motif), and S563PR. We conclude that CK2 is a kinase that phosphorylates calnexin in vivo as well as in microsomes in vitro. Another yet to be identified kinase (protein kinase C and/or proline-directed kinase) is directed toward the most COOH-terminal serine residue. Elucidation of the signaling cascade responsible for calnexin phosphorylation at these sitesin vivo may define a novel regulatory function for calnexin in cargo folding and transport to the ER exit sites. Calnexin was originally identified and purified as a constituent of a complex of four co-isolated integral membrane proteins, two of which were phosphorylated in microsomes by ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DE-MALDI, delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; ToF, time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry; nano-ESI, nanoelectrospray ionization; CNL, constant neutral loss; TLC, thin layer cellulose; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; CK2, casein kinase II; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PKC, protein kinase C; PDK, proline-directed kinase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. -associated kinase(s) (1Wada I.

As a consequence of the cDNA cloning of this phosphoprotein, it was predicted and subsequently confirmed to be a type I integral membrane protein with extensive sequence similarity in its luminal domain to the ER luminal resident protein, calreticulin (1Wada I.

These chaperones act as lectins to couple oligosaccharide modifications to newly synthesized N-linked glycoproteins with productive glycoprotein folding. The lectin specificity of these chaperones has been identified as the recognition of high mannose oligosaccharides terminating in monoglucosyl residues linked α1–3 (3Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y.

Purification of the ER-associated kinase that phosphorylated calnexin in microsomes led to the identification of CK2 (14Ou W-J. Thomas D.Y. Bell A.W. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol.

The properties of this kinase were consistent with the conditions that originally revealed calnexin phosphorylation (1Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W-J. Doherty, II J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W.

Furthermore, purified CK2 has been found to phosphorylate calnexin on putative CK2 sites found within the cytosolic domain of calnexin (14Ou W-J. Thomas D.Y. Bell A.W. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol.

Green G.A. Girardot R. Monteil H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated calnexin has been shown to associate with the null Hong Kong mutant of α-1-antitrypsin, coinciding with retention of this misfolded glycoprotein within the lumen of the ER (16Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated calnexin was also found in association with newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex class I allotypes, which egressed from the ER at slow rates. Those allotypes transported to the Golgi apparatus at more rapid rates were associated preferentially with nonphosphorylated calnexin (17Capps G.G. Zuniga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged association of newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains with calnexin was found in a B lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with HLA-B701 after incubation with the phosphatase inhibitor cantharidin or okadaic acid (19Tector M. Zhang Q. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25816-25822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when human synovial epithelial (McCoy) cells were treated with okadaic acid, the major cellular protein whose phosphorylation was shown to increase (based on two-dimensional gels followed by protein microsequencing) was calnexin (18Schue V. Green G.A. Girardot R. Monteil H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Remarkably, calnexin phosphorylation also increased 3-fold when McCoy cells were treated with Clostridium difficile cytotoxin B (18Schue V. Green G.A. Girardot R. Monteil H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Although some progress has been made on the kinases and sites of phosphorylation of calnexin after in vitro phosphorylation of intact microsomes (14Ou W-J. Thomas D.Y. Bell A.W. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23789-23796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cala S.E. Ulbright C. Kelley J.S. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2969-2975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) little is known of the sites of calnexin phosphorylation in vivo. Here we report on their identification in two mammalian cell lines, HepG2 cells (human) and Madin-Darby canine kidney MDCK cells. Both cell lines revealed phosphorylation of the cytosolic domain of calnexin exclusively on serine residues within CK2 motifs as well as a protein kinase C (PKC) and/or proline-directed kinase (PDK) motif. Rabbit antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide, corresponding to amino acid residues 487–505 of canine calnexin, described previously were used (3Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar).32P-Orthophosphoric acid (specific activity > 8000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pyridine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and HEPES were from Sigma. Sequencing grade bovine trypsin was from Boehringer Mannheim. TLC microcrystalline plates (0.1-mm thickness) were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Kodak XAR-5 OMAT film was purchased from Picker International Canada Inc. (Montreal, Quebec). Reagents for SDS-PAGE and protein determination were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were from Sigma, Anachemia Canada Inc. (Lachine, Quebec), or Boehringer Mannheim. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, dialyzed FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. FBS was obtained from HyClone Laboratories, Inc. (Logan, UT). Both human hepatoma (HepG2) cells and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 500 units/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml of streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% atmospheric CO2and used when they were 80% confluent. Cells were radiolabeled as described previously (16Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Capps G.G. Zuniga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed FBS followed by incubation in the same medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then labeled by the addition of 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. At the end of labeling, the cells were lysed as described previously (3Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and once with ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl) before harvesting. Cells were then lysed in 2% CHAPS/HEPES-buffered saline lysis buffer (2% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 0.4 mmNaVO4, and 5 mm NaMoO4) for 30 min on ice. The same procedures were used to immunoprecipitate calnexin from both 32P-labeled and cold phosphate-labeled cellular extracts as described previously (3Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated calnexin was isolated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried for 2 h at 80 °C under vacuum, or the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (1Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W-J. Doherty, II J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were visualized by radioautography at room temperature. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (21Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vivo phosphorylated calnexin was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. 32P-Labeled calnexin was detected by radioautography, and the corresponding PVDF bands were excised. The membrane containing phosphorylated calnexin was washed extensively with distilled water and subjected to acid hydrolysis, immersed in 6n HCl at 110 °C for 60 min. The hydrolysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, lyophilized, and dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer (88% formic acid, glacial acetic acid, H2O; 2.5:7.8:89.7 (v/v/v)). Phosphoamino acid analysis was by two-dimensional electrophoresis on TLC plates in the presence of phosphoamino acid standards; phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. First dimension electrophoresis was carried out in pH 1.9 buffer for 20 min at 1.3 kV employing a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific, Del Mar, CA). Second dimension electrophoresis was carried out in pH 3.5 buffer (pyridine, glacial acetic acid, H2O; 0.5:5:94.5 (v/v/v)) at 1.5 kV for 20 min. The standards were visualized by spraying a 0.25% (w/v) ninhydrin acetone solution followed by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. The radiolabeled amino acids were detected by radioautography with an enhancing screen at −70 °C. Recovery from each step was monitored by Cerenkov counting. Calnexin immunoprecipitates from nonradiolabeled HepG2 and MDCK cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (stain was 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 in 50% (v/v) methanol in water containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid; destain was 50% (v/v) methanol in water containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid); and the corresponding gel slice was excised. Coomassie stain was removed by extraction (twice) with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/H2O, followed by two cycles each of extracting with acetonitrile and swelling with 100 mm NH4HCO3. Calnexin was in gel reduced and alkylated with 15 mmdithiothreitol and 1.3 mm iodoacetamide and then in gel digested with 13 μg/ml bovine trypsin in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 as described (22Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were first extracted with acetonitrile, followed by two cycles each of swelling with 100 mm NH4HCO3 and extracting with acetonitrile and then two cycles each of swelling with 5% formic acid and extracting with acetonitrile. The efficiency of the extraction of calnexin tryptic phosphorylated fragments from gel pieces was evaluated with radiolabeled calnexin and Cerenkov counting. Greater than 70% of the radioactivity was extracted and recovered (data not shown). For DE-MALDI-ToF MS, dried peptide extracts were redissolved in 5% formic acid containing 5% methanol (10 μl) (22Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). An aliquot (0.4 μl) was spotted onto a stainless steel target precoated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The target was allowed to air dry before being washed with an aqueous solution containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Excess wash solution was blown off the target using compressed air. The target was loaded into the mass spectrometer for analysis by DE-MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry using a Bruker Reflex instrument fitted with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. All spectra were acquired with the instrument in reflector mode. Acquisition parameters were set as follows: sampling frequency, 500 MHz; gain, 50 mV; source voltage, 24,000 V; reflector voltage, 24850 V. DE-MALDI-ToF mass spectra were acquired for each digest and compared with mock in gel trypsin digest. Nano-ESI experiments were performed as described (23Betts J.C. Blackstock W.P.

Briefly, in gel trypsin-digested calnexin was desalted via a POROS R2 capillary column (22Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M.

Spraying capillary needles were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, Reading, UK) employing a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA), and gold was sputtered employing a vapor desorption instrument. A PE-Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) fitted with a nano-ESI source (24Wilm M. Mann M. Anal.

The ion spray voltage was set to 600–650 V with an orifice potential of 60–70 V. Instrument polarity was set appropriate to the detection of positive or negative ions. Q1 scans were used to mass analyze ions relating to the intact peptides in the mixture. These were recorded by scanning the first quadrupole betweenm/z 400 and 2000 using a 1.0-ms dwell time and a 0.1-Da step size. Peptides containing phosphate produce a characteristic PO3− ion fragment atm/z 79 (26Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27Carr S.A.

Molecular ions for these peptides were recorded by scanning the first quadrupole betweenm/z 300 and 1400 with the third quadrupole set to transmit m/z 79 only (precursorsm/z 79 scans). Argon gas was used in the collision cell (quadrupole 2) at a collision gas thickness of 250 units. Scanning the first and third quadrupoles with an offset ofm/z 49 profiled phosphopeptides by loss of H3PO4 (molecular mass of 98) from doubly charged molecular ions (Constant Neutral Loss scans) (28Covey T.

For MS/MS detection, Q1 was set to transmit a mass window of 2 Da for product ion scans. Product ion spectra were accumulated with a 0.2-Da mass step size. Dwell time was 1.0 ms, and collision energy was optimized to obtain the MS/MS spectra. Spectra interpretation was performed using BioMultiView (Sciex) software. Candidate kinases for the cytosolic serine residues of calnexin were predicted based on consensus sequence motifs employing the PROSITE data base of EXPASY 2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://expasy.hcuge.ch.

Predicted peptide m/z values were evaluated employing tools provided by ProteinProspector. 3Available on the World Wide Web athttp://prospector.ucsf.edu. Calnexin and calmegin sequence alignments were initially generated by BLASTp (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Calnexin was originally identified as a major substrate of ER-associated kinase(s) by in vitrophosphorylation of intact microsomes with [γ-32P]GTP as phosphate donor (1Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W-J. Doherty, II J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine the in vivo sites of phosphorylation for calnexin, both HepG2 and MDCK cells werein vivo labeled with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin antibodies. SDS-PAGE-resolved immunoprecipitates were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes and similar levels of phosphorylated calnexin from both cell types were revealed by radioautography (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). The bands corresponding to phosphorylated calnexin were excised from the PVDF membranes and subjected to phosphoamino acid analyses. Radioautograms of the two-dimensional TLC plates for both human and canine calnexins revealed only 32P-labeled serine that comigrated with the nonradiolabeled phosphoserine standard as detected by ninhydrin staining (left and right parts of Fig. 1 B, respectively). The phosphorylated residues were not altered with longer (up to 24 h) in vivo radiolabeling (data not shown). Hence, calnexin was exclusively in vivophosphorylated on serine residues in both cell types. In isolated ER microsomes, in vitro phosphorylation by ER-associated kinase(s) is exclusively on the cytosolic domain of calnexin (1Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W-J. Doherty, II J.J.

The cytosolic domain of canine calnexin contains six serines, and the cytosolic domain of human calnexin contains five equivalent serines and a threonine. The five conserved cytosolic serine residues are in primary sequence motifs that are predicted to be recognized by CK2 (34Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Calnexin was immunoprecipitated from nonradiolabeled cell lysates from both cultured MDCK and HepG2 cells. After separation by SDS-PAGE and visualization by Coomassie staining, calnexin was in gel digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DE-MALDI-ToF mass spectra for the tryptic peptides of calnexin from MDCK and HepG2 were collected (Fig. 3,A and B). Peptide masses not observed in the mock in gel digest (data not shown), were employed to confirm the identity of MDCK and HepG2 calnexins. Total coverage for calnexin from MDCK cells was 165 of 573 (28.8%) amino acid residues, and coverage from HepG2 cells was 171 of 572 (29.9%) amino acid residues. With respect to the cytosolic domain of calnexin, however, the degree of coverage was 58.4 and 33.7% from MDCK and HepG2 cells, respectively. This coverage by DE-MALDI-ToF included phosphopeptides observed as peak 1 and peak 7 in Fig. 3 A for MDCK calnexin and as summarized in Table II. Coverage of the cytosolic domain was increased by nano-ESI MS and was greater than 90% by combination of both mass spectrometric techniques (see below). Poor coverage of the luminal domain was consistent with the generation of a protease-resistant core in the presence of Ca2+ (2Ou W-J. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that a peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of Rab2 (residues 2–14) arrests protein traffic prior to a rate-limiting event in VSV-G movement through pre-Golgi structures (Tisdale, E. J., and Balch, W. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 29372–29379). To determine the mechanism by which this peptide inhibits transport, we investigated the effect of the Rab2 peptide on the distribution of the β-COP subunit of coatomer because COPI partially localizes to pre-Golgi intermediates. We found that the peptide caused a dramatic change in the distribution of pre-Golgi intermediates containing β-COP. A quantitative binding assay was employed to measure recruitment of β-COP to membrane when incubated with the Rab2 (13-mer). Peptide-treated microsomes showed a 25–70% increase in the level of membrane-associated β-COP. The enhanced recruitment of coatomer to membrane was specific to the Rab2 (13-mer) and required guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, ADP ribosylation factor, and protein kinase C-like activity. The ability to enhance β-COP membrane binding was not limited to the peptide. Similarly, the addition of recombinant Rab2 protein to the assay promoted β-COP membrane association. Our results suggest that the Rab2 peptide causes the persistent recruitment of COPI to pre-Golgi intermediates which ultimately arrests protein transport due to the inability of membranes to uncoat.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The binding of COP1 deforms the membrane which leads to bud formation and eventual release of a coated vesicle. We have reported that a peptide which corresponds to residues 2–14 of Rab2 arrests protein transport by preventing the flow of cargo through pre-Golgi intermediates (VTCs) (2Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The ability of this peptide to block transport in a rapid and specific manner makes it a valuable tool to dissect events in the early secretory pathway. In this study, we took advantage of the irreversible property of the peptide to determine the mechanism by which the Rab2 (13-mer) arrests transport. Our previous observation that peptide affects transport from pre-Golgi structures prompted us to look at the distribution of transport-related proteins which co-localize to VTCs. We initially analyzed the distribution of COPI by focusing on the β-COP subunit. To our surprise, we found that the peptide had a striking affect on β-COP recruitment. Membranes incubated with peptide showed a 25–70% increase in β-COP binding compared with control. This increase in coatomer binding was specific to the Rab2 (13-mer) and required ARF, GTPγS, and protein kinase C (PKC) or a PKC-like protein. Similar results were obtained after addition of recombinant Rab2 protein to the binding assay. We propose that this enhanced COPI recruitment results in the inability of vesicles derived from pre-Golgi structures to uncoat which ultimately leads to the coupled arrest of anterograde and retrograde traffic. These data suggest that Rab2 plays a role in protein sorting and recycling from pre-Golgi intermediates. Polyclonal antiserum made to peptides corresponding to β-COP (EAGELKPEEEITVGPVQK), N-α-COP (yeast sequence KMLTKFESKSTRAKGYC), N-β′-COP (PLRLDIKRKLTARSDYC), and N-ε-COP (APPAPGPASGGSGEVYC) were generously provided by Dr. Rohan Teasdale (R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The serum was applied to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B to which the immunizing peptide was coupled for affinity purification. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of PBS and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8. The eluate was neutralized to pH 7.2, dialyzed against PBS, then concentrated. Peptides were synthesized at the R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute Protein Facility (La Jolla, CA). The monoclonal antibody to ARF (1D9) and ARF1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Richard Kahn (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Purified coatomer was kindly provided by Dr. M.

Rab2 cDNA was acquired from Dr. Marino Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The polyclonal serum to p58 was obtained from Dr. Jaakko Saraste (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway). Calphostin C was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Chelerythrine chloride was obtained from LC Laboratories. Digotonin was acquired from Boehringer Mannheim. HRP-conjugated antibody was purchased from Bio-Rad. Monoclonal antibody to β-COP (M3A5) and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman into 10 mmHepes, pH 7.2, and 250 mm mannitol, then broken with 15 passes of a 27-gauge syringe. The broken cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant re-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing ER, pre-Golgi, and Golgi membranes was washed with 1 m KCl in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, for 15 min on ice, then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 250 mm mannitol and employed in the binding reaction as described previously (10Aridor M. Bannykh S. Rowe T. Balch W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 14Tisdale E.J. Plutner H. Matteson J. Balch W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Membranes (30 μg of total protein) were added to a reaction mixture which contained 27.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2.75 mm MgOAc, 65 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 units of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. Peptide or Rab2 protein were added to obtain the final concentration as indicated under “Results” and the reaction mixture incubated on ice for 30 min. Rat liver cytosol (50 μg) and 2.0 μm GTPγS were then added and the reactions shifted to 37 °C and incubated for 10 min. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) which contained 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with an affinity purified polyclonal antibody made to the EAGE peptide of β-COP (25Pepperkok R.

NRK cells plated on coverslips were permeabilized with digitonin (20 μg/ml) as outlined previously (3Plutner H. Davidson H. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Coverslips with permeabilized cells were inverted and placed in tissue culture wells that contained the transport mixture described above, preincubated on ice for 15 min with or without peptide or Rab2 protein and then incubated for 80 min at 15 °C. To terminate transport, the cells were transferred to ice and fixed in 3% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min. Intracellular β-COP was detected by re-permeabilization of the fixed cells with 0.05% saponin in PBS/normal goat serum for 10 min, washed with PBS, then co-incubated for 30 min with a monoclonal antibody to β-COP (M3A5) and a polyclonal serum to p58, or with polyclonal serum to Rab2. Cells were then washed with PBS, co-stained for 30 min with Texas Red anti-rabbit antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse antibody, washed, mounted, then viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. Rab2Δ14 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-oligonucleotide primer which introduced a start codon at the deletion site. The cDNA for Rab2 wild type and Rab2Δ14 were cloned into pET3A (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI) and introduced into BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). A 1-liter culture was grown to an OD600 of 0.4–0.5 and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, then homogenized by 20 passes with a Dounce tissue grinder. Lysozyme (400 μg/ml), DNase I (40 μg/ml), and 25 mm MgCl2 were added to the homogenate and allowed to digest for 30 min at 4 °C, then centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 70-ml column containing Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm EDTA), washed with 2 bed volumes of Buffer A, then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–400 mm) in Buffer A. Three-ml fractions were collected and an aliquot of each fraction separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a Rab2 polyclonal antibody. Rab2-enriched fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a 200-ml column containing Sephacryl S-100 (Pharmacia) and eluted with Buffer A. Fractions containing Rab2 or Rab2Δ14 proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, then pooled, concentrated, and prenylated in an in vitroreaction. Briefly, the isoprenylation reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl that contained 5 μg of recombinant Rab2 protein, 10 μg of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Sigma), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 μl of rat liver cytosol, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 units of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then desalted through a 1-ml column of Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia) and concentrated. The protein concentration was determined by Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Recombinant myristoylated ARF was prepared from the BL21 bacterial strain that had been co-transformed with a plasmid encodingN-myristoyltransferase and wild type ARF1 (27Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were induced with 1.0 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C in the presence of 50 μm myristate. The cells were lysed and the expressed ARF1 purified on a DEAE-Sephacel and AcA54 Ultrogel columns as described by Weiss et al. (28Weiss O. Holden J. Rylka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ARF depletion, rat liver cytosol was fractionation on a Superose 6 column equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 125 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (28Weiss O. Holden J. Rylka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARF-enriched and ARF-depleted fractions were identified by Western blotting. Those fractions lacking ARF were pooled, and concentrated to the original volume. We analyzed the distribution of β-COP in permeabilized NRK cells incubated with or without peptide for 80 min at 15 °C by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were incubated at this reduced temperature to accumulate and enhance visualization of pre-Golgi intermediates (VTCs). In control cells, anti-β-COP antibody labeled the juxtanuclear Golgi complex and vesicular structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm and in proximity to the Golgi complex (Fig. 1 A). This distribution of β-COP is in agreement with that found in other cell types (6Presley J. Cole N. Schroer T. Hirschberg K. Zaal K. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

In contrast, cells incubated in the presence of the Rab2 peptide displayed prominent β-COP-labeled structures that ringed the nucleus in a collar-like manner (Fig. 1 B). These cells did not appear to contain peripherally-located β-COP-labeled vesicles. The β-COP containing ring-like structure partially overlapped with VTCs located near the cis Golgi region that stained with the antibody to p58 (29Saraste J. Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D) and with antibody to Rab2 (Fig. 1 H). Both of these polypeptides are considered marker proteins for VTCs (4Chavrier P. Parton R.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As we observed with antibody to β-COP, p58 (Fig. 1 D) and Rab2 (Fig. 1 H)-labeled vesicles were not found in peripheral locations. In control cells, p58 (Fig. 1 C) and Rab2 (Fig. 1 G) were localized in vesicular elements that were concentrated in the Golgi region and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. This staining pattern is similar to that observed with antibody to β-COP. This striking change in VTC distribution prompted us to further explore the relationship of Rab2 to COPI recruitment. A quantitative binding assay was used to measure β-COP recruitment to membranes in the presence of the Rab2 peptide (10Aridor M. Bannykh S. Rowe T. Balch W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 21Donaldson J. Cassel D. Kahn R. Klausner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Google Scholar). For this assay, microsomes were prepared from whole cell homogenates and washed with 1m KCl to remove pre-bound COPI. These membranes were preincubated in buffer for 30 min on ice with or without peptide, and then supplemented with GTPγS and rat liver cytosol and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The peptide concentrations employed in the binding assay were equivalent to those which inhibit protein traffic in anin vitro transport assay (2Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To terminate the reaction, membranes were collected by centrifugation, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, then probed with an affinity purified antibody to β-COP. We observed in peptide-treated membranes a marked increase in β-COP recruitment that occurred in a dose dependent manner and required GTPγS (Fig. 2). The amount of membrane-associated β-COP increased ∼50% when incubated with 25 μm peptide. In our previous studies (2Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), this peptide concentration reduced ER to Golgi transport by 50% in anin vitro transport assay. To learn if recruitment was specific to the Rab2 (13-mer), peptides were synthesized to the amino terminus of other Rab proteins and evaluated in the binding assay (see Table I). Stimulation of β-COP membrane binding was specific to the Rab2 (13-mer). As shown in Fig. 3, a randomized form of Rab2 (13-mer) had no effect on β-COP binding even at a concentration that results in maximum recruitment by the wild-type peptide. Likewise, a peptide that corresponds to the first 7 amino acids of Rab2 had no influence on β-COP membrane binding. The amount of membrane-associated β-COP was not affected by control peptides made to the analogous N-terminal domains of Rab5 and Rab3A. We also noted that a peptide to the amino terminus of Rab1B, a protein essential for ER to Golgi transport failed to recruit coatomer above the control level. These results show that the enhanced recruitment of β-COP to membrane was specific to the Rab2 (13-mer).Table IPeptides tested in membrane binding assayRab proteinPeptideRab1BNPEYDYLFKLLLIGDRab2 (7-mer)AYAYLFKRab2 (13-mer)AYAYLFKYIIIGDRab2 (random)AYKAGYIDLYIFIRab3AASATDSRYGQKRab5ANRGATRPNGPNTGNKMembrane binding assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Figure 3Enhanced β-COP membrane binding is specific to the Rab2 (13-mer). Microsomes were prepared from HeLa cell homogenates as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then preincubated for 30 min on ice in 50 μm peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of the peptides indicated (see Table I). Cytosol and GTPγS were added and the membranes incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Membranes were pelleted and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The blot was incubated with a polyclonal antibody to β-COP, then further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with ECL. The amount of recruited β-COP was quantitated by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Membrane binding assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The availability of affinity-purified antibodies that recognize the α, β′, and ε subunits of coatomer allowed us to test for co-recruitment after peptide treatment. In all cases, we observed a linear increase in membrane binding of these subunits comparable to β-COP (data not shown). It appears that the peptide stimulates, at the very least, recruitment of a subcomplex if not all coatomer subunits. We performed a time course in which membrane was incubated with or without peptide to determine whether the Rab2 (13-mer) affects the rate of coatomer recruitment to membrane. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the Rab2 peptide accelerated coatomer binding that resulted in a t½ of ∼5 min compared to t½ of ∼7.5 min for the control. No increase in β-COP recruitment was observed after ∼10 min of incubation for both control and peptide-treated membranes. The apparent saturability was not due to the rate of COPI binding, since longer incubations times did not result in an increased level of membrane-bound β-COP (data not shown). To further learn if the membranes were saturated with β-COP or if cytosol was limiting, microsomes were preincubated with or without the Rab2 peptide and then GTPγS and increasing amounts of cytosol added. Fig. 4 Bshows that control and peptide-treated membranes were saturated with β-COP when incubated with 0.1 mg of cytosol (total protein). Incubation of membranes with higher cytosol concentrations did not result in additional β-COP recruitment. Peptide-treated membranes showed an ∼ 30% increase in membrane-bound β-COP compared with control membrane. These combined results suggest that the Rab2 (13-mer) not only affects the extent of β-COP recruitment but also causes a rapid recruitment of COPI to membrane. The Rab2 peptide inhibits protein traffic in an irreversible manner (2Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) which may result from the inability of the Rab2 protein to bind to pre-Golgi elements. We pursued this question by first establishing a dose-response curve for the Rab2 protein. The addition of 200 ng of Rab2 protein saturated the membranes (Fig. 5). The microsomal binding assay was then performed with increasing peptide concentrations in the presence of 200 ng of recombinant Rab2 protein. The amount of membrane-bound Rab2 protein did not change when co-incubated with 10–75 μmpeptide (Fig. 5, inset). These results suggest that the Rab2 (13-mer) does not compete with Rab2 protein binding to membrane. We reasoned that if there was no competition between the peptide and the Rab2 protein for binding, then the Rab2 (13-mer) might mimic the function of the intact protein and therefore potentiate Rab2 activity. To address this possibility, the microsomal binding assay was performed by incubating membranes with three concentrations of recombinant Rab2 protein with GTPγS and cytosol for 15 min at 37 °C. As we observed with the Rab2 (13-mer), Rab2 protein membrane binding resulted in a dose-dependent increase in membrane-associated β-COP (Fig. 6 A). This result was further investigated in the morphological assay which showed that the Rab2 protein changed the intracellular distribution of β-COP. In these cells we observed large β-COP containing structures located in the perinuclear region (Fig. 7 C). These structures appeared to overlap with juxtanuclear structures that labeled with antibody to p58 (Fig. 7 D) and with antibody to Rab2 (Fig. 7 D, inset). This accumulation of COPI containing intracellular structures in response to the Rab2 protein is consistent with the enhanced β-COP recruitment observed in the microsomal binding assay.Figure 7Rab2 protein alters β-COP distribution in permealized cells. NRK cells grown on coverslips were permeabilized with digotonin, and then incubated in a complete transport mixture (panels A and B), or in a complete transport mixture supplemented with 200 ng of Rab2 protein (panels C and D) or with 200 ng of Rab2 Δ14 (panels E and F) for 80 min at 15 °C. The distribution of β-COP (all panels), the distribution of p58 (inset panels A, C, and E), and the distribution of Rab2 (inset panel B, D, and F) was determined by indirect immunofluorescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control cells, antibody to β-COP predominantly labeled the Golgi region. Rab2 protein-treated cells displayed enhanced perinuclear β-COP staining that overlapped with structures stained for p58 and Rab2.

However, the regulatory properties of these channels are unknown. In this study, we investigated the ion-conducting properties of full-length Bcl-xl in the lipid bilayer reconstitution system. Our findings indicate that Bcl-xl forms a cation-selective channel that conducts sodium but not calcium and that Bcl-xl channel activity is reversibly inhibited by luminal calcium with a half-dissociation constant of ∼60 μm. This calcium-dependent regulation of the Bcl-xl channel provides new insights into the roles of calcium and Bcl-2-related proteins in the programmed cell death pathway.

This calcium-dependent regulation of the Bcl-xl channel provides new insights into the roles of calcium and Bcl-2-related proteins in the programmed cell death pathway. Bcl-2 and its related proteins are critical regulators of programmed cell death or apoptosis (1Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Composed of both anti- and pro-apoptotic members, this family of proteins functions in a programmed cell death pathway common to most multicellular organisms. It is generally believed that the ratio of death antagonists, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and death agonists, such as Bax and Bcl-xs, plays a major role in the fate of the cell following an apoptotic stimulus (3Oltvai Z.N Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic proteins have also been suggested to function by interacting with caspases/CED-4 homologs (4Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 5Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Most of the Bcl-2-related proteins contain a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal sequence that anchors the protein to membranes of organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; 6×His, 6 × histidine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mitochondria and nucleus, which play important roles in apoptosis (6Hockenbery D.

Despite their importance in regulating development and homeostasis in multicellular organisms, the exact physiological function(s) of these proteins remain elusive. One of the current theories is that Bcl-2 family members regulate ion fluxes. This idea is supported by evidence that Bcl-2 overexpression prevents calcium redistribution from the ER to mitochondria following growth factor withdrawal (10Baffy G. Miyashita J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits apoptosis-associated calcium waves (11Magnelli L. Cinelli M. Turchetti A. Chiarugi V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and nuclear calcium uptake (12Marin M.C. Fernandez A. Bick R.J. Brisbay S. Buja L.M. Snuggs M. McConkey D.J. von Eschenbach A.C. Keating M.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2259-2266PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 overexpression has also been shown to enhance the uptake of calcium by mitochondria (13Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and preserve mitochondrial transmembrane potential (14Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Migotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Our previous data have demonstrated that Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with a reduction in the transient elevation of cytosolic calcium induced by thapsigargin-mediated ER calcium ATPase inhibition (15Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpression maintains calcium homeostasis and calcium-dependent protein processing in the ER of thapsigargin-treated cells (16He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray and NMR structure of Bcl-xl was shown to resemble the physical structure of ion channel-forming bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin and colicin Ia (17Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2 and Bax, have been shown to form ion channels using the lipid bilayer reconstitution system (18Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 19Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11357-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). However, these studies all utilized proteins from which the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain had been deleted. Previous studies of the channel forming bacterial toxin, colicin Ia, showed that the channel formed by protein which lacks the hydrophobic transmembrane domain differs in conductance from the one formed by the intact colicin Ia (22Baty D. Knibiehler M. Verheij H. Pattus F. Shire D. Bernadac A. Lazdunski C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it is presently unclear whether the ion channel forming properties of the truncated Bcl-2 family members necessarily correspond to those of the intact proteins. Furthermore, it seems paradoxical that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, which function to inhibit apoptosis, should structurally and functionally resemble bacterial toxins whose main purpose is to form pores in cell membranes and ultimately destroy cells by disrupting ion homeostasis. This suggests that the ability of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl to promote cell survival may not derive solely from their ability to form a channel. An explanation to this paradox may lie in understanding how Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl channel activity is regulated. In light of our recent evidence that depletion of cellular calcium abrogates the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 (16He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we set out to examine whether calcium is able to regulate the channel activity of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in a lipid bilayer reconstitution system. In the present report, we show that full-length Bcl-xl, produced in a bacterial expression system, forms a monovalent cation-selective channel that conducts sodium but not calcium. Significantly, we observed that Bcl-xl channel activity is inhibited by calcium, indicating for the first time that Bcl-xl forms a calcium-regulated cation channel. A full-length human bcl-xlcDNA (23Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, using flanking primers (forward = 5′-CCCCCTTCTAGAATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGG-3′ and reverse = 5′-GGGGCATGCCTCGAGTCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGAGCC-3′, start/stop codons are underlined) to introduce a XbaI site in the 5′ end and a XhoI site in the 3′ end. The XbaI and XhoI-digested, gel-purified polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pProex-1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing a 6-histidine (6×His) sequence, which allows affinity purification of expressed 6×His-Bcl-xl fusion protein. The entire bcl-xlcDNA sequence was identical to the published sequence with the exception of two conservative changes, A70G and V152A. A single colony of Escherichia coli, transformed with the full-length bcl-xlcDNA, was cultured at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Induction was carried out at an A600 of 0.7 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 5 h before harvesting cells by centrifugation. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2–5 volumes of sonication buffer (50 mm Na3PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following sonication (1-min bursts/1-min cooling/200–300 watts), the cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and solubilized as described previously by Loo and Clarke (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of buffer A (50 mm Na3PO4 (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The proteins were then solubilized at 4 °C by adding 1 ml of solubilization buffer (buffer A + 1% (w/v) CHAPS). Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column that was pre-equilibrated with 0.5 ml of nickel-agarose (Qiagen) in buffer B (buffer A + 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS). The column was washed twice with 0.6 ml of buffer B and with 0.6 ml of buffer C (10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, 80 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The 6×His-tagged Bcl-xl proteins were eluted with 0.25 ml of buffer D (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) in multiple fractions. Typically, cells from 100 ml of culture yielded 0.5–3.0 μg of Bcl-xl protein. Purified proteins were then characterized by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gels), followed by silver staining (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting. Immunoblots were performed as described previously (16He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length 6×His-tagged Bcl-xl proteins were mixed with the sample buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.7), 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and separated on a 12.5% linear SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with the Bcl-xl polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Planar lipid bilayer membranes were formed across an aperture of 200 μm diameter with a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol in a ratio of 5:5:1 as described previously (25Bhat M. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A patch clamp unit, and data analyses were performed with pClamp Software. The eluted fraction containing the purified Bcl-xl protein was either used directly or concentrated by Centriplus-30 (Amicon) and reconstituted in liposomes (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol in a ratio of 1:1:1) for the single channel measurements. The two preparations gave similar results. Purified Bcl-xl (60–100 ng) or Bcl-xl containing liposome was added to the cis-solution in the presence of asymmetric NaCl conditions at pH 7.4. The experiments were performed at room temperatures (23–25 °C). Single channel currents were recorded at 1 ms/point with the cut-off filter frequency set at 1 KHz. The full-length Bcl-xl protein was expressed in E. colifollowing isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and purified to homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The Western blot shown in Fig. 1 A represents the elution profile from the nickel column. The purified Bcl-xl has an apparent molecular mass of ∼31 kDa, which corresponds to the endogenous Bcl-xl (data not shown). It has been shown previously that Bcl-xl runs slightly higher than the predicted molecular mass of 26 kDa for the full-length Bcl-xl protein (18Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Silver staining of an eluted fraction revealed a single band, indicating that the preparation was >95% pure (Fig. 1 B.) To characterize the single channel function of full-length Bcl-xl, purified protein was reconstituted in the lipid bilayer, and the selected current traces shown in Fig. 2were recorded with 200 mm NaCl present in thecis-solution (to which the Bcl-xl protein was added) and 50 mm NaCl present in the trans-solution. Bcl-xl displays channel activity, producing a larger current at +40 mV than that at −40 mV (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the current-voltage relationship has a reversal potential of −30 mV (Fig. 2 B), which corresponds to a selectivity ratio ofPNa/PCl = 13.9. These findings indicate the cation-selective nature of the Bcl-xl channel. In separate experiments with a recording solution consisting of 200 mm NaCl (cis)/200 mm KCl (trans), the full-length Bcl-xl channel had a reversal potential of ∼−5 to 0 mV, which corresponds to a relative selectivity ratio ofPNa/PK = ∼1–1.2. This value is similar to the truncated Bcl-xl channel reported by Minnet al. (18Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of the Bcl-xl channel is the appearance of multiple conductance states, as shown in Fig. 2 C. Typically, six distinctive conductance levels could be identified, with each conductance level of ∼50 picosiemens. The association of multiple conductance states with the full-length Bcl-xl channel is similar to that of the Bcl-xl channel that had the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain deleted (18Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). This characteristic may be because of the propensity of Bcl-xl proteins to interact with one another, as this prevents us from distinguishing the current measurements from either single channels or multiple channels. At the present, we do not know the stoichiometry of the Bcl-xl channel,i.e. the number of subunits that participates in the formation of the cation-selective channel. To confirm that the conductance shown in Fig. 2 was a property of the Bcl-xl protein, we measured its conductance in the presence of the Bcl-xl polyclonal antibody, which recognizes first 19 amino acids of the amino terminus. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of ∼31 nm antibody to thecis-solution produced a significant reduction in Bcl-xl channel activity (n = >3), whereas addition of an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin to thecis-solution was without effect (data not shown). Furthermore, when the antibody was added to thetrans-solution, no change in channel activity was observed. These findings suggest that the Bcl-xl channel activity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions at the amino terminus and confirm that the channel activity observed in the planar lipid bilayer system was indeed produced by Bcl-xl rather than any minor contaminants in the protein preparation. In addition, these data confirm that the protein is oriented in the cis-cytoplasmictrans-luminal manner. To study whether the full-length Bcl-xl channel is regulated by calcium, 100 mm CaCl2 was added to thetrans-solution. The current traces shown in Fig. 4 were obtained with a NaCl gradient of 200 (cis)/50 mm (trans). Following the addition of 100 mm CaCl2 to thetrans-solution, the activities of the channel at both +60 mV and −60 mV were reduced to essentially zero, indicating that calcium inhibited the function of the Bcl-xl channel. Furthermore, because an inward current was not observed at −60 mV, the Bcl-xl channel does not appear to be permeable to calcium. The dose-response relationship between luminal calcium concentration and Bcl-xl channel activity was examined, to further understand the effect of luminal calcium. The results indicate that calcium attenuates both the current amplitude and opening probability of the Bcl-xl channel activity, with a Ki of 57.78 ± 26.14 μm (Fig. 5 A). In addition, the inhibitory effect was because of the action of luminal calcium, as suggested by the following observations. First, adding calcium to the cis-solution had a lesser inhibitory effect on the Bcl-xl channel current amplitude and opening probability (Fig. 5 A). Second, adding 10 mm MgCl2 to the trans-solution did not affect the channel activity (Fig. 5 A). In addition, the inhibitory effect of the Bcl-xl channel activity by luminal calcium was readily and consistently reversed by adding EGTA to the trans-solution (n = 5), as illustrated in Fig. 5 B. Our findings indicate that full-length Bcl-xl forms a monovalent cation selective channel, with conductance properties similar to those described previously using recombinant proteins from which the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain had been deleted (18Minn A.J.

Despite the evidence suggesting that Bcl-2-related proteins conduct ions, the relationship of this property to apoptosis induction or repression is presently unknown. In the present study, however, we show that Bcl-xl channel activity can be regulated by calcium, a finding that may provide new insights into the function of the Bcl-2 family in the apoptotic pathway. Regulation of ion channels by calcium is a well documented phenomenon. For example, intracellular calcium regulates the rate of calcium-dependent inactivation of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel as well as the open-closed transitions of a wide variety of potassium channels, such as Maxi-K(Ca) (26Triggle D.J. J. Hypertens. Suppl. 1997; 15: s9-s15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Klaerke D.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Physiol. 1997; 118: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Also, changes in luminal calcium concentration are known to regulate the rate of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles of muscle cells, as well as the single channel opening probability of the ryanodine receptor/calcium release channels (28Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, our observation that an anti-apoptotic protein such as Bcl-xl is regulated by luminal calcium is not unusual, yet novel as it may have a significant impact on how we view the function of these proteins in the apoptotic pathway. Although calcium has been implicated as a mediator of apoptosis, its exact role is enigmatic. However, the maintenance of a high level of calcium within the ER lumen is known to be essential for cellular functions, including translation (29Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), protein processing (30Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell division (31Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and cell survival. Recently, Tsien and colleagues (32Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Helm R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) demonstrated, with their “cameleons” fluorescent indicators, that the calcium concentration in the ER of individual cells is as high as 400 μm under physiological conditions. In addition, using ER-targeted, low calcium affinity aequorin reconstituted with coelenterazine n, the physiological concentration of calcium in the ER lumen is estimated to be between 500 and 600 μm in intact cells (33Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that luminal calcium in the high μmrange inhibits Bcl-xl channel activity. This suggests that when the calcium concentration in the ER lumen is maintained at this level, the Bcl-xl channel remains in a closed state, supporting ion homeostasis. Unlike the ER lumen, the free calcium concentration is relatively low in mitochondria. For example, mitochondrial free calcium in a single living cardiac myocyte is estimated to be in the high nanomolar range (34Miyata H. Silverman H.S. Sollott S.J. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1123-H1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that calcium at this concentration would keep the Bcl-xl channel open. However, what do Bcl-xl and its channel activity in the mitochondria have to do with promoting cell survival? Interestingly, a recent study by Shimizu and colleagues demonstrated that Bcl-2 prevents loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by 20 μm calcium in isolated mitochondria (35Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Their findings suggested that Bcl-2 maintained this Δψ by mediating proton efflux. However, at a higher calcium concentration (100–200 μm), Bcl-2 failed to mediate proton efflux, leading to the collapse of the Δψ. This is consistent with our findings regarding the dose-response relationship between luminal calcium concentration and Bcl-xl channel activity. Hence, it is likely that Bcl-xl channel activity may be regulated by the luminal calcium concentration of the organelle with which it is associated, thereby contributing to its anti-apoptotic function. Based on the present findings, whether Bax and other pro-apoptotic proteins can be regulated by calcium merits immediate investigation. We thank George Dubyak, Anna-Liisa Nieminen, and Edmunds Z.

However, it exerts differential effects on cloned glutamate transporter subtypes, enhancing EAAT2 and inhibiting EAAT1 transport (15Zerangue N. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol.

Attwell D. Nature. 1989; 342: 918-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These cells predominantly express an EAAT1 homolog (sEAAT1) that is similarly inhibited by arachidonate when it is exogenously expressed in oocytes (10Eliasof S. Arriza J.L. Leighton B.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6433-6435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because arachidonate is released during synaptic activity and can modulate synaptic transmission (17Williams J.H. Errington M.L. Lynch M.A. Bliss T.V.P. Nature. 1989; 341: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 18Linden D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), understanding its effects on various glutamate transporter subtypes is important. Recently, Kataoka et al.reported an activity-dependent enhancement of glutamate transporter currents in rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons that was mediated by arachidonate (5Kataoka Y. Morii H. Watanabe Y. Ohmori H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was designed to examine the mechanism of the effects of arachidonate on the cloned rat EAAT4 transporter, which is expressed at high levels in Purkinje neurons. The rat EAAT4 cDNA 1C.-L. Lin, A. V. Tzingounis, J. D. Rothstein, and M. P. Kavanaugh, submitted for publication. was subcloned into pOG, a vector derived from pBSTA (19Goldin A.L. Sumikawa K. Rudy B. Iverson L.E. Vol. 207. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992: 279-297Google Scholar) that contains a multiple cloning site between flanking Xenopus β-globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences. Capped mRNA was transcribed using T7 polymerase and injected into stage V or VI oocytes (approximately 50 ng/oocyte). Recordings and radiolabel uptake assays were made 4–7 days later as described (15Zerangue N. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6433-6435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Extracellular Ringer's solution contained (in mm) 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. Buffers were present at 5 mm and consisted of MES 2The abbreviation used is: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. /HEPES (pH 6.5), Na/HEPES (pH 7.5), or HEPES/Tris (pH 8.5). Solutions containing indicated ion substitutions were changed by bath exchange. Recordings were made using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp circuit (20Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and records were analyzed using pCLAMP 6.0 software (Axon Instruments). [3H]l-glutamate (1 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) uptake assays were performed at 25 °C. Following a 5-min incubation in the indicated concentration of [3H]l-glutamate (10 μCi/ml), oocytes were rapidly washed three times in cold Ringer and lysed in 1% SDS, and scintillation spectroscopy was performed. Arachidonic acid (Calbiochem) was stored at −20 °C in 100 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and dissolved in recording solution by sonication immediately prior to use. All other compounds were from Sigma. Three to four days following injection of RNA transcribed from the rat excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT4 cDNA Xenopusoocytes displayed >30-fold increased uptake of 1 μm[3H]l-glutamate. In oocytes voltage-clamped at −60 mV, EAAT4 currents induced by application of 30 μml-glutamate were increased upon co-application of 100 μm arachidonate (Fig. 1 A). This effect was reversible, although its onset and offset were slower than the solution exchange times as monitored by the glutamate response (Fig. 1 A). Application of 100 μm arachidonate alone in oocytes expressing rEAAT4 resulted in a small but significant inward current (Fig. 1 B; −2.2 nA ± 0.6, n = 4). This inward current was not observed in uninjected oocytes (1.1 nA ± 0.9, n = 9). At −60 mV, arachidonate increased the magnitude of the steady-state current induced by 30 μm glutamate to 324 ± 41% of its control value (n = 11). Currents elicited by glutamate in the presence and absence of arachidonate at a series of membrane potentials showed that arachidonate enhanced the current amplitude to a greater extent at more negative potentials (Fig. 1, C andD; also see Fig. 4). These results are consistent with a study on Purkinje neuron transporter currents (5Kataoka Y. Morii H. Watanabe Y. Ohmori H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a recent report on the human EAAT4 transporter (21Fairman W.A. Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 1790Google Scholar).Figure 4Arachidonate enhances a proton-selective current. Voltage dependence of currents induced by 30 μm glutamate in the presence and absence of 100 μm arachidonate at pH 6.5 (A), 7.5 (B), and 8.5 (C). D, extracellular pH shifted the potential at which currents in the presence of arachidonate crossed over the control transport currents. The l shows least squares fit with slope of −53.4 mV/pH unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The arachidonate concentration dependence in the presence of a saturating concentration of glutamate (30 μm) revealed that the arachidonate effect on the current was saturable, with an EC50 of 135 ± 21 μm (n= 3; Fig. 2 A). In the presence of arachidonate, the apparent affinity of the transporter for glutamate was unaffected; the EC50 of the current was 1.5 ± 0.2 and 1.5 ± 0.3 μm in control and with 100 μm arachidonate, respectively (n = 6). The effects of arachidonate on the transport current seemed to be direct rather than through a metabolite, because coapplication of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (100 μm) together with the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaretic acid (50 μm) had no effect on the potentiation induced by arachidonic acid (96 ± 2% of control enhancement,n = 3). To examine whether arachidonate affected the transport of l-glutamate in oocytes expressing rEAAT4, uptake of 1 μm or 30 μm[3H]l-glutamate was assayed in the presence or absence of 300 μm arachidonate (Fig. 2, Cand D). In marked contrast to its effects on the currents, arachidonate had no significant effect on the uptake ofl-glutamate into oocytes. Uptake of 1 μm[3H]l-glutamate was 524 ± 152 fmol/min in control conditions and 468 ± 86 fmol/min in the presence of 300 μm arachidonate (n = 6,p = 0.74). Uptake of 30 μml-glutamate uptake was also not significantly changed by 300 μm arachidonate (1753 ± 506 fmol/min and 1477 ± 271 fmol/min in control and arachidonate, respectively;n = 5; p = 0.64). Arachidonate also had no effect on l-glutamate uptake in uninjected oocytes (Fig. 2, C and D). These results demonstrate that arachidonate increased a glutamate-dependent rEAAT4 current without affecting glutamate uptake. This is in contrast to the effects of arachidonate on the EAAT1 and EAAT2 subtypes, in which l-glutamate uptake and currents are decreased or increased in parallel (15Zerangue N. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6433-6435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hence, the ionic nature of the rEAAT4 conductance increased by arachidonate was investigated further. Similar to the human EAAT1-EAAT4 subtypes (20Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar,22Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), rat EAAT4 mediates an uncoupled Cl− conductance in addition to the sodium-coupled glutamate transport current, because the outward current was abolished when extracellular chloride was substituted by gluconate (n = 4; data not shown). To examine whether arachidonate selectively increased the uncoupled Cl− conductance, the voltage dependence of the current induced by glutamate was examined in the presence and absence of arachidonate. The arachidonate-dependent current was inwardly rectifying and did not reverse at the Cl−equilibrium potential (∼−20 mV), indicating that the conductance increased by arachidonate was not Cl−-selective (Fig. 3 A). To further rule out an action of arachidonate on the transporter-mediated anion conductance, extracellular Cl− was substituted by the more permeant ion NO3− (4Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Similar to results with the human EAAT4 transporter (4Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), NO3−was more permeant than Cl−. Replacement of extracellular Cl− by NO3− increased the glutamate-induced outward current and shifted the reversal potential to more negative potentials, from −14.8 ± 1.1 to −81.8 ± 1.1 mV (n = 3; Fig. 3 B). Coapplication of 100 μm arachidonate with glutamate slightly inhibited the outward NO3− current, further supporting that conclusion that the conductance increased by arachidonate was not anion-selective (Fig. 3 B). The reversal potential of the glutamate-induced current was shifted approximately +10 mV by arachidonate (from −14.8 ± 1.1 mV to −4.7 ± 2.4 mV, n = 3), and this shift was not influenced by changing the Na+ gradient by substitution of 48 mm Na+ with choline (n = 3; data not shown). Hence, the arachidonate-mediated increase of thel-glutamate current was selective for ions other than sodium or chloride. Glutamate transporters mediate a coupled flux of protons with glutamate (23Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). To examine whether a proton-selective current was involved in the arachidonate potentiation of the l-glutamate current, currents were measured with varying extracellular pH between 6.5 and 8.5. Altering the extracellular proton concentration markedly influenced voltage dependence of the arachidonate-dependent current. As the extracellular proton concentration increased, the potential at which the glutamate current recorded in the presence of arachidonate crossed the control glutamate current shifted to more positive potentials (Fig. 4). With extracellular pH at 7.5, close to the value of the intracellular pH (24Webb D.J. Nuccitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the arachidonate-dependent current crossed the control current at 2.3 ± 3.9 mV (n = 11), and this reversal potential changed 53 mV/pH unit (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that the major component of the conductance amplified by arachidonate was proton-selective. The present results show that arachidonic acid activates a proton-selective conductance during EAAT4-mediated transport ofl-glutamate, extending the recognized types of currents associated with glutamate transporters. In addition to the current associated with the Na+/H+/K+-coupled translocation of glutamate (15Zerangue N. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol.

EAAT4 is predominantly localized to the cerebellum, where it is found on Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites (1Yamada K. Watanabe M. Shibata T. Tanaka K. Wada K. Inoue Y.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5693-5702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transporters participating in this process are located both in glial cells surrounding the synapse (33Clark B.A. Barbour B. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 34Bergles D.E. Dzubay J.A. Jahr C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14821-14825Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and in the postsynaptic dendrites and cell body (4Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 35Takahashi M. Sarantis M. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of the synaptically activated transport current in Purkinje cells suggest that it is mediated in large part by EAAT4 (4Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is liberated by activation of phospholipase A2 during neuronal activity (5Kataoka Y. Morii H. Watanabe Y. Ohmori H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dumuis A. Pin J.P. Oomagari K. Sebben M. Bockaert J. Nature. 1990; 347: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and it can modulate activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength in Purkinje cells (18Linden D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Whether exogenously applied or generated by depolarization, arachidonic acid increased the amplitude of glutamate transporter-mediated currents in rat Purkinje cells (5Kataoka Y. Morii H. Watanabe Y. Ohmori H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7017-7024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplitude of the increase seen in Purkinje cells was similar to that reported here with the exogenously expressed EAAT4. Together these results suggest that synaptic activity may lead to activation of a glutamate transporter-mediated proton influx in neurons that express EAAT4. Because pH strongly influences the activity of many types of ion channels (for review see Ref. 37Takahashi K.I. Copenhagen D.R. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 24: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this property of the transporter could provide an additional mechanism to modulate postsynaptic responses. Furthermore this phenomenon could contribute to intracellular acidification during ischemia as a consequence of the pathological elevation of glutamate and arachidonate.

https://openalex.org/W2058763205,"The kdpFABC operon, which encodes the structural genes for the high affinity K+ transport complex KdpFABC, is regulated by the sensor kinase KdpD and the response regulator KdpE. KdpD is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the autophosphorylation by ATP and the dephosphorylation of the corresponding response regulator KdpE. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphatase activity of KdpD is dependent on ATP, whereas GTP, ITP, CTP, ADP, and GDP have no effect. The phosphatase activity requires only ATP binding, because nonhydrolyzable analogs (adenosine-5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate and adenosine-5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate) work as well. However, KdpD proteins missing amino acids 12–128 are characterized by a phosphatase activity that is independent of ATP. These proteins are still able to respond to K+ starvation, but an increase in osmolarity is no longer sensed. Comparison of different KdpD sequences reveals a conserved motif in this amino acid region that is very similar to a classical ATP-binding site (Walker A motif). Replacement of the conserved Gly37, Lys38, and Thr39residues in the consensus ATP-binding sequence results in a KdpD protein that causes a kdpFABC expression pattern comparable with that seen with KdpD proteins missing amino acids 12–128. However,in vitro phosphatase activity is comparable with that of wild-type KdpD. These results suggest that amino acids 12–128 of KdpD are important for its activity and that an additional ATP-binding site in the N-terminal region seems to be involved in modulation of the phosphatase activity.

KdpD and KdpE, two proteins that regulate the expression of thekdpFABC operon in Escherichia coli (1Polarek J.W. Williams G. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2145-2151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are members of the large family of sensor kinase/response regulator systems (see Refs. 2Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes. Vol. 5. JAI Press Inc., London1996: 403-420Google Scholar and 3Altendorf K. Voelkner P. Puppe W. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar for review). The corresponding genes are organized in the kdpDE operon, which is adjacent to thekdpFABC operon that encodes the structural genes of the high affinity K+ transport complex KdpFABC (4Hesse J.E. Wieczorek L. Altendorf K. Reicin A.S. Dorus E. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Siebers A. Altendorf K. Bakker E.P. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 225-252Google Scholar). K+ is an important osmotic solute for the maintenance of turgor in bacterial cells (6Epstein W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 73-78Crossref Google Scholar), and the Kdp system can be characterized as an optional system to scavenge K+ from the environment. The stimulus that KdpD senses is believed to be a decrease in turgor pressure or some effect thereof (7Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Expression of kdpFABC is induced under K+-limiting growth conditions (below 2 mm). In mutants lacking all other K+-translocating transport systems (TrkG, TrkH, and Kup), kdpFABC is expressed in media containing 50 mm K+ or less. (7Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar). There is no correlation of kdpFABC expression with internal K+ concentration when this parameter is altered by changing medium osmolarity. Therefore, neither the external nor the internal concentration of K+ per se seems to be sensed but what might be called the “need” for K+ to maintain turgor. Control by turgor is supported by the finding that a sudden increase in medium osmolarity, which reduces turgor, is able to turn on expression of the kdpFABC operon transiently (7Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar). This model has been challenged by more recent findings (9Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 10Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating that there is a difference in expression of kdpFABC when the osmolarity of the medium is increased by a sugar or a salt. Analysis of mutant forms of KdpD that result in constitutive expression ofkdpFABC independent of the K+ concentration of the medium but retain the ability to respond to changes in medium osmolarity led to the suggestion that KdpD senses two stimuli, decrease in turgor and K+ concentration (11Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The kdpD gene has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed (12Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene product KdpD is an integral protein of the cytoplasmic membrane (13Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, KdpD was purified and reconstituted in an active form in proteoliposomes (14Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This purified protein has autokinase activity. The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the response regulator KdpE. Furthermore, KdpD catalyzes the dephosphorylation of purified KdpE∼P (14Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). According to hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence and the analysis of a series of KdpD-alkaline phosphatase (kdpD-phoA) and KdpD-β-galactosidase(kdpD-lacZ) fusions as well as protease susceptibility experiments (15Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the following secondary structure model was established (Fig. 1). KdpD consists of a large cytoplasmic N-terminal region, four putative transmembrane domains, and an extended cytoplasmic C-terminal region. Whereas the C-terminal domain shows high similarity to transmitter domains of other sensor kinases (16Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar), the length of the N-terminal input domain is rather unusual. KdpD missing the four transmembrane domains became inactive in vivo and in vitro. However, proteins missing different parts of the soluble N-terminal domain could be phosphorylated in vitro, the phosphoryl group was transferred to KdpE, and they also contained phosphatase activity. The influence of the N-terminal truncations in KdpD on the transcriptional regulation ofkdpFABC was tested in a trk−background. It was shown that the truncation of amino acids 12–128 influences the level of kdpFABC expression, whereas the truncation of amino acids 128–391 exhibits expression levels that were comparable with wild-type KdpD (17Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this communication we describe for the first time the quantification of the rate of the phosphatase activity of KdpD. Furthermore, KdpD proteins missing amino acids 12–128 are characterized by a deregulated phosphatase activity. A conserved motif that is similar to a classical ATP-binding site (Walker A motif) can be found in this region. The strong dependence of the phosphatase activity of KdpD on ATP and alteration of the proposed nucleotide binding site by site-directed mutagenesis provide first evidence that ATP-binding modulates KdpD activity. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. NAP 10 columns to remove ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

E. coli HAK006 [ΔkdpABCD Δ(lac-pro) ara thi] carrying a kdpFABC promoter-lacZ fusion (20Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Kanamaru K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was used to probe signal transduction in vivo. Plasmids pWP2-92 (Δ12–228), pWP 4-92 (Δ128–391), pWP6-92 (Δ12–395) (17Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and pPV5-1 (21Jung K. Heermann R. Meyer M. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar) were used. Plasmid pPV5-1 is a derivative of plasmid pPV5 (12Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains five unique restriction sites that were introduced by silent mutation (21Jung K. Heermann R. Meyer M. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). All these plasmids are derivatives of pKK223-3, in whichkdpD is under the control of the tac promoter. Furthermore, the kdpD gene was cloned into plasmid pBAD18 (22Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar) using restriction sites SmaI and HindIII resulting in pBD. Subsequently, plasmids pWP2-92 (Δ12–228), pWP4-92 (Δ128–391), and pWP6-92 (Δ12–395) were digested withPstI and StuI and ligated in similarly treated plasmid pBD. The resulting plasmids pBD (Δ12–228), pBD (Δ128–391), and pBD(Δ12–395) were confirmed by restriction analysis. Substitution of Gly37, Lys38, and Thr39 was achieved by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ATP-γ-S, adenosine-5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine-5′-[β, γ-imido]triphosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mutagenesis. The oligonucleotide primer was designed to change codons of Gly37, Lys38, and Thr39 to codons of Ala37, Ala38, and Cys39. The PCR product was purified in agarose gels and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. The DNA fragment was isolated from agarose gels and ligated to similarly treated pPV5-1 resulting in pPV5-1, G37A,K38A,T39C. Subsequently, this kdpD construct was cloned into pBAD18 (22Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar) using XmaI and HindIII restriction sites, resulting in plasmid pBD-G37A,K38A,T39C. Mutations were verified by sequencing the length of the PCR-generated segment through the ligation junctions in double-stranded plasmid DNA, using the dideoxynucleotide termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) and synthetic sequencing primers after alkaline denaturation of the DNA (24Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). E. coli TKR2000 transformed with pPV5-1 or pPV5-1, G37A,K38A,T39C or pWP 2-92 (Δ12–228), pWP 4-92 (Δ128–391), and pWP6-92 (Δ12–395) was grown aerobically at 37 °C in KML complex medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% KCl) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼1.0. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (14Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inverted membrane vesicles containing KdpD (2 mg protein/ml) were incubated at room temperature in phosphorylation buffer, containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.38 Ci/mmol). At different times, aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal volume of double concentrated SDS sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). After incubation for 4.5 min, an equimolar amount of KdpE was added to the KdpD-containing fractions, and the incubation was continued. Further aliquots were removed at different times and mixed with SDS sample buffer as described above. To test dephosphorylation, purified KdpE prepared as described (17Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was phosphorylated in the following manner. Wild-type KdpD (4 mg/ml) was incubated in phosphorylation buffer, except that MgCl2 was replaced with 5 mm CaCl2, and phosphorylation was initiated with 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.38 Ci/mmol). After 5 min, purified KdpE (0.1 mg/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 min. KdpD-containing membrane vesicles were removed by centrifugation. ATP was removed by gel filtration through Sephadex G25 (preincubated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mNaCl). Purified KdpE∼P was used immediately. Dephosphorylation was initiated by addition of 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP (or other nucleotides as specified), and inverted membrane vesicles containing KdpD (1 mg/ml). At different times aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Shortly before stopping SDS-PAGE an [γ-32P]ATP standard was loaded on the gels. Gels were dried, and phosphorylation of the proteins was detected by exposure of the gels to a phosphorscreen. Phosphorylated proteins were quantified by image analysis using the PhosphorImager system of Molecular Dynamics. In vivosignal transduction was probed with E. coli HAK006 transformed with the plasmids described. Cells were grown in TY medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract) (11Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or minimal medium (26Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with NaCl and KCl as indicated. Cells were grown to midlogarithmic growth phase and harvested by centrifugation. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described (27Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar) and is given in Miller units. Protein was assayed by the method of Peterson (28Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) using 9 or 12% acrylamide gels. Immunodetection of KdpD proteins with polyclonal antibodies against KdpD was performed according to (13Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Inverted membrane vesicles containing equal amounts of either wild-type or truncated KdpD, as judged by Western blot analysis (data not shown), were tested for kinase activity. The time courses of autophosphorylation of different truncated KdpD proteins in comparison with wild-type KdpD is shown in Fig. 2. Autophosphorylation was tested to be linear within 0.5 min. Furthermore, transfer of the phosphoryl group to KdpE was determined. The transfer of the phosphoryl group to KdpE was very fast (within 15 s the phosphotransfer was complete). Phosphotransfer was detectable for all truncated KdpD proteins (data not shown). In addition to the kinase activity KdpD catalyzes also the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated KdpE (14Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). KdpE∼P itself is very stable; within 2 h no major loss of the phosphoryl group was detected. Dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P was initiated by the addition of inverted membrane vesicles containing KdpD, 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm ATP. Within about 5 min half of the amount of KdpE∼P was dephosphorylated (Fig. 3 A). The rate of dephosphorylation of wild-type KdpD was comparable with that of the truncated forms. For wild-type KdpD only ATP was effective to stimulate the phosphatase activity; GTP, ITP, CTP, ADP, and GDP were without effect. Furthermore, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, ATP-γ-S and AMP-PNP, were as effective as ATP (data not shown). In the absence of ATP a very slow dephosphorylation was observed when wild-type KdpD and KdpD (Δ128–391) were tested (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, KdpD (Δ12–228) and KdpD (Δ12–395) are characterized by a phosphatase activity that is independent of the presence of ATP. It has been found previously that in wild-type strains kdpFABC is expressed when medium concentration of K+ is below 2 mm. Furthermore, an increase in medium osmolarity at constant K+ concentration, a maneuver that reduces turgor, caused expression of kdpFABC (7Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Signal transduction mediated by truncated forms of KdpD was previously tested in E. coli deleted for other K+ uptake systems (TrkG and TrkH) leaving Kdp as the main K+transport system. Because of the importance of the Kdp system as the major K+ uptake system, kdpFABC expression was never completely blocked (17Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the transcriptional induction of kdpFABC with E. coli HAK006 (11Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that synthesizes the constitutive K+ uptake systems, TrkH, TrkG, and Kup. This strain lacks the functional kdpFABCoperon as well as the kdpD gene on the chromosome but contains the intact kdpE gene under the control of its own promoter. In addition, this strain harbors a kdpFABCpromoter-lacZ fusion gene on the chromosome. Because the amount of regulatory proteins is very critical in signal transduction (high levels of KdpD prevent complementation of a kdpD nullstrain), 2K. Jung, unpublished information. E. coliHAK006 was transformed with plasmids pBD and its derivatives. In plasmid pBD kdpD is under the control of the arabinose promoter (22Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar). When cells were grown in the absence of an inducer (arabinose) and in the presence of the repressor glucose, the amount of KdpD produced was sufficient to complement a kdpD nullstrain. The truncated proteins were tested for their response to an increase in osmolarity and K+ limitation in comparison with wild-type KdpD (Table I). In response to an increase of osmolarity β-galactosidase activities of cells producing wild-type KdpD or KdpD (Δ 128–391) increased, whereas only basal levels of β-galactosidase activity were detectable in cells producing KdpD (Δ12–228) or KdpD (Δ12–395). Furthermore, K+ limitation resulted in high β-galactosidase activities when cells produced wild-type KdpD or KdpD (Δ128–391). In the case of KdpD (Δ12–228) and KdpD (Δ12–395), β-galactosidase was detectable when cells were cultivated at very low K+concentrations. However, β-galactosidase activity was much lower in comparison with that of wild-type KdpD.Table IInfluence of alterations in the N-terminal domain in KdpD on the regulation of kdpFABC expression by K+ concentration and osmotic stressKdpD constructβ-Galactosidase activity0.1 mm K+1 mmK+6 mm K+No osmotic stress0.6 m NaClunitsWild-type KdpD384775013552KdpD (Δ12–228)80444KdpD (Δ12–395)328534KdpD (Δ128–391)346668412450KdpD-G37A,K38A,T39C309424E. coli HAK006 was transformed with plasmid pBD, its derivatives carrying the indicated deletions in kdpD, or pBD-G37A,K38A,T39C.

Open table in a new tab E. coli HAK006 was transformed with plasmid pBD, its derivatives carrying the indicated deletions in kdpD, or pBD-G37A,K38A,T39C. Cells were grown to midlogarithmic growth phase in minimal medium containing different amounts of K+ or in TY medium in the presence of different NaCl concentrations (the basal concentration of K+ in this medium was determined to be 6 mm by flame photometry). β-Galactosidase activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is given in Miller units (27Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). The data presented represent average values obtained in at least three independent experiments. Sequence comparison of the first 200 amino acids of so far six known KdpD sequences of different microorganisms revealed that a conserved motif exists that is similar to a classical ATP-binding site (Walker A motif) (29Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In addition, we found that KdpD proteins missing these amino acids (KdpD(Δ12–395) and KdpD (Δ12–228)) are characterized by a phosphatase activity that is independent of ATP and cause deregulation of kdpFABCexpression. To test whether KdpD contains a second ATP-binding site, site-directed mutagenesis was used to inactivate this site. Therefore, codons for Gly37, Lys38, and Thr39were replaced by codons for Ala37, Ala38, and Cys39 in kdpD. The resulting KdpD protein was tested for kinase and phosphatase activity. The rate of autophosphorylation was comparable with that of wild-type KdpD; after addition of KdpE the phosphoryl group was rapidly transferred (data not shown). KdpD-G37A,K38A,T39C catalyzed the dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P. In the absence of ATP the rate of dephosphorylation was very slow, and it could be stimulated in the presence of ATP. Rates were comparable with that of wild-type KdpD or KdpD(Δ128–391) (data not shown). Furthermore, transcriptional induction of kdpFABCwas tested using E. coli strain HAK006 transformed with plasmid pBD-G37A,K38A,T39C. Inactivation of the proposed ATP-binding site impaired kdpFABC expression in response to an increase of the osmolarity of the medium (Table I). As shown before with truncated proteins missing amino acids 12–395 or 12–228, respectively, KdpD-G37A,K38A,T39C showed a modest ability to induce reporter gene expression in response to K+ starvation (Table I). Dephosphorylation of the response regulator is well studied in various sensor kinase/response regulator systems and characterized by diverse mechanisms (16Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). The sensor kinase EnvZ by itself is able to enhance the rate of dephosphorylation of phospho-OmpR (31Igo M.M. Ninfa A.J. Stock J.B. Silhavy T.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the chemotaxis system, dephosphorylation of CheY is mediated by a separate protein, CheZ (37Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and in the process of sporulation of Bacillus subtilis different phosphatases have been identified (38Perego M. Hanstein C. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Using purified and reconstituted KdpD we have recently shown that dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P is only dependent on the sensor kinase (14Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this communication we demonstrate for the first time that the rate of dephosphorylation can be significantly increased in the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. In contrast, other nucleotides do not have an effect at all. The dephosphorylation activity of EnvZ is also stimulated by ATP, but in contrast to KdpD, also by ADP (31Igo M.M. Ninfa A.J. Stock J.B. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biol.

In comparison with other sensor kinases, KdpD contains an extended hydrophilic N-terminal domain of 400 amino acids exposed to the cytoplasm. This N-terminal domain is characterized by a high degree of homology between the so far known KdpD sequences from different organisms (Fig. 4). It is tempting to speculate that this domain, in addition to the four transmembrane helices, is involved in stimulus perception. We found that the stimulation of phosphatase activity of truncated forms of KdpD missing amino acid 12–128 is no longer dependent on ATP. Furthermore, we demonstrated that amino acids 12–128 of the N-terminal domain of KdpD are important for the regulation of kdpFABCexpression. KdpD(Δ12–395) and KdpD(Δ12–228) are not able to respond to an increase in osmolarity raised by the addition of NaCl. When cells synthesizing these truncated proteins were grown under K+-limiting conditions, the kdpFABC operon was expressed, but the level of expression was much lower in comparison with that of wild-type KdpD. In contrast, the truncation of amino acids 128–391 results in a KdpD protein that gave rise to the same expression level of the kdpFABC operon as wild-type KdpD. In addition to the strong dependence of the phosphatase activity on the presence of ATP we found that amino acids 31–39 comprise a motif that is conserved among the KdpD sequences (Fig. 4) and that is very similar to a classical ATP binding site (Walker A motif) of many ATP-requiring enzymes (29Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 4, a Walker B motif can also be found. The most frequently published form of the Walker A motif is GXXXXGKT (39Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 40Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The motif found in KdpD has one moreX between the first and second Gs. There is one other ATP-binding site found in the dethiobiotin synthetase that has the same insertion. Structural analysis of this protein reveals that the dehydral angles of the conserved residues of the motif are identical to those of other proteins containing the classical motif (41Huang W. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Gibson K.J. Flint D. Lorimer G. Structure. 1994; 2: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that KdpD contains a second, regulatory ATP-binding site. To test this hypothesis, we replaced together the conserved residues Gly37, Lys38, and Thr39 by site-directed mutagenesis. In this case kdpFABC expression is reduced to the same extent as it is seen with KdpD proteins missing this putative ATP-binding site. This results are in favor of the existence of a regulatory ATP-binding site in the N-terminal domain of KdpD. It is conceivable that the low level of kdpFABC expression is because of a decrease of the amount of KdpE∼P. Because in vitro no differences were seen in the kinase activities of KdpD proteins missing this site, it is suggested that ATP-binding regulates the phosphatase activity of KdpD. Indeed, we observed a deregulation of the phosphatase activity of KdpD proteins missing amino acids 12–128. However, the deregulation of the phosphatase activity in vitro was not observed with KdpD-G37A,K38A,T39C. Therefore, an interaction of the N- and the C-terminal domain may also contribute to the regulation of the phosphatase activity. An interaction of the input and transmitter domain depending on the stimulus might influence the switch between kinase and phosphatase activity in such a way that through conformational changes the accessibility of the putative regulatory ATP-binding site may vary and thereby the phosphatase activity might be tightly regulated. Although it is known that upon an osmotic upshift intracellular ATP concentration varies (42Ohwada T. Sagisaka S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is too premature to draw conclusions about the interplay between ATP concentration and activity of KdpD. There are to our knowledge only two other sensor kinases known that contain an additional nucleotide binding site (Walker A motif). In ChvG from Agrobacterium tumefaciens this putative site is located in the transmitter domain (43Charles T.C. Nester E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6614-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unorthodox sensor kinase BvgS fromBordetella pertussis contains such a motif in its linker region. Individual replacements of amino acid residues of this motif caused the inactivation of BvgS indicating the functional importance of this site (30Beier D. Deppisch H. Gross R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In summary, we could show here that the phosphatase activity of KdpD can be increased in the presence of ATP or ATP analogs. Furthermore, KdpD proteins missing amino acids 12–128 are characterized by a deregulated phosphatase activity in vitro. Finally, KdpD proteins missing a conserved motif in the N-terminal domain, which is similar to a classical ATP-binding site (Walker A), either by truncation or mutagenesis diminish kdpFABC expression in response to K+ limitation or osmotic upshock.

To determine if a similar association occurs between the ribosome and mitochondrial membrane protein(s) during protein import in higher eukaryotes, we examined ribosome-mitochondria binding. By using spectral measurements, analysis of mitochondrial associated RNA, and electron microscopy, we demonstrated that ribosomes stably bind to purified rat liver mitochondria in vitro. Binding of ribosomes to mitochondria was markedly reduced by GTP and nearly abolished by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine-5′-[thio]-triphosphate (GTPγS), but was only modestly reduced by GDP or ATP and unaffected by CTP. The initial rate of GTP hydrolysis by mitochondria was increased by ribosomes, whereas the rate of ATP hydrolysis by mitochondria was not affected. Ribosomes programmed with mRNA for 92 amino acids of the N terminus of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase bound to mitochondria, but unlike unprogrammed rat liver ribosomes, neither GTP nor GDP disrupted binding; however, GTPγS did. These data show that receptors specific for ribosomes are present on the mitochondrial membrane, and a GTP-dependent process mediates this binding. The presence of a nascent chain alters these binding characteristics.

These data show that receptors specific for ribosomes are present on the mitochondrial membrane, and a GTP-dependent process mediates this binding. The presence of a nascent chain alters these binding characteristics. These findings support the hypothesis that a co-translational translocation pathway exists for import of proteins into mitochondria. Proteins can cross membranes by either post-translational or co-translational translocation. Based on in vitroobservations, proteins targeted to the mitochondria are thought to be completely synthesized in the cytoplasm and cross the mitochondrial membrane(s) post-translationally (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). However, evidence consistent with a co-translational translocation pathway for mitochondrial protein import has been reported. For example, 1) the surface of mitochondria isolated from cycloheximide-treated yeast cells is observed to be studded with polysomes (2Kellems R. Butow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8043-8050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2) the number of bound polysomes is dependent on the metabolic state of the cells from which the mitochondria are isolated (3Kellems R. Butow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 3) ribosomes are bound to the mitochondria at the contact sites (4Kellems R. Allison V. Butow R. J. Cell. Biol. 1975; 65: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); and 4) the mRNA of polysomes that co-isolate with mitochondria is enriched in messages for mitochondrial proteins (5Ades I. Butow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9918-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Suissa M. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13048-13055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, both in vitroand in vivo, mitochondrial protein import can be instantaneously disrupted by cycloheximide-induced translation arrest indicating that no detectable pool of full-length precursor exists in the cytosol and that translation and import are tightly coupled (7Verner K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 366-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6841-6847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, methotrexate, which inhibits post-translational import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV-dihydrofolate reductase by preventing its unfolding, does not inhibit cytochrome oxidase subunit IV-dihydrofolate reductase import in vivo (9Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that co-translational translocation may eliminate the need for precursor proteins to be maintained in a translocation-competent state by chaperones in the cytoplasm. Almost all mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane proteins are synthesized with an N-terminal presequence and then imported into the mitochondria (10Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kiebler M. Becker K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presequence-containing precursor protein is presumably held in a translocation-competent conformation in the cytoplasm by hsp70 chaperonins probably in concert with the presequence-specific chaperonin, e.g. “targeting factor” or mitochondrial stimulating factor, and the precursor is recognized and imported by a multisubunit translocation complex in the mitochondrial membranes (13Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig A.E. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 333: 800-805Crossref Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J.

Since these early events in targeting and translocation clearly and specifically involve the N-terminal presequence, it is entirely possible that mitochondrial protein import can be initiated long before translation is complete. To examine the hypothesis that, in vivo, proteins import into the mitochondria by a co-translational translocation pathway, and to determine whether receptor(s) for the translation machinery at the outer membrane play a role in targeting an incompletely synthesized nascent polypeptide chain to the mitochondrial import site, we examined the interaction of the ribosome with the mitochondria. Specifically, ribosome binding to mitochondria was shown using three independent methods, and the ability of ribosome-bound nascent polypeptide chains to target the ribosome to the mitochondria was determined. Finally, because recent studies have shown that GTP-binding proteins are not only involved in initiating protein translocation at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-[thio]-triphosphate; EKMT, EDTA, high salt-washed mitochondria; EKMPMT, EDTA/high salt, metrizamide/Percoll-purified mitochondria; mMDH, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase; SRP, signal recognition particle; GNRP, guanine nucleotide release or exchange protein. but are also involved in protein import into chloroplast (19Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of ATP and GTP on ribosomes binding to mitochondria and the early events in protein translocation. Ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) were isolated from the post-mitochondrial supernatant of rat liver homogenates by a previously described method (20Bloemendel H. Benedetti E.L. Bont W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To remove endogenous GTPase activity, isolated ribosomes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m KOAc, 10 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), incubated at room temperature 15 min, and re-isolated by sedimentation through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion containing 0.5 m KOAc, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgOAc, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNasin. Rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes were isolated as described (21Lauring B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 9435-9439Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The final ribosomal pellets were resuspended in ribosome binding buffer (RB, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 unit/μl RNasin) and stored at −70 °C in small aliquots. Mitochondria were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat livers using previously published methods (22Chu T. Grant P. Strauss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12806-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were further purified to reduce ER contamination using metrizamide-Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described previously (23Storrie, B., and Madden, E. (19) Methods Enzymol., 182,203–225.Google Scholar). Final preparations were brought to a protein concentration between 5 or 15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 70 mm mannitol, and 250 mm sucrose (MIB) and either used immediately or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Ribosome binding activity and GTP hydrolysis was essentially the same for fresh and previously frozen mitochondria, although electron microscopy indicated integrity of the intermembrane was often disrupted in the previously frozen mitochondria. Mitochondria were washed using a previously described method for stripping ER membranes of ribosomes (24Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). For all experiments described, EDTA, high salt-washed mitochondria (EKMT) were used unless otherwise specified. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity and arylesterase activity were measured as described previously (25Cascarano J. Chambers P. Schwartz E. Poorkaj P. Gondo R. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 347-837Google Scholar, 26Shephard E. Hubscher G. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, respectively). The amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) produced from trinucleotide hydrolysis by mitochondria and ribosomes was determined using a modification of a previously described method (27Bitte L. Kabat D. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 563-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 17-μl samples were prepared as described above, and after incubation and pelleting, the supernatants were brought to 500 μl with water and 100 μl of 7.5 nH2SO4, 100 μl of 6.6% (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, and 80 μl of freshly prepared 0.36 mFeSO4·7H2O, 0.15 nH2SO4 were added sequentially. After a 20-min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 650 or 700 nm. To correct for light scattering, Pi contamination, and/or nucleotide degradation, background samples containing ribosomes, mitochondria, or ribosome-mitochondria complexes but lacking nucleotides, as well as samples containing only nucleotides, were run in parallel, and their absorbance was subtracted from the corresponding samples. Rat mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) mRNA was synthesized byin vitro transcription of linearized pGEM-mMDH as described previously (22Chu T. Grant P. Strauss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12806-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were cleaved in the mMDH coding region withFokI, and truncated mMDH mRNAs produced by in vitro transcription were translated in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine to produce stable ribosome-nascent chain complexes carrying peptides of defined length (28Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The TNT® T7 luciferase control plasmid was cleaved in the coding region withCfr10, and ribosome-nascent chain complexes were produced using the TNT®-coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system as recommended by the supplier (Promega). Ribosome-nascent chain complexes were isolated as described (21Lauring B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 9435-9439Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except the ribosomes were not high salt- washed and the sucrose cushion contained 100 mmKOAc instead of 500 mm KOAc. Before each binding assay, ribosomes were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 2 min to remove insoluble material. Mitochondria (75–300 μg as indicated) and ribosomes (2–16 μg as indicated) were mixed in a total reaction volume of 17 or 25 μl of RB/MIB (1:3). Either ATP, GTP, GDP, GTPγS, or CTP was added to a final concentration of 1.2 mm as indicated. Samples were incubated for 0–15 min at room temperature, and mitochondria were immediately sedimented at 17,000 × g for 2 min. The mitochondrial pellets were washed with MIB and resuspended in MIB containing 1 mmMgCl2, and the absorbance of the supernatant and/or mitochondrial suspension was measured at 260 and 280 nm for each sample. In parallel, samples containing only mitochondria and nucleotide were assayed and set as background for the corresponding ribosome, mitochondria, and nucleotide sample. When ribosomes carried [35S]methionine-labeled nascent chains, the relative amount of ribosome-nascent chain complex binding was also determined by liquid scintillation counting of the ribosome-mitochondrial pellet. To verify that absorbance changes of the resuspended mitochondrial pellets reflected differential ribosomal binding, 400–450 μg of mitochondria were incubated with approximately 75 μg of ribosomes in 200 μl of RB/MIB (1:3) for 5 min at room temperature. The ribosome-mitochondria complexes were divided into 30-μl aliquots, sedimented (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in 30 μl of RB/MIB (1:3) containing either 0.1 or 5 mm ATP, GTP, GDP, GTPγS, CTP, or no nucleotide. Samples were again incubated at room temperature for 5 min and sedimented through an equal volume of 1.0 m sucrose cushion (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Pellets and supernatants were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and the RNA ethanol-precipitated. The resuspended RNA was subjected to both agarose gel electrophoresis and dot blot analysis, using a [32P]dCTP-radiolabeled 300-nucleotide cDNA probe that had been amplified by polymerase chain reaction using cytoplasmic 18 S rRNA as a template (GenBankTM accession number V01270. Sense primer, 5′-TACATGCCGACGGGCGCTGACC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCTGCTGCCTTCCTTGGATG-3′). The 18 S probe was tested by Northern blot analysis to confirm that the RNA visualized by ethidium bromide staining corresponded to cytosolic 18 S rRNA and not mitochondrial rRNA. Samples were prepared for electron microscopy by adding 100 μl of mitochondria or ribosome-mitochondria complexes (approximately 7.5 μg of mitochondrial protein/μl) to 1 ml of fixative containing 4% glutaraldehyde, 100 mmsucrose, 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (glutaraldehyde/sucrose/cacodylate buffer). Fixed samples were washed with 100 mm sucrose, 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, postfixed in 1% OsO4, and dehydrated in graded ethanols. Samples were embedded in Spurr's resin (29Spurr A.R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1969; 26: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10193) Google Scholar), thin sectioned, and examined using a Philips 400 TEM operating at 80 KeV (Micromed, Wake Forest University School of Medicine). Ten randomly selected fields for mitochondria under each condition were photographed at a magnification of × 15,200, and the number of ribosomes per field was counted by hand. To ensure that each field had the same amount of mitochondrial surface area, point count stereology was used to quantify the relative surface areas of en face versus cross-sectional views of mitochondria (30Weibel E.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1969; 26: 235-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Between all fields in all conditions, this ratio was very constant at 0.31 to 0.33, and thus, absolute numbers of ribosomes are reported for comparison between fields. For each condition, the fields with the highest and lowest counts of ribosomes were discarded, and the average and standard deviation of the remaining eight fields are reported. Rat liver mitochondria prepared by differential centrifugation have been shown to contain other organelles including a significant amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes (26Shephard E. Hubscher G. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In order to examine only the ribosome-mitochondria interaction, crude mitochondrial preparations were either subjected to EDTA and high salt treatment (24Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), purification by density gradient centrifugation (23Storrie, B., and Madden, E. (19) Methods Enzymol., 182,203–225.Google Scholar), or both. All preparations were analyzed for activity of the RER-specific enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase, and arylesterase. Based on enzyme activity, either density gradient centrifugation (MPMT) or EDTA/high salt treatment of mitochondria (EKMT) reduced the amount of RER contamination by about 75%, whereas density gradient centrifugation followed by EDTA/high salt treatment (EKMPMT) essentially eliminated RER contamination (Fig. 1). Prior to conducting ribosome-mitochondria binding experiments, cytosolic rat liver ribosomes were washed in high salt to remove endogenous GTPase activity and were tested for inorganic phosphate production from GTP or ATP. The initial rate of GTP hydrolysis by ribosomes was reduced approximately 80% by high salt treatment (TableI). Ribosomes preparations were also analyzed for RER enzyme markers and were shown to be free of RER contamination (Fig. 1).Table IPhosphate production5 min10 minA 260/A 280aMeasurements were taken for samples incubated at room temperature for 10 min.nmolHigh salt-washed ribosomes0.6 ± 0.21.76 ± 0.04Mitochondria0.4 ± 0.21.07 ± 0.02High salt-washed ribosomes + mitochondria0.5 ± 0.31.17 ± 0.01Ribosomes + ATP4.4 ± 0.7High salt-washed ribosomes + ATP2.9 ± 0.43.7 ± 1.1Mitochondria + ATP11.7 ± 2.015.9 ± 0.91.09 ± 0.02High salt-washed ribosomes + mitochondria + ATP14.0 ± 0.317.7 ± 0.81.15 ± 0.02Ribosomes + GTP3.3 ± 0.9High salt-washed ribosomes + GTP0.7 ± 0.20.9 ± 1.1Mitochondria + GTP9.6 ± 0.615.6 ± 1.31.08 ± 0.02High salt-washed ribosomes + Mitochondria + GTP18.9 ± 1.020.9 ± 0.91.09 ± 0.02High salt-washed ribosomes + GTPγS0.5 ± 0.5Mitochondria + GTPγS1.3 ± 0.3High salt-washed ribosomes + mitochondria + GTPγS3.5 ± 0.5Each value listed represents the mean ± S.D. from at least three experiments.

Open table in a new tab Each value listed represents the mean ± S.D. from at least three experiments. Each assay included 150 μg of EDTA/high salt-washed mitochondria, 5 μg of ribosomes, and 1.2 mm nucleotides. High salt-washed ribosomes were incubated with EDTA/high salt-washed, density gradient purified mitochondria (EKMPMT); the ribosome-mitochondria complexes were separated from free ribosomes by sedimentation, and the A 260 of resuspended complexes and/or the free ribosomes remaining in the supernatant were measured. The difference in the A 260 between resuspended mitochondria incubated without ribosomes and mitochondria incubated with ribosomes was taken to represent ribosome binding. As shown in Fig. 2, ribosomes bind to both freshly isolated and previously frozen mitochondria. The number of ribosomes bound per mg of mitochondria is much higher in the previously frozen samples, presumably because the mitochondrial contents leak out of the mitochondria upon freeze-thawing. Freshly isolated mitochondria will bind approximately one ribosome per 1.7 fg of mitochondrial protein when saturated with ribosomes (Fig. 2). Because ATP is required for post-translational import of proteins into the mitochondria and because GTP is required for co-translational translocation of protein into the ER, we hypothesized that nucleotides would alter ribosome binding to mitochondria. Formation of ribosome-mitochondria complexes was measured as before except samples were initially incubated with or without ATP, GTP, GDP, GTPγS, or CTP. A differential increase in the A 260 andA 280 resulting in an increasedA 260/A 280 ratio (Table I) was observed when resuspended mitochondria had been incubated with ribosomes compared to when resuspended mitochondria had been incubated alone. This indicates that the ribonucleic acid-containing ribosomes associate with mitochondria, and the increase in theA 260 was arbitrarily set to represent 100% ribosome binding (Fig. 3, lane MR). Similar increases in the A 260 andA 280 were observed when 1.2 mm CTP was included in binding assay (Fig. 3, lane MRCTP). However, when 1.2 mm GTP or GTPγS was included, only minimal increases in absorbance were observed (Fig. 3, lanes MRGTPand MRGTPS). Inclusion of GDP or ATP in the binding assay resulted in A 260 increases that were somewhat lower than values obtained in the absence of nucleotide but were also significantly higher than GTP and GTPγS. This indicates that the association between ribosomes and mitochondria can be blocked by GTP or GTPγS but is only mildly affected by ATP or GDP. Under the conditions used here, it is unclear if the effect of ATP on binding is direct or a result of conversion of ATP to GTP from existing GDP. However, the dramatic effects of GTP or GTPγS on complex formation was statistically different from complex formation under all other conditions tested indicating that GTP plays a dominant role in controlling the ribosome-mitochondria association. To confirm that the increases in the A 260 and the A 280 for mitochondria incubated with ribosomes were due to ribosome-mitochondria binding, ribosome-mitochondria complexes were pre-formed by incubation of EKMPMT with high salt-washed ribosomes in the absence of nucleotides. The pre-formed complexes were isolated by sedimentation, and the pellets were resuspended in RB/MIB containing either no nucleotide, GTP, GDP, GTPγS, or ATP at a concentration of either 0.1 or 5 mm. Complexes were re-isolated by sedimentation, and to assess whether ribosomes remained bound under each condition, the relative amount of rRNA in the supernatants and pellets was determined by subjecting the extracted samples to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining or by dot blot analysis (Fig. 4). Ribosomal RNA extracted from the pellet represents the stably bound ribosomes, whereas rRNA in the supernatant represents ribosomes that were released from the mitochondria. When no nucleotide was added to the pre-formed complexes, nearly all rRNA re-sedimented with the mitochondria (Fig. 4, A andB, lane −NTP). Again, this indicates that the ribosomes remained stably bound to mitochondria in the absence of nucleotide. As expected, pellets obtained from pre-formed ribosome-mitochondria complexes incubated with GTP, GDP, or GTPγS contained less rRNA demonstrating that guanine nucleotides selectively disrupt binding (Fig. 4 A, lanes GTP, GDP, andGTPγS). ATP did not significantly disrupt binding under these conditions, and the effect of GDP on binding was considerably less than GTP. These differences were observed even at low concentration (0.1 mm) of GTP (data not shown). Samples containing mitochondria alone were treated exactly as the ribosome-mitochondria complexes and subjected to dot blot analysis in parallel, but no radioactivity was detectable for these samples. In agreement with spectral data, GTP and GTPγS have the greatest effect on ribosome-mitochondrial complex stability. These data show that 1) the spectroscopic absorbance changes correlate well with changes in ribosome binding, and 2) the ribosome-mitochondrial interaction is not the result of nonspecific binding since, when ribosome-mitochondria complexes are pre-formed, this interaction can be specifically reversed by GTP or GTPγS. Finally, to confirm that the spectral data and dot blot analysis measured ribosome-mitochondria binding and not another process, such as ribosome aggregation and de-aggregation, ribosome-mitochondria complexes were examined by electron microscopy. Frozen unwashed mitochondria were thawed and washed twice in MIB. An aliquot was removed and fixed in glutaraldehyde/sucrose/cacodylate buffer. The remaining mitochondria were then EDTA/high salt-washed (EKMT) and an aliquot of these mitochondria was removed and fixed. Ribosomes were then added to the rest of the sample, and the sample was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot was then removed, and the ribosome-mitochondria complexes were sedimented, washed in MIB, and fixed as before. The remaining sample was divided into 2 aliquots, and GTP was added to one of the aliquots at a final concentration of 1 mm. These two samples were incubated for 5 min, sedimented, washed in MIB, and then fixed. As shown in Fig. 5 A, ribosomes are bound to the mitochondrial membrane surface prior to EDTA/high-salt treatment. EDTA/high salt-washed mitochondrial membranes are devoid of ribosomes (Fig. 5 B), but when ribosomes are added to these mitochondria, ribosomes again bind to the mitochondrial membrane surface (Fig. 5 A, compare panels B andC). Finally, when GTP is added to the ribosome-mitochondria complexes, the number of ribosomes associated with the mitochondrial surface is markedly reduced compared with ribosome-mitochondria complexes before addition of GTP (Fig. 5 A,comparepanels C and D) or compared with ribosome-mitochondria complexes incubated without GTP (data not shown). To quantify these observed differences in ribosome binding, we counted the number of ribosomes binding to mitochondria from 10 random fields of all four conditions. Fig. 5 B, lanes A andB, demonstrates that the observed differences in ribosome binding from Fig. 5 A is real and that there is a statistically significant difference between panels C andD. Thus, these data show that ribosomes co-isolating with mitochondria remain bound to the mitochondrial surface even after freeze-thawing but that these ribosomes can be completely removed by EDTA/high salt treatment. EDTA/high salt treatment, however, does not cause mitochondria to lose their ability to bind ribosomes (panel C). Finally, GTP is very effective at removing ribosomes from the mitochondrial surface and clearly disrupts the ribosome-mitochondrial interaction (panel D). In summary, we have used three different experimental approaches to independently prove that ribosomes specifically bind to mitochondria. These data also show that the interaction is affected by GTP and is reversible, providing strong evidence that this interaction is physiologically significant. Because the presence of nucleotide had a marked effect on ribosome-mitochondria binding, we hypothesized that nucleotide hydrolysis was associated with this binding. The amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) produced on the cytosolic side of isolated mitochondria was quantified in the absence and presence of ribosomes and nucleotides (Table I). Following sedimentation of the mitochondria, essentially no Pi was detected in the supernatants from EKMT, high salt-washed ribosomes, or ribosomes and EKMT together, when incubated without a trinucleotide. In addition, very little Pi was produced when EKMT, ribosomes, or ribosomes and EKMT together were incubated with GTPγS (Table I). In contrast, Fig. 6 shows the curve for Piproduced from GTP by EKMPMT, in the absence and presence of ribosomes. The initial rate of hydrolysis of GTP by mitochondria alone was 20 nmol/min/mg but was much higher at 85 nmol/min/mg for mitochondria and ribosomes together. Since ribosomes had no GTPase activity, acceleration of Pi production by mitochondria in the presence of ribosomes is due to the interaction between mitochondria and ribosomes increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis. The rate of Pi production in the presence of ATP and, therefore, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by mitochondria in the presence of ribosomes, is approximately equal to the sum of the individual rates of Pi production by mitochondria and ribosomes alone indicating that the ribosome-mitochondria interaction does not affect the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Table I). Thus, the ribosome-mitochondrial interaction stimulates GTP hydrolysis which suggests this is a specific receptor-ligand interaction that is controlled by a GTP-dependent step. The presence of ribosome-binding sites on the mitochondria suggested that ribosome-mitochondrial binding might be functionally important in co-translational translocation. At physiologic concentrations of GTP, however, ribosomes isolated from the post-mitochondrial cytosol did not stably bind to mitochondria. Since the transit peptide is responsible for targeting a mitochondrial protein in the post-translational import pathway, we proposed that a nascent chain containing a mitochondrial transit peptide would be capable of directing the ribosome to the mitochondria and stabilize binding in the presence of GTP, whereas ribosomes carrying non-mitochondrial nascent chains would behave like unprogrammed ribosomes in the presence of GTP. Ribosomes protect about 40 of the most recently added C-terminal amino acids of the growing polypeptide chain from macromolecules of the cytosol but allow exposure of the N-terminal end of the nascent polypeptide to the cytosol prior to complete translation (31Berkovitch-Yellin Z. Bennett W.S. Yonath A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 403-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A truncated mRNA lacking a stop codon and containing the coding region of the N-terminal end of precursor mMDH was designed to minimize exposure of the mature portion of mMDH while allowing complete exposure of the transit peptide to the cytosol (32Grant P.M. Tellam J. May V.L. Strauss A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6053-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mRNA for this 92-amino acid polypeptide was translated using [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the ribosome-nascent chain complexes were isolated by sedimentation, and the complexes were assayed for EKMT binding activity in the absence or presence of di- or trinucleotides. An 86-amino acid nascent luciferase polypeptide was used as a non-mitochondrial, targeted protein control and was produced similarly to the mMDH precursor. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 7 and show that when the ribosomes carry a mitochondrial transit peptide-containing nascent chain, the presence of GTP does not significantly reduce the amount of ribosome-nascent chain complexes bound to the mitochondria compared with the amount of ribosome-nascent chain complexes bound when no nucleotide is present (Fig. 7 A). Similarly, when GDP was included, the number of ribosome-nascent chain complexes bound to mitochondria was not significantly different from the number of complexes bound in the absence of nucleotide. However, the presence of GTPγS greatly reduced the formation of stable ribosome-mitochondria complexes. These results differ from our earlier findings using unprogrammed ribosomes that showed that GTP caused a significant reduction in stable ribosome-mitochondria complex formation. In addition, the ribosomes carrying the non-mitochondrial luciferase nascent chains behave like unprogrammed ribosomes (Fig. 7 B) and do not stably bind to mitochondria in the presence of either GTP or GTPγS. Thus, the presence of the transit peptide blocks GTP-dependent release of the ribosome from the mitochondria and allows stable formation of a ribosome-nascent chain-mitochondrial complex. These experiments show that the transit peptide causes selective stabilization of ribosome-mitochondria binding in the presence of GTP and suggest a mechanism for selective import in the presence of a nonselective ribosome receptor; unprogrammed ribosomes and ribosomes programmed with non-mitochondrial proteins are not stably bound to the mitochondrial membrane. Additionally, it is clear that in the presence of ribosomes, the transit peptide alone is not capable of directing the nascent polypeptide to the mitochondria since the non-hydrolyzable GTPγS destabilizes this binding. A GTP-dependent process, therefore, must function in ribosome binding to mitochondria. In this report we have demonstrated that ribosomes bind specifically to rat liver mitochondria and that both GTP and the nature of the nascent chain attached to the ribosome affect binding. Specifically, GTP significantly attenuated stable ribosome-mitochondria binding unless mitochondrial transit peptide-containing translation intermediates were complexed with the ribosomes. In addition, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP almost completely abolished the formation of stable ribosome-mitochondria complexes whether or not ribosomes carried presequence-containing nascent chains. We also demonstrated that whereas isolated intact mitochondria hydrolyze GTP, hydrolysis of GTP was greatly accelerated when GTPase-depleted ribosomes were added to the reaction. This report supports, but does not prove, the hypothesis of co-translational mitochondrial import by establishing a central element in this model, namely ribosomes selectively and stably bind to mitochondria. Our data suggest that the interaction of ribosomes with the mitochondria could use components and proceed by a pathway, similar to those used to initiate co-translational translocation at the ER membrane. It is now becoming clear that ribosomes target to the translocation apparatus, specifically, the sec61p complex at the ER membrane independent of the signal recognition particle (SRP) (21Lauring B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 9435-9439Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Neuhof A. Rolls M. Jungnickel B. Kalies K. Rapoport T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The interaction of the ribosome with both SRP and the translocation apparatus at the ER membrane involves GTP in both complexes (34Bacher G. Lutcke H. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At the ER membrane, GTP also controls the release of SRP from SRP receptor and the initiation of delivery of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the membrane. In short, ribosomes, alone, possess the ability to bind specifically to the ER translocon, but under physiological conditions, G-proteins affect the interactions between components of the targeting apparatus including the SRP-ribosome interaction, the SRP-SRP receptor interaction, and the ribosome-membrane attachment to accomplish correct protein trafficking. A cytosolic mitochondrial precursor-specific chaperonin, mitochondrial stimulating factor, has been functionally compared with SRP; however, it is an ATP-dependent protein and has only been shown to function post-translationally having no known interaction with the ribosome (13Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig A.E. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 333: 800-805Crossref Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15Ono H. Tuboi S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Hachiya N. Komiya T. Alam R. Iwahashi J. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5146-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In our experiments, ribosome-mitochondria binding was only modestly affected by ATP, and the ribosome-mitochondria interaction did not have any effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Whether ATP has a direct effect on binding or simply provides a source for generating GTP is unclear. What is clear, however, is that GTPγS almost completely disrupted the ribosome-mitochondria binding showing that GTP hydrolysis has an important role in controlling this interaction. Our results demonstrate that, similar to what occurs at the ER membrane, ribosomes bind tightly to the mitochondrial membrane surface and that at least one GTP-binding factor, and the nature of the nascent chain bound to the ribosome, affect the stability of this interaction. These analogies to protein targeting to the ER have led us to propose that higher eukaryotic mitochondria contain ribosome receptors, possibly similar to the sec61p complex, which are active in initiating co-translational translocation. We observed that ribosome-mitochondria binding is actively destabilized by GTP unless the ribosome carries a transit peptide-containing nascent chain. That binding is stable in the absence of nucleotide and only mildly disturbed by GDP indicates that ribosomes interact with mitochondria when a G-protein of the binding apparatus is free of nucleotide or loaded with GDP. Since most G-proteins tightly bind GDP, ribosomes probably bind to mitochondria when a G-protein of the binding apparatus is GDP-bound. In general, it is the release of GDP by the action of guanine nucleotide release or exchange protein (GNRP) that allows G-proteins to bind GTP and the action of a third protein, G activation protein, that induces hydrolysis of GTP by G-proteins (35Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Because GTPγS destabilizes ribosome-mitochondria binding, we know that hydrolysis of GTP is not required to destabilize binding. This implies that it is the action of a GNRP upon ribosome-mitochondria binding that destabilizes the interaction. Since both stimulation of GNRP activity and G activation protein activity result in accelerated GTP hydrolysis, this is consistent with the observation that the rate of GTP hydrolysis by mitochondria increases in the presence of ribosomes. Therefore, we propose that the ribosome-mitochondria interaction stimulates GNRP activity, and that GTP binding to an unidentified G-protein destabilizes binding unless a transit peptide is present. We also suggest that a GNRP is located either on the ribosome, or the mitochondria, and that the G-protein is located on the other so that GTP binding essentially lowers the affinity of the ribosome for the mitochondria. The ribosome-mitochondria interaction behaves similarly to the ribosome-ER interaction except that the action of an SRP-like component that recognizes the transit peptide occurs at the mitochondrial membrane. These data clearly show a direct link between the cytosolic translation machinery and the mitochondria, as well as a ribosomal influence on mitochondrial GTP hydrolysis. These findings are strongly supportive of the hypothesis that in vivo mitochondrial proteins are imported by co-translational translocation and indicate the potential importance of GTP in the mitochondrial protein import system (7Verner K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 366-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The current view is that precursor proteins are translated in the cytosol, accompanied by chaperones to the mitochondrial surface, and imported by a specific, multi-subunit import apparatus. However, the experimental observations on which this model is based is biased for several reasons. First, nearly all of the studies defining mitochondrial protein import have used in vitro systems in which the precursor proteins are first translated and then the translated product is added to mitochondria for import. This system works well in defining the import apparatus, but mechanisms for co-translational import are completely missed by this approach. Second, most of the work defining protein import has been accomplished in yeast andNeurospora. However, there are significant differences in transmembrane protein transfer at the ER between yeast and higher eukaryotic cells, showing that yeast is not always representative of more complex cellular processes such as those found in mammalian mitochondria (36Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30299-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, it is clear that the interior of a eukaryotic cell is highly structured so that even soluble cytoplasmic proteins do not diffuse freely but rather are recruited in specific cytoplasmic domains (37Hovland R. Hesketh J.E. Pryme I.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The current assumption that precursor proteins are translated in the cytosol and then reach their target by chemical diffusion is inconsistent with the current view of a highly structured cytosol and could potentially be rate-limiting for cells with high rates of metabolism. While at least some completely synthesized mitochondrial proteins import post-translationally into isolated mitochondria, the fact that most mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane proteins contain an N-terminal transit peptide suggests that recruiting begins long before protein synthesis is complete. Further work is necessary to establish the relationship between mitochondria, ribosomes, the nascent polypeptide, and GTP. It is intriguing, however, that other investigators have found G-proteins in the membrane and contact sites of mitochondria of higher eukaryotes (38Lithgow T. Timms M. Hφj P. Hoogenraad N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Takeda S. Sagara Y. Kita K. Natori S. Sekimizu K. J. Biochem.

Recently, it has been proposed that the release of pyrophosphate from Compound 1 can be catalyzed of two-valent ions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ (11De Saizieu A. Vankan P. van Loon A.P.G.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The conversion of Compound 3 to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (Compound 4) is catalyzed by dihydroneopterin aldolase (12Mathis J.B. Brown G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Compound 4 is converted to dihydrofolate by the subsequent condensation with 4-aminobenzoate and glutamate by the catalytic action of dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate synthetase, respectively (13Green J.M. Nichols B.P. Matthews R.G. Neidhardt F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 2nd Ed. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 665-673Google Scholar). An enzyme catalyzing the epimerization of the folate precursor, dihydroneopterin triphosphate, under formation of 7,8-dihydromonapterin (Compound 2) had been observed in Escherichia coli by Heine and Brown (14Heine M.C. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, the primary structure of this enzyme has been determined and has been found to show similarity to the dihydroneopterin aldolase domain of a multifunctional folate biosynthetic enzyme from Pneumocystis carinii (15Haußmann C. Rohdich F. Lottspeich F. Eberhardt S. Scheuring J. Mackamul S. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 949-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the epimerase is similar to a reading frame at 69.0 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). of the E. colichromosome designated ygiG (EMBL accession number L12966) in the close vicinity of the bacitracin resistance gene. This reading frame specifies the dihydroneopterin aldolase of E. coli,which is a potential target for the development of enzyme inhibitors with antibacterial and/or antiprotozoal activity. This paper reports on structural and mechanistic similarities of dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase and dihydroneopterin aldolase. It also shows that the single Hemophilus influenzae homolog of these proteins (specified by the unannotated open reading frameygiG_haein) is an aldolase-type enzyme. 6-Hydroxymethylpterin,d-dihydroneopterin, l-dihydromonapterin,d-dihydromonapterin, l-neopterin,l-monapterin, d-dihydroneopterin monophosphate,d-neopterin, and dihydrobiopterin were purchased from Dr. B. Schircks (Jona, Switzerland). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany), Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany), and New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Goldstar DNA polymerase was obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). GTP cyclohydrolase I was purified from a recombinant E. coli strain as described earlier (9Nar H. Huber R. Auerbach G.

Reaction mixtures containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m KCl, 50 mm GTP, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.05 mg/ml recombinant E. coli GTP cyclohydrolase I were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Protein was then removed by ultrafiltration using a YM-30 membrane (Amicom Inc.). An aliquot of this reaction mixture (20 μl) was added to 80 μl of a solution containing 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.2, and 8 mm MgCl2. The epimerase reaction was started by the addition of protein solution. The reaction mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a solution (30 μl) containing 1% I2 and 2% (w/v) KI in 1m HCl. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Excess iodine was reduced by the addition of 2% ascorbic acid (10 μl, w/v). A solution (210 μl) containing 1.5 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 4.8 mm ZnCl2, 4.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, grade II) was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Trichloroacetic acid (50 μl, 40%, w/v) was added. Aliquots of 10 μl were analyzed by HPLC using a reversed-phase column (4 × 250 mm) of Nucleosil RP18 and an eluent containing 0.5% (w/v) H3BO3, pH 4.7. The effluent was monitored fluorometrically (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 446 nm). The flow rate was 2 ml/min. The retention volume was 7 ml ford-erythro-neopterin and 9 ml forl-threo-neopterin (monapterin). The assay is based on a method described earlier (12Mathis J.B. Brown G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 70 μm dihydroneopterin, and protein. The mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 1 m HCl containing 1% I2 and 2% (w/v) KI. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Excess iodine was reduced by the addition of 2% ascorbic acid (10 μl, w/v). The samples were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using a column (4 × 250 mm) of Nucleosil RP18 and an eluent containing 30 mm HCOOH and 7% MeOH. 6-Hydroxymethylpterin was detected fluorometrically (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 446 nm). The retention volume was 6.5 ml. The expression plasmids for the folX andfolB genes were constructed as described by Richter et al. (16Richter G. Fischer M. Krieger C. Eberhardt S. Lüttgen H. Gerstenschläger I. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2022-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The folX and folB genes ofE. coli were amplified by PCR with chromosomal DNA fromE. coli XL1-Blue as template. The folB gene ofH. influenzae was amplified by PCR using the plasmid GHIFL0I as template (Table I). The folX gene was amplified with the oligonucleotides EpiExsense as forward primer and EpiExanti as reverse primer (Table II). The folBgene of E. coli was amplified with ECAL1 as forward primer and ECAL2 as reverse primer (Table II), and the folB gene ofH. influenzae was amplified with HAEALD1 as forward primer and HAEALD2 as reverse primer (Table II). Each amplification product served as template for a second PCR with the universal forward primer kEcoRI (Tables II and Table III). The reverse primer EpiExanti was used for the folX gene. The reverse primer ECAL2 was used for the folB gene of E. coli, and the reverse primer HAEALD2 for the folB gene of H. influenzae. The PCR products (folB ofH. influenzae and folX of E. coli) were cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated in the expression vector pNCO113, which had been digested withEcoRI and BamHI, whereas the folB gene of E. coli was cleaved with PstI andEcoRI and then ligated into the expression vector pNCO113, which had been digested with PstI and EcoRI. The expression plasmids designated pEPI (containing the folXgene of E. coli), pEAL (containing the folB gene of E. coli), and pHIAL containing thefolB gene of H. influenzae) (Table I) were transformed into E. coli M15(pREP4). Kanamycin (20 μg/ml) and ampicillin (180 μg/ml) were added for the maintenance of the plasmids in the host strain.Table IIPrimers used for PCR amplificationECAL15′-GGA GAA ATT AAC CAT GGA TAT TGT TTT TAT AGA GCA AC-3′ECAL25′-CCG AAC TGC AGC GTA TGA CCA G-3′Episense5′-TAA AGA ACC TTC GTT TGC GTA C-3′EpiExsense5′-GAG GAG AAA TTA ACC ATG GCA CAG CCT GCA GCA ATA ATA CG-3′EpiExanti5′-TGT TCA TGC AGG ATC CCC ATA TGG-3′kEcoRI5′-ACA CAG AAT TCA TTA AAG AGG AGA AAT TAA CCA TG-3′EpiKpn5′-CTT CGG TAC CCA CCA CTT C-3′EpiPst5′-CTA CAG CAC TGC AGA TAT TGC-3′Epi015′-ATG TAC ACA AGC GGC TGG-3′Epi025′-GTG CCA GCA CTA CAC CGG-3′HAEALD15′-GAG GAG AAA TTA ACC ATG GAT CGT GTT TTT ATT GAA GAA TTG-3′HAEALD25′-TCA ATT AAA TTG GAT CCC TGT CAG-3′kan015′-CAC GAC GGG CGT TCC TTG CG-3′kan025′-GCG ATA CCG TAA AGC ACG AGG-3′Kana45′-CTG CAG AAC CAA CAC GCG GAG G-3′kan-Rbs-15′-AAA GAG GAG AAA TTA ACT ATG CTT GAA CAA GAT GGA TTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Table IIIConstruction of expression plasmids for the folB genes of E. coli and H. influenzae and for the folX gene of E. coliGeneForward 1 primeraSee Table II for primer sequences.Forward 2 primeraSee Table II for primer sequences.Reverse primeraSee Table II for primer sequences.TemplateResulting plasmidfolB (E. coli)ECAL1kEcoRIECAL2Chromosomal DNApEALfolB (H. influenzae)HAEALD1kEcoRIHAEALD2GHIFL01pHIALfolX (E. coli)EpiExsensekEcoRIEpiExantiChromosomal DNApEPIa See Table II for primer sequences. Open table in a new tab The folX gene and the adjacent regions were amplified by PCR with EpiKpn as forward primer and EpiPst as reverse primer (Table II) using chromosomal E. coli XL1 DNA as template. The amplification product was cleaved with KpnI and PstI and then ligated into the vector pMAK705, which had previously been digested with KpnI and PstI. The vector contains the temperature-sensitive pSC101 origin of replication and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. The resulting plasmid, pMAK705E, was digested with EcoRV. The folX gene contains two internal EcoRV sites, and digestion results in the excision of a DNA fragment of 105 bp. A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified by PCR using the forward primer kan-Rbs-1 and the reverse primer Kana4 (Table II) with the plasmid pREP4 (Table I) as template. The EcoRV-digested plasmid pMAK705E was T-tailed withTaq polymerase, and the product was ligated with the kanamycin resistance cassette, yielding the plasmid pMAK705EK (Table Iand Fig. 2). The replacement of the chromosomal folX gene is a modification of the methods described by Hamilton et al. (17Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Russel and Model (18Russel M. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Fermér and Swedberg (19Fermér C. Swedberg G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 831-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pMAK705EK was transformed into therecA+ E. coli strain SK6600. The plasmid replicates at 30 °C, but not at 44 °C. Growth at 44 °C on plates that contain chloramphenicol selects clones with the plasmid integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination. This results in a tandem arrangement of the intact folX gene adjacent to the inactivated folX gene with the kanamycin insert. PCR screening was performed using two pairs of primers in order to check whether the integration of the inactivated folXgene had occurred by homologous recombination. The forward primer Epi01, complementary to the E. coli chromosome in the direct vicinity of the 5′-end of the folX insert, in combination with the reverse primer kan02, complementary to the folXinsert, should result in a fragment of ∼1.2 kb. The forward primer kan01, complementary to the kanamycin gene, and the reverse primer Epi02 (Table II), complementary to the E. coli chromosome in the direct vicinity of the 3′-end of the folX insert, should result in the amplification of a 1.4-kb fragment. One of 12 clones screened with this method showed the correct pattern of amplificates. The resolution of this cointegrate was achieved by overnight incubation of the bacterial strain in LB liquid medium containing 20 mg/liter chloramphenicol at 30 °C. Cells were then diluted 105-fold and grown on plates containing chloramphenicol at 30 °C. Plasmid isolation of the resulting colonies showed that ∼50% of the colonies now contained an intact folX gene on the plasmid and therefore the defective folX gene on the chromosome. Curing of the clones was achieved by growing them at 44 °C on LB plates. The resulting clones were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Epimerase activity could not be detected in cell extracts of the mutants. PCR amplification using the forward primer Episense and the reverse primer Epianti (Table II) resulted in amplificates of ∼1400 bp, whereas the intact folX gene yields amplificates of ∼300 bp. For the comparison of growth rates, SK6600 cells with intact or defective folX genes were grown on LB medium as well as on M9 minimal medium supplemented with vitamin-free casamino acids (Gibco BRL). E. coli strain M15(pREP4) carrying the expression plasmid pEAL was grown to a density of 0.6A600 nm units in shaking flasks with LB medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin and 180 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 2.0 mm, and incubation was continued for a period of 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; and stored at −20 °C. Frozen cell mass (8.3 g) was suspended in 50 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 mg/ml DNase and 0.02 mg/ml RNase. Bacteria were lysed by ultrasonic treatment, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was heated to 95 °C in a water bath for 3.5 min and was then cooled in ice water. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded on a Sepharose Q column (2 × 11 cm; Pharmacia) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM-30 membrane). Concentrated fractions (8 ml) were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 60 cm; Pharmacia). The column was developed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Dihydroneopterin aldolase from H. influenzae could be purified using the same procedure. E. colistrain M15(pREP4) harboring the expression plasmid pEpi was grown in LB medium containing 150 mg/liter ampicillin and 20 mg/liter kanamycin. The culture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking. At a cell density of 0.6 A600 nm units, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and incubation was continued overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Frozen cell mass (8.5 g) was thawed and resuspended in 80 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 mg/ml DNase and 0.02 mg/ml RNase. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded on a Sepharose Q column (2.5 × 12 cm). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM-30 membrane), and subjected to heat treatment at 80 °C for 4 min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The enzyme was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 60 cm). The column was developed with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. The flow rate was 3 ml/min. Steady-state kinetic experiments were performed at 37 °C. Km andVmax were determined by least-square fit according to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the programs Origin (Microcal) and Excel (Microsoft). The equilibrium constant for epimerization of dihydroneopterin triphosphate and dihydromonapterin triphosphate catalyzed by dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase was estimated from the composition of reaction mixtures that had reached a state of apparent equilibrium. Experiments were performed with an analytical ultracentrifuge (Optima XL-I, Beckman Instruments) equipped with absorbance and interference optics. Experiments were performed in double sector cells with aluminum centerpieces and sapphire windows. Fluorochemical FC43 (10 μl; Beckman Instruments) was added to the sample compartment for sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The partial specific volume was estimated on the basis of amino acid compositions (20Lane T.M. Shak B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.C. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

Protein (∼2 mg/ml) dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (ρ = 1.0228 g cm−3), was centrifuged at 4 °C and 7000 rpm for 72 h. Protein concentration was monitored by laser interferometry. We have recently reported the sequence of dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase from E. coli (15Haußmann C. Rohdich F. Lottspeich F. Eberhardt S. Scheuring J. Mackamul S. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 949-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A data base search indicated that an open reading frame in the neighborhood of the bacAgene located at 69.0 kb on the E. coli chromosome specifies a similar protein (30% identical amino acid residues). This open reading frame, which was subsequently designated folB, also shows similarity to putative dihydroneopterin aldolases from a variety of microorganisms (Fig. 3) (2Fleischmann R.D. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar, 21Kaneko T.

The folB gene of E. coli was amplified by PCR with chromosomal DNA and placed under the control of the lacoperator and a T5 promoter in the plasmid pNCO113. A recombinantE. coli strain carrying this plasmid expressed a 12.5-kDa peptide as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cell extracts of the recombinant strain had a dihydroneopterin aldolase activity of 180 μmol/min/mg as compared with a value of 41 nmol/min/mg in the E. coli wild-type strain DSM613. This finding provided strong support for the hypothesis that thefolB gene codes for dihydroneopterin aldolase. The recombinant protein was purified by chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A typical experiment is summarized in Table IV. The purified protein migrated as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The purification factor of 2.9 indicates that the protein had been expressed to a level of ∼35% of cellular protein in the recombinant E. colistrain.Table IVPurification of recombinant dihydroneopterin aldolase from E. coliProcedureTotal activitySpecific activityaThe formation of hydroxymethyl dihydropterin (Compound4) from dihydroncopterin (Compound 3) was measured at 70 °C.Purification factorYieldmmol/hμmol/mg/hfold%Cell extract89.51791100Heat treatment73.42561.4382Sepharose Q66.54872.7274Superdex 20063.65232.9271a The formation of hydroxymethyl dihydropterin (Compound4) from dihydroncopterin (Compound 3) was measured at 70 °C.

The H. influenzae gene was expressed in a recombinant E. coli strain and purified in the same way as the E. coli aldolase. As expected on the basis of the sequence similarity, the recombinant protein catalyzed the retroaldol cleavage of dihydroneopterin. The kinetic parameters were similar to those of the E. coli aldolase. The folX gene of E. coli specifying dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase was expressed under the control of the lacpromoter and T5 operator. The recombinant protein was purified by a sequence of ion-exchange chromatography, heat treatment, and gel permeation chromatography (Table V).

Initial enzyme experiments were performed at the temperature optimum of the enzymes studied (70 °C for dihydroneopterin aldolase and 55 °C for dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase) (Tables IV and V).

Open table in a new tab Products were determined by fluorescence-monitored HPLC after dehydrogenation and dephosphorylation as required. The results shown in Table VII and Fig. 4 indicate that the aldolases specified by the folB genes of E. coliand H. influenzae catalyze the cleavage of dihydroneopterin. The velocity was 127 μmol/mg/h in comparison with 234 nmol/h as determined by Mathis and Brown (12Mathis J.B. Brown G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The remarkable difference can be explained by the pH at which Mathis and Brown determined their kinetic properties. Their activities were measured at pH 9.6, but we have found a dramatic decrease in activity at pH >8.5. However, the enzyme could also catalyze the epimerization of position 3′ of dihydroneopterin, yielding dihydromonapterin. The rates of the forward and reverse reactions were similar. Moreover, we found that the epimer dihydromonapterin could also serve as a substrate for aldol cleavage of the side chain, yielding hydroxymethyldihydropterin. All cleavage and epimerization reactions catalyzed by the enzyme have similar velocities. The kinetic properties of the aldolase fromH. influenzae are shown in parentheses in Fig. 4. The naturally occurring substrate of the aldolases in the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydrofolate is dihydroneopterin. However, the epimer dihydromonapterin can be converted to 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin without prior epimerization to dihydroneopterin as the velocity of the cleavage reaction for both epimers is at least six times higher than the epimerization reaction of both substrates (Table VII). It should be noted that the folB gene of E. coli catalyzes the epimerization reaction more efficiently then the H. influenzae protein. Table VII indicates that in H. influenzae, the velocity of epimerization, as well as the velocity of the formation of hydroxymethylpterin from dihydromonapterin, is considerably lower as compared with the E. coli enzyme. The monophosphate of dihydroneopterin can be cleaved by the aldolases of E. coli and H. influenzae, but the velocity is <1% as compared with the unphosphorylated substrates. The triphosphates of dihydroneopterin and dihydromonapterin were neither cleaved nor isomerized by the aldolases under study. As shown in Table VII and Fig. 4, dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase uses the triphosphates of dihydroneopterin and dihydromonapterin efficiently as substrates for epimerization. A value of 0.77 was estimated for the equilibrium constant on the basis of the steady-state kinetic parameters. Dihydroneopterin and dihydromonapterin can also serve as substrates for epimerization, but the reaction velocities of the unphosphorylated substrates are slower by more than a factor 700. However, the unphosphorylated substrates are also slowly converted to hydroxymethyldihydropterin. The velocity of the aldolase-type reaction catalyzed by epimerase is <1% as compared with the cleavage of dihydroneopterin by the FolB protein. The cleavage reactions cannot be attributed to a contamination of recombinant dihydroneopterin aldolase with dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase specified by the chromosomal folX gene since aldolase and epimerase are efficiently separated by the anion-exchange chromatography step (epimerase elutes at a sodium chloride concentration of ∼150 mm, whereas aldolase elutes at ∼600 mmNaCl). The physiological role of the FolB protein in the pathway of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis is well understood. However, the role of the epimerase occurring in E. coli, but not in H. influenzae, is not clear. We therefore constructed afolX deletion mutant by gene targeting in E. coliusing the method described by Kushner and co-workers (17Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of the required plasmids and the gene deletion are described under “Experimental Procedures.” PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA confirmed that the chromosomal gene of the mutant carries an insertion of 807 bp after bp 149 of the folXgene. Cell extracts of the mutant are devoid of epimerase activity. Since the enzyme assay used is very sensitive, any residual activity below the detection limit would have been <0.5% as compared with theE. coli wild-type strain. The folX mutant showed normal growth properties on minimal medium as well as on complete medium. Thus, the biological role of epimerase remains unknown. The enzymes specified by the folX and folBgenes of E. coli are similar in terms of their primary structure and quaternary structure. The sequence similarity extends to dihydroneopterin aldolases of several other microorganisms (Fig. 3). Some of these proteins are large multidomain proteins catalyzing several steps in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate. It appears safe to assume that the folB gene is involved in the pathway of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis, where it is responsible for the shortening of the position 6 side chain of the pteridine precursor. On the other hand, the role of the dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase is still unknown. Growth tests of E. coli with a defective folX gene showed no apparent phenotype. Pteridines with the threo configuration of the trihydroxypropyl side chain that is generated by the epimerization reaction have been found in a variety of organisms (29Gerding H. Cremer-Bartels G. Hanneken L. Krause K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 383Google Scholar, 30Guroff G. Rhoads C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 142-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but their metabolic role is unknown. Even if these stereoisomers have a specific metabolic function, a specific epimerase may not be required for their formation since, at least in E. coli and H. influenzae, they can be formed by the aldolase specified by thefolB gene. H. influenzae has a folB gene (i.e.the unannotated reading frame ygiG_haein) specifying a protein whose catalytic properties are very similar to those of the FolB protein of E. coli. However, the genomes of H. influenzae and Bacillus subtilis appear to be devoid offolX genes specifying a pteridine epimerase, in line with the hypothesis that the epimerase is not an essential protein in bacteria. A hypothetical reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. We propose tentatively that both reaction types can be initiated by protonation of N-5 followed by deprotonation at the acidic C-1′ of dihydroneopterin- or dihydromonapterin-type substrates. Epimerase- as well as aldolase-type reactions can be catalyzed by both the FolB and FolX proteins. This raises the question of a common transition state for both types of reaction. A retroaldol cleavage of the C–C bond between C-1′ and C-2′ is proposed to be the crucial reaction step for both enzyme reactions. Epimerization at C-2 would result from reversal of the cleavage reaction without stereochemical control. The different product ratios of FolB- and FolX-type proteins could result from differences in compartmentalization between the different exit pathways originating from the common transition state. Epimerization could occur if the reaction products resulting from cleavage of the α,β-carbon bond, instead of being released from the enzyme, react under regeneration of a pteridine, albeit without stereo control. Partitioning between the reaction pathways for cleavage and isomerization could then depend on the compartmentalization of the cleavage fragments at the active site. This would imply that in the case of epimerase, the release of the cleavage products from the enzyme could be hindered by the protein conformation, and release would occur only after religation of the cleavage fragments.

https://openalex.org/W1533019847,"Several lines of evidence suggest a role for laminin-5 in skin wound healing. We report here that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which elicits various responses during cutaneous healing, stimulates transcription of the mouse laminin α3A (lama3A) gene. To identify the TGF-β-responsive elements (TGFβ-REs) on the lama3A promoter, we have generated a series of 5′-deletions of the promoter upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Transient cell transfection assays using mouse PAM212 keratinocytes revealed that TGFβ-REs lie between nucleotides −297 and −54 relative to the transcription start site. Insertion of the TGFβ-RE in front of the unresponsive minimal SV40 promoter conferred TGF-β inducibility. Computer analysis of the promoter sequence identified three canonical activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites located at nucleotides −277 (AP-1A), −125 (AP-1B), and −69 (AP-1C). Site-directed mutagenesis of either the AP-1A or AP-1C site did not drastically alter the basal activity of the lama3Apromoter, but reduced TGF-β responsiveness by 50%. Simultaneous mutation of these two AP-1 sites resulted in a 65% decline in the response to TGF-β, suggesting a cooperative contribution of each site to the overall promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of the AP-1B site markedly reduced the basal activity of the lama3Apromoter, indicating that this AP-1 site is essential for gene expression. Mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding of Fra-2 and JunD to the AP-1 sites, suggesting for the first time a possible regulatory function for the Fra-2·JunD AP-1 complex in a basal keratinocyte-specific gene.

In the skin, this adhesive protein is secreted by the basal keratinocytes and colocalize with the anchoring filaments of the lamina lucida of the dermal epidermal junction (3Verrando P. Hsi B.L.

Laminin-5 is a heterotrimeric glycoprotein composed of the α3A, β3, and γ2 polypeptide chains that are products of different genes. Mutations in the genes encoding laminin α3 (LAMA3), β3 (LAMB3), and γ2 (LAMC2) have been shown to underlie the Herlitz or non-Herlitz forms of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, characterized by blister formation and erosions of the skin and mucosas that frequently lead to neonatal death (8Aberdam D.

Several lines of evidence suggest a role for laminin-5 in the re-epithelialization of wound skin repair. Laminin-5 is found at the epidermal-dermal junction at sites and times that coincide with actively migrating or rapidly proliferating basal keratinocytes (14Larjava H. Salo T. Haapasalmi K. Kramer R.H. Heino J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,15Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, enhancement of laminin-5 transcription is observed at low cell densities in vitro in migrating and proliferating keratinocytes, similar to what happens at the wound edge (15Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of laminin-5 in wound healing remains to be clarified, its major dual contribution would be to allow migration and adhesion of keratinocytes during the wound process. In addition, accumulating data suggest that laminin-5 might be associated with growth and migration of cancer cells (16Nagle R.B. Hao J. Knox J.D. Dalkin B.L. Clark V. Cress A.E. Am. J.

Recently, cloning of the cDNAs encoding the α3 chain of mouse laminin-5 has identified two distinct polypeptides (α3A and α3B) that derive from a single alternatively spliced gene (20Galliano M.-F.

Genomic organization analysis of the murine lama3gene revealed that the α3A chain is transcribed by an independent internal promoter (21Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.-F. Chauvin N. Ortonne J.-P.

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the laminin α3A (lama3A) gene by TGF-β. 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TGFβ-RE, TGF-β-responsive element; nt, nucleotide(s); AP-1, activator protein-1. Indeed, it has been shown earlier that TGF-β up-regulates the adhesion protein laminin α3A mRNA level (23Korang K. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Mauviel A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TGF-β, a member of a large superfamily of cytokines, is generally acknowledged to be the cytokine with the broadest range of activities in injured tissue repair and tumor progression (24Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 275-308Google Scholar). It affects nearly every aspect of tissue repair. Indeed, TGF-β is the most potent known stimulator of chemotaxis since it promotes the migration of the majority of cell types that participate in the repair processes. TGF-β regulates the transcription of a wide spectrum of matrix proteins, increasing their production while decreasing their proteolysis and modulating their interactions with cellular integrin receptors (25Kagami S. Kuhara T. Yasutomo K. Okada K. Loster K. Reutter W. Kuroda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Matrix production by keratinocytes is also regulated by TGF-β (26Wikner N.E. Elder J.T. Persichitte K.A. Mink P. Clark R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vollberg T.M. George M.D. Jetten A.M. Exp.

Using transient transfection, site-directed mutagenesis, and nuclear protein binding assays, we have mapped a TGF-β-responsive region between nt −297 and −54 of the lama3A promoter. Computer analysis of this sequence identified three canonical AP-1 sites. Insertion of this region upstream of the unresponsive minimal SV40 promoter conferred TGF-β inducibility. Site-directed mutagenesis of either AP-1 site suggested a cooperativity among these AP-1 sites in the laminin α3A promoter. Mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding to the three AP-1 sites. Moreover, antibody supershift analyses have identified JunD and Fra-2 proteins binding to these sites. Mouse PAM212 keratinocytes (kindly provided by Dr. S. H. Yuspa, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mouse lama3A promoter construct pGalA (21Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.-F. Chauvin N. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol.

The deletion panel Δ4.2 to Δ6.5 was created using the exonuclease III system Erase-a-Base (Promega). The 5′-deletion constructs were confirmed by sequencing and restriction digest analysis. To create ΔSM and ΔSAP, pGalA was digested withEcoRI/MscI, and SnaBI/ApaI, respectively, blunted with Klenow polymerase I, and religated. The ΔPA20, ΔPA23, ΔPA24, and ΔPA25 constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides PA20 (sense, 5′-GTCTGGCGCTGTCTGCA-3′), PA23 (sense, 5′-TGTGGGCTTTTCCCTGACTCAGC-3′), PA24 (sense, 5′-CCTGACTCAGCCTGTGATTT-3′), PA25 (sense, 5′-GATTTACAGCTGCTCTAATT-3′), and PA22 (antisense, 5′-CGTGCAAACCTCTGTGTTC-3′), located at −244, −291, −279, −265, and −21 base pairs, respectively, of the transcription initiation site of murine laminin α3A. These polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned into pUag (R&D Systems) and then extracted from the vector by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and ligated intoBglII/HindIII-digested pGalbasic empty expression vector (CLONTECH). The SV-RE4 construct was created by first synthesizing complementary oligonucleotides representing four consecutive copies of the sequences in the lama3A promoter between bases −279 and −265 (sense, 5′-CCTGACTCAGCCTGT-3′). These oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pUag, extracted from the vector by SmaI/XhoI digestion, and inserted intoSmaI/XhoI-digested pGal-promoter, in front of the heterologous SV40 promoter. The SV-MS construct was prepared by first digesting the ΔSM construct by SmaI, and then theSmaI digestion fragment was introduced in theSmaI site of the pGal-promoter vector in front of the SV40 promoter (CLONTECH). To create mutA, mutB, mutC, mutAB, mutAC, mutBC, and mutABC constructs, two point mutations were introduced into each of the three putative AP-1-binding sites AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-1C of the pGalA construct with the Quick-Change kit (Stratagene) using the complementary mutant primers for AP-1A (sense, 5′-GGCCAGGGTGTGGGCTTTTCCCTGCCTTAGCCTGTGATTTACAGCTGCTC-3′; and antisense; 5′-GAGCAGCTGTAAATCACAGGCTAAGGCAGGGAAAAGCCCACACCCTGGCC-3′), for AP-1B (sense, 5′-GCTCTCTCTGCCTGTGTAGGCTGCCTTATGTGTGAAGTTTAAAGGTGGGGC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCCCCACCTTTAAACTTCACACATAAGGCAGCCTACACAGGCAGAGAGAGC-3′), and for AP-1C (sense, 5′-CGCAGACAGCCTTCTTTCCCTCCTGCGTTAGGCAGGCCCGGGCACTGCAGGAAG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CTTCCTGCAGTGCCCGGGCCTGCCTAACGCAGGGAAAGAAGGCTGTCTGCG-3′). Plasmid DNAs were purified using silica columns from QIAGEN (Hylden), and transfections were carried out in 24-well dishes using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) as detailed elsewhere (21Ferrigno O.

Each DNA construct was tested in triplicate wells in at least three separate experiments. The transfection efficiency of pGalA and its derivative constructs was determined by cotransfection of the plasmid pGL2-control (Promega, France). The values of β-galactosidase expression data were normalized to the measured luciferase activity. The enzyme activities were measured using a luminometer (Berthold Biolumat LB9500C). The activity of the promoterless vector pGalbasic, which contain no insert, was measured to determine background activity. In the TGF-β induction assays, 4 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with or without 100 pm recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) for an additional 16–20 h. AP-1 DNA binding activity was analyzed in total cell extracts made from untreated or TGF-β1 (100 pm)-treated PAM212 cells in Totex lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% aprotinin) as described (29Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Supernatants (15,000 ×g, 15-min centrifugation) were collected. An in vitro binding reaction of AP-1 in a total volume of 25 μl was performed by incubation of 5 μg of whole cell extract in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mmKCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 3 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 15 min of preincubation on ice, 200,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe was added and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Then DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 10 mm Tris, 9 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid, and 275 mm EDTA for 1 h at 300 V; dried; and subjected to autoradiography. When indicated, an excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added during preincubation. For antibody supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 0.3 μl of antisera against members of the Jun and Fos families described elsewhere (30Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The structure of the murine lama3A promoter and several of its regulatory DNA elements is depicted in Fig. 1. Full-length pGalA, which contains 1 kb of promoter region upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter gene, was transfected into PAM212 cells and examined for responsiveness to TGF-β. A dose-responsive increase in lama3A activity was observed with maximal stimulation (4.5-fold) at 100 pm TGF-β (Fig. 2). A series of 5′-deletions of thelama3A promoter were examined to delineate the minimal region responsive to TGF-β. TGF-β responsiveness was significant (3.0–4.5-fold) for pGalA (nt −1096), Δ2.4M (nt −839), Δ4.2M (nt −619), Δ6.5M (nt −505), and ΔSM (nt −297) constructs, but decreased to 1.5-fold upon deletion from nt −297 to −244 (ΔPA20) (Fig. 3, A and C). This slight induction was lost from nt −244 to −94 (ΔSAP). It therefore appeared that an essential TGF-β-responsive element (TGFβ-RE) was located between nt −297 and −244 of thelama3A promoter. However, since the basal activity drastically decreased for ΔSAP, it remained to be determined whether the loss of stimulation was due to the low basal activity or to the presence of additional sequences allowing secondary TGF-β responsiveness between nt −244 and −94.Figure 2Effect of TGF-β on mouse lama3Apromoter transcriptional activity. Cells (4 × 104) were transfected with 0.2 μg of promoter-reporter plasmid pGalA and 0.125 μg of SV40-luciferase DNA (pGL3-control, Promega) as an internal control. After removing the transfection medium, increasing concentrations of TGF-β in serum-free medium were added to the cells and incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C prior to extraction of cell extracts. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as relative light units and normalized by luciferase activity of cotransfected pGL2-promoter. -Fold induction was calculated by comparing the normalized β-galactosidase activities of TGF-β-treated cells and untreated control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Deletion analyses and transcriptional activation of the mouse lama3Agene promoter by TGF-β in transient transfection assays of PAM212 cells.

Similar induction with TGF-β treatment was obtained with the ΔSM (nt −297), ΔPA23 (nt −291), and ΔPA24 (nt −279) constructs, whereas a decrease in induction was observed with ΔPA25 (nt −265). This result indicates that a TGF-β-responsive element is located between nt −279 and −265 of the lama3A promoter. Examination of the deleted region that reduced TGF-β responsiveness revealed the presence of one potential AP-1-binding site (Figs. 1 and3 B). To assess whether the region between nt −279 and −265 was sufficient for activation by TGF-β, four copies of this sequence were linked to a heterologous unresponsiveness SV40 promoter (construct SV-RE4) (Fig. 4). Since no TGF-β induction was observed in SV-RE4, we conclude that the 15-base pair sequence containing AP-1 (nt −279) is necessary but not sufficient to confer TGF-β responsiveness. As suggested previously, additional TGFβ-RE sequences must reside downstream of the AP-1-binding site. To assess whether the region between nt −297 and the TATA box was sufficient for activation by TGF-β, the MscI/SmaI DNA fragment from pGalA (from nt −297 to −54) was linked to a heterologous SV40 promoter (construct SV-MS). This construct was able to fully restore the TGF-β induction of β-galactosidase transcription in PAM212 cells as compared with ΔSM, whereas no induction was observed with the pGal-promoter vector alone (Fig. 4). Thus, the sequence of this region of the lama3A promoter is sufficient to confer TGF-β responsiveness to a previously non-inducible promoter. Examination of the TGF-β-responsive region indicated the presence of three potential AP-1-binding sites located at nt −277 (AP-1A), −125 (AP-1B), and −69 (AP-1C) (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to sequentially modify these putative AP-1 sites within the context of the pGalA promoter fragment because this region retains high basal activity and TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 3 A). The mutated constructs were then used in transient transfection experiments in parallel with their wild-type counterparts. As shown in Fig. 5, the mutation of AP-1B (mutB) drastically reduced the promoter activity, whereas mutation of each of the other AP-1 sites (mutA and mutC) still maintained 60% of the pGalA basal activity. However, elimination of each AP-1 site reduced TGF-β responsiveness to half the level seen with the wild-type promoter construct pGalA. Simultaneous mutation of both AP-1A and AP-1C (mutAC) abated by 65% the inducible activity by TGF-β, whereas simultaneous mutations of the three AP-1 sites (mutABC) completely abolished TGF-β responsiveness, as did dual mutants including the AP-1B mutation (mutAB and mutBC) (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the integrity of each AP-1 site of the lama3A promoter is necessary for full transcriptional induction. Furthermore, since half the response to TGF-β is retained within single AP-1 mutants, the full transcriptional induction of the lama3A promoter by TGF-β requires cooperation among the three AP-1 sites. To confirm the interaction of nuclear proteins with the AP-1 sites, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were performed using radiolabeled lama3A TGFβ-RE sequences corresponding to each of the three AP-1 sites and flanking regions, as detailed in TableI. AP-1Am, AP-1Bm, and AP-1Cm are mutants of the AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-1C sites, respectively. Fig. 6 shows a gel mobility shift experiment in which unstimulated and TGF-β-stimulated mouse keratinocyte total cell extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled AP-1A, AP-1B, or AP-1C oligonucleotides in the absence or presence of excess nonradioactive competitors. Our results indicate that, although these regions bound protein complexes isolated from both control and TGF-β-treated keratinocytes, TGF-β treatment induced a significant increase in DNA binding within 1 h for the AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-1C oligonucleotides (Fig. 6, A–C). Protein binding was specifically competed in a dose-dependent manner by addition of 20- and 50-fold excesses of homologous DNA, but not by a 50-fold excess of the corresponding homologous mutant AP-1 sequence or heterologous Sp1 oligonucleotide competitors. These data indicate that AP-1 complexes bind to each of the three TGFβ-RE elements of the lama3A promoter. Although the AP-1A and AP-1C oligonucleotides were specifically competed by 20-fold (data not shown) and 50-fold (Fig. 6, A and C, respectively) molar excesses of every AP-1 oligonucleotide, the AP-1B band shift was not displaced by a 50-fold molar excess of either AP-1A or AP-1C competitor (Fig. 6 B).Table ISequence of 1ama3A AP-1 sites and double-stranded oligonucleotides employed in gel mobility shift assaysNameSequenceAP-1A5′-TTTCCCTGACTCAGCCTGT-3′AP-1Am5′-TTTCCCTGCCTTAGCCTGT-3′AP-1B5′-TAGGCTGACTCATGTGTG-3′AP-1Bm5′-GCTCTCTCTGCCTGTGTAGGCTGCCTTATGTGTGAAGTTTAAAGGTGGGGC-3′AP-1C5′-TTTCCCTGAGTCAGGCAGG-3′AP-1Cm5′-CGCAGACAGCCTTCTTTCCCTCCTGCGTTAGGCAGGCCCGGGCACTGCAGGAAG-3′Sp15′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′AP-1Am, AP-1Bm, and AP-1Cm are mutants of AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-1C in which the A at position 3 and the C at position 6 of the consensus sequence were changed to C and T, respectively (underlined in each oligonucleotide).

Sp1 has commercial (Promega) consensus binding sites. Consensus binding sites of all oligonucleotides are underlined. To characterize further the protein complexes binding to the TGFβ-RE region of the murine lama3A promoter, total cell extracts from untreated and TGF-β-treated PAM212 cultures were incubated prior to DNA/protein interactions with antibodies specific for each member of both the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) family proteins and visualized by gel mobility shift assay. Since identical results were obtained from untreated and TGF-β-treated cells, we illustrated the data from treated cells. As shown in Fig. 7, the antibodies against JunD and Fra-2 (and to a much less extent, JunB) induced a supershift of the labeled DNA probes (brackets). These results indicate that JunD and Fra-2 participate in the formation of the complex that binds to the three AP-1 sites of the lama3A promoter. This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism oflama3A transcriptional induction by TGF-β. TGF-β is known to regulate many different gene transcripts of the extracellular matrix, thereby modulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, under both physiological and pathological conditions (24Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 275-308Google Scholar). Our results define three AP-1-binding sites in the mouse lama3A promoter that cooperate to confer TGF-β responsiveness since (a) their presence is needed in front of unresponsive SV40 promoter sequences to fully restore TGF-β inducibility; (b) mutations of the AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-1C sites significantly abate the TGF-β-promoter transactivation in PAM212 cells; and (c) simultaneous mutations of the three AP-1 sites abolish this transactivation. Furthermore, the AP-1B site is crucial forlama3A promoter activity since mutating its sequence almost completely abolished the basal transcriptional activity of thelama3 promoter. Since the AP-1B site is not cross-competed on band shift assays by a 50-fold molar excess of either AP-1A or AP-1C oligonucleotide competitors, the AP-1 protein heterodimer binds the AP-1B site with higher affinity than the two other AP-1 sites. These results suggest that the AP-1B site is preferentially bound by the AP-1 proteins under basal activity and must cooperate with the two other AP-1 sites to allow full transcriptional basal and TGF-β-stimulated activities. As reviewed recently (32Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), many promoters of keratinocyte-specific genes contain cis-acting elements that are capable of binding AP-1 heterodimer complexes. In the epidermis, the AP-1 heterodimer serves as an activator of gene expression in all the keratinocyte layers, i.e. keratin K5 in the basal layer; human papillomavirus in the suprabasal compartment; loricrin and profilaggrin in the granular layer; and finally, keratin K1, involucrin, and transglutaminase 1 in the spinous/granular layer (32Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing how the cell coordinately regulates genes through identical DNA elements. Since AP-1 consists of proteins from the Jun and Fos families that associate as homodimers (Jun·Jun) or heterodimers (Fos·Jun), one clue might be the composition of the AP-1 dimers, meaning that a certain combination of Fos·Jun complexes may be necessary to provide different levels of transcriptional activity, depending on the stage of keratinocyte differentiation. It should be noted that laminin α3A transcripts are produced only by proliferating basal keratinocytes in vivo (33Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Baudoin C. Galliano M.F. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in vitro(15Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that the lama3A promoter AP-1 sites are preferentially bound by the Fra-2·JunD complex and that the binding is significantly increased by TGF-β stimulation of PAM212 keratinocytes as compared with untreated cells. Recently, immunohistological studies on Fos/Jun factors have shown that the distribution of AP-1 proteins in the mouse epidermis is compartmentalized in vivo, suggesting that distinct AP-1 complexes act in the various layers of the skin (34Rutberg S.E. Saez E. Glick A. Dlugosz A.A. Spiegelman B.M. Yuspa S.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance, Fra-2 and JunD are coexpressed only in the basal layer of mouse skin, but are absent in the spinous (for Fra-2) and granular (for JunD) layers of the epidermis, implying that the particular Fra-2·JunD heterodimer is selectively down-regulated in the early stages of epidermal differentiation (34Rutberg S.E. Saez E. Glick A. Dlugosz A.A. Spiegelman B.M. Yuspa S.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar). All the epidermal genes investigated so far are regulated by different AP-1 family members, i.e.JunB/JunD for HPV18 (35Thierry F. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. Howley P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3740-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), JunB/Fra-1 and JunD/Fra-1 for involucrin (36Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and c-Jun/c-Fos for profilaggrin (37Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These keratinocyte genes are expressed in the suprabasal compartments of the epidermis. Since the lama3A gene is expressed exclusively in the basal cells of most stratified epithelia, it will be important to determine the potential role of Fra-2 and JunD in the regulation of basal keratinocyte-specific genes in general and of the lama3Agene in particular. AP-1 has been shown to be the transcriptional mediator of several TGF-β-responsive genes, including TGF-β itself (40Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B.

However, the nature of the AP-1 complexes that are induced by TGF-β has not been determined, except partially for the α2(I)-collagen promoter, which is bound by c-Jun in keratinocytes and JunB in fibroblasts (47Mauviel A.

AP-1-binding sites are not the exclusivecis-acting elements bound in response to TGF-β stimulation; Sp1 has also been reported to participate in the regulation of human α2(I)-collagen (48Inagaki Y.

In conclusion, we have used a combination of techniques to identify the regulatory elements important for the transcriptional induction of thelama3A gene by TGF-β. We have demonstrated a cooperative contribution of three canonical AP-1-binding sites to the stimulation of the promoter activity and that the AP-1B site is essential for basal gene expression. These AP-1-binding sites contain almost exclusively the JunD and Fra-2 proteins, which suggests for the first time a possible regulatory function of the Fra-2·JunD AP-1 complex in a basal keratinocyte-specific gene. Our results therefore strongly support the idea that AP-1 proteins play a central role in the transcriptional regulation of epidermal gene expression (32Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As for many other genes, the same regulatory elements are involved in both basal and stimulated transcriptional activities. These studies represent the initial steps toward the identification of the signaling pathways involved in TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation of laminin α3A under physiological and pathological conditions, such as wound healing and carcinogenesis.

We show here that developmental silencing of the γD-crystallin promoter correlates with delayed demethylation during lens fiber cell differentiation. Methylation silencing of the γD-crystallin promoter is a general effect and does not require the methylation of a specific CpG, nor does methylation interfere with factor binding to the proximal activator. In later development, the γD-crystallin promoter is also shut down earlier by a repressor that footprints to the −91/−78 region. A factor with identical properties is present in brain. Hence, a ubiquitous factor has been recruited as a developmental regulator by the lens. All γ-crystallin promoters tested contain upstream silencers, but at least the γB-crystallin silencer is distinct from the γD-crystallin silencer. The γ-crystallin promoters were found to share a proximal activator (the γ-box; around −50), which behaves as a MARE. The γB-box is recognized with much lower avidity than the γD-box. By swapping elements between the γB- and the γD-crystallin promoter, we show that activation by the γB-box requires a directly adjacent −46/−38 AP-1 consensus site. These experiments also uncovered another positive element in the γD-crystallin promoter, around −10. In the context of the γD-crystallin promoter, this element is redundant; in the context of the γB-crystallin promoter, it can replace the −46/−38 element.

The mammalian genome contains a large number of gene families, which encode related proteins with similar structure and function, yet are optimized for a particular developmental and differentiation stage. The pattern of expression of gene family members varies between families. For example, in the β-globin gene family, the paradigm of a clustered gene family, expression switches between members such that only one or two genes are active at the same time (for review, see Ref. 1Orkin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, the six clustered and closely related members of the γ-crystallin gene family (the γA- to γF-crystallin genes), which encode abundant structural proteins of the vertebrate lens, are all simultaneously active in the embryonic lens but switched off individually during postnatal development (2Goring D.R. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-C. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Murer-Orlando M. Paterson R.C. Lok S. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Dev.

Eye Res. 1990; 50: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the rat, at 3 months of age the γB-crystallin mRNA is still present at 90% of the level at birth, whereas the transcript level from the γD-crystallin gene has dropped to 60%, and those of the γE- and γF-crystallin genes have dropped to 5% of the level at birth (4van Leen R.W. van Roozendaal K.E.P. Lubsen N.H. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As lens cells do not die and as the younger lens cells overlay the older cells, the consequence of this pattern of gene expression is the creation of a γ-crystallin gradient across the eye lens, which correlates inversely with the water gradient. This gradient in turn sets the gradient of refraction across the lens and thereby prevents optical aberration. The mechanism of the developmental regulation of the γ-crystallin gene expression is not known. There is a strong negative correlation between the methylation state of a γ-crystallin gene promoter region and gene activity, suggesting that DNA methylation, or rather lack of DNA demethylation, is involved in silencing the genes (6Peek R. Niessen R.W.L.M. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Differential expression or availability of transactivating factors is also likely to be causally involved in developmental regulation of expression. It is generally assumed that the closely related γA–F-crystallin genes share a common regulatory element that specifies the lens specificity of these genes. The prime candidate for such an element is the palindromic sequence (here denoted the γ-box) located upstream of the TATA box (Fig. 1). Mutations of this sequence abolish promoter activity in transfection studies (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev.

Breitman M.L. Liu Q. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that a pentamer of the mouse γF-crystallin γ-box sequence directs lens-specific expression in transgenic mice. The expression of this construct, however, was restricted to the embryonic lens nucleus, and it was suggested that the wider range of developmental expression of the mouse γF-crystallin promoter is determined by upstream enhancers (13Goring D.R. Bryce D.M. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Liu Q. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Yu C.C.-K. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Development. 1990; 110: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). The study of the regulatory mechanisms of crystallin gene expression is complicated by the peculiar mode of growth of the lens; the lens epithelial cells differentiate to lens fiber cells at the equator of the lens. The fiber cells of a late developmental stage but at an early differentiation state thus overlay fiber cells of an earlier developmental stage but at a later differentiation state. The lens is thus a mixture of cells at different developmental and differentiation stages. To obtain a fiber cell at a specific developmental and differentiation stage, we have made use of an in vitrodifferentiation system. In this system, the monolayer of epithelial lens cells, still attached to the lens capsule, is cultured in the presence of bFGF, 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; MARE, Maf recognition element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; tk, thymidine kinase; HSV, herpes simplex virus. which induces the differentiation of lens epithelial cells to lens fiber cells (Ref. 15McAvoy J.W.

Retina Eye Res. 1997; 16: 443-478Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lens fiber cells follow the course of differentiation also seen in vivo, including the typical changes in morphology and the accumulation of the various crystallins. The lens epithelial cells are aware of their developmental age and differentiate to fiber cells corresponding to that developmental age (17Lovicu F.J. McAvoy J.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

When explants are taken from newborn rats, copious accumulation of γ-crystallin is seen after about 10 days ofin vitro culture (19Lovicu F.J. McAvoy J.W. Exp.

Lens explants isolated from older rats differentiate more slowly in vitro than those from younger rats and accumulate less γ-crystallin mRNA and protein (18Richardson N.A. McAvoy J.W. Exp.

Demethylation of this promoter occurs within the first 2 days of in vitrodifferentiation, long before activation of the endogenous gene. The pulse of activity of the endogenous gene, between days 10 and 12 (21Peek R. McAvoy J.W. Lubsen N.H. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was suggested to be regulated by the balance of activity of a transactivating factor binding the γ-box, first detected around day 6, and of a silencing factor, which appears around day 10 (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate developmental changes in these regulatory interactions, we have now followed the activation of the γD-crystallin promoter duringin vitro differentiation of lens epithelial explants isolated from 10-day-old rats. We show here that in explants from these older rats, promoter demethylation is delayed, whereas the silencing factor appears earlier. We have further compared the γD-crystallin promoter with the γB-crystallin promoter, the promoter with the most extended developmental expression. We show that the γ-boxes of the γD- and γB-crystallin promoters, which resemble a Maf recognition element (MARE; Refs. 22Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 23Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar), are recognized by the same factor, possibly a Maf protein, but that the affinity of the γB-box for this factor is much lower than that of the γD-box. Activity of the γB-crystallin promoter requires interaction with an AP-1 binding site directly downstream of the γB-box. Like the γD-crystallin promoter, the expression of the γB-crystallin promoter is subject to silencing, but the silencing factor differs from the one that represses the γD-crystallin gene. Lens epithelial explants from newborn or 10-day-old (as indicated) Wistar rats were obtained essentially as described (24Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Rat lenses were isolated in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The lens capsule together with the anterior monolayer of epithelial cells were peeled off the fiber cell mass and pinned down on a 3.5-cm Petri dish. Explants (three per dish) were cultured as described previously (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Basic FGF (a kind gift from Scios, Inc., Mountain View, CA) was added to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml, and the cells were cultured for the indicated period prior to transfection. Isolation of chromosomal DNA from lens explants and ligation-mediated PCR was performed as described previously by Dirks et al. (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CpG-methylation of DNA usingSssI methylase was essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Total reaction time was 4 h, whereby addition of enzyme and S-adenosylmethionine to the reaction mix was repeated after 2 h. Completeness of methylation was tested by a pilot digestion using ThaI and electrophoresis through an agarose gel. The template for mutagenesis was single-stranded DNA from a pBluescript II (SK−) (Stratagene) construct containing the γD-crystallin −1087/+48 fragment. Oligonucleotides for mutations were DB1 (5′-GCT GTT CCT GTC AAC GCA GC-3′ at position −64/−45), DB2 (5′-GTT CCT GTC AAG GCA GCA GAC-3′ at position −61/−41), and DB3 (5′-CTG TTC CTG TGG AGG CAG CAG-3′ at position −63/−43) to obtain the mutants γDB1, γDB2, and γDB3, respectively. Oligonucleotide DB4 (5′-GCA GCA GTC ATG ACA GCT ATA TAT ATA GAT C-3′ at position −46/−15) was used to mutate both the wild type γD-crystallin promoter and the mutant γDB3 promoter to obtain γD4 and γDB4, respectively, and oligonucleotide BD1 (5′-TGG AGG CAG CAG ACC TCC TGC TAT ATA TAC CAG-3′ at position −55/−21) to obtain γBD1. Mutations were introduced using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system version 3 (Amersham, UK). The BglII (−375)/FokI (+10) promoter fragment of each mutant was cloned into pEUCAT (25Ammendola R. Gounari F. Piaggio G. De Simone V. Cortese R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Subsequently, replacement of the γD −10 region by its γF equivalent was performed by using the oligonucleotide DF (5′-TGT AGG GCT GGG AGC AGG GTC TAT A-3′), representing the sequence at position −23 to +1 of the γF promoter, and the oligonucleotide UMS (5′-TGC ATT AAA TTC CAG GAA CTT GCT TTC TGT G-3′), priming upstream from the pEUCAT multiple cloning site, in a PCR reaction using wild-type and mutant γD promoter constructs as templates. PCR products were cloned into pEUCAT. All mutants were checked by dideoxy sequence analysis (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52761) Google Scholar). To delete the upstream region, promoter constructs were truncated at the −73 ApaI site. Other promoter constructs used have been described previously (12Peek R. Kraft H.J. Klok E.J. Lubsen N.H. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides DS1 s (5′-TCG AGT GCC CTG CCC CCC GCG G-3′) and DS1a (5′-TCG ACC GCG GGG GGC AGG GCA C-3′) were annealed (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and cloned into the SalI site of pBLCAT2 (28Luckow B. Schhtz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) to obtain construct pBLCAT2γDS1. The ApaI (−73)/BamHI fragment of pBLCAT2γ (8Peek R. van der Logt P. Lubsen N.H. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was exchanged with that of pBLCAT2γDS1 to obtain pBLCAT2γDS. The γB- XhoI (−414)/ApaI (−73), γC- NheI (−183)/ApaI (−69), γD-PvuII (−193)/ApaI (−73), and γF-crystallinSpeI (−280)/ApaI (−70) blunt-ended/sticky fragments were inserted into pBLCAT2γ by replacement of itsHindIII (blunt)/ApaI fragment to obtain pBLCAT2γB, pBLCAT2γC, pBLCAT2γD, and pBLCAT2γF, respectively. Construct pBLCAT2γBS was obtained by deletion of the −414/−110 fragment from pBLCAT2γB using the SacI site at position −10. Plasmid DNA was isolated according to the alkali lysis procedure (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in conjunction with either the Wizard Maxiprep System (Promega) or CsCl gradient centrifugation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was transfected to the lens cells using either Lipofectamine Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the PDS-1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). When cells were transfected using Lipofectamine, per dish 2.0 μg of CAT reporter construct and 0.25 μg of CMV/β-gal construct (29Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) were transfected to the cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using the Biolistic Particle Delivery System, 0.5 μg of CAT reporter construct and 0.125 μg of CMV/β-gal construct was coated on 1-μm gold particles and bombarded on the cells at 450 psi helium. After culturing for 3 more days in the presence of 25 ng/ml bFGF, the cells were harvested in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (25 mm bicine, pH 7.8, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% Tween 80) per dish, and vigorously shaken for 10 min. The cell debris was pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge. To determine transfection efficiency, 20 μl of the supernatant was used to assay for β-galactosidase activity (29Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The remainder of the supernatant was heated for 15 min at 65 °C to inactivate cellular deacetylases. From the supernatant, 20 μl was used to assay for CAT activity as described by Gorman et al. (30Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) or using the Quan-T-CAT system (Amersham). Transfections were done in duplo or triplo, and two DNA isolates from each construct were tested in independent experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (12Peek R. Kraft H.J. Klok E.J. Lubsen N.H. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed essentially as described (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Műller M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Műller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). DNA restriction fragments were size-fractionated through a native 6% polyacrylamide gel and isolated by electro-elution using a Bio-Trap apparatus (Schleiger and Schuell), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 0.1–0.5 ng of end-labeled probe (10,000–20,000 cpm) was added to 5–10 μg of nuclear extract (5 μl, final concentration of 100 mm NaCl) and either 1.0 μg of poly(dGdC·dGdC) or 1.0–3.0 μg of poly(dIdC·dIdC), as indicated, in binding buffer (final concentrations 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10–50 mm KCl as indicated, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 4% (v/v) Ficoll) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was left for 10 min at room temperature, loaded on a pre-run 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE = 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA), which then was run for 2 h at 10 volts/cm. The gel was dried and exposed to a Fuji AX film overnight with one intensifying screen. The appropriate DNA fragment was 32P-labeled at one end. An aliquot (600,000 cpm) was methylated using dimethylsulfate (DMS) essentially as described (33Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar,34Tullius T.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 213-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The methylated probe was incubated with 150–200 μl of nuclear extract (150–400 μg of protein) for a preparative gel retardation assay (analytical assay 30–40-fold scaled up). The complexed and the free probe were visualized by autoradiography overnight. The DNA was cut out of the gel, isolated by electro-elution as described above, cleaved by piperidine (final concentration 10% (v/v)), and size-fractionated in a 15% sequencing gel. The gel was dried, and exposed to a Fuji AX film for 18–72 h. In explants from newborn rats, the γD promoter region is fully demethylated between day 1 and 2 of in vitro differentiation (Ref. 7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2 A). To test whether promoter demethylation still occurs in 10-day-old rat explants, in which the level of expression of the γD promoter is about 50-fold lower, the state of methylation of the genomic ThaI site at position −13 of the γD promoter was followed during in vitrodifferentiation. In a parallel experiment, the methylation state of this ThaI site in explants from newborn rats was tested. In newborn rat explants, virtually complete demethylation of theThaI site was found after 2 days of culture, in agreement with the results of Dirks et al. (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, demethylation of this site was significantly slower during differentiation of explants from 10-day-old rats (Fig. 2 A). Even after 5 days of differentiation, demethylation was only 65% complete. To determine the effect of DNA methylation on γD promoter activity, a γD(−73/+10)CAT fusion gene was methylated using CpG methylase and transfected into explanted lens cells. We found a strongly reduced activity of the methylated construct; activity was only 1% of that of the unmethylated promoter and within background levels (Fig. 2 B). Although the CAT coding region is also methylated in these experiments, other studies have shown that DNA methylation does not impede elongation (35Ben-Hattar J. Jiricny J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2560-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 37Yisraeli J. Frank D. Razin A. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that methylation of the CAT coding sequence does not affect transient expression (6Peek R. Niessen R.W.L.M. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Kruczek I. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7586-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hence, the effect of CpG methylation is likely to block γD promoter activity, although from our own experiments, we cannot rule out an aspecific effect. The γD promoter contains a CpG site in its proximal activator, the γ-box, located around −50 (see also Fig. 1). To test whether methylation of the γ-box element is sufficient to block binding of the cognate activating factor in vitro, the binding of rat lens nuclear extract factors to a methylated promoter fragment was compared with that to a nonmethylated fragment in an EMSA. Complex formation with the methylated fragment was reduced when compared with that of the unmethylated fragment, but not abolished (complex D1; Fig. 2 C). This was confirmed by the fact that the methylated fragment competed for the activator complex as efficiently as the unmethylated fragment itself. In the EMSAs using the methylated γD promoter fragment, an additional band is seen (complex D2; note that this complex migrates slower than the faint aspecific complex seen in some of the other lanes). This band could represent binding to the methylated DNA by general MCpG binding proteins. These data suggest that methylation of the γ-box is not sufficient to suppress promoter activity. We therefore tested the effect of methylation on the activity of mutant constructs, lacking either the CpG site at −50 or the CpG sites between −20 and −10. The activity of these mutant γD promoters, when methylated, was also in the background range (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, the activity of the γC promoter was also very low when methylated. Together, our results indicate that the reduction in γ-crystallin promoter activity by methylation is a general effect and not due to methylation of a specific site. We have previously proposed that the differentiation stage-specific expression of the γD-crystallin gene during fiber cell differentiation was regulated by the phased appearance of first an activating and then a silencing factor (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The reduced activity of the γD promoter in explants of 10-day-old rats could be due to a changed expression profile of these factors. Therefore, the activities of the γD(−73/+45)CAT fusion gene and of a silencer-tkCAT construct were followed during the course of differentiation of 10-day-old explants. The γD(−73/+45)CAT construct was active at all stages of differentiation, with a maximum around day 12 (Fig. 3 A). The timing of up-regulation of the γD activating factor in these explants is very similar to that in explants from newborn rats (see Ref. 7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the activity of the γD(−73/+45)CAT construct in 10-day-old explants was around 50% of that in explants from newborn animals (data not shown), indicating that the level of the activating factor is decreased in the older explants. Rather different results were obtained when the presence of the silencing factor was assayed for; the construct containing four copies of the silencing element in front of the HSV tk promoter was inactive even in early differentiated cells from 10-day-old rats (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the silencing factor is present throughout differentiation of these cells. In contrast, in explants from newborn rats, silencing activity was maximal only after 10 days ofin vitro differentiation (Ref. 7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5 B). The level of silencing in fiber cells from 10-day-old rats was not significantly different from that during late differentiation of cells from newborn animals. The earlier appearance of the silencing factor might well explain the reduced activity of the γD gene in the 10-day-old explants. The γD silencer was originally found by chance, when testing the effect of the −84/−71 G/C-rich region conserved among the γ-crystallin promoters. This region suppresses gene activity in non-lens cells such as retina, skin, and brain (12Peek R. Kraft H.J. Klok E.J. Lubsen N.H. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In vivo footprinting in lens cells, however, showed that nuclear factor contacts extended further upstream to −88 (7Dirks R.P.H. Klok E.J. van Genesen S.T. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Lubsen N.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In view of its importance in the developmental shut down of the γD gene, we have reexamined this region. Methylation interference footprinting showed a contacted region between −91 and −79 in the upper strand and between −90 and −78 in the lower strand in both a lens and a brain nuclear complex, suggesting the presence of the same factor in lens and brain cells (Fig. 4,A and B). This was further confirmed by measurement of the molecular weight of the factors in an EMSA-based method (39Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in which the mobility of the complexes in gels of different polyacrylamide concentrations were compared. The molecular masses of both the lens and brain complexes, including the oligonucleotide probe, were estimated at 105 kDa (Fig. 4 C). These results strongly suggest that the lens and brain factors are the same and bi"

We have isolated and characterized the human cystatin A gene. The cystatin A gene consists of three exons and two introns. The first, the second, and the third exons consist of coding sequences that are 66, 102, and 126 base pairs in length, respectively. The first and the second introns consist of 14 and 3.6 kilobase pairs, respectively. The transcription initiation site was located 55 base pairs upstream from the first translation site. The fragment, +77 to −2595 in the 5′-flanking region of the human cystatin A gene, was subcloned into a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. The expression vector, p2672CAT, produced a significant CAT activity in transiently transfected SV40-transformed human keratinocytes (SVHK cells), that were further stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent protein kinase C activator. Sequence analysis of the gene detected three TPA responsive elements (TRE-1, TRE-2, and TRE-3) and one AP-2 site on the 5′ upstream promoter region. Deletion analyses of the p2672CAT vector demonstrated that TRE-2, which was located between −272 and −278, was critical for the regulation by TPA. Gel shift analyses revealed that c-Jun, JunD, and c-Fos bound to the TRE-2 region and that the p2672CAT activity level was elevated by co-transfection with c-Jun and c-Fos or with JunD and c-Fos expression vectors. Furthermore, co-transfection of SVHK cells with the protein kinase C-α expression vector and the p2672CAT expression vector also resulted in an increased CAT activity. These results indicate that the 5′-flanking region of the human cystatin A gene confers promoter activity and contains a TRE (TRE-2) that mediates, at least in part, the enhanced expression of this gene by TPA.

We have previously shown that the mRNA level of cystatin A is also stimulated by TPA in SV40-transformed human keratinocytes (SVHK cells) (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SVHK cells are a well-established, immortalized cell line sharing features of normal human keratinocytes (24Steinberg M.L. Defendi V. J. Invest.

These cells express relatively high levels of cystatin A as compared with other cell lines, such as A432 and SCC13 (data not shown). In the present study, we have identified the structure of the human cystatin A gene by screening a human genomic library and by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have also analyzed the regulation of cystatin A promoter activity by using a CAT reporter vector, which was connected to the 5′-flanking region of the cystatin A gene. SV40-transformed human keratinocytes (SVHK cells) (24Steinberg M.L. Defendi V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 131S-136SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. M. L. Steinberg (Department of Chemistry, City College of the City University of New York, NY). The cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. A human phage library was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A 448-bp human cystatin A cDNA was digested withEcoRI (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random priming method. Filter hybridization was used to screen 1 × 106 clones with a probe at 65 °C overnight in a solution composed of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution: 0.002% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.002% Ficol, 0.02% bovine serum albumin). Subsequently, the filters were washed three times for 10 min at room temperature with 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.0015 m sodium citrate), 0.05% SDS and twice for 1 h at 65 °C with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The filters were then exposed to Kodak XAR V film at −70 °C for 2 days. PCR was performed to analyze the promoter, the first exon, and the first intron of cystatin A using the Promoter FinderTM DNA Walking Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To isolate the promoter and the first exon, we performed the first long PCR with the AP1 primer (as described in the kit) and the HCA1 primer (5′-AGTGGCGGGTTTGGCCTCAGATAAGCCTGG-3′; +63 to +95). Subsequently, the second PCR was performed with the AP2 primer (as described in the kit) and the HCA2 primer (5′-AGATAAGCCTCCAGGTATCATTTTGCG-3′; +51 to +77). To isolate the first exon and the first intron, we performed the first long PCR with the AP3 primer (5′-GCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATGG-3′) and the HCA3 primer (5′-CGCAAAATGATACCTGGAGGCTTATCT-3′; +63 to +95) The second PCR was performed with the AP4 primer (5′-ACCACGCGTGCCCTATAG-3′) and the HCA4 primer (5′-GGAGGCTTATCTGAGGCCAAACCCGCCACT-3′; +66 to +95). The HCA 1–4 primers were determined by cDNA analysis of keratolinin (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The long PCR kit was purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Otsu, Japan). The DNA was amplified for 35 cycles on a DNA cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) at 98 °C for 20 s and then 68 °C for 15 min. The PCR products (pTA648, pTA2672, and pTA4.0) were subcloned into the pCRTM 2.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The isolated clone (pcHCA) was digested withEcoRI and ligated into the pGEM-3Zf(+) vector. The constructed plasmids were denatured with 0.2 m sodium hydroxide. The single-stranded DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the SP6 and T7 promoter primers (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.H. Sambrook T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar). The HindIII,XbaI-digested fragments from the pTA2672 and pTA648 vectors were inserted into the promoterless 0-CAT plasmids (p2.5CAT and p648CAT, respectively). Deleted vectors p478CAT, p238CAT, and p68CAT were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides HCA5 (5′-CTGTATGTTAAACATTTCCAG-3′; −478 to −457), HCA6 (5′-CATTGTCAAAGAGAATGCAG-3′; −239 to −221), HCA7 (5′-GCTGTTTGTGGAAAATAAAG-3′; −69 to −50), and HCA2. Each TRE-deleted fragment was generated by PCR using the overlap extension method with oligonucleotides HCA8 (5′-CATCCTGTTTCTGAATTATGAAATC-3′; −274 to −244, deleted TRE-2 region), HCA9 (5′-TAATTCAGAACAGGATGGAACCAT-3′; −267 to −236, deleted TRE-2 region), HCA10 (5′-GCAAGTAGATGTCCTAACAAGCAT-3′; −211 to −180, deleted TRE-1 region), and HCA11 (5′-GTTAGGACATCAACTTGCCCACTTG-3′; −204 to −173, deleted TRE-1 region). To construct the p648ΔT1 vector, we performed two PCR amplifications using the AP-2 and HCA8 oligomers or the HCA9 and HCA2 oligomers with the p648CAT vector as the template. Next, we performed a PCR with the AP-2 and HCA2 oligomers using mixed products derived from the initial PCR. The second PCR product was subcloned into the pCRTM 2.1 vector. Using the T7 promoter oligomer, we performed sequence analysis to confirm the orientation of the promoter and to confirm the absence of the deleted portion. The deleted fragments, which were isolated by digestion with HindIII andXbaI, were inserted into the promoterless 0-CAT plasmid. The p648ΔT2 vector was constructed using the AP-2, HCA10, HCA11, and HCA2 oligonucleotides. Using the p648ΔT1 vector, we performed PCR with the AP-2, HCA10, HCA11, and HCA2 oligomers and constructed the p648ΔT12 vector. The β-galactosidase expression vector was kindly supplied by Dr. T. Watanabe (Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Japan). The PKC expression vectors were generous gifts of Dr. S. Ohno (Department of Molecular Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine) (27Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Cell. 1988; 53: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Transfection of plasmid DNA into cells was performed by the liposome method using Lipofectin (28Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar). Typically, 5 μg of reporter plasmid and 2 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid were co-transfected into 1 × 105 SVHK cells. The β-galactosidase plasmid was used as the internal standard to normalize each transfection efficacy. After 48 h, cells were collected, and the CAT assay was performed (29Neuman J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.D. Biotechniques. 1987; 5: 441Google Scholar). The enzyme activity level of β-galactosidase in the transfected cell extracts was measured spectrophotometrically (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.H. Sambrook T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar). Relative CAT activity is expressed as the count of acetylated fraction corrected for the activity of the 0-CAT vector. Nuclear extraction and gel retardation analyses were performed as described previously (30Takahashi H. Kobayashi H. Iizuka H. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1995; 287: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probe that was used corresponds to the −240 to −266 fragment, which includes the TRE-2 site (see under “Results and Discussion”). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Penicillin and streptomycin were obtained from M. A. Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). The pGEM3Zf(+) vector was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The [α-32P]dCTP and deoxycytidine thiotriphosphate (1000 Ci/ml) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were obtained from Nakarai Chemicals Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). Anti-c-Jun, anti-Jun B, anti-Jun D, anti-c-Fos, anti-NF-κB, and anti-Fra-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A human genomic phage library was screened with a32P-labeled, full-length human cystatin A cDNA (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Of the 1 × 106 clones screened, one clone (pcHCA) was identified that intensely hybridized with the cystatin A cDNA probe. DNA sequence analysis revealed that pcHCA contained the second and the third exon of the cystatin A gene (Figs. 1 and 2). In order to isolate the first exon and the promoter region, PCR was performed with the AP1/HCA1 primer pair and the AP2/HCA2 primer pair (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two fragments were obtained, one 648 bp and the other 2672 bp. These fragments were subcloned into pCRTM 2.1 vector (pTA648 and pTA2672; see Fig. 1), and DNA sequence analysis was performed. These fragments contained the first exon with the 5′-untranslated region (Figs. 1 and 2). In order to isolate the first exon and the first intron, PCR was performed with the AP3/HCA3 primer pair and the AP4/HCA4 primer pair. A fragment of 4 kb (pTA4k) was amplified, and DNA sequence analysis revealed that the fragment contained the first exon with a portion of the first intron. From these results, cystatin A was shown to contain three exons and two introns. The first, second, and third exons consisted of coding sequences of the cystatin A gene that were 66, 102, and 126 bp in length (Fig. 2). The second intron was approximately 3.6 kb in length, and the first intron was 14 kb in length, as determined by PCR using oligomers coding the first and the second exon (data not shown). We have previously shown that TPA increases the level of mRNA in SVHK cells (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transcription initiation site of the cystatin A gene was determined by the primer extension method using RNA prepared from TPA-treated SVHK cells. The transcription initiation site was located 55 bp upstream from the first translation site (Fig. 2,A).Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the human cystatin A gene. The deduced amino acid sequence is shown below the nucleotide sequence. The transcription start site is shown asboldface letter A. The putative polyadenylation site, TRE-1, TRE-2, TRE-3, and the AP2 site are underlined. Thestar indicates the stop codon.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 193-196Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Family 1 cystatins (cystatins A and B) consist of approximately 100 amino acid residues (11–12 kDa) and lack disulfide bonds. Family 2 cystatins (cystatins C, S, and D) are approximately 120 amino acids in length (13–14 kDa) and contain two disulfide bonds. Family 3 cystatins, also known as the kininogen family, contain nine disulfide bonds. The human cystatin A gene consists of three exons and two introns similar to cystatin B (family 1), cystatin C (family 2), cystatin S (family 2), and cystatin D (family 2) (31Pennacchio L.A.

DNA sequence analyses showed that the 5′-flanking region of the human cystatin A gene did not contain a CAAT box or a TATA box. The other cystatin genes, except for cystatin C, also do not contain these sites. In order to determine the basal promoter region of the human cystatin A gene, six deletion fragments spanning from +77 to −2595 in the 5′-flanking region were fused with the CAT gene and transfected into SVHK cells (Fig. 3). The construct containing the +77 to −2595 fragment (p2672CAT) expressed a CAT activity level 13 times as high as the reverse-oriented construct (Fig. 3) or the constructs with vector but with no flanking region (data not shown). These data indicate that the 5′-flanking region of the human cystatin A gene contains a sequence that confers promoter activity. Deletion of the p2672CAT fragment up to −238 demonstrated minimal loss in basal activity. When the 5′-flanking region was deleted to the −68 position, the CAT activity was markedly depressed, suggesting that the most proximal −238 bp of the 5′-flanking region is essential for the basal transcription. Within −68 to −238, the cystatin A promoter contains an AP-2-like sequence (TCCCCATGCC; −75 to −84). AP-2 is an enhancer-binding protein that has been purified and cloned from HeLa cells, and this protein specifically interacts with the consensus sequence (T/C)C(C/G)CC(A/C)N(GCG/CGC) (35Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Preliminary analysis showed that deletion of the AP-2 region decreased the basal promoter activity by one-third. The AP-2-like site might contribute to the basal transcription of human cystatin A gene. Cystatin S, which is highly expressed in the salivary gland, is induced by the β-adrenergic agonist isoprotererol (36Shaw P.A. Cox J.L. Barka T. Naito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18133-18137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that cAMP and TPA increases the mRNA level of cystatin A in SVHK cells (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). So far, there is no evidence for the TPA-dependent induction of other cystatins. To determine whether transcription of the human cystatin A gene is stimulated by TPA, five deletion constructs were transfected into SVHK cells in the presence or absence of TPA. The results showed that the construct containing the fragment +77 to −478 responded to TPA stimulation. The CAT activity level increased 3-fold following a 24-h exposure to TPA (Fig. 4). Consistent with the fact that the effect of TPA is mediated by PKC, the TPA-dependent cystatin A promoter activity was mimicked by other PKC activators, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol and mezerein (Fig. 5 A). 4-O-methyl-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a very weak PKC activator, produced much less effect on the promoter activity. Furthermore, the effect of TPA was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine dihydrochloride (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Effect of PKC activators and inhibitor on cystatin A promoter activity. p648CAT vector was transfected into SVHK cells, and the cells were treated with 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (100 μg/ml), mezerein (1 μm), or 4-O-methyl-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (200 ng/ml) (A) or with TPA (10 ng/ml) or 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine dihydrochloride (100 μm) for 24 h (B). The average CAT activities relative to the promoterless vector 0-CAT vector were obtained from at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There are two putative TPA responsive elements (TRE-1, −189 to −195; TRE-2, −272 to −278) and one AP-2 responsive site (−74 to −83) within the +77 to −478 region of the cystatin A gene (Fig. 2). In order to determine the critical region of the TPA regulatory site, three TRE-deleted constructs were transfected into SVHK cells. Deletion of the T-2 region (−272 to −278) or the T-2 plus T-1 region (−189 to −195) completely abolished the TPA responsiveness (Fig. 6). Conversely, deletion of T-1 showed no significant loss in TPA responsiveness. These results indicate that the sequence −272 to −278 (TRE-2) is responsible for the TPA stimulation. In keratinocytes, TPA is a potent inducer of differentiation and increases the expression of CE precursor protein(s), as well as transglutaminase. TRE sites have been identified in a number of differentiation-related genes, such as loricrin, involucrin, small proline-rich protein(s), and transglutaminase 1 (19Takahashi H. Iizuka H. J. Invest.

Fukushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17858-17863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study revealed that the TRE-2 region (−272 to −278) of the cystatin A gene was critical for the TPA-induced promoter activity. This is consistent with a common controlling mechanism for the expression of CE precursor proteins, as well as their cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase 1. The AP-1 protein, which is a complex consisting of Jun and Fos family proteins, binds to TREs and regulates the TPA-inducible genes. In order to determine the binding protein(s) in the TRE-2 region of the human cystatin A gene, a 38-bp synthetic oligonucleotide representing the TRE-2 region (−272 to −278 bp) was evaluated using a DNA gel shift assay. Incubation of the oligonucleotide with the nuclear extract from TPA-treated SVHK cells yielded three DNA-protein binding complexes (Fig. 7, lane 2). The specificity of the binding was verified by a competition assay using the same (Fig. 7,lane 4) or unrelated (Fig. 7, lane 5) unlabeled oligonucleotides in excess of 100 moles. Furthermore, anti-c-Jun, anti-JunD, and anti-c-Fos antibodies decreased the specific bands, whereas supershifted bands appeared near the top of the lane (Fig. 7,lanes 6, 8, and 9). A supershifted band was not detected by the addition of anti-JunB, anti-Fra-1, or anti-NF-kB antibodies (Fig. 7, lanes 7, 10, and 11). In order to determine the effects of these AP-1 related proteins on the transcription of cystatin A, various expression vectors of the Jun and Fos family proteins were transfected into SVHK cells. Co-transfection of the p648CAT vector with the c-Jun and c-Fos expression vectors or the JunD and c-Fos expression vectors resulted in an increase in the CAT activity level (Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the nuclear proteins that bind to the TRE-2 region are most likely composed of c-Jun and c-Fos or of JunD and c-Fos. It has been reported that cystatin A is expressed in the upper spinous layer to the granular layer of the normal epidermis (37Tezuka T. Qing J. Saheki M. Kushida S. Takahashi M. Dermatology. 1994; 188: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of the normal epidermis revealed that the c-Fos protein is localized in the upper spinous and granular cell layers, whereas the c-Jun protein is localized in the granular cell layer. Fra-1 is expressed in all of the epidermal cell layers except for the basal cell layer. Conversely, JunB and JunD are present in all of the epidermal cell layers (38Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2681-2687PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that the cystatin A gene is regulated by c-Jun and c-Fos, or by c-Jun and JunD, is compatible with the expression pattern of the AP-1 protein family in the epidermis. PKC is a large family of proteins consisting of at least 11 isozymes (39Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). PKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ are the classical PKC proteins that are calcium- and diacylglycerol-dependent. PKC-δ, -ε, -η, -θ, and -μ are the novel PKCs, which do not require calcium for activation. PKC-ζ and -τ are the atypical PKCs, which require neither calcium nor diacylglycerol for activation. TPA activates classical and novel PKCs but not atypical PKCs. The epidermal keratinocytes contain PKC-α, -δ, -ε, -η, and -ζ (40Dlugosz A.A. Mischak H. Muchinski J.F. Yuspa H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 286-292Google Scholar). In order to determine the PKC isozyme(s) responsible for cystatin A gene expression, we co-transfected SVHK cells with the p648CAT vector and various PKC isozyme expression vectors. Consistent with TPA-induced activation of endogenous PKC(s), cystatin A promoter activity was increased by TPA in SVKH cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 9, C). Transfection of PKC-δ, -ε, -η, or -ζ had no effect on the cystatin A promoter activity as compared with the transfection of the control vector. Although TPA also increased the promoter activity of SVHK cells transfected with PKC-δ, -ε, -η, or -ζ, the increase was not statistically significant as compared with that of the cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 9, δ, ε, η, and ζ). Cystatin A promoter activity, however, was significantly stimulated by co-transfection of p648CAT and the PKC-α vectors, which was further stimulated by TPA (Fig. 9, α). These results suggest that PKC-α is responsible for the stimulation of the human cystatin A promoter activity. There are several reports concerning the localization of PKC isozymes in the epidermis (41Leibersperger H. Gschwendt M. Gernold M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14778-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wevers A. Wirnitzer U. Schaarschmidt H. Hagemann L. Mahrle G. Arch. Dermatol.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 858-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal skin, PKC-η is expressed in the uppermost granular layer (43Koizumi H. Kohno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Ohkawara A. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 858-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PKC-α mRNA is expressed from the basal to the spinous layers (42Wevers A. Wirnitzer U. Schaarschmidt H. Hagemann L. Mahrle G. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1992; 284: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because cystatin A is expressed in the upper spinous layer and the granular layer, there would be other transcription factors (either stimulatory or inhibitory) that regulate the differentiation-specific expression of cystatin A in the epidermis. In this study, we characterized the structure of the human cystatin A gene, including the 5′-upstream region. The cystatin A gene was shown to be regulated by PKC pathway, similar to other CE precursor proteins (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest.

The characterization of the AP1-dependent signaling pathway via specific PKC isozymes will clarify the nature of the regulation and will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of keratinocyte differentiation.

Here, we analyzed the structure of the humanPRL-1 gene and localized it to chromosome 6 within band q12. Human, rat, and mouse PRL-1 are 100% conserved at the amino acid level and 55% identical to a newly identified Caenorhabditis elegans PRL-1. The presence of two promoter activities, P1 and P2, in the human PRL-1 gene were identified by primer extension and RNase protection assays. A functional TATA box was identified in promoter P1 upstream of the non-coding first exon. A non-canonical internal promoter, P2, was found in the first intron that results in PRL-1 transcripts beginning 8 base pairs downstream of the 5′-end of exon 2 and causes no alteration in the encoded protein. The first 200-base pair region of either promoter P1 or P2 conferred high basal transcriptional activity. An enhancer that bound a developmentally regulated factor, PRL-1 intron enhancer complex (PIEC), was localized to the first intron of the humanPRL-1 gene. The presence of PIEC correlated with the ability of the intron enhancer to confer transcriptional activation in HepG2 and F9 cells. The intron enhancer contributed significantly toPRL-1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells which contain PIEC but not to NIH 3T3 cells which do not.

Protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases play important roles in the regulation of cell growth, development, and differentiation. One of the most interesting immediate early or primary growth response genes first identified in regenerating liver encodes a novel 20-kDa nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPase, 1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein tyrosine phosphatase; PRL-1, phosphatase of regenerating liver; PIEC, PRL-1 intron enhancer complex; EMSA, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay; kb, kilobase pairs; bp, base pair(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. PRL-1 (phosphatase of regenerating liver). Other than the signature sequence for PTPases, PRL-1 is not homologous to either the dual specificity PTPases (cdc25 and MKP-1) or monospecific PTPases (1Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 2Taub R. Diamond R.H. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1996: 59-74Google Scholar). A PRL-1-like protein, OV-1, was isolated from human cells (3Montagna M. Serova O. Sylla B.S. Feunteun J. Lenoir G.M. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and found to be 95% identical to rat PRL-1 at the amino acid level but is not the human PRL-1 homologue. Human PRL-1 (CAAX-1) and human OV-1(CAAX-2) cDNAs were isolated as encoding proteins containing isoprenylation sites (4Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The finding of at least two members of this PTPase family, PRL-1 and OV-1, with a high degree of conservation suggests that PRL-1 and family members have important cellular functions. PRL-1 mRNA is elevated throughout the major proliferative phase of liver regeneration when hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells in the liver are rapidly proliferating.PRL-1 is expressed at high levels in other proliferating cells including fetal liver and a number of tumor cell lines such as hepatomas (1Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PRL-1-transfected cells showed altered growth characteristics, including a faster doubling time, growth to a greater saturation density, altered morphology, and evidence of anchorage-independent growth. Overexpression of human PRL-1 and OV-1 in epithelial cells resulted in tumor formation in nude mice (4Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a positive role for PRL-1 in the growth response. However, in addition to regenerating liver, PRL-1 is expressed at significant levels in brain and skeletal muscle, two terminally differentiated tissues that are notable for their absence of ongoing cellular proliferation. In intestinal epithelia which contain both terminally differentiated and proliferating cells, PRL-1 is expressed in the terminally differentiated villus but not proliferating crypt enterocytes (5Diamond H.R. Peters C. Jung S.P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Taub A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G121-G129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation of PRL-1 expression with growth in some cellular systems and differentiation in others suggests that PRL-1 may have different roles depending on the cell type. Because of the interesting pattern of regulation of this gene during cellular growth and differentiation and its association with cellular transformation, we cloned and characterized the human PRL-1 gene and determined its chromosomal localization. Moreover, we performed an analysis of the regulatory regions of the human PRL-1 gene that are necessary for its expression. A human lymphocyte genomic library established in λ-FIX II (gift from E. Rand) was used to isolate human PRL-1 gene clones. Approximately 1 × 106 plaques were screened with a 243-bpEcoRI/SstI fragment derived from the 5′-end of rat PRL-1 cDNA using high stringency conditions. Several positive isolates proved to contain intronless PRL-1 genes and were believed to be pseudogenes. Two intron-containing positive phage clones were further characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blotting. SstI fragments from the positive phage clone, hprl1, were subcloned into the vector Bluescript KS(+) and denoted pPRL/SstI, pPRL/Sst2, etc. 12 kb of continuous sequence was determined using ABI automated cycle sequencer with Stretch upgrade (DNA Sequencing Core, Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and was analyzed with Intelligenetics (Intelligenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and GCG sequence analysis software (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). To determine the chromosomal localization of the human PRL-1, the 17.5-kb genomic DNA clone hprl1 was used for fluorescence in situ hybridization. The probe was labeled by nick translation with biotin-11-dUTP and hybridized to human metaphase chromosomes. After fluorescence in situ hybridization, the slide was destained and G-banded for chromosomal identification (6Lichter P. Cremer T. Human Cytogenetics: A practical Approach.in: Rooney D.E. Czepulkowski B.H. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992Google Scholar). RNAs were prepared exactly as reported using guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction (7Mohn K. Laz T.M. Melby A.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21914-21921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Du K. Peng Y. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed following the reported protocols (9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For P1 a 22-nucleotide antisense primer, corresponding to bases +57–78 relative to the transcription start site (+1), and for P2 a 25-bp antisense primer from +3542–3567 were used. Primers were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified by Sephadex G-25 spin column. 50 μg of human HepG2 total cellular RNA was hybridized with the radiolabeled primer (105 cpm) by heating at 80 °C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature in a solution containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.3, at 42 °C, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm dNTP mixture, and 0.5 mm spermidine. Then 2 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to the mixture, and the reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation with 50 μg/ml tRNA, the primer-extended products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Sequencing reactions were performed using Sequenase 2.0 according to the manufacturer's protocol (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The antisense RNA probe was generated from an EcoRI-linearized Bluescript KS plasmid template (plasmid pP2-B) containing sequence 3269–3567 of human PRL genomic DNA by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP using an in vitro transcription kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The probe used contained 130 bp of exon 2 and 169 bp of intron 1 (see Fig. 3). 50–70 μg of total HepG2 RNA was used for the assay. After overnight hybridization of 0.5–1 × 106 cpm of probe to the RNA, the hybrids were digested according to the described protocol (9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The protected fragments were then analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea. Chimeric human promoter-luciferase plasmids were constructed by cloning various lengths of 5′-flanking sequence and intron sequence from the PRL-1 gene into the polylinker region of the luciferase reporter plasmids pGL2-Basic or pGL2-SV40-promoter (Promega). Unless indicated, the nomenclature used for the constructs is based upon the succession of 5′ restriction sites within the fragments. The plasmid pP1-BglS was constructed by ligating the 2219-bp (BglII-BglI blunted) fragment from plasmid pPRL/SstI, which contains 6.1 kb of the 5′-flanking region and 818 bp of the PRL-1 gene, into theBglII and HindIII (blunted) sites of the vector pGL2-Basic. A series of 5′-end deletion mutant plasmids were then generated from the plasmid pP1-BglS (see Fig. 4 A) by use of various convenient restriction endonuclease sites. For construction of the plasmid pP1-KpnS, pP1-Hind, pP1-Pst, and pP1-Sma, the plasmid pP1-BglS was digested with KpnI,KpnI/HindIII, KpnI/PstI,SmaI, respectively, and blunted by incubating with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTP, and then the fragments were self-ligated to generate corresponding plasmids. To construct the plasmids pP1-KpnL and pP1-BglL, the plasmid pPRL/SstI was cut by BglII and KpnI respectively; the 3.8-kb KpnI fragment and 1-kb BglII fragment were gel-purified and ligated toKpnI and BglII sites of the plasmids pP1-KpnL and pP1-BglL, respectively. Orientation was determined by DNA sequence. For construction of plasmid pP2-Hind (see Fig. 4 B), the 1834-bp region of PRL-1 gene (+1733 to +3567) was first amplified by PCR and subcloned into the KpnI andBglII sites of the plasmid pGL2-Basic. The sequences of the primers for the PCR were 5′-GATTCATGGTACCGAAGCTTT-3′ (upstream) and with KpnI and BglII sites (underlined) for cloning. “pP2-Sst” was generated by inserting theSstI/HindIII fragment from PRL-1 gene subclone pPRL/Sst 2 (containing PRL-1 exons 2–4, Fig. 1) into the site between SstI and HindIII of plasmid “pP2-Hind.” To generate plasmid “pP2-Sst-anti-,” plasmid pP2-Sst was partially digested with HindIII after digestion by SstI, and the 2705-bp SstI/HindIII fragment was gel-purified and subcloned into the site betweenSstI and HindIII of the plasmid Bluescript KS, which was digested with SstI, blunt-ended, and redigested with XhoI. The SstI (blunted)/XhoI fragment was then cloned into the site between XhoI andHindIII (blunted) of plasmid pGL2-Basic. P2 mutant plasmids pP2-A and pP2-B were generated by PCR amplification of plasmid pPRL/Sst 2 and subcloned into the site between KpnI andBglII of plasmid pGL2-basic. P2 plasmids pP2-C and pP2-D were constructed by exonuclease Bal31 digestion of pP2-B. The sequences of the primers for the PCR were as follows: upstream, 5′-GATTCATGGTACCGAAGCTTT-3′ (pP2-Hind); 5′-CTTCAGAGGATCCTGGAGT-3′ (pP2-A); 5′-ATCTGGATCCTCACCCCTTGAG-3′ (pP2-B); and downstream, 5′-GCTAGATCTTGGTGGAGCAGTAA-3′.Figure 1Structure and sequence of the humanPRL-1gene.

To generate plasmid Pst-P2/SmaI, plasmid Pst-P2 was cut with SmaI, and 9.02- and 0.542-kbSmaI fragments were gel-purified and religated. The insert orientation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Chimeric human PRL 1 intron enhancer-promoter luciferase plasmids pBglI/SmalI, pSmaI/SmaI, and pSmaI/SstI were constructed by blunt-ended cloning the first intron into blunted XhoI site of the SV40 promoter luciferase-containing plasmid pGL2-promoter (Promega). The deletion of pSma I/SmaI was done by Bal-31 nuclease mutation. The HindIII-linearized pSma I/SmaI was incubated with Bal-31 nuclease at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped at 3-min intervals and then digested withSstI. The resulting DNA fragments were gel-purified on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel, and DNA fragments were eluted into 0.5m NH4Ac and 1 mm EDTA. After ethanol precipitation, the deletion fragments were cloned into the site between SstI and BglII (blunted) of pGL2 promoter. The sequence and orientation of the inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Human hepatoma HepG2 cells, mouse embryo testicular carcinoma cell line F9 cells, and mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine (Flow Laboratories), 100 units of penicillin, and 50 units of streptomycin (Flow Laboratories) as described previously (1Diamond R.H.

Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were grown in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 50 units of streptomycin. Calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfections were performed as described previously with minor modifications (10Peng Y. Schwarz E.J. Lazar M.A. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Taub R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours before transfection, the cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at 1–5 × 105 cells/cm per dish and then cotransfected with various human PRL-luciferase chimeric plasmids (5 μg per dish) and 1 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase reference plasmid (Promega) as an internal standard for transfection efficiency. After incubation with DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation buffer for 16 h, the cells were washed twice with serum-free culture medium; complete medium was added, and then the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting for luciferase activity assays performed with luciferase assay system (Promega) and the recommended procedure by the supplier. Relative luciferase activity was reported after normalization to β-galactosidase activity. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and 2 μg/ml proteinase inhibitors antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, and leupeptin were added into all buffers except phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Crude nuclear extracts from regenerating liver were prepared as reported (11Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30429-30435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts from cell lines HepG2, H35, HeLa, F9, and NIH 3T3 were prepared using the procedure of Seal et al. (12Seal S.L. Davis D.L. Burch J.B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2704-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were washed twice and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline solution. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and lysed by homogenization in approximately 9 volumes of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.3 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots of cell lysate were layered over 5 ml of Buffer B (same as Buffer A except that the concentration of sucrose was 1 m) in 15-ml tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the nuclei pellet was resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol). Nuclei were lysed by the dropwise addition of 1/9 volume of 4.2 m NaCl before being centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 50 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol) for at least 6 h. Finally, the extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and aliquots were quick-frozen in dry ice, 95% ethanol mixture and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein determination method per manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized single polynucleotides were annealed in 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl at 90–95 °C for 10 min, and then cooled to room temperature. After being kept at room temperature for 24 h, the annealed oligonucleotide was purified by 15% native polyacrylamide. End labeling of oligonucleotides was carried with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified by Sephadex G-25 spin column. Binding reactions were performed essentially as reported (11Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30429-30435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts (3–6 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1.5 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol for 15 min at room temperature. 32P-Labeled probe (0.5–1 × 104 cpm) was then added to the reaction, and incubation was continued for another 20 min. DNA-protein binding complexes were analyzed on 6% native polyacrylamide gel at 300 V using 0.5× TBE as electrophoresis buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films overnight. The sequence of the oligonucleotide used in the EMSA was as follows, 5′GCCGCCTCCGCCCTTGGCCCTTTGGTCTG3′. For UV cross-linking experiments, a gel mobility shift experiment was performed as described above using 20 μg of nuclear protein extract in 20 μl of binding reaction buffer. After electrophoresis, the wet gel was UV-irradiated for 60 min at 305 nm, 7000 microwatts/cm2 using a fotodyne UV transilluminator, and exposed to film for 30–60 min. The specific DNA-protein complexes were cut out and eluted into a solution containing 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m ammonium acetate at 4 °C overnight. After precipitation with 3 volume of 95% ethanol, the specific DNA-protein complexes were dissolved in 20 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer, electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then subjected to autoradiography. DNase I footprinting was carried out as described in Ohlsson and Edlund (13Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0–150 μg of nuclear protein extract was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 50 μl of a mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm fluoride. 1–2 × 104 cpm of32P-end-labeled DNA probe was then added. After the binding reaction was incubated for 40 min at room temperature, MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to a final concentration of 5 and 2 mm, respectively. An empirically adjusted amount of freshly diluted DNase I was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for exact 45 s at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100 mg/ml proteinase K and was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Nucleic acids were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, precipitated by ethanol/sodium acetate, and fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel, alongside sequencing ladder G + A that was produced by chemical cleavage of aliquots of the probe DNA (14Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). Two overlapping genomic clones, designated as hprl1 (17.5 kB) and hprl2 (14.5 kB), containing the human PRL-1 gene were isolated (Fig. 1 A). Results from detailed restriction mapping and Southern hybridization demonstrated that both clones spanned the entire human PRL-1 gene but had different 5′ and 3′ boundaries (Fig. 1). The clone hprl1, with a 17.5-kb insert, was subcloned, and 12 kb were sequenced from the upstream BglII site (−2179) to 0.8 kb past the 3′-end of the second polyadenylation signal. The human PRL-1 gene is composed of 6 exons and 5 introns. The boundaries of each exon display the canonical splice donor (GT) and splice acceptor (AG) consensus sequences (Fig. 1 A). The first exon contains no coding sequence and is separated from the second exon by the largest intron (3.2 kb) in the gene. An ATG initiation codon is located in the middle of the second exon. Based on GenBankTM analyses, rat, human, and mouse PRL-1 are identical at the amino acid level. We found that human PRL-1 had 55% amino acid identity with aCaenorhabditis elegans “similar to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (U42846)” sequence identified by C. elegansgenomic sequencing (15Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P. Hawkins T.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Interesting features of this conservation include virtual identity within the enzymatic domain (around amino acid 120), size similarity, and absolute conservation of the C-terminal CAAX (CCIQ) sequence. The human hprl1 genomic probe specifically hybridized to the centromeric region of the long arm of a C group chromosome in 20 out of 30 metaphases that were scored. Sequential G-banding localized the probe to chromosome 6, within band q12 (Fig. 2). Examination of the nucleotide sequence of the human PRL-1 gene 5′-flanking region revealed that the promoter region was highly GC-rich and contained a canonical TATA box. The transcription start site of the gene was identified from total RNA of human hepatoma cell line HepG2 using primer extension analysis with a primer contained within exon 1 (Fig. 3 A). A single major primer extension product was identified at a position 25 bp 3′ to the TATA box. We designated it as promoter P1. The protein coding sequence was predicted to begin within the second exon suggesting that the first intron could contain an additional promoter site(s) for initiation of PRL-1 mRNA. A primer extension analysis of HepG2 RNA using an oligonucleotide primer from within exon 2 revealed a specific extended fragment of 123 bp (Fig. 3 B). A confirmatory RNase protection assay using an antisense probe (299 bp) containing the 3′ 169 bp of the first intron and the 5′ 130 bp of the second exon was performed with HepG2 total RNA. As shown (Fig. 3 C), two RNase-resistant duplexes of approximately 123 and 130 bp were detected. The 130-bp fragment, which was the same size as the region of exon 2 contained in the probe, likely derived from RNA initiated at the P1 promoter. The 123-bp product detected on both primer extension and RNase protection analyses could be explained by an mRNA initiation site 8 bases 3′ to the 5′ boundary of exon 2. A similar internal RNA initiation site was detected in rat liver PRL-1mRNA. 2Y. Peng, K. Du, S. Ramirez, and R. Taub, submitted for publication. A non-TATA sequence just upstream of the exon 2 initiation site was designated promoter P2. To establish that P1 and P2 are functional and begin to delineate the sequences essential for transcription of the humanPRL-1 gene in cell culture systems, we first constructed a series of the human PRL-1 P1 luciferase chimeric plasmids in which various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the humanPRL-1 gene including the P1 RNA initiation site were fused with the coding region of the bacterial luciferase gene (Fig. 4 A). A plasmid containing the SV40 promoter and enhancer (pGL-C) was used as a positive control for transfection. Sequences necessary for high level basal transcription of the PRL-1 P1 promoter in both HepG2 and mouse NIH 3T3 cells were found within the first 200 bp of the P1 promoter, and a negative element may exist in the region between −3200 and −2179 bp. To delineate the sequences essential for promoter P2 function in the human PRL gene, we constructed a series of the human PRL-1P2-luciferase chimeric plasmids in which various lengths of the first intron of the human PRL-1 and the first 130 bp of exon 2 were fused with the coding region of bacterial luciferase gene. As shown (Fig. 4 B), except plasmid P2-D (without the internal transcription start site), all P2 luciferase constructs with the correct orientation had luciferase activity. When the 2538 bp intron was inserted into the vector in reverse orientation, no luciferase activity was detected after transfection. Deletion mapping analysis revealed the sequence between +3269 and +3330 in PRL-1intron 1 was responsible for a significant amount of P2 activity in HepG2 cells (compare pP2-B with pP2-C). Results were similar when these constructs were analyzed in NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). The fact that the first exon of the PRL-1 gene is non-coding and the gene contains two transcription start sites in exons 1 and 2 suggested that transcriptional regulatory sequences may reside in intron 1. The sequence of the first intron shows a high content of GC bases in the first 900 bp downstream of exon 1 and contains several consensus sites for transcription factor binding, including SP-1, AP-2, Myo D, NF-κB, HNF5, and C/EBP elements. To test for the presence of an enhancer sequence within the first intron, constructs were made"

The roles of the two transferases in the biosynthesis of branched polylactosamine backbones have not been clearly elucidated. We report here that cIGnT6 activity is expressed in human (PA1) and murine (PC13) embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, both of which contain branched polylactosamines in large amounts. In the presence of exogenous UDP-GlcNAc, lysates from both EC cells catalyzed the formation of the branched pentasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc from the linear tetrasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. The PA1 cell lysates were shown to also catalyze the formation of the branched heptasaccharides Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc from the linear hexasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc in reactions characteristic to cIGnT6. By contrast, dIGnT6 activity was not detected in the lysates of the two EC cells that were incubated with UDP-GlcNAc and the acceptor trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Hence, it appears likely that cIGnT6, rather than dIGnT6 is responsible for the synthesis of the branched polylactosamine chains in these cells. Two types of β1,6-GlcNAc transferases (IGnT6) are involved in in vitro branching of polylactosamines: dIGnT6 (distally acting), transferring to the penultimate galactose residue in acceptors like GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R, and cIGnT6 (centrally acting), transferring to the midchain galactoses in acceptors of the type (GlcNAcβ1–3)Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R.

Hence, it appears likely that cIGnT6, rather than dIGnT6 is responsible for the synthesis of the branched polylactosamine chains in these cells. Biosynthesis of branched backbones of type 2 polylactosamines involves reactions catalyzed by β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT3), 1The abbreviations used are: GnT3, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc to Gal); GalT4, β1,4-galactosyltransferase (Gal to GlcNAc); cIGnT6, centrally acting β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc to Gal); dIGnT6, distally acting β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc to Gal); EC, embryonal carcinoma; Gal (or G), d-galactose; GlcNAc (or Gn), N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; Lac, lactose; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1–4GlcNAc); MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry with time-of-flight detection; MH, maltoheptaose [Glcα1–4(Glcα1–4)5Glc]; MP, maltopentaose [Glcα1–4(Glcα1–4)3Glc]; MT, maltotriose (Glcα1–4Glcα1–4Glc); MTet, maltotetraose [Glcα1–4(Glcα1–4)2Glc]. β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT4), and β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GnT6). However, the actual pathways leading to in vivo biosynthesis of branched polylactosamine backbones have not been clearly identified. The branch-forming reactions, in particular, are poorly understood. Two candidate branching reactions involving distinct β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (IGnT6) have been described in vitro (1Bierhuizen M.F.A. Fukuda M. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1994; 6: 17-28Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The “distally acting” dIGnT6 transfers a GlcNAc unit in the β1,6 linkage to the penultimate galactose residue at the growing end of the linear polylactosamine chain (Scheme FS1) (2Brockhausen I.

Maaheimo H. Lauri S. Costello C.E. Renkonen O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By contrast, the “centrally acting” cIGnT6 transfers a GlcNAc residue in the β1,6 linkage to midchain galactose units of preformed as well as growing linear chains (3Gu J. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gasa S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2994-2999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Leppänen A. Penttilä L. Niemelä R. Helin J. Seppo A. Lusa S. Renkonen O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7026-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The dIGnT6 reactions proceed only with acceptor chains bearing distal GlcNAc residues, whereas the cIGnT6 works with polylactosamine backbones carrying either a galactose or a GlcNAc residue at the distal position. There is very little overlapping in the acceptor specificities of the two types of enzymes in vitro. In naturally occurring branched backbones, uniformly short LacNAcβ1–6 branches are linked to linear primary chains; this is the case e.g. in human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (11Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6623-6631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and adult erythrocyte band 3 (12Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8260-8273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the dIGnT6 is responsible for the biosynthesis of polylactosamines in these cells (5Piller F.

However, the suggested role of dIGnT6 in the biosynthesis of molecules containing exclusively short branches is doubtful because the extension enzyme, e.g. the GnT3 of human serum elongates both branches of the hexasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′(LacNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc (where LacNAc is Galβ1–4GlcNAc) (13Vilkman A. Niemelä R. Penttilä L. Helin J. Leppänen A. Seppo A. Maaheimo H. Lusa S. Renkonen O. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 226: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), paving routes to the formation of complex as well as short branches (14Seppo A. Penttilä L. Niemelä R. Maaheimo H. Renkonen O. Keane A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4655-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have recently suggested that midchain branching enzymes similar to the cIGnT6 activity present in blood serum of mammals may be responsible for the conversion of linear polylactosamine chains into branched backbone arrays in vivo (10Leppänen A. Salminen H. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Costello C.E. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7026-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reasoning was based on data showing that the cIGnT6 activity of rat serum catalyzed the transformation of the linear hexasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3LacNAcβ1–3LacNAc in two steps into the doubly branched octasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc. The latter was β1,4-galactosylated enzymatically into the mature decasaccharide backbone LacNAcβ1–3′(LacNAcβ1–6′)LacNAcβ1–3′(LacNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc (10Leppänen A. Salminen H. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Costello C.E. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7026-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which strikingly resembles the polylactosamine backbones of human EC cells of line PA1 (11Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6623-6631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report experiments involving lysates of human PA1 cells, exogenous UDP-GlcNAc, and either the tetrasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′LacNAc or the hexasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′LacNAcβ1–3′LacNAc that established the presence of the cIGnT6 activity in the PA1 cells. In contrast, the dIGnT6 activity was not detected in experiments where UDP-GlcNAc and GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc were incubated with PA1 cell lysates. Lysates of murine EC cells of line PC13, known to carry large amounts of branched polylactosamines (15Renkonen O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), also expressed the cIGnT6 activity but not the dIGnT6 activity. The data imply that cIGnT6 rather than dIGnT6 activity is involved in the biosynthesis of branched polylactosaminoglycans in human as well as murine EC cells. Hence, it is suggested that the linear polylactosamine backbones are probably synthesized first and branched afterward in these cells. Mouse embryonal carcinoma cells of line PC13 established from the pluripotent OTT6050 teratocarcinoma tumor (16Bernstine E.G. Hooper M.L. Grandchamp S. Ephrussi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3893-3903Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. C. F. Graham (Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, UK). The human PA1 teratocarcinoma-derived cells (17Zeuthen J. Norgaard J.O.R. Avner P. Fellows M. Wartiovaara J. Vaheri A. Rosen A. Giovanella B.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Jorma Wartiovaara (Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Finland). The cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (18Lehtonen E. Lehto V.-P. Badley R.A. Virtanen I. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 144: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For the experiments, the cells were detached from the dishes with 0.02% EDTA in NaCl-P buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) and washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2–7.4 (with Ca2+ and Mg2+). Washed human (PA1) and mouse (PC13) EC cell pellets (50–150 μl) were lysed with 200 μl of 0.9% NaCl, 1% TX-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In some experiments, more concentrated cell lysates were prepared by suspending the cell pellets in 50 μl of 1.8% NaCl, 2% TX-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the cells. Small amounts (0.6 μl) of 40 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in ethanol were added to the mixture once each h to a final concentration of 1 mm. In some experiments aprotinin and leupeptin were also added to the lysis buffer to a final concentration of 17 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml, respectively. The lysed cells were kept at 0 °C and homogenized by 5 × 3 strokes in a Potter homogenizer. The lysates were used immediately as the enzyme source in glycosyltransferase reactions.

Partial acid hydrolysis was carried out using 0.1 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C essentially as in Seppo et al. (7Seppo A. Penttilä L. Makkonen A. Leppänen A. Niemelä R. Jäntti J. Helin J.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed in the positive-ion delayed-extraction mode with a BIFLEXTM mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) using a 337-nm nitrogen laser. 1 μl of sample (10 pmol) and 1.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in water) were mixed on the target plate and dried with a gentle stream of air. Dextran standard 5000 from Leuconostoc mesentroides (Fluka Chemica-Biochemica) was used for external calibration. The structures of key oligosaccharides of the present experiments are shown in Table I and are identified in the text by using appropriate bold face digits. Incubation of tetrasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (1) and UDP-GlcNAc with lysates of human embryonal carcinoma cells (line PA1) gave an oligosaccharide product that chromatographed on paper like authentic pentasaccharide 2 marker (peak 1 in Fig. 1 A). Yields of 3–7% were obtained. The identity of the product as glycan 2 was established by enzymatic degradation. First, a treatment of the pentasaccharide with β-galactosidase gave a product co-chromatographing with authentic GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (8) (Fig. 1 B). Next, the putative glycan8 was identified by a partial treatment with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase that gave the trisaccharides GlcNAcβ1–6[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc and GlcNAcβ1–3[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc as well as the disaccharide [14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (Fig. 1 C). In addition to degradation, the original pentasaccharide product was subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry that gave a major signal atm/z 974.8 (Fig. 1 D), assigned to the sodiated molecular ion of Gal2GlcNAc3(calculated m/z = 974.9). Finally, the identity of the pentasaccharide product generated by PA1 cell lysates was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 1 E, Table II); the resonances of the structural reporter groups were practically identical with those of authentic glycan 2 (23Maaheimo H. Räbinä J. Renkonen O. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 297: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Some of these resonances probably would have been different if the GlcNAc branch had been transferred to C-2 or C-4 of the central galactose unit of glycan 1(24Sabesan S. Duus J. Neira S. Domaille P.

Open table in a new tab The pentasaccharide 2 was formed from tetrasaccharide1 in yields of 6–10%, also in reactions catalyzed by lysates of murine EC cells of line PC13 (Fig. 2 A). The endo-β-galactosidase-resistant product was identified as glycan2 by enzymatic degradation as above. First, β-galactosidase converted the putative pentasaccharide 2into a tetrasaccharide that chromatographed like glycan 8(Fig. 2 B). Then the putative glycan 8, upon a partial treatment with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase gave a mixture of the trisaccharides GlcNAcβ1–6[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc and GlcNAcβ1–3[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc as well as the disaccharide [14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (Fig. 2 C). Finally, enzymatic β1,4-galactosylation of the putative pentasaccharide 2 gave the hexasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′(LacNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc (Fig. 2 D), establishing the presence of a distal GlcNAc in the acceptor. Two isotopomers of glycan 3(LacNAcβ1–3′LacNAcβ1–3[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc and LacNAcβ1–3[3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3′LacNAc) were synthesized and were separately incubated with PA1 cell lysates and UDP-GlcNAc to establish whether both the galactose 2 (labeled in the [14C]-acceptor) and the galactose 4 (labeled in the [3H]-acceptor) of glycan 3serve as independent acceptor sites. A heptasaccharide-like product was formed from both acceptors. The product chromatographed as a single peak (peak 1 in Fig. 3 A, RMP = 0.49, RMH = 1.04, solvent A), showing the same migration rate as an unresolved mixture of authentic heptasaccharides 4 and5 (10Leppänen A. Salminen H. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Costello C.E. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7026-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The net yield of the heptasaccharide-like fraction varied from 3 to 7% in 4-h incubations in several separate experiments; it was not improved in 22-h incubations. To ensure that peak 1/Fig. 3 A represented an authentic product resulting from the transfer of GlcNAc to radiolabeled acceptor 3, an aliquot of the material was treated with UDP-Gal and GalT4. This treatment gave 62% [3H]glycans chromatographing like authentic octasaccharide 6 (Fig. 3 B, RMP = 0.32, RMH = 0.68, solvent A), establishing the presence of a distal GlcNAc residue in most of the glycans of peak 1/Fig. 3 A. In addition, the data of Fig. 3 B suggest that the glycans of peak1/Fig. 3 A also included the [3H]hexasaccharide 3 acceptor itself, which contaminated the heptasaccharide products because of obvious chromatographic “tailing.” Other experiments that are described below show that the distal GlcNAc units of the heptasaccharide products of the branching reaction of glycan 3 were β1,6-bonded in some molecules to the galactose 2 and in others to the galactose 4 of the acceptor. The presence of glycan 4 in the heptasaccharide fraction of the branching reaction was established by using endo-β-galactosidase, which cleaves internal β-galactosidic linkages of polylactosamines but does not attack these linkages at branch-bearingN-acetyllactosamine units (25Scudder P. Hanfland P. Uemura K. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6586-6592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the crude [14C]heptasaccharide fraction with this enzyme gave two labeled oligosaccharide products, shown in Fig. 3 C. Peak2, chromatographing like the branched tetrasaccharide8, was derived from the putative glycan 4. It was isolated and cleaved by partial β-N-acetylhexosaminidase treatment into GlcNAcβ1–6[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (peak2) and GlcNAcβ1–3[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (peak 3) as shown in Fig. 3 D. These data established that during the incubation with UDP-GlcNAc and PA1 cell lysate, a β1,6-bonded GlcNAc branch had been transferred to galactose 2 of the [14C]-labeled glycan 3. Peak1 of Fig. 3 C represented the hexasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAcβ3[14C]Gal, a cleavage product of glycan 5; it was not studied further because it contained no easily accessible structural information about the branch structure. The presence of glycan 5 in the crude [3H]heptasaccharide fraction of the branching reaction was also established by using endo-β-galactosidase, which gave two radiolabeled oligosaccharides, LacNAcβ1–3[3H]Gal (from glycan 4) and LacNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)[3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Gal, that were separated by paper chromatography (not shown). The hexasaccharide product, which was derived from the putative glycan5 of the [3H]heptasaccharide fraction, was then subjected to partial acid hydrolysis. This resulted in formation of several [3H]oligosaccharides shown in Fig. 3 E. The important products were GlcNAcβ1–6[3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAc (peak 2) and GlcNAcβ1–6[3H]Gal (peak 4), which proved that the galactose 4 of the [3H]-labeled glycan3 had accepted a β1,6-bonded GlcNAc branch during the incubation with UDP-GlcNAc and a PA1 cell lysate. Incubation of an authentic 1:1 mixture of [3H]-labeled heptasaccharides 4 and5 with UDP-GlcNAc and PA1 cell lysates gave small amounts (2.4–4.4%) of a product that chromatographed on paper like the doubly branched octasaccharide LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc (not shown; RMP = 0.74, RMH = 1.10). In the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum the product gave a sodium-containing molecular ion at m/z 1543.4 (calculatedm/z for Gal3HexNAc51543.4). Together with the (M + K)+ signal, this ion represented 70% of the total polylactosamines in the molecular ion range (26Naven T.J.P. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A treatment of the octasaccharide concentrate with GalT4 and UDP-Gal gave a crude decasaccharide. In MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of this product, a major signal at m/z 1867.8 was observed that was assigned to (M + Na)+ of Gal5HexNAc5 (calculatedm/z 1867.7). These data suggest that the octasaccharide formed from the mixture of the heptasaccharides4 and 5 by the PA1 cell lysate was [3H]LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc. When the trisaccharide [14C]GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (7) (21 pmol) was incubated with UDP-GlcNAc and human or mouse EC cell lysates, chromatographically detectable tetrasaccharide-like products were formed in less than 0.3% yield (not shown), implying that human and mouse EC cells did not express significant dIGnT6 activities. The present data show that lysates from human embryonal carcinoma cells of line PA1 contained centrally acting β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, which catalyzed the formation of the branched pentasaccharide 2from the linear tetrasaccharide 1 in the presence of exogenous UDP-GlcNAc (For the structures of the saccharides, see TableI). In addition, heptasaccharides 4 and 5 were formed from the linear hexasaccharide 3. Evidence was also provided supporting the notion that a second β1,6-GlcNAc branch was transferred during incubation of a mixture of the heptasaccharides4 and 5 with PA1 cell lysates and UDP-GlcNAc. We call the activity responsible for these reactions as cIGnT6 to emphasize the site-specificity of the reaction in thecentral area of the acceptor and the formation of precursors of the blood group I antigen. Because PA1 cells are known to express branched polylactosamine backbones (11Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6623-6631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rasilo M.-L. Renkonen O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the in vitro reactions described in the present experiments are similar to those responsible for the synthesis of the multiply branched polylactosamines in vivo. Also lysates from murine embryonal carcinoma cells of line PC13 contained cIGnT6 activity. The PC13 cells are also known to express large amounts of branched polylactosamines (15Renkonen O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hence, the cIGnT6 reactions observed in vitro in the present experiments are likely to occur also in vivo during the synthesis of PC13 glycans. The action of dIGnT6, too, leads in vitro to the formation of branched polylactosamines (14Seppo A. Penttilä L. Niemelä R. Maaheimo H. Renkonen O. Keane A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4655-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and this enzyme has been suggested to be responsible for the in vivo biosynthesis of branched polylactosamine backbones (5Piller F. Cartron J.-P. Maranduba A. Veyrières A. Leroy Y. Fournet B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13385-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

However, in the present experiments we were unable to observe any dIGnT6 activity in lysates of PA1 cells or PC13 cells that would have converted the linear trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc into the branched tetrasaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Taken together, our present data imply that the cIGnT6 activity rather than the dIGnT6 activity may be responsible for the in vivosynthesis of branched polylactosamine backbones in embryonal carcinoma cells. The dominant role of cIGnT6 in the branch generation, combined with the data showing that the branches of glycans in PA1 cells are short along the entire backbone chain (11Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6623-6631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that the biosynthesis of branched polylactosamine backbones in PA1 cells occurs in rather distinct stages as shown in Scheme FS2: First, alternating action of GnT3 and GalT4 elongates the linear backbone chains to their final size. Second, the linear backbones are branched by cIGnT6 at different sites along the chains. Third, the GlcNAc branches are finally galactosylated by GalT4. A process of this kind is likely to produce rather similar branches along the entire primary backbone chain. By contrast, participation of dIGnT6 in the branching process would generate branches in association with chain elongation, probably leading to more complex branches in the proximal than the distal parts of the mature backbones. The concept that linear polylactosamine chains are precursors of the branched backbones is not new. The relationship was proposed already in 1979 when the developmentally regulated expression of small i (linear chains) and big I (branched backbones) as blood group antigens in human and bovine red blood cells was described (28Watanabe K. Hakomori S. Childs R.A. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3700-3703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present data merely provide the underlying mechanism of the interconversion in EC cells. Scheme FS2 suggests also that cIGnT6 is localized in the Golgi compartment of PA1 cells in a more restricted manner than Gal T4 and more distally than GnT3. The presence of the cIGnT6 activity in the murine EC cell lysates suggests that the polylactosamine backbones of these cells may also consist of primary linear chains that carry short branches. Such arrays may be important scaffolds for “presenting” the binding epitopes of cell adhesion saccharides in multivalent, high affinity modes. This notion is supported by the finding that functionally active sperm receptor saccharides are successfully assembled to ZP3 protein of murine zona pellucida in “appropriately” transfected murine embryonal carcinoma cells but not in a number of other cells similarly transfected (30Kinloch R.A. Mortillo S. Stewart C.L. Wassarman P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); the failing cells probably did not express sufficient amounts of enzymes required for synthesis of branched polylactosamines. Recently, a polylactosamine backbone decorated by several sialyl Lewis X-bearing branches has actually proven to be a highly potent antagonist of lymphocyte L-selectin (31Renkonen O. Toppila S. Penttilä L. Salminen H. Helin J. Maaheimo H. Costello C.E. Turunen J.P. Renkonen R. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We note that the cDNA directing the expression of branched polylactosamines has already been isolated from the cDNA expression library from PA1 cells (32Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This cDNA probably codes the cIGnT6 observed in the present experiments."

In this study, we have examined M5 of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Mutant enzymes were expressed behind an inducible heat-shock promoter in yeast secretory vesicles as described previously (Nakamoto, R. K., Rao, R., and Slayman, C. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7940–7949). Three substitutions (R695A, H701A, and L706A) led to misfolding of the H+-ATPase as evidenced by extreme sensitivity to trypsin; the altered proteins were arrested in biogenesis, and the mutations behaved genetically as dominant lethals. The remaining mutants reached the secretory vesicles in sufficient amounts to be characterized in detail. One of them (Y691A) had no detectable ATPase activity and appeared, based on trypsinolysis in the presence and absence of ligands, to be blocked in the E1-to-E2 step of the reaction cycle. Alanine substitution at an adjacent position (V692A) had substantial ATPase activity (54%), but was likewise affected in the E1-to-E2 step, as evidenced by shifts in its apparent affinity for ATP, H+, and orthovanadate. Among the mutants that were sufficiently active to be assayed for ATP-dependent H+ transport by acridine orange fluorescence quenching, none showed an appreciable defect in the coupling of transport to ATP hydrolysis. The only residue for which the data pointed to a possible role in cation liganding was Ser-699, where removal of the hydroxyl group (S699A and S699C) led to a modest acid shift in the pH dependence of the ATPase. This change was substantially smaller than the 13–30-fold decrease in K+affinity seen in corresponding mutants of the Na+,K+-ATPase (Arguello, J. M., and Lingrel, J. B (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22764–22771). Taken together, the results do not give firm evidence for a transport site in M5 of the yeast H+-ATPase, but indicate a critical role for this membrane segment in protein folding and in the conformational changes that accompany the reaction cycle. It is therefore worth noting that the mutationally sensitive residues lie along one face of a putative α-helix.

It is therefore worth noting that the mutationally sensitive residues lie along one face of a putative α-helix. There is currently much interest in the molecular mechanism of cation transport by P-type ATPases, which are structurally and functionally related to one another, but pump ions as diverse as H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ (reviewed in Refs. 1Fagan M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 57-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For two members of the group, the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and the Na+,K+-ATPase of animal cell plasma membranes, site-directed mutagenesis has identified amino acids in membrane segment 5 that appear to be directly involved in the transport pathway. In the first case, MacLennan and co-workers (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that mutations of Glu-771 abolished Ca2+ transport and Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation from ATP and that substitution of the adjacent residue, Gly-770, by Ala led to a significant decrease in Ca2+ affinity (5Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, they proposed that Glu-771 serves directly as a Ca2+-liganding residue and that Gly-770 may also contribute to high affinity Ca2+ binding. Subsequently, Vilsen and Andersen (6Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were able to distinguish the roles of the two residues by demonstrating that mutations of Glu-771 eliminated the ability of the ATPase to occlude Ca2+, whereas the G770A mutant was still capable of occlusion. Andersen (7Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) has since raised the possibility that Glu-771 may play a role in H+ countertransport, based on changes in dephosphorylation rate when amino acid replacements are made at this position. Parallel studies of the animal cell Na+,K+-ATPase have been of interest since it also contains a glutamate at the corresponding point in M5 1The abbreviations used are: M5, membrane segment 5; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase. 1The abbreviations used are: M5, membrane segment 5; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase. (Glu-779 in the canine and sheep α1-isoforms). Arguello and Kaplan (8Arguello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first drew attention to this residue by demonstrating that it reacts with 4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamino)coumarin, causing disruption of K+ and Na+ occlusion. Thus, there was reason to think that Glu-779 in the Na+ pump, like its close relative in the Ca2+ pump, might be a cation-liganding residue. Subsequently, however, mutagenesis studies have shown that this simple interpretation cannot be correct. Whereas replacement of the glutamate in M5 by Leu does inactivate the Na+,K+-ATPase (9Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), replacement by Gln, Ala, or Arg leaves a functional enzyme with relatively normal K½ values for both Na+ and K+ (10Feng J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have implicated a nearby residue, Ser-775, in K+ binding by describing mutants (S775A and S775C) with large increases in the K½ for stimulation of ATPase activity by K+. Given the intriguing differences in M5 between the Ca2+- and Na+,K+-ATPases, we set out recently to map structure-function relationships in M5 of a third, phylogenetically distant member of the P-type ATPase family, the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase. This enzyme is encoded by the PMA1gene, accounts for 10% of plasma membrane protein, and splits as much as one-quarter of the ATP produced by the cell (reviewed in Ref. 15Rao R. Slayman C.W. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 29-56Google Scholar). It generates the proton electrochemical gradient that underlies nutrient uptake and, consistent with its key physiological role, is essential for cell viability. While the mechanism of proton transport by the yeast ATPase has not yet been studied in detail, work on a very closely related pump (the Pma1 ATPase of the filamentous fungusNeurospora crassa) provides evidence for a simple stoichiometry of 1 H+ translocated per ATP split (16Perlin D.S. San Francisco M.J.D. Slayman C.W. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we have carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis along the full length of M5 in the yeast ATPase. The results have identified five amino acid residues that play a significant role in the reaction cycle, along with three others that are required for proper protein folding and transit through the secretory pathway. Two related strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used in this study: SY4 (MAT a, ura3-52, leu2-3,112, his4-619, sec6-4ts GAL2, pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1) and NY605 (MAT a, ura3-52, leu2-3,112, GAL2). In strain SY4, the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene has been placed under control of theGAL1 promoter by gene disruption (17Cid A. Perona R. Serrano R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using the integrating plasmid YIpGAL-PMA1 (18Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SY4 also carries the temperature-sensitivesec6-4 mutation, which, upon incubation at 37 °C, blocks the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (19Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). NY605 was generously provided by Dr. Peter Novick (Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine). Mutagenesis (20Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) was performed on a 519-base pair BglII-SalI restriction fragment subcloned into a modified Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following DNA sequencing, the BglII-SalI fragment carrying the mutation was moved into plasmid pPMA1.2 (18Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3.8-kilobase HindIII-SacI fragment, which contains the entire pma1 coding region, was cloned into the yeast expression vector YCp2HSE (18Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), placing the mutant allele under heat-shock control. Plasmids were then transformed into yeast according to the method of Ito et al. (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed SY4 cells were grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 ∼ 1) at 23 °C in supplemented minimal medium containing 2% galactose, shifted to medium containing 2% glucose for 3 h, and then heat-shocked at 39 °C for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested and washed, and the secretory vesicles were isolated as described previously (22Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine the level of expressed Pma1 protein relative to a wild-type control, secretory vesicles (5–20 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted (18Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis; typically, the analysis was carried out at two protein concentrations within the linear range, and the expression level was calculated from the average of the two determinations. Unless otherwise noted, ATP hydrolysis was assayed at 30 °C in 0.5 ml of 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.7, 5 mm KN3, 5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase). The reaction was stopped after 20–40 min, and the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP was determined by the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (23Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated as the difference between ATP hydrolysis measured in the absence and presence of 100 μmsodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of P-type ATPases. For determination of Km values, the concentration of Na2ATP was varied between 0.15 and 7.5 mm, with MgCl2 always in excess of ATP by 5 mm. Actual concentrations of MgATP were calculated as described previously (24Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of pH on hydrolysis, the pH of the assay mixture was adjusted to values between 5.2 and 7.5 with Tris base. ATP-dependent proton transport was determined by measuring the initial rate of acridine orange fluorescence quenching as described by Ambesi et al.(25Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The specific initial rate of fluorescence quenching for each mutant was adjusted for ATPase expression and is reported as a percent of the wild-type rate. To measure the synthesis of mutant ATPases that were unable to reach the secretory vesicles, SY4 cells were shifted from galactose medium at 23 °C to glucose medium at 39 °C as described above and then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (26Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Total membranes were isolated and immunoprecipitated with anti-Pma1 antibody (26Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, incubated in 1 m sodium salicylate (30 min at 23 °C), dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Limited trypsinolysis was performed on both isolated secretory vesicles and 35S-labeled yeast total membranes. Vesicles or membranes were diluted into 1 mmEGTA/Tris, pH 7.5; centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 35 min; and suspended at 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 5 mm MgCl2. Following preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 μm orthovanadate, 10 mm MgADP, or 10 mm MgATP at 30 °C for 5 min, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was added (trypsin/protein ratio of 1:4 for secretory vesicles or 1:20 for total membranes), and the incubation was continued for 0.5–20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Reaction products were analyzed either by immunoblotting (secretory vesicles) or by immunoprecipitation and fluorography (total membranes). Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the method of Lowry et al.(27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Ambesi et al. (22Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In this study, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to examine the structural and functional role of amino acids in M5 of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Residues Ser-690 to Leu-713 were included based on hydropathy analysis of the Pma1 protein sequence (reviewed in Ref. 15Rao R. Slayman C.W. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 29-56Google Scholar). All but two of the residues were replaced with alanine, whereas alanines at positions 697 and 711 were replaced with serine. The mutant alleles were transformed into yeast strain SY4, expressed under control of an inducible heat-shock promoter, and secretory vesicles were isolated and characterized with respect to expression and ATP hydrolysis. Most substitutions allowed reasonable amounts of the ATPase to reach the secretory vesicles, but there were three cases (R695A, H701A, and L706A) in which little or no Pma1 protein could be detected in the vesicles (Fig. 1 A and TableI, part A). Immunoprecipitation from35S-labeled total membranes revealed that each of these mutant proteins was synthesized, but became arrested in an earlier compartment of the secretory pathway, presumably the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1 B).Table IEffect of pma1 mutations on expression, ATP hydrolysis, and proton transportMutationExpressionaCalculations were made from yields of mutant and wild-type H+-ATPase protein/mg of total secretory vesicle protein, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”).ATP hydrolysisbVanadate-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit is defined as 1 μmol of Pi/min.Proton transportcThe initial rate of fluorescence quenching (proton transport) was determined as previously described (25).

Open table in a new tab Values represent the mean of at least three determinations with an average S.E. of 11% or less. The remaining 21 mutant ATPases reached the secretory vesicles in amounts ranging from 39 to 99% of the wild-type control (Table I, part A). When these mutants were assayed for their ability to hydrolyze ATP, 17 of them had activities of 37% or better after correction for the level of expression in the secretory vesicle preparations. Three showed significant reductions in activity: Y694A to 22%, W709A to 21%, and S699A to 8% of the wild-type control. One mutant ATPase (Y691A) was expressed well in secretory vesicles (92%), but appeared to be completely inactive. Y691A and S699A, along with R695A, H701A, and L706A, which were blocked in biogenesis, were later examined for structural defects by limited trypsinolysis, as described below. The mutant ATPases were next assayed for vanadate sensitivity, MgATP dependence, and the effect of pH on the rate of ATP hydrolysis. In all but one case, the kinetic properties of the mutants proved to be essentially normal (TableII, part A). The exception was V692A, which displayed an increased Ki for vanadate (11 μm compared with 1.8 μm for the wild-type control), a decreased Km for MgATP (0.1 mm compared with 1.1 mm for the wild type), and a relatively alkaline pH optimum (pH 6.4 compared with pH 5.7 for the wild type). Because Val-692 is presumably buried in the membrane, it is unlikely to contribute in a direct way to the vanadate- and MgATP-binding sites. Rather, the increased Ki, decreased Km, and altered pH optimum can more reasonably be accounted for by a slowing of the E1P-to-E2P conformational change; as a result, the ATPase accumulates in E1, which has a relatively high affinity for ATP and protons and a relatively low affinity for orthovanadate. This idea is supported by the fact that mutations at three positions in M4 lead to a similar set of kinetic changes (25Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Table IIKinetic properties of pma1 mutantsMutationKm(MgATP)Ki(van)avan, vanadate.pH optimummmμmPart A Wild type1.11.85.7 S690A0.71.45.8 V692A0.110.96.4 V693A0.71.85.8 I696A0.62.85.7 A697A1.01.85.6 L698A0.91.35.7 L700A1.02.15.5 L702A0.75.35.7 E703A1.32.25.7 I704A1.32.25.6 F705A1.12.85.7 G707A1.21.95.7 L708A1.02.15.7 I710A1.42.55.6 A711S1.32.05.6 I712A1.02.35.7 L713A1.02.25.7Part B Wild type1.11.85.7 Y694G0.959.65.4 S699C0.57.55.4 S699T1.83.65.7 E703D0.87.35.7Kinetic properties for each mutant were determined under standard assay conditions (50 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.7, 5 mmNa2ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKN3, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 50 mg/ml pyruvate kinase at 30 °C) with the following exceptions. TheKm was determined by varying Na2ATP from 0.15 to 7.5 mm (MgCl2 in excess of ATP by 5 mm); the Ki was determined by varying the concentration of vanadate from 0 to 200 μm; and the pH optimum was calculated from assays carried out over a pH range of 5.2–7.5 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Kinetic properties for each mutant were determined under standard assay conditions (50 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.7, 5 mmNa2ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKN3, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 50 mg/ml pyruvate kinase at 30 °C) with the following exceptions.

Values represent the mean of at least three determinations with an average S.E. of <7%. Given the fact that membrane segment 5 is believed to play a direct role in cation translocation in the Ca2+- and Na+,K+-ATPases, it was of particular interest to explore the proton-pumping ability of the yeast M5 mutants. For this purpose, secretory vesicle preparations were assayed for ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange fluorescence. In seven of the mutants (Y691A, Y694A, R695A, S699A, H701A, L706A, and W709A), ATPase activities were below the limit at which associated proton pumping could have been reliably detected by the acridine orange assay. With one exception, all of the remaining mutants showed a reasonable correlation between the initial rate of ATP-dependent quenching and the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Table I, part A). In V692A, the rate of acridine orange quenching (123% of the wild-type control) appeared to exceed the rate of ATP hydrolysis (54% of the wild-type control). However, separate measurements indicated that the apparent discrepancy could be accounted for by the pH difference between the hydrolysis assay and the quenching assay, together with the above-mentioned alkaline shift in pH optimum. Thus, at pH 6.7, the V692A enzyme split ATP at 119% of the wild-type rate, completely consistent with its relative rate of acridine orange quenching at the same pH (123%; see Table I, part A). There was no evidence for abnormal ATP-dependent proton transport in any of the other 16 mutants that were studied (Table I, part A). Based on comparison with other P-type ATPases, it seemed useful to make additional amino acid replacements at three positions: Tyr-694, Ser-699, and Glu-703. In the case of Tyr-694, Andersen (28Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) has reported that mutation of the corresponding residue to glycine leads to uncoupling of the SERCA Ca2+-ATPase; the other two residues are believed to play a role in cation binding in the Na+,K+- and SERCA Ca2+-ATPases, respectively (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

At Tyr-694 of the yeast ATPase, substitution by Gly gave better expression (Y694G, 64%; Table I, part B) than substitution by Ala (Y694A, 40%; Table I, part A). Interestingly, the Y694G enzyme was extremely resistant to orthovanadate, with a Ki of 60 μm (Table II, part B). This large increase inKi, with only minor changes in Kmand pH optimum, suggests that the mutation has a relatively specific effect on vanadate binding, raising the possibility that the cytoplasmic end of M5 may somehow interact with the vanadate-binding pocket. Y694G also showed an apparent difference between the rate of ATP hydrolysis (18% before correction for the level of expression in secretory vesicles, 28% after correction) and the rate of acridine orange fluorescence quenching (8% before correction, 12% after correction). Taken at face value, this difference could indicate partial uncoupling, but the rates are below the limit at which a detailed analysis is possible. In the case of Ser-699, both the Cys and Thr mutants were well expressed, but S699T was considerably more active (96% hydrolysis, 100% transport) than S699C (16% hydrolysis, 12% transport). In both cases, the pH profile for ATP hydrolysis was examined to see whether there was any evidence for a decrease in the apparent affinity of the ATPase for protons, similar to the decrease in K+ affinity reported for the corresponding mutants of the Na+,K+-ATPase (14Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the pH curve for S699C did indeed shift in the acid direction, but only modestly (∼0.2 pH units). A similar shift of ∼0.2 pH units was seen in S699A (data not shown), although in this case, the ATPase activity was very low. By contrast, the more conservative substitution in S699T had no effect on the pH profile. Finally, although the substitution of Glu-703 by Asp (56% expression, 39% hydrolysis, 40% transport) was less well tolerated than the substitution by Ala (95% expression, 105% hydrolysis, 92% transport), there was sufficient activity in both cases to carry out a quantitative study of H+ pumping over a range of MgATP concentrations. The results are illustrated in Fig. 3. As reported earlier (25Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the relationship between the initial rate of acridine orange fluorescence quenching and the rate of hydrolysis was approximately linear in the wild-type control. Significantly, the data points for E703A and E703D fell along the same straight line, consistent with normal coupling be"

Extension of the promoter sequence to −463 ε decreased ε-gene expression in the definitive erythroid cells, supporting previous evidence that the −179 to −463ε region contains an ε-gene silencer. However, the ε-gene of the μLCR(−463)ε mice was not silenced in the definitive cells of fetal and adult erythropoiesis indicating that additional silencing elements are located upstream of position −463ε.

All animal species have different hemoglobins in the embryonic and definitive stages of development. These hemoglobins are synthesized under the control of globin genes whose expression is restricted to either the definitive or the primitive stages of erythropoiesis. In the mouse there are two embryonic genes, ε and βh1, and two adult genes βmajor and βminor; expression of embryonic genes is totally restricted to the yolk sac stage of erythropoiesis, whereas adult gene expression starts only after the onset of definitive hematopoiesis in the liver of the 11-day-old mouse fetus. In humans, the first gene of the β globin locus to be expressed is the embryonic (ε) followed by the two fetal (γ) genes and the adult δ and β genes (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W.

Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The absolute nature of ε-globin gene silencing is remarkable in view of the relative proximity of the ε-gene to the locus control region (LCR), 1The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; kb, kilobase(s); HS, hypersensitive sites; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; kb, kilobase(s); HS, hypersensitive sites; bp, base pair(s). residing 6–22 kb upstream. The LCR, characterized physically by five DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS), influences chromatin structure over the entire β globin domain (7Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M.

Transgenic mice bearing a fragment containing the LCR hypersensitive sites 1 and 2 and contiguous ε 5′-flanking sequence fused to the coding region of the γ globin gene display an embryonic pattern of transgene regulation (13Shih D.M.

Transient expression assays have localized a silencer between 392 and 177 base pairs upstream of the ε-globin cap site (15Cao S.X. Gutman P.D. Dave H.P. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5306-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Gutman P.D. Cao S.X. Dave H.P. Mittelman M. Schechter A.N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice carrying a 2-kb ε-gene promoter from which the −177 to −392 silencer has been deleted express the ε-globin gene in the adult stage of development (14Raich N. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Enver T. Blood. 1992; 79: 861-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice provide an excellent model for delineation of the sequences necessary for ε-gene silencing, because of the absolute restriction of ε-globin gene expression in the yolk sac cells of the mouse. If such sequences exist, their deletion or mutation is expected to be associated with loss of ε-gene silencing resulting in continuation of ε-gene expression in the adult stage of development. In the experiments described in this report developmental studies were performed using transgenic mice containing an LCR cassette linked to an ε-globin gene containing only 179 or 463 bp of promoter sequence. We found that although a significant level of developmental control is retained in the proximal promoter, the bulk of ε-gene silencing resides with sequences located upstream of −179 ε. These sequences include but are not limited to the −177 to −392 ε-silencer. These results provide in vivo evidence that elements located both in the proximal as well as in the distal ε-gene promoter are involved in ε-gene silencing. pμLCR(−463)ε was produced from a modified version of pμLCRε, which contains 2 kb of sequence upstream of the ε-globin gene transcription start site. The μLCR cassette of pμLCRε was modified to provide an additional 0.6 kb of sequence 5′ to HS4 of the original μLCR, producing 3.1-kb pμLCRε (thereafter, the term μLCR used in the text represents this new LCR cassette except where otherwise indicated). pμLCRε was linearized using SmaI, partially digested using BfrI, and the digestion products were blunted using Klenow enzyme. An 8.3-kb product was gel purified and religated to generate pμLCR(−463)ε. To generate pμLCR(−179)ε the construct pμLCRε was linearized using SmaI, partially digested using BamHI, and the digestion products were blunted using Klenow enzyme. A 7.9-kb product was gel purified and religated to produce pμLCR(−179)ε. All constructs were freed from vector sequences using restriction enzymes, gel purified, and resuspended in filtered Tris-EDTA before injection into fertilized oocytes. Transgenic mice carrying the pμLCR(−179)ε and pμLCR(−463)ε constructs were produced as described previously (19Stamatoyannopoulos G. Josephson B. Zhang J. Li Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7636-7644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Founder animals were identified by Southern blotting with an ε-gene sequence probe. F1 progeny were obtained by breeding founder animals with nontransgenic mice and were screened for correct integration and to exclude the presence of mosaicism in the founders. To study the developmental pattern of human ε-gene expression, staged pregnancies were interrupted on days 9, 12, and 16 of development. Samples from blood and yolk sac were collected on day 9 embryos; blood, yolk sac and liver were collected on day 12 fetuses; and blood and liver were collected on day 16 fetuses. Total RNA was isolated from transgenic tissues by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). The ε mRNA level was measured by the quantitative RNase protection assay described previously (21Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, riboprobe for ε mRNA was labeled by transcribing the linearized plasmid pT7ε(188) using T7 RNA polymerase (22Li Q. Clegg C. Peterson K. Shaw S. Raich N. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ε probe protects a 188-bp fragment in exon 2 of ε mRNA. The mouse α and ζ riboprobes were used in RNase protection assays as internal globin mRNA controls. mRNA levels were determined in all transgenic siblings of each litter. RNA samples from different tissues were analyzed at least twice to reduce experimental error in mRNA quantitations. Human ε and mouse α and ζ signals were quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Levels of human mRNA per transgene copy were expressed as percentages of mouse α-like mRNA levels per copy, taking into account that the mouse possesses four copies of the α-globin gene and two copies of the ζ-globin gene. In the adult stages of development when ζ mRNA is absent, murine α mRNA per copy was calculated by dividing the levels of murine α mRNA by four. Copy number determination was accomplished by the multiply redundant protocol described previously (21Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to reduce experimental errors. Multiple DNA samples were obtained from each of at least three animals from each transgenic line. These samples were digested with restriction enzyme EcoRI and resolved by electrophoresis over 1% agarose gel. Southern blots were hybridized with a radiation-labeled ε probe by using a 0.6-kbBamHI fragment of the ε-globin gene as template. The signals were quantitated on a PhosphorImager. Copy numbers were calculated by determining the relative intensity of signals from a given transgenic line compared with the signals obtained from diploid human genomic DNA. The construct μLCR(−179)ε consists of a 1.9-kb ε-gene fragment that contains the ε-globin gene, 179 bp of sequences of the ε-gene promoter and 280 bp of 3′-nontranslated sequences. The −463 ε construct contains ε genomic sequences identical to those of the −179 ε construct, but the promoter is extended to a BfrI site at position −463. This construct therefore contains the −177 to −392 sequence previously shown in transient assays (15Cao S.X. Gutman P.D. Dave H.P. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5306-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and transgenic mouse studies (14Raich N. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Enver T. Blood. 1992; 79: 861-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to behave like an ε-gene silencer. The −179ε- or −463ε-fragments were linked to a 3.1-kb μLCR, which consists of 0.71 kb of HS1, 0.73 kb of HS2, 0.56 kb of HS3, and 1.1 kb of HS4. This 3.1 μLCR contains the core element of DNase I hypersensitive sites 1, 2, and 3, which are also present in the previously used 2.5 kb μLCR (23Forrester W.C. Novak U. Gelinas R. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5439-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The 3.1 μLCR also contains 600 additional bp of HS4, which includes the core element of HS4; this core of HS4 is missing from the 2.5 μLCR (23Forrester W.C. Novak U. Gelinas R. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5439-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Control mice were of two kind. First, 3.1 μLCRε and 2.5 μLCRε mice in which the ε-gene promoter is extending 2-kb upstream of the cap site, i.e. in the EcoRI site at position −2040 ε. Second, three βYAC lines that were produced using a 248-kb β-locus YAC. These lines have been analyzed in detail for structural integrity using previously published protocols (24Peterson K.R. Li Q. Clegg C.H. Furukawa T. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and found to contain an intact β-globin locus, from 5′ HS4 to 3′ HS1. For developmental studies, timed pregnancies were interrupted at 9, 12, and 16 days, and yolk sac, blood, and fetal liver samples were collected for measurement of human ε and murine α and ζ mRNA by RNase protection (Fig. 2). More than one tissue was analyzed in each gestational day to increase the accuracy of ε mRNA measurements. Multiple members from each litter were used for measurements of globin mRNA.

The day 12 yolk sac still contains large numbers of nucleated embryonic red cells, and the day 12 fetal blood is composed predominantly from nucleated erythrocytes of yolk sac origin. Therefore, blood and yolk sac samples from day 12 fetuses were used to assess ε-globin expression in day 12 embryonic erythropoiesis. ε-gene expression in cells of definitive erythropoiesis was studied using day 12 fetal liver, day 16 fetal liver, day 16 fetal blood, and adult blood. The day 12 fetal liver is an organ of adult erythropoiesis, and it mostly consists of definitive erythroblasts that can be distinguished from the embryonic erythroblasts by their smaller size and small cytoplasmic nuclear ratio. There is no expression of murine embryonic εy and βh1 genes or human ε-transgenes in fetal liver erythropoiesis (11Raich N. Enver T. Nakamoto B. Josephson B. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Science. 1990; 250: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Raich N. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Enver T.

Yolk sac origin erythroblasts that contaminate the fetal liver preparations (11Raich N. Enver T. Nakamoto B. Josephson B. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Science. 1990; 250: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) account for the small levels of ε mRNA detected in fetal liver specimens from μLCRε or βYAC transgenic mice. The μLCR(−179)ε construct contains all the transcriptional motifs of the proximal ε-gene promoter, i.e. the TATA box at −30, the CAAT box at −84, the CACC box at −113, and a GATA-1 site in position −165 shown before to be required for up-regulation of ε-gene expression (29Gong Q.H. Stern J. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2558-2566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the proximal promoters of the β-like globin genes share a basic organization, several differences also exist between promoters. Differences between the ε-and γ gene promoters include the presence of a duplicated CAAT box in the γ-promoter and divergence of sequences surrounding the TATA, CAAT, and CACC boxes. Presumably these structural differences contribute to the difference in the developmental regulation of ε-and γ genes in humans. Using the μLCR(−179)ε recombinant we produced 8 transgenic lines, all of which expressed the ε-globin transgene. Two lines had more than 30 copies of the integrated transgene and were excluded from further analysis because we have found that such high transgene copies are frequently associated with position effects resulting in loss of the correlation between copy number of the integrated transgenes and level of globin gene expression. The 6 lines were used for developmental studies in F2 progeny. The percentage of ε-globin mRNA relative to mouse α and ζ mRNA was measured by quantitative RNase protections and corrected for the number of copies of the transgene. Expression of the ε-globin gene ranged from 11.8 to 23.3% of murine α (mean 16.2 ± 3.1) in the 9-day embryonic cells, and it was slightly higher (range 11.8–33.3%; mean 19.5 ± 6.6%) in the 12-day embryonic cells (Table I). In Fig. 3 we compare levels of ε mRNA in day 9 yolk sac and blood and day 12 yolk sac and blood of μLCR(−179)ε mice to those of μLCRε and βYAC controls. There is no significant difference in ε mRNA levels between the μLCR(−179)ε and the μLCRε lines. ε mRNA in the μLCR(−179)ε and the μLCRε embryos was significantly higher than in the βYAC embryos. The lower levels of ε mRNA in the βYAC transgenic mice most likely represent the decreased chance of interaction between the ε-gene and the LCR when a γ globin gene is also present in the construct. γ mRNA in embryonic cells of βYAC mice is considerably higher than ε mRNA (24Peterson K.R. Li Q. Clegg C.H. Furukawa T. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Furukawa T.

Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that the murine embryonic trans acting environment favors the transcription of human γ gene. The μLCR(−463)ε construct contains the sequence −177 to −392ε previously shown to harbor an ε-gene silencer (14Raich N. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Enver T. Blood. 1992; 79: 861-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cao S.X. Gutman P.D. Dave H.P. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5306-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This silencer contains sites that bind erythroid-specific as well as constitutive transcriptional factors (16Gutman P.D. Cao S.X. Dave H.P. Mittelman M. Schechter A.N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Trepicchio W.L. Dyer M.A. Baron M.H. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 829-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a GATA-1 binding site at −208, two GATA-1 binding sites that overlap with a YY1 site at −269; and a CCACC site at −379 that binds Sp-1 or a related factor. Seven founder lines were produced but only three transmitted the transgene and were used for developmental studies (Fig. 2, panel B and Table I). Levels of ε mRNA (corrected per copy of transgene) in the 9-day embryonic cells ranged from 7.7 to 12.4% (mean 9.7 ± 2.24%) and in the 12-day embryonic cells from 6.0 to 16.6% (mean 12.8 ± 3.6%). Therefore, ε-gene expression in the embryonic tissues of the μLCR(−463)ε-transgenic mice was considerably lower compared with the μLCR(−179)ε transgenic mice at both the day 9 and day 12 developmental stages (Fig. 3). The lower ε-gene expression in the μLCR(−463)ε mice cannot be attributed to the increased distance of the LCR from the proximal promoter because, as shown in Fig. 3, ε-gene expression in the μLCRε mice (which contain a promoter extending 2 kb from the cap site) is higher than ε in μLCR(−463)ε mice. The lower levels of ε mRNA in the μLCR(−463)ε mice may reveal the presence in the −179ε to −463ε sequence of negative elements that can be detected only when other upstream sequences are deleted. As shown in Table II, the 12-day fetal liver samples of the βYAC mice contain from 2 to 3.7% ε mRNA deriving from contaminating embryonic erythroblasts. There is no ε mRNA in the 16-day blood and liver samples or in adult blood of the βYAC transgenic mice. In the 3.1 μLCRε and 2.5 μLCRε mice, traces of ε mRNA are detected in the 16-day liver (0.11%) and adult blood (0.18–0.67%). Therefore, compared with the β-locus YACs, the two μLCRε constructs are “leaky” and allow synthesis of residual levels of ε mRNA in the cells of definitive erythropoiesis. Fig. 4 shows that ε-gene expression in the 12-day fetal liver of the six μLCR(−179)ε lines is significantly higher than in the 2.5 μLCRε and 3.1 μLCRε controls. The difference is even more striking in the 16-day fetal liver in which the levels of ε mRNA in μLCR(−179)ε mice are 30–50-fold higher than in the 3.1 μLCRε control (Table II). The μLCR(−179)ε construct, however, has not totally lost the ability to down-regulate ε-gene expression, because, as shown in Fig. 5 A, there is a significant decline in ε mRNA levels in the adult μLCR(−179)ε-transgenic mice. This is in contrast to a μLCRAγ gene containing only the proximal γ-promoter (μLCR(−201)Aγ), which is not down-regulated in the adult and it directs similar levels of γ mRNA in the adult and in the embryonic cells of transgenic mice (19Stamatoyannopoulos G. Josephson B. Zhang J. Li Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7636-7644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Comparison of ε mRNA levels in embryonic cells (a) and adult cells (b) of transgenic mice carrying the μLCR(−179)ε construct (A), the μLCR(−463)ε construct (B), and μLCRε (▪) or βYAC (□) constructs (C). The highest level of ε mRNA in the embryonic cells of each line was used for the data plotted in a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite the presence of the −177 to −392 silencer in the μLCR(−463)ε construct, the 12-day definitive erythroid cells of these mice had ε mRNA levels that were about 2-fold higher than the levels of the 3.1 μLCRε or βYAC controls (Table II and Fig. 4). Levels of ε mRNA in the 16-day fetal tissues of μLCR(−463)ε mice are 20–40-fold higher than in the μLCRε control (Fig. 4). Therefore the definitive erythroblasts of the μLCR(−463)ε mice synthesize significant amounts of ε mRNA. The levels of ε mRNA in adult μLCR (−463)ε mice, are significantly lower than in adult μLCR(−179)ε mice (Fig. 5) most likely reflecting the presence of the −179 to −392 ε-silencer. ε-Expression in the adult μLCR(−463)ε mice is 10–20-fold higher than in the adult 3.1 μLCRε control (Table II), most likely reflecting the presence of silencing elements upstream of −463ε. The results in Tables Iand II show consistency of expression of the ε-gene in the mouse lines carrying the μLCR(−179)ε or the μLCR(−463)ε constructs. The mean ε-gene expression in the μLCR(−179)ε mice is 18.9 ± 5.5 in the day 12 embryonic blood and 5.3 ± 2.2 in adult blood. The coefficients of variation in per copy expression between the μLCR (−179) ε lines are 0.29 for the fetal day-12 embryos and 0.41 for the adult stage, respectively. Small coefficients of variation (less than 0.5) indicate that the expression of a transgene is independent of the position of integration (21Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since ε-gene expression is not influenced by the position of integration of the transgenes, the developmental profiles shown in Tables I and II must reflect an inherent property of the μLCR(−179)ε construct. It is noteworthy that copy number-dependent expression was also previously observed in the μLCR(-201) Aγ transgenic mice containing only the proximal γ gene promoter (19Stamatoyannopoulos G. Josephson B. Zhang J. Li Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7636-7644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Copy number dependence of ε expression is also characteristic of the construct μLCR(−463)ε. Thus, the coefficient of variation is 0.38 in the day-12 embryonic blood and 0.39 in adult blood of the μLCR(−463)ε-transgenic mice, indicating that the expression of this transgene is also independent of position of integration. Several studies have shown that sequences in the ε-gene promoter as well as in the LCR participate in the developmental regulation of the ε-globin gene. Experiments in transgenic mice have shown that, in the absence of the LCR, the human ε-genes remain silent in the embryonic cells of transgenic mice, indicating that the LCR is necessary for in vivo ε-globin gene transcription (11Raich N. Enver T. Nakamoto B. Josephson B. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Science. 1990; 250: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,12Shih D.M. Wall R.J. Shapiro S.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5465-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The contribution of LCR sequences in the developmental control of ε-gene has been clearly shown in studies of βYAC transgenic mice containing deletions of DNase I hypersensitive site 3; mice carrying a 2.5-kb deletion removing HS3 and the surrounding flanking sequences display decreased ε-globin expression in the embryonic erythropoiesis (26Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6605-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas mice carrying deletions of the core element of HS3 display total absence of ε-expression in day-9 embryonic cells and severe reduction of ε-expression in day-12 embryonic cells (31Navas P.A. Peterson K.R. Li Q. Skarpidi E. Rhode A. Shaw S.E. Clegg C.H. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Such data suggest that sequences of the core element of HS3 are necessary for activation of ε-gene transcription. The contribution of elements of the ε-gene promoter have been investigated in vitro,with transient expression assays and in vivo, in transgenic mice. Studies in transiently transfected cell lines have revealed sequences that either positively (17Trepicchio W.L. Dyer M.A. Baron M.H. Mol. Cell.

Several of these sequences have been evolutionarily conserved (36Gumucio D.L. Shelton D.A. Bailey W.J. Slightom J, L. Goodman M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic mice have shown that all the ciselements required for ε-gene silencing are located in a 2.0-kb fragment that contains the ε-gene promoter (11Raich N. Enver T. Nakamoto B. Josephson B. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Science. 1990; 250: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Raich N. Clegg C.H. Grofti J. Romeo P.H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this study we wished to examine to what degree the proximal and distal ε-gene promoter are involved in the developmental regulation of the ε-globin gene in vivo. We used control constructs containing the whole β-locus or a 2-kb ε-promoter and constructs with an ε-promoter containing only the essential transcriptional motifs or these essential motifs as well as a previously identified upstream silencer. We found high levels of ε mRNA in the adult cells of transgenic mice carrying only the proximal ε-promoter indicating that structural elements located in the distal ε-gene promoter are critical for ε-gene silencing. The level of ε mRNA in the adult cells decreased when sequences containing the previously described silencer were added, providing further evidence for thein vivo function of this element. However, presence of this silencer did not totally suppress ε-gene expression in definitive cells suggesting that additional elements located in the distal ε-promoter are involved in ε-gene silencing. Although mice carrying only the proximal ε-promoter have high levels of ε-gene expression in the adult stage of development, the level of ε mRNA in the adult cells is strikingly lower than in embryonic cells, suggesting that sequences located in the proximal ε-promoter participate in ε-gene silencing. Overall, our results provide in vivoevidence that multiple elements located in the distal as well as in the proximal ε-gene promoter are involved in ε-gene silencing. Liu et al. (37Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have recently reported that a sequence located between position −179 to −304 of the ε-gene promoter contains a positive regulatory element, the deletion of which in the context of the β-locus YAC results in catastrophic reduction of ε-globin (as well as on γ-globin) gene expression. This finding contrasts to the results of the present study, which shows that the levels of ε mRNA in the embryonic cells of μLCR(−179)ε-transgenic mice are as high as in transgenic mice carrying an ε promoter extending 2-kb upstream of the ε-gene cap site. Such findings imply that most of the cis elements necessary to interact with the LCR are located in the proximal ε-gene promoter. The results of Liu et al. also contrast to the results of a previous study in which a −179 to −463 ε sequence was deleted from a 2-kb ε-promoter. Transgenic mice carrying this construct have normal ε mRNA levels in embryonic erythroblasts (14Raich N. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Enver T. Blood. 1992; 79: 861-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although they should have lacked ε expression if a positive element with the characteristics described by Liu et al.(37Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was located in the deleted sequence. There are several explanations for these discrepant findings. First, it is known that YACs have a considerable tendency for rearrangements and YAC transgenic lines may carry several YAC integrants, each showing different structural rearrangements (24Peterson K.R. Li Q. Clegg C.H. Furukawa T. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The finding of Liu et al. (37Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) could be explained if such rearranged YACs were contained in the transgenic lines they studied, a possibility that has not been totally excluded with the structural analyses done. Second, as previous studies have shown, globin genes behave differently when they are individually linked to the LCR in short constructs or when they are present in constructs containing the whole β-locus. Thus, when the β genes are linked to a 2.5-kb μLCR (38Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or a 20-kb LCR (39Behringer R.R. Ryan T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), they are expressed in embryonic as well as adult cells, whereas they are totally silenced in embryonic cells when they are located in γδβ cosmids (38Enver T.

Brinster R.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) or in βYACs (27Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7593-7597Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similar behavior has been documented with γ-globin genes (19Stamatoyannopoulos G. Josephson B. Zhang J. Li Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7636-7644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Such results do not invalidate the use of short constructs but they point to the different insights obtained when short globin gene-LCR constructs or constructs containing the whole β-locus are used in transgenic mouse experiments. The short constructs are useful for delineating the functional role of specific sequences flanking the globin genes or elements contained in the HSs of the LCR. Such constructs have allowed the delineation of specific cis elements of the β- (41Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or γ- (19Stamatoyannopoulos G. Josephson B. Zhang J. Li Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7636-7644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gene promoters or the HSs of the LCR (41Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 42Caterina J.J. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Philipsen S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since, in the intact β-locus, the competition between globin gene promoters to interact with the LCR becomes the dominant determinant of gene expression, “whole locus” constructs are most useful for addressing questions on the control of globin gene switching. It is likely that certain regulatory elements have different functions in the different stages of development, and these functions could be identified by the use of the two types of constructs. The discrepancies between our results and those of Liu et al. (37Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) perhaps reveal that the −179 to −392 sequence has a dual function. In the presence of the transcriptional environment of definitive erythropoiesis this element may act as an ε-gene silencer, and this function was depicted when the LCR ε-gene constructs were used in transgenic mice. In the presence of an embryonic transcriptional environment and an intact β-locus, this sequence may behave as an “anchor” that facilitates the interaction of the LCR with the ε-and γ genes of embryonic cells; this function was perhaps depicted when in the studies of Liuet al. (37Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) a β-locus YAC with a deleted −179 to −392 ε sequence was used.

The marked biphasic nature of the dose-response curve for inhibition of the enzyme by MP-6(N-methyl-4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzyl)propyl]pyridinium) makes this compound the first selective inhibitor of the two sites (Miyoshi, H., Inoue, M., Okamoto, S., Ohshima, M., Sakamoto, K., and Iwamura, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 16176–16183). Modifications of the structure of MP-6 show that a tert-butyl group on the benzene ring, a methyl group attached to the pyridine nitrogen atom, para-substitution pattern in the pyridine ring, and the presence of a branched structure in the spacer moiety are important for the selective inhibition. On the basis of the structural specificity, we synthesized a selective inhibitor, MP-24 (N-methyl-4-[2-methyl-2-(p-tert-butylbenzyl)propyl]pyridinium), which elicits greater selectivity.

There are a variety of inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and with the exception of a few inhibitors which inhibit electron input into the enzyme (3Kean E.A. Gutman M. Singer T.P. J. Biol.

This concept may be helpful in elucidating the terminal electron transfer step in complex I and seems to be consistent with the existence of two EPR-detectable species of complex I-associated ubisemiquinones (11Vinogradov A.D.

Iwamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) can be explained by assuming the existence of more than one inhibitor (or ubiquinone) binding site. In the previous study (17Miyoshi H. Inoue M. Okamoto S. Ohshima M. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16176-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we synthesized a series of MPP+analogues which are much more potent than the original MPP+and demonstrated that the presence of hydrophobic counter-anion tetraphenylboron (TPB−) potentiates the inhibition by MPP+ analogues differently depending upon the molar ratio of TPB− to the inhibitors. In the presence of a catalytic amount of TPB−, the inhibitory potency of MPP+analogues was markedly enhanced, and the extent of inhibition was almost complete. The presence of an excess amount of TPB−partially reactivated the enzyme activity, and the inhibition was partly saturated (∼50%). This complicated inhibitory behavior could be explained by the dual binding sites model mentioned above (6Gluck M.R. Krueger M.J. Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Nicklas W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3167-3174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which supposes quite different hydrophobic natures of the two sites and/or their environments. If there are indeed two distinct binding sites of MPP+analogues in bovine complex I, there should be specific inhibitors which act selectively at one of the two proposed binding sites since it is unlikely that the structural properties of the two sites are completely identical. We have synthesized such a selective inhibitor, MP-6 (N-methyl-4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzyl)-propyl]pyridinium, Fig. 1) (17Miyoshi H. Inoue M. Okamoto S. Ohshima M. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16176-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the absence of TPB−, this inhibitor showed approximately 50% inhibition at 5 μm in NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase assay, but the inhibition reached a plateau at this level over a wide range of concentrations. Weak inhibition was again observed above ∼80 μm, and maximum inhibition (>90%) was obtained only when the concentration of the inhibitor was increased to ∼250 μm. Such a marked biphasic nature of the does-response curve has not been reported previously for usual complex I inhibitors. On the other hand, almost complete inhibition was readily obtained at low concentrations of MP-6 (<10 μm) in the presence of 2 μm TPB−. The site that is readily blocked by low concentrations of MP-6 without TPB− would be the hydrophilic binding site. Thus, MP-6 is a fairly selective inhibitor of one of the two proposed binding sites and could be a useful probe to examine the mechanism of the terminal electron transfer step of complex I. This inhibitor is, however, not completely selective in the strict sense because it elicits complete inhibition at high concentrations without TPB−, as mentioned above. Therefore, highly selective pyridinium-type inhibitors superior to MP-6 are required. Among the 19 cationic inhibitors synthesized previously (17Miyoshi H. Inoue M. Okamoto S. Ohshima M. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16176-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), only MP-6 exhibited such a unique inhibitory behavior, suggesting that some specific structural feature(s) of this compound would be responsible for its behavior. Elucidation of such structural features is essential to develop further selective inhibitors. In the present study, we systematically modified the structure of the lead compound MP-6 (Fig. 1) and investigated the effects of structural modifications on its inhibitory behavior. On the basis of the structural information, we synthesized a selective inhibitor superior to MP-6. Characterization of the inhibitory behavior of the new inhibitor provides further evidence for the dual binding sites model. Q1 was a generous gift from Eisai Co. (Tokyo, Japan).

All synthetic compounds were characterized by1H NMR spectroscopy (Bruker ARX-300) and elemental analyses for carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, within an error of ± 0.3%.N-Methylation (or N-ethylation) of the compounds was carried out by the previously reported method (17Miyoshi H. Inoue M. Okamoto S. Ohshima M. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16176-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The previous synthetic method for MP-6 (17Miyoshi H. Inoue M. Okamoto S. Ohshima M. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16176-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was not suitable for preparation of a variety of derivatives because of low reaction yield and limits of structural variations of starting materials. We therefore synthesized MP-6 by a new method as follows (Method 1 in Fig. 2). To a mixture of tert-butylbenzene (16 g, 0.12 mol) andn-propionyl chloride (9.3 g, 0.1 mol), was added aluminum chloride (14.7 g, 0.11 mol) slowly at 0 °C. After stirring at room temperature for 3 h, the mixture was poured into ice water and extracted with ether, washed with 1 n HCl, 1 nNaOH, and brine, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:20) to give 4-propionyl-tert-butylbenzene in a 47% yield. To a solution of lithium diisopropylamide in THF, was added 4-propionyl-tert-butylbenzene (7.7 g, 40.5 mmol) slowly at −78 °C and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. After adding 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (4.4 g, 41 mmol) dropwise, the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, ether was added, and the organic phase was washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:1) to give 4-[1-hydroxy-2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propyl]pyridine in a 90% yield. To a solution of 4-[1-hydroxy-2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propyl]pyridine (3.3 g, 11.1 mmol) and triethylamine (2.5 g, 24.7 mmol) in 30 ml of THF, methanesulfonyl chloride (1.4 g, 12.2 mmol) was added slowly at 0 °C. After stirring at 0 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was extracted with ether, washed with saturated Na2CO3 and brine, then dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The residue 4-[1-methanesulfonyloxy-2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propyl]pyridine was used directly in the next step. 4-[1-Methanesulfonyloxy-2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propyl]pyridine was dissolved in 20 ml of pyridine and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight. The mixture was evaporated and then the residue was extracted with ether, washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 3:7) to give 4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propenyl]pyridine in a 93% yield. To a solution of 4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propenyl]pyridine (1.0 g, 3.6 mmol) in 10 ml of ethanol, Pd/C (0.1 g, 10% w/w) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred under H2, until TLC analysis failed to reveal the presence of the precursor. Pd/C was removed by celite filtration, and the solvent was evaporated. Purification by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 3:7) gave 4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propyl]pyridine in a 89% yield. To a solution of 4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)propyl]pyridine (0.8 g, 2.8 mmol) in 8 ml of ethylene glycol, hydrazine monohydrate (0.42 g, 8.4 mmol) and KOH were added (0.55 g, 8.4 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 150 °C for 5 h. The mixture was extracted with ether, washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:4) to give 4-[2-(p-tert-butylbenzyl)propyl]pyridine in a 66% yield.

MP-16 was prepared by reduction of 4-[(2-carboxy-3-p-tert-butylphenyl)propyl]pyridine with LiAlH4 in THF. 4-[(2-Carboxy-3-p-tert-butylphenyl)propyl]pyridine was prepared by decarboxylation of 4-[(2,2-diethoxycarbonyl-3-p-tert-butylphenyl)propyl]pyridine, which was obtained by reacting 4-[(2,2-diethoxycarbonyl)ethyl]pyridine andp-tert-butylbenzylbromide in the presence of NaH in THF at 0 °C. 4-[(2,2-Diethoxycarbonyl)ethyl]pyridine was prepared by reducing 4-[(2,2-diethoxycarbonyl)vinyl]pyridine, which was synthesized by reacting 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and diethylmalonate in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine at 100 °C, with 10% Pd/C in ethanol under hydrogen gas at room temperature.

Bovine heart submitochondrial particles were prepared by the method of Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (19Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11424-11427PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.4) at −78 °C. NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase activity was measured as the rate of NADH oxidation with a Shimadzu UV-3000 at 340 nm (ε = 6.2 mm−1cm−1). The reaction medium contained 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCN, 0.4 μm antimycin A, and the final mitochondrial protein concentration was 30 μg/ml. The reaction was started by adding 50 μm NADH after submitochondrial particles were incubated with inhibitor for 4 min at 30 °C. Q1 (50 μm) was used as an electron acceptor since this substrate is the best electron acceptor, yielding high reaction rate with linear kinetics (20Estornell E. Fato R. Pallotti F. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, the concentration of TPB− was set at 2 μm throughout the present study since the inhibition by TPB− itself was not negligible above this concentration. The experimental conditions for investigation of the effects of incubation temperature or incubation time on the inhibition by MP-24 are described in the figure legends. Ferricyanide and dichloroindophenol reduction by complex I was assayed at 420–500 and 600 nm, respectively, under the same experimental conditions. When ferricyanide (1 mm) or dichloroindophenol (50 μm) was used as an electron acceptor, the concentration of NADH was set at 150 or 50 μm, respectively. The I75/I25 ratio was used as an index of the biphasic nature of the titration curve (TableI), wherein the I75 and I25 were the molar concentrations to give 75 and 25% inhibition of the control NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase activitywithout TPB−, respectively. The I50values, i.e. the molar concentrations which gave 50% inhibition with 2 μm TPB−, are also listed in Table I to compare the inhibitory potencies when complete inhibition was achieved with the aid of TPB−.Table ISummary of the inhibition of complex I activity by pyridinium- and quinolinium-type inhibitorsCompoundsI25I75I75/I25I50(with 2 μm TPB−)μmμmMP-60.831722070.33MP-111.585570.35MP-121.11531390.38MP-130.808.3100.29MP-143.12991.6MP-151.326200.85MP-165.53979.4MP-170.9318190.82MP-1818175101.5MP-193.4250741.1MP-202.02031020.61MP-210.80921150.25MP-220.41711730.16MP-230.612203600.28MQ-200.160.9260.22MQ-210.172.5150.52MQ-220.7015211.0MP-240.58>400>6900.30MP-252.129141.1MP-260.671021520.34MP-270.441753980.92MP-289.51952115The I75 and I25 are the molar concentrations which gave 75 and 25% inhibition of the control NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase activity without TPB−, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The I75 and I25 are the molar concentrations which gave 75 and 25% inhibition of the control NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase activity without TPB−, respectively. The I50 value, which is the molar concentration to give 50% inhibition, was obtained with 2 μm TPB−. The values are averages from at least two independent measurements. The dose-response curve of MP-6 (without TPB−) for the inhibition of NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase activity is shown in Fig. 3 (open squares) as a reference. Transformation of a tert-butyl group attached to the benzene ring of MP-6 to an n-butyl group (MP-11,closed circles) or a sec-butyl group (MP-12,closed squares) resulted in reduction of the biphasic nature of the dose-response curve. In particular, saturation of the inhibition by the two derivatives was less clear than that by MP-6. Considering that the hydrophobicities of these three derivatives are almost identical, these findings indicate that a bulky and rigidtert-butyl group of MP-6 is important for the selective inhibition. In the presence of 2 μm TPB−, these three derivatives exhibited similar inhibitory potencies, as shown in the inset in Fig. 3. Complete inhibition was readily attained at concentrations less than 10 μmirrespective of different substituents. The presence of TPB− makes the selective inhibition by pyridinium-type inhibitors ambiguous probably by facilitating inhibitor passage through the hydrophobic barrier to the remaining (i.e. hydrophobic) site (6Gluck M.R. Krueger M.J. Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Nicklas W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3167-3174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dose-response curve of the N-ethyl derivative (MP-13) showed no marked biphasic nature, although its inhibitory potency was almost identical to that of MP-6. This result indicates that a methyl group attached to the pyridine nitrogen atom is critical for the selective inhibition. In addition, the observation that the dose-response curves of MP-14 and MP-15 were much less biphasic than that of MP-6 indicates that the para-substitution pattern at the pyridine ring is also important. Deletion of a branched methyl group in the spacer moiety linking the pyridine and benzene rings (MP-17) and transformation of the methyl to hydroxymethyl (MP-16) results in loss of the biphasic nature of the dose-response curve. These findings demonstrate that the branched methyl group is also an essential structural factor. 2It is necessary to consider the effects of the configuration of the methyl group on the activity since MP-6 is a racemic mixture. However, we did not stereoselectively prepareR and S isomers of MP-6 since th"

The cytoplasmic C terminus of this protein contains three protein sorting motifs which are related to the function of E3-13.7. In this study, the structure of a 23-residue polypeptide corresponding to this domain was examined using solution NMR and CD spectroscopic methods. The peptide was observed to exist in a mostly random structural state in aqueous solution but underwent high affinity association with dodecylphosphocholine micelles, where it adopted an ordered structure. The affinity of this peptide for the micellar surface and the structure of the bound peptide were independent of pH variation, surface charge, or attachment of a myristoyl anchor to the N-terminal. Studies with phospholipid vesicles suggested that the micellar structural results can be extrapolated to a true lipid bilayer. On the micellar surface all three sorting motifs are closely associated with the water/apolar interface: 72-YLRH and 87-LL lie within interfacial amphipathic helices, while 76-HPQY is non-helical and dimples just above the surface. These results contribute to the development of an understanding of the basis for specificity in recognition of sorting motifs by components of the cellular protein trafficking machinery.

A 13.7-kDa protein expressed from the “Early 3” genome region of adenovirus (E3-13.7) down-regulates the EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; E3-13.7, adenoviral E3-13.7 protein; E3-CyD, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of E3-13.7; E3-mCyD, myristoylated C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of E3-13.7; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; CD, circular dichroism; AP1 and AP2, clathrin adaptins; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DQF-COSY, double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. and related tyrosine kinase receptors during infection of epithelial cells and fibroblasts (1Hoffman P.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For EGFR it has been shown that E3-13.7 exerts its role by altering sorting at the endosomal level (3Hoffman P. Carlin C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3696-3706Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) such that the ratio of receptor destined for lysosomal degradation relative to receptor destined for recycling to the plasma membrane surface is increased. The down-regulatory action of E3-13.7 is believed to be associated with the constitutive recycling pathway of EGFR and does not require ligand stimulation of the receptor to be operative. An enhanced understanding of the down-regulatory mechanism of E3-13.7 is desirable because of light it will shed both upon the cell biology of protein trafficking pathways and upon the molecular biology of adenoviral infections. As outlined in Fig. 1, E3-13.7 is an integral membrane protein comprised of an N-terminal transmembrane helix followed by an extracellular/lumenal loop, a second transmembrane segment, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (1Hoffman P. Yaffe M.B. Hoffman B.L. Yei S. Wold W.S. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13480-13487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the process by which E3-13.7 down-regulates tyrosine kinase receptors is incompletely understood, it is known that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (E3-CyD) is critical to its function. Within this 23-residue domain there are three different sequence motifs (Fig. 1) known to be broadly relevant to the cellular trafficking of membrane proteins via clathrin-mediated internalization pathways (4Kirchhausen T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 182-188Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell.

One of these is the “di-leucine” (87-LL) motif (Refs. 7Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.-P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol.

While a functional role for this motif in E3-13.7 has yet to be established, it is of probable significance because it and adjacent residues (LLRIL) are also present in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain of EGFR where it has been shown to be critical to proper sorting of the receptor. 2S.-J. Kil and C. Carlin, unpublished results. The other two motifs present in the E3-CyD represent the tyrosine-based motifs YXXZ and NPXY (i.e. 72-YLRH and 76-HPQY), where Z is a large hydrophobic amino acid andX is any residue. These motifs are also critical to the internalization and intracellular trafficking of a variety of other membrane proteins and are known to be associated with clathrin adaptin recognition and binding (reviewed in Refs. 8Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar and 10Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell.

Carlin, submitted for publication. have established that mutation of either tyrosine to alanine in E3-13.7 leads to a loss of EGFR down-regulatory activity in adenovirus-infected cells. They have also shown that the 72-YLRH motif is required for high affinity binding of the adaptin AP-2 by the E3-CyD in vitro while both tyrosine motifs are critical for binding by AP-1. In this paper, the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of E3-13.7 is examined. Its structure is of relevance both because of specific insight it may provide into the mode of receptor down-regulatory action by E3-CyD and thereby into mechanisms of endosomal receptor sorting. More generally, structural information for E3-CyD may shed light upon the general mechanisms by which sorting motifs are recognized by components of cellular protein trafficking networks. While sorting motifs have previously been subjected to structural characterization (12Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the present study extends previous work in two crucial aspects. First, because the E3-CyD contains three different sorting motifs within a fairly short sequential span, this study will provide insight into the structural consequences of sorting signal multimerization. Clustering of signals is relevant to E3-13.7 function3 and has been observed to be important in the sorting of other proteins (7Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.-P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Arneson L.S. Miller J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Second, most previous studies have focused on the structures of motif-containing polypeptides in aqueous solution. However, since sorting motifs are often found in sequentially juxtamembrane domains (as for E3-13.7) we considered the possibility that membrane interactions might sometimes play an important role in defining the local structure of a motif-containing segment. The cytoplasmic domain of E3-13.7 was investigated in two forms (Fig. 1): (i) an N-acetylated 23-residue peptide which will be referred to as E3-CyD (E3 Cytoplasmic Domain). (ii) An N-myristoylated 25-residue peptide, referred to as E3-mCyD, where the myristoyl tail serves (ideally) as a surrogate transmembrane domain. In this paper we describe structural studies of these two peptides in both aqueous solution and in aqueous detergent micelles. Micelles were used to model biological membranes. The detergent used in most of our studies was dodecylphosphocholine (DPC, see Ref. 19Lauterwein J. Bosch C. Brown L.R. Wuthrich K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 556: 244-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). DPC has the same zwitterionic phosphocholine head group as the dominant phospholipid species of most eukaryotic membranes, phosphatidylcholine (20Gennis R. Biomembranes, Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 533Google Scholar). DPC micelles have also been recently demonstrated to provide a favorable balance between desirable NMR properties and biochemical compatibility with membrane proteins, properties which are often at odds with each other (21Vinogradova O. Sonnichsen F. Sanders C.R. J. Biomol. NMR,. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The two peptides illustrated in Fig. 1were obtained from Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc. (Boston, MA). Both peptides were specified to be >95% pure according to the company documentation, but we found that the myristoylated peptide, E3-mCyD required further purification. This was accomplished by size-exclusion chromatography using Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad) and water with 20% isopropyl alcohol and 0.5% formic acid as an eluant. E3-CyD powder was dissolved either in an aqueous buffer or was premixed with detergents DPC and/or SDS in perdeuterated form from Cambridge Isotopes Lab (Andover, MA). E3-mCyD peptide had a high tendency to aggregate in water and required sonication to be dissolved in the presence of micelles. Standard sample preparations contained 3 mm E3-CyD in (85% H2O, 15% D2O) 50 mm buffers (sodium acetate, pH 4.5, or sodium phosphate, pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. For micellar samples the following concentrations of detergent were used: 50–60 mmDPC for E3-CyD and 150–400 mm for E3-mCyD (plus 10 mol % of SDS in some cases). Bilayer-containing samples were prepared by mixing the peptides with 50-nm unilamellar POPC vesicles which were formed by repeatedly forcing aqueous POPC dispersions through 50-nm nylon filters using a LIPOSOFAST extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, ON). NMR experiments were carried out using a Varian UNITY-Plus 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with Varian 5-mm1H/X and 1H/13C/15N indirect z axis pulsed field gradient probes. For most of the samples, the following experiments were executed: one-dimensional1H temperature-variation, DQF-COSY (double-quantum-filtered) (22Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), TOCSY (23Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and NOESY (using pulsed field gradients for water suppression) (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). The TOCSY mixing time was 60–70 ms. Several NOESY mixing times were used for micellar samples: 80, 200, and 300 ms, while for detergent-free samples a single NOESY mixing time of 200 ms was used. Translational diffusion coefficients were measured using the water-suppressed longitudinal eddy-current delay pulse sequence as described by Altieri et al.(25Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The method of Kim and Prestegard (26Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Res. 1989; 84: 9-13Google Scholar) was utilized which allows accurate calculation of scalar coupling from measurement of separations of extrema in dispersive and absorptive plots of rows through cross-peaks. This method is effective in analyzing spectra with moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, traces through the antiphase DQF-COSY cross-peaks were deconvoluted with two antiphase Lorentzian resonances using VNMR. Coupling constants derived by these two methods were compared and only values which were determined to be in agreement were accepted. The NMR-based method used in this work to determine the partition coefficient of the peptides in micelles is similar to that described elsewhere (27Gao X. Wong T.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1871-1888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Stilbs P. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982; 87: 385-394Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 29Soderman O.

Colloid Polymer Sci. 1986; 264: 77-84Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the present case, a pulsed field gradient longitudinal eddy-current delay experiment was used instead of the stimulated spin-echo experiment. CD spectra were acquired using a Jasco-600 spectrometer. Samples for far-UV studies were prepared by dissolving about 0.5 mg/ml peptides powder in 0–320 mmdodecylphosphocholine (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) in buffer. The exact concentration was determined by measuring the solution absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 2840 [m−1 cm−1] for both peptides. Quartz cuvettes with a light path-length of 1 mm were used. The parameters employed were: bandwidth = 1 nm; sensitivity = 50 mDeg; time constant = 0.5 s. Spectra acquired represented an average of 4 scans. Reference spectra, obtained with the samples containing all components except the peptide, were recorded before each spectrum and subtracted from the peptide spectrum during acquisition. All spectra were recorded in mDegree units. The instrument was routinely calibrated with an standard solution of recrystallized (1R)-(−)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, ammonium salt at 290 nm (θ = 7910). The structures of E3-CyD and E3-mCyD were examined in aqueous solution and in aqueous micelles. Measurements were made at both pH 4.5 and 7.5 for two reasons. First, this allowed data to be taken at pH above and below the pKa of the histidine side chains present in both tyrosine sorting motifs, thereby allowing us to investigate whether the structure of E3-CyD is sensitive to the state of protonation of these residues. Second, while studies at the higher pH might be more physiologically relevant, it is much easier to extract structurally useful NMR data at mildly acidic pH where all amide protons can be directly observed due to depressed rates of chemical exchange with water protons. Total backbone1H NMR resonance assignments were made for E3-CyD in water at 4, 15, and 25 °C at pH 4.5 and 4 °C for pH 7.6. One-dimensional proton and CD spectra were routinely used as qualitative structural indicators while NOE and J-coupling measurements were used as a source of more quantitative structural data. It was observed that E3-CyD in water at 25 °C is mostly unstructured at both acidic and neutral pH. Only by lowering the temperature to 4 °C at pH 4.5 were we able to detect some residual α-helical/turn structure as reflected by dNN(i, i+1) cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2 A) and negative intensity at 220 nm in the CD spectrum (Fig. 3 A). Even in this case, the helical content appears to be minimal. Few intermediate and no long-range NOEs were observed. Moreover, while strong sequential dαN(i, i+1) connectivities were present there was a lack of deviations by chemical shifts from their random-coil values for CαH or NH resonances (“fingerprint region” Fig. 4 A). VicinalJNα coupling constants fell mostly inside the range typical for extended random coil conformations. Taken together, these results indicate the lack of a defined conformation for this peptide in water under any conditions examined.Figure 3Circular dichroism spectra of E3-CyD and E3-mCyD in various solutions. A, E3-CyD at 4 °C in water and micelles (10 mm DPC); B, E3-mCyD at 25 °C in micelles (80 mm DPC). The peptide concentration in each case was 0.5 mg/ml.

A-C represent the fingerprint region showing amide-α-proton cross-peaks. D illustrates amide-amide cross-peaks, which are characteristic of α-helical conformation. The pH 4.5 buffer was 50 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The pH 7.6 buffer was 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When E3-CyD was dissolved in DPC micelles it showed a major change in its conformational state. Chemical shifts were much more dispersed and a dramatic increase in line widths was observed relative to the peptide in solution at the corresponding temperatures (Fig. 5). The amide proton frequency of Arg1 is shifted about 0.8 ppm downfield while amide proton frequencies of several of the C-terminal residues (Arg21, Ile22, and Leu23) shifted about 0.5 ppm upfield. CD data show pronounced α-helical character at both acidic and neutral pH (Fig. 3 A). Increasing the DPC concentration from 10 to 320 mm did not result in changes in the CD spectra (data not shown), indicating that in this range both the percentage of peptide associated with micelles and the structure of the bound peptide are independent of the peptide:micelle ratio. Diffusion coefficients were measured which established that E3-CyD is tightly bound to DPC micelles in the 4–40 °C range and at both acidic and neutral pH (Table I). The partition coefficients determined for the peptide under various conditions were in all cases >500 (Table I). This result indicates that the transmembrane domain of the E3-13.7 is not necessary for tight association of the cytoplasmic domain of E3-13.7 with a membrane surface. However, in order to test whether a transmembrane anchor may play an important role in defining the conformation of the surface-associated C-terminal domain, we examined anN-myristoylated form of the peptide (E3-mCyD,Fig. 1).Table IDiffusion and partition coefficients of E3-CyD in DPC micellesTemperatureE3-CyD in water (pH 7.6, 100 mmNaCl)E3-CyD in micelles (60 mm DPC, 100 mm NaCl) pH 7.6E3-CyD in micelles (60 mm DPC, 100 mm NaCl) pH 4.5Dr(×10−7cm2/s)aDiffusion coefficient of the free polypeptide.DobsbObserved diffusion coefficient for the polypeptide (×10−7 cm2/s).DmiccCorrected (see Ref. 27) diffusion coefficient of the DPC micelles (×10−7 cm2/s).BoundPartition coefficientDobsDmicBoundPartition coefficient° C%%419.3 ± 10%5.8 ± 20%4.7 ± 7%≥93≥5204.9 ± 11%4.4 ± 10%≥97≥11702525.8 ± 10%9.7 ± 18%9.3 ± 4%≥98≥16709.7 ± 5%9.1 ± 5%≥97≥12604035.8 ± 10%13.5 ± 10%13.9 ± 4%≥98≥175014.1 ± 7%13.6 ± 4%≥98≥1760a Diffusion coefficient of the free polypeptide.b Observed diffusion coefficient for the polypeptide (×10−7 cm2/s).c Corrected (see Ref. 27Gao X.

Open table in a new tab The E3-mCyD peptide was not water soluble. Even in micelles, it had a high tendency to aggregate, as exhibited by appreciable line-broadening. Addition of negatively charged detergents (up to 10 mol % SDS) to mimic the net negative charge present in most biological membranes did not have much affect on the spectrum. CD spectra of the myristoylated peptide were very similar to that of E3-CyD in micelles at both pH values (Fig. 3 B) and the distribution of chemical shifts in its 1H NMR spectrum was very similar to that of E3-CyD under similar conditions (not shown). These results indicate that E3-mCyD adopts a similar surface-associated structure as E3-CyD and that the membrane-associated structure of the cytoplasmic domain of E3–13.7 can be independent of an N-terminal membrane anchor. We also examined the question of whether E3-CyD binds to a “real” lipid bilayer with the same high affinity as DPC micelles and whether it adopts the same structure in both systems. We therefore examined the NMR spectrum of E3-CyD when mixed with unilamellar POPC vesicles in the liquid crystalline phase. POPC is a major component of eukaryotic membranes and vesicles comprised of this phospholipid are often used to mimic biological bilayers (20Gennis R. Biomembranes, Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 533Google Scholar). The NMR spectra of E3-CyD in POPC vesicles are similar to spectra of the peptide in micelles but with much larger line widths in the former case (data not shown). The breadth of the lines prohibits detailed structural characterization in vesicles, but the general similarity of the one-dimensional spectra confirms that the peptide does indeed have a high affinity for actual lipid bilayers and strongly suggests that its structural state in bilayers is similar to its structure in micelles. The results of this section established that E3-CyD binds with high affinity to DPC micelles in a manner which appears to be similar to its interaction with bilayers and which is independent of the presence of either an N-terminal membrane “anchor” or of a net negative charge in the interface. We therefore proceeded to a detailed structural characterization of E3-CyD in DPC micelles. Some general structural information can be gleaned from temperature-induced changes in the amide-aromatic region of one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of micellar E3-CyD (Fig. 5). At 4 °C the spectrum is extremely broad and more highly dispersed than in the absence of detergent. When the temperature of the micellar sample is increased, peaks become sharper and less dispersed, suggestive of a loss of structural order. Some peaks undergo more changes than others in terms of both line width and chemical shift. For example, aromatic peaks of Tyr4 at 4 °C are much broader and upfield-shifted than at 40 °C, while resonances from Tyr11 are narrow at both temperatures and exhibit no changes in chemical shift. The same is true to a lesser extent for His7 as compared with His8. This suggests that in the ordered (low temperature) structural state Tyr4 and His7 side chains are inserted into the interface while Tyr11 and His8 can undergo less restricted motion in the aqueous domain of the interface. Diffusion measurements indicated that both ordered and disordered states represent E3-CyD bound to the micelle surface. CD spectra indicated that there is little change in helicity over the range of 4–40° (data not shown), suggesting that the two states may actually be conformationally similar, but have different modes of membrane interaction. The experiments described above indicate that what is observed spectroscopically for micellar E3-CyD at all temperatures is the average of two populations (ordered and disordered) in fast exchange. Unfortunately, the sample in which the ordered form is most highly populated (at 4 °C) cannot be readily accessed by two-dimensional NMR experiments due to extensive line broadening. Even at higher temperatures only modest DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra were obtained, with some spin systems missing and some peak intensities low due to line broadening. As a result, it was not possible to assign all side chain protons. The presence of two populations in fast exchange also made it hard to quantify NOE data for the ordered state and only a few3 JNα coupling constants could be unambiguously measured. Nevertheless, backbone assignments were made at 40 °C at both pH values and, while quantitative structure calculations were unfeasible, it was possible to determine a semiquantitative structural model for the ordered form of the peptide based upon these data. Fig. 2 B summarizes NOE and J-coupling data obtained for E3-CyD in DPC at 40 °C and acidic pH from two-dimensional NMR experiments. There are a number of intermediate-range NOEs representing the ordered population, typical for α-helical like structure between residues 1–6 and 17–21 (dαN(i, i+3), dNN(i, i+2), dNN(i, i+1)). The deviation of α-proton chemical shifts (δHα) from their random coil values and measured vicinal JNα couplings are consistent with modeling these regions as α-helical. This indicates that 11 of 23 residues are α-helical, in good agreement with the 4 °C CD data (Fig. 3 A) estimate of about 40%. The following NOEs were also observed: Pro9δδ′-His8 NH, Pro9δδ′-Gln10 NH, Pro9ββ′-Tyr11 NH, Pro9ββ′-Gln10 NH, and Pro9ββ′-Gln10 side chain NH2. These are indicative of a loop or β-turn involving residues His8-Tyr11. Furthermore, His7 and His8 exhibit amide-water exchange peaks, indicating that they are water accessible. Measurements at 25 °C yielded data which generally confirmed the structural conclusions gleaned from the 40 °C data although spectral quality at 25 °C was not as high as at 40 °C. An additional source of information on the structure of the bound peptide is differential broadening of resonances from various peaks seen in the DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra. Even at 40 °C, some side chain peaks (such as those from Ile2, Asp13, Ile16, and Thr15) are so broad that they cannot be observed, while others (Ala3, Tyr4, Ala17, and Asp18) are clearly more broad than others. The most probable explanation is that the side chains of these residues are imbedded in the micellar interface resulting in shorter transverse relaxation times due to restrained local motion. Increasing the pH to 7.6 did not significantly change the pattern of the NOESY fingerprint region (Fig. 4, B and C). However, some amide proton frequencies shifted at residues (in decreasing order) Thr15, Ile16, Arg14, Gln10, Ala17, Leu19, and His8 without dramatic changes of intermediate-range NOE pattern. The major difference in the NOE pattern (data not shown) was a reduction in intensity of NN-cross-peaks for Arg6-His7, Leu20-Arg21, and Asp18-Arg21, suggestive of a population decrease for the ordered state versus the disordered one. This conclusion is supported by the CD spectrum showing a lower helical population at the higher pH. These results suggest that changing the pH does not change the overall structure of the peptide, but rather changes the stability of the ordered conformation. Additional insight into the probable mode of the peptide-surface interaction was provided by mapping the distribution of the hydrophobicity in the helical segments. We examined helical wheel diagrams of E3-CyD to identify possible amphipathic helixes in the peptide which would be likely sites of insertion into the micellar interface. These diagrams (not shown) indicated that regions 1–7 and 17–21 are certainly amphipathic if helical. The residues comprising the hydrophobic faces of these helices correspond to the side chain resonances which exhibited the most broad NMR resonances (above section). Based upon the data presented under “Results,” a model can be constructed for E3-CyD incorporated in DPC micelles. Key components of this model are as follows and represented pictorially in Fig. 6. 1) Residues 1–7 adopt a helical conformation, with Ile2, Ala3, and Leu5 constituting the hydrophobic face imbedded into the micellar interface. 2) Residues 8–11 form a β-turn or loop facing aqueous solution. 3) Residues 12–16 may in"

https://openalex.org/W2157419558,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 and the adenoviral 12 S E1A oncoprotein are both known to elicit their biological effects mainly by regulating the transcription of important cellular genes. The human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene is a transcriptional target of both p53 and E1A. We have analyzed the effects of p53 and 12 S E1A, separately as well as together, on PCNA gene transcription. Our results showed that whereas both p53 and 12 S E1A separately activated PCNA transcription, 12 S E1A repressed p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, 12 S E1A uses a dual strategy of transcriptional activation and repression to take control of the cellular PCNA gene regulation. The cyclic AMP-response element in the PCNA core promoter, besides being crucial for basal transcription, synergizes with p53 to activate transcription. The cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) is an essential component of both the transcriptional activation and repression by E1A. Our data demonstrate for the first time that E1A can modulate CBP function to activate PCNA transcription, while at the same time repressing p53-mediated activation by disrupting CBP interaction with p53, thereby uncoupling PCNA transcription from the regulatory effects of p53."

Significant protein cross-linking was not detected in the absence of DNA. In all four α/β-type SASP examined, the amino donor in the EDC induced amide cross-links was the α-amino group of the protein.

In SASP-A and SASP-C ofBacillus megaterium two conserved glutamate residues, which form part of the germination protease recognition sequence, were involved in cross-link formation. In SspC from Bacillus subtilis and Bce1 from Bacillus cereus the acidic residues involved in cross-link formation were not in the protease recognition sequence, but at a site closer to the N terminus of the proteins. These data indicate that, although there are likely to be subtle structural differences between different α/β-type SASP, the N-terminal regions of these proteins are involved in protein-protein interactions while in the DNA bound state.

These proteins are encoded by four to seven monocistronic genes in each species, and their amino acid sequences are highly conserved both within and betweenBacillus species (1Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The α/β-type SASP are nonspecific DNA-binding proteins which are synthesized only within the forespore compartment during sporulation (3Mason J.M. Hackett R.H. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Sun D. Stragier P. Setlow P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Typically, two major α/β-type SASP accumulate to high levels within the spore, while the minor α/β-type SASP are found at much lower levels. The level of total α/β-type SASP in spores is sufficient to saturate the spore chromosome, and the binding of these proteins to spore DNA is the major determinant of spore resistance to UV radiation and a significant determinant of spore heat resistance (1Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis spores which lack the two major α/β-type SASP (α and β) are much more sensitive to UV radiation and heat than are wild type spores (5Mason J.M. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 174-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the first few minutes of spore germination, α/β-type SASP are quickly degraded by a sequence-specific protease termed germination protease (GPR) (1Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Structural studies of purified α/β-type SASP and α/β-type SASP·DNA complexes have shown that significant changes in these proteins' structure occur upon binding to DNA, as α/β-type SASP are predominantly unfolded in solution but acquire significant α-helical content upon binding to DNA 2S. C. Mohr and P. Setlow, unpublished results. (6Rao H. Mohr S.C. Fairhead H. Setlow P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The α/β-type SASP cover 4–6 base pairs of DNA, and binding of these proteins to DNA is highly cooperative, particularly to DNAs bound with low affinity. (7Nicholson W.L. Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of α/β-type SASP·DNA complexes indicate that the protein forms a helical coat along the DNA (8Griffith J. Makhov A. Santiago-Lara L. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are extensive interactions between α/β-type SASP when bound to DNA, although these proteins are monomers in solution 3B. Setlow and P. Setlow, unpublished results. (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is possible that interactions between adjacent α/β-type SASP along the DNA backbone may be important for the α/β-type SASP/DNA binding interaction. To determine which regions of the proteins are involved in interactions between α/β-type SASP bound to DNA, we have performed protein cross-linking studies with the zero-length cross-linking reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). We have identified EDC-catalyzed protein cross-links in four different α/β-type SASP from Bacillus species, and the identification of these cross-links has yielded new insights into the interaction of α/β-type SASP on DNA.

TheBacillus strains used were Bacillus cereus T (originally obtained from H. O. Halvorson) and Bacillus megaterium QMB1551, ATCC no. 12872 (originally obtained from H. Levinson). E. coli strains were routinely grown in 2× YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter) at 37 °C with shaking. For the overexpression of cloned genes encoding α/β-type SASP, the medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (JM107) or 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose (BL21).B. megaterium was sporulated at 30 °C in supplemented nutrient broth, and spores were harvested and cleaned as described previously (12Setlow P. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed to polymerase chain reaction amplify a 512-base pair fragment containing the gene encoding Bce1 (13Loshon C.A. Fliss E.R. Setlow B. Foerster H.F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 168-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from B. cereus genomic DNA; the amplified fragment contained the gene's ribosome binding site and transcription terminator (13Loshon C.A. Fliss E.R. Setlow B. Foerster H.F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 168-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 168-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each contained BamHI restriction sites and 5′-flanking sequences (underlined residues) for cloning purposes. The BamHI-digested polymerase chain reaction product was agarose gel-purified and ligated intoBamHIdigested plasmid pET3 (11Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4831) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pPS2532 in which BclI digestion confirmed that the gene encoding Bce1 was under the control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid pPS2532 was used to transform E. coli strain DE3(BL21) to ampicillin resistance. The E10K mutant form of Bce1 was generated with the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH according to manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylated primers complementary, except for designed mismatches (underlined bases), to the unique AlwNI restriction site of pET3 (5′-CCTGTTACTAGTGGATGCTGC) and the Gly6–Gly15 coding region of the gene encoding Bce1 (5′-GGAAGTCGTAATAAAGTATTAGTTCGAGGC) (13Loshon C.A. Fliss E.R. Setlow B. Foerster H.F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 168-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used with plasmid pPS2532 as a template to synthesize a mutagenized plasmid lacking the AlwNI site, and with a lysine codon replacing the codon for glutamate 10 of bce1. The mutagenized plasmid was digested with AlwNI prior to transformation into the mismatch repair deficient E. coli strain (mutS::Tn10, Tetr) supplied with the mutagenesis kit. Mutagenized plasmid was enriched by plasmid isolation, digestion with AlwNI and retransformation intoE. coli strain JM83. One clone was isolated and the identity of the mutagenized plasmid, termed pPS2734, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. SspC and SASP-C were overexpressed in E. coli strain JM107 from pDG148 derived plasmids containing the α/β-type SASP genes under control of an isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside inducible promoter as described previously (14Setlow B. Hand A.R. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stragier P. Bonamy C. Karmazyn-Campelli C. Cell. 1988; 52: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Bce1 and Bce1E10K were overexpressed in E. coli strain DE3(BL21) from plasmids pPS2532 and pPS2734, respectively. SspC, Bce1, and Bce1E10Kwere extracted from dry ruptured E. coli cells with 3% acetic acid/30 mm HCl as described previously (16Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 178: 6020-6027Crossref Google Scholar). SASP-C and SASP-A were extracted with 3% acetic acid (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from dry rupturedE. coli cells and dry ruptured spores of B. megaterium strain QMB1551, respectively. All α/β-type SASP were purified as described previously (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α/β-Type SASP (0.5 mg/ml) with or without cesium chloride gradient-purified,EcoRI-linearized pUC19 plasmid DNA (100 μg/ml) were incubated in 1 ml of 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 24 °C for 20 min prior to addition of EDC to 25 mm. The 5:1 (w/w) ratio of protein to DNA is sufficient to saturate the DNA with α/β-type SASP, although SASP-A binds more weakly than do the other α/β-type SASP tested (17Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, approximately 50% of the α/β-type SASP are bound to the DNA. The cross-linking reactions were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C, followed by dialysis in Spectrapor 3 tubing against 1 liter of 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 18 h. Dialyzed cross-linking reactions were frozen, lyophilized, dissolved in sample buffer and run on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (18Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and monomeric and cross-linked proteins were excised with a clean razor blade. Proteins were electroeluted from polyacrylamide gel slices into 50 mmNH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS using ElutrapTMseparation chambers (Schleicher & Schuell). Gel purified proteins were frozen, lyophilized, dissolved in 100 μl of MilliQ-H2O, and precipitated with 800 μl of cold acetone. Precipitated proteins were washed with 500 μl of cold acetone and dissolved in freshly prepared 8 m urea prior to trypsin digestion. EDC-treated proteins (∼20–40 μg) were digested with trypsin (Worthington, 5 μg) in 100 μl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3, 10 mm CaCl2, 1.2 m urea at 37 °C for 15–18 h. Tryptic digests were run on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters 680 gradient controller, two Waters 501 pumps, a Waters U6K injector, and a Vydac protein C4 column (3.9 × 150 mm). Tryptic digests were loaded onto the reverse phase column in 100% buffer A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by 5 min of washing with 100% buffer A. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a discontinuous linear gradient as follows: 5–30 min, 0–30% buffer B (0.052% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile); 30–50 min, 30–40% buffer B; 50–70 min, 40–100% buffer B. Peptides were detected by their UV absorption at 214 nm with a Waters 481 spectrophotometer, and fractions containing peptides were collected with an Isco 2150 peak separator and an Isco Foxy fraction collector. Molecular masses of HPLC-purified peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Perseptive Biosystems Linear MALDI-TOF instrument. External calibration consisting of two standards (angiotensin, 1297.5 Da; and ACTH(18–39), 2466.7 Da) was used for all determinations, resulting in ±0.15% mass accuracy. Peptides from HPLC fractions (1 μl, ∼1–10 pmol/μl) were mixed and dried on the instrument stage with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile. Amino acid analysis was conducted as described previously (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were determined with an ABI model 492A Procise automated protein sequencer. In an effort to identify the interacting regions of α/β-type SASP bound to DNA, we decided to use protein cross-linking to trap interacting amino acid residues for subsequent biochemical analysis. Most α/β-type SASP do not contain cysteine residues (1Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and therefore several protein cross-linking reagents which rely upon thiol chemistry could not be used for this study. The α/β-type SASP are small proteins (6–7.6 kDa) which are monomeric in solution3 (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and appear to interact with one another only when bound to DNA. We were interested in regions of close contact between α/β-type SASP and therefore decided to use cross-linking reagents with short- or zero-length linker arms. EDC, a water-soluble carbodiimide, gave efficient cross-linking of α/β-type SASP only in the presence of DNA (see below). Consequently, we chose this reagent for further work. Protein cross-linking with EDC usually involves the formation of an amide bond between either an N-terminal α-amino or lysine ε-amino group and the carboxyl side chain of aspartate/glutamate residues. Therefore, in contrast to cross-linkers that contain flexible linker arms several angstroms in length, EDC induced cross-links should occur only between residues that are in very close proximity to one another. The proteins chosen for this study were SASP-A and SASP-C from B. megaterium, SspC from B. subtilis, and Bce1 fromB. cereus (Fig. 1). Most of the variability between these proteins occurs near the N termini which vary both in length and amino acid sequence (Fig. 1) (1Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). All α/β-type SASP lack the N-terminal methionine residue which is the only residue that is removed post-translationally (Fig. 1) (1Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). SASP-A and SASP-C are major α/β-type SASP in spores, whereas SspC and Bce1 are minor proteins. For all four proteins little or no protein-protein cross-linking was detected in the absence of added DNA, while significant protein-protein cross-linking was detected in reactions containing α/β-type SASP and DNA (Fig. 2, and data not shown). The extent of protein-protein cross-link formation and the number of higher order oligomers formed varied for each protein tested (Fig. 2). By overloading polyacrylamide gels, decamers could be easily detected in cross-linking reactions with Bce1 and DNA, whereas only small amounts of trimer were detected in reactions with SASP-A and DNA (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The efficiency of protein cross-linking corresponded roughly to the affinity of each protein for linear plasmid DNA (Bce1 > SspC ≈ SASP-C > SASP-A) as determined by DNase protection assays (17Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown), although the observed cross-linking efficiency of SASP-A was lower than expected.Figure 2EDC cross-linking of α/β-type SASP is DNA-dependent. Protein (0.5 mg/ml) with or without linear plasmid DNA (100 μg/ml) was reacted with 25 mm EDC for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by dialysis against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were lyophilized, dissolved in sample buffer, and run on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (16.7% acrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Numbers on the left marginindicate the positions of molecular mass markers in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The DNA dependence of cross-link formation between α/β-type SASP suggested that the EDC-generated protein-protein cross-links are formed only between α/β-type SASP that are adjacent to one another on the DNA backbone. These in vitro experiments used only a single α/β-type SASP. However, there are multiple α/β-type SASP in spores, with two proteins present at high levels. Consequently, an obvious question is whether the different α/β-type SASP interact when bound to DNA. To obtain data pertinent to this question we analyzed protein-protein cross-link formation in reactions with two different α/β-type SASP bound to DNA. SASP-A and SASP-C fromB. megaterium were chosen for the initial hetero-cross-linking experiments because they are the two major α/β-type SASP found in spores of B. megaterium (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins also differ sufficiently in molecular mass (SASP-A = 6,260.1 Da and SASP-C = 7,423.3 Da) to allow resolution of the three possible dimeric forms by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic analysis of cross-linking reactions containing SASP-A, SASP-C, and DNA revealed the presence of a new predominant band that migrated at the position expected for a SASP-A/SASP-C heterodimer (Fig. 3, lane A + C), and this band is indeed a SASP-A/SASP-C heterodimer (see below). Titration experiments demonstrated that the ratio of SASP-A to SASP-C that produces the most heterodimer is ∼3:1 (w/w) (data not shown). This latter ratio approximates the relative levels of these two proteins inB. megaterium spores (9Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterodimers were also formed between SASP-A and SspC from B. subtilis (data not shown). However, in contrast to the SASP-A/SASP-C cross-linking reaction in which the SASP-A/SASP-C heterodimer was the predominant cross-linked product (Fig. 3), SASP-A/SspC heterodimer formation was much less efficient than formation of the SspC homodimer in these reactions (data not shown). Since SspC and SASP-C have similar affinities for linear plasmid DNA in solution, the difference in their formation of heterodimers with SASP-A is presumably due to differences in the amino acid sequences of SspC and SASP-C. There is presently very little detailed structural information available on α/β-type SASP or the complex they form with DNA. Therefore, identification of the amino acid residues involved in EDC-dependent cross-link formation was undertaken to determine which regions of α/β-type SASP are involved in protein-protein interactions that occur in the DNA bound state. Purified monomeric and oligomeric α/β-type SASP from EDC cross-linking reactions were digested with trypsin and the products resolved by reverse phase-HPLC. Two types of differences should be detected between the HPLC tryptic maps of dimeric (or oligomeric) and monomeric (but EDC treated) α/β-type SASP. First, the digests of α/β-type SASP dimers should show decreases (∼50%) in the relative yield of some peptide(s) as compared with the monomer, because amino acid residues within this peptide(s) will be in a cross-linked peptide in the dimer. Second, there should be a new peptide peak(s) in HPLC tryptic maps of α/β-type SASP dimers, which should be the peptide containing the cross-link. Detailed analyses, including mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis and amino acid sequencing of the latter peptides should then allow both the unambiguous identification of the peptides in the cross-link, as well as the specific amino acid residues involved. Intramolecular cross-links could also be formed by EDC, as α/β-type SASP go from an unfolded to a more ordered structure on binding to DNA. Intramolecular cross-links could be found within both monomeric and oligomeric proteins, and this modification could be detected by comparing HPLC tryptic maps of EDC treated monomers and untreated protein. However, we never saw evidence for intramolecular cross-link formation in these analyses (data not shown). HPLC analysis identified two unique, closely eluting peptides in the tryptic digest of dimeric SASP-A (Fig. 4 B, peptides labeled1 and 2) which were not present in the digest of the SASP-A monomer (Fig. 4 A). A substantial reduction in the amount of one peptide was also noted in the digest of dimeric SASP-A when compared with that of monomeric SASP-A (Fig. 4 B, peptide labeled 3). No other significant differences were observed between digests of the monomeric and dimeric species. Because the relative amounts of all other peptides appeared to be approximately the same between digests of monomeric and dimeric SASP-A, these data suggested that the cross-link occurred between an amino acid residue in peptide 3 and a residue within a small peptide which has very little UV absorbance. The tryptic digests of the SASP-C monomer and dimer exhibited differences that were very similar to those seen with SASP-A (data not shown). HPLC analysis of the tryptic digest of the SASP-A/SASP-C heterodimer also identified two unique peptides which were not present in digests of SASP-A or SASP-C monomers (data not shown). Both of these unique peptides from the SASP-A/SASP-C heterodimer had HPLC retention times that differed from those of the putative cross-linked peptides identified from the SASP-A and SASP-C homodimers (data not shown). Only two additional significant tryptic peptides were detected in the Bce1 dimer that were not present in the Bce1 monomer (Fig. 5, A and B). One of these peptides (Fig. 5 B, peptide labeled with anasterisk) was an oxidized form of Bce1 tryptic peptide Lys55–Arg66 which contained a methionine sulfoxide residue (data not shown). The other unique peptide, presumably the cross-linked peptide, eluted early in the HPLC gradient (Fig. 5 B, peptide labeled 1). No obvious reduction in the level of any major peptide peak was observed when the HPLC profile of the tryptic digest of monomeric Bce1 was compared with that of dimeric Bce1, suggesting that the cross-link occurred between amino acid residues from two small tryptic peptides. In contrast to SASP-A, SASP-C, and Bce1, analysis of the tryptic digest of the SspC dimer identified only one unique peptide in comparison to the digest of the SspC monomer (data not shown). However, as was found with SASP-A and SASP-C, the amount of one major peptide was decreased significantly in the digest of the SspC dimer as compared with the digest of the monomer (data not shown). Presumably this large peptide is involved in cross-link formation with a rather small peptide. The relatively high efficiency of SspC and Bce1 cross-linking (Fig. 2) also allowed the purification and analysis of cross-linked trimeric and tetrameric species of these proteins. The HPLC profiles of the tryptic digests of the trimeric and tetrameric species of both SspC and Bce1 were essentially identical to the tryptic map of the dimeric forms, with the exception of greater reductions in the larger peptide partner in the cross-link in the higher oligomers of SspC (data not shown). These data suggest that identical EDC catalyzed cross-links occur between each protein in higher oligomers of cross-linked α/β-type SASP. Various types of information were used to determine the amino acid residues involved in cross-link formation in the different α/β-type SASP. For SASP-A, SASP-C, and SspC, mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis identified the large peptides whose level was decreased in tryptic digests of the dimeric species as Tyr20–Arg37, Phe29–Arg46, and Ser8–Lys27, respectively. This identified one probable partner in the major cross-link formed in these three proteins. Determination of the mass of each peptide tentatively identified as a cross-linked species from tryptic digests of both homo- and heterodimers (Table I), as well as amino acid analyses (data not shown) allowed assignment of the two tryptic peptides in the various cross-links. In all cases, the site of cross-linking was tentatively identified as between the α-amino group of the protein and an acidic group on a separate tryptic peptide. The peptides in the two new peaks from tryptic digests of cross-linked dimers of either SASP-A or SASP-C had virtually identical observed molecular masses (Table I), suggesting that each peak contained the same two tryptic peptides linked together, but cross-linked at a different site. Analyses of the two unique peptides isolated from the tryptic digest of the SASP-A/SASP-C heterodimer predicted that the cross-links were between the α-amino group of one protein and a tryptic peptide in the other protein (Table I).Table IMass determination of cross-linked peptides by MALDI-MSPeptideObserved MassPredicted peptideCalculated average massaAverage masses were determined using MS Digest on the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Home Page; http://www.rafael.ucsf.edu.SASP-A-1bCross-linked peptides are labeled (1) and (2) according to the order of their elution during reverse-phase HPLC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, and data not shown).2452.8Ala1–Lys5× Tyr20–Arg372454.7SASP-A-2bCross-linked peptides are labeled (1) and (2) according to the order of their elution during reverse-phase HPLC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, and data not shown).2453.8Ala1–Lys5 × Tyr20–Arg372454.7SASP-C-1bCross-linked peptides are labeled (1) and (2) according to the order of their elution during reverse-phase HPLC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, and data not shown).2914.6Ala1–Arg9 × Phe29–Arg462915.2SASP-C-2bCross-linked peptides are labeled (1) and (2) according to the order of their elution during reverse-phase HPLC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, and data not shown).2914.3Ala1–Arg9 × Phe29–Arg462915.2Bce1–1913.8Gly1–Lys2 × Asn9–Arg14915.2SspC2745.1Ala1–Arg5 × Ser8–Lys272744.0SASP-A/C-1bCross-linked peptides are labeled (1) and (2) according to the order of their elution during reverse-phase HPLC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, and data not shown).2944.6Ala1–Arg9 × Tyr20–Arg372945.2SASP-A/C-2bCross-linked peptides are labeled (1) and (2) according to the order of their elution during reverse-phase HPLC (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, and data not shown).2423.8Ala1–Lys5 × Phe29–Arg462424.7Mass spectrometry was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a Average masses were determined using MS Digest on the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Home Page; http://www.rafael.ucsf.edu.b Cross-linked peptides are labeled (1Setlow P.
