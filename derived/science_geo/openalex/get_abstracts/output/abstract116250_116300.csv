https://openalex.org/W2100522747,"About 90 percent of human pancreatic carcinomas show allelic loss at chromosome 18q. To identify candidate tumor suppressor genes on 18q, a panel of pancreatic carcinomas were analyzed for convergent sites of homozygous deletion. Twenty-five of 84 tumors had homozygous deletions at 18q21.1, a site that excludes DCC (a candidate suppressor gene for colorectal cancer) and includes DPC4, a gene similar in sequence to a Drosophila melanogaster gene (Mad) implicated in a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-like signaling pathway. Potentially inactivating mutations in DPC4 were identified in six of 27 pancreatic carcinomas that did not have homozygous deletions at 18q21.1. These results identify DPC4 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation may play a role in pancreatic and possibly other human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2112249032,"An optimal immune response should differentiate between harmful and innocuous antigens. Primitive systems of innate immunity, such as the complement system, may play a role in this distinction. When activated, the C3 component of complement attaches to potential antigens on microorganisms. To determine whether this alters acquired immune recognition, mice were immunized with a recombinant model antigen, hen egg lysozyme (HEL), fused to murine C3d. HEL bearing two and three copies of C3d was 1000- and 10,000-fold more immunogenic, respectively, than HEL alone. Thus, C3d is a molecular adjuvant of innate immunity that profoundly influences an acquired immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2135319033,"beta-Arrestins are proteins that bind phosphorylated heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and contribute to the desensitization of GPCRs by uncoupling the signal transduction process. Resensitization of GPCR responsiveness involves agonist-mediated receptor sequestration. Overexpression of beta-arrestins in human embryonic kidney cells rescued the sequestration of beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) mutants defective in their ability to sequester, an effect enhanced by simultaneous overexpression of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1. Wild-type beta 2AR sequestration was inhibited by the overexpression of two beta-arrestin mutants. These findings suggest that beta-arrestins play an integral role in GPCR internalization and thus serve a dual role in the regulation of GPCR function."
https://openalex.org/W2102433010,"Mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) homolog MEC1/SAD3/ESR1 were identified that could live only if the RAD53/SAD1 checkpoint kinase was overproduced. MEC1 and a structurally related gene, TEL1, have overlapping functions in response to DNA damage and replication blocks that in mutants can be provided by overproduction of RAD53. Both MEC1 and TEL1 were found to control phosphorylation of Rad53p in response to DNA damage. These results indicate that RAD53 is a signal transducer in the DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathways and functions downstream of two members of the ATM lipid kinase family. Because several members of this pathway are conserved among eukaryotes, it is likely that a RAD53-related kinase will function downstream of the human ATM gene product and play an important role in the mammalian response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2124492445,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are bone-derived factors capable of inducing ectopic bone formation. Unlike other BMPs, BMP-1 is not like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but it is the prototype of a family of putative proteases implicated in pattern formation during development in diverse organisms. Although some members of this group, such as Drosophila tolloid (TLD), are postulated to activate TGF-beta-like proteins, actual substrates are unknown. Procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) cleaves the COOH-propeptides of procollagens I, II, and III to yield the major fibrous components of vertebrate extracellular matrix. Here it is shown that BMP-1 and PCP are identical. This demonstration of enzymatic activity for a BMP-1/TLD-like protein links an enzyme involved in matrix deposition to genes involved in pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W2082956732,"In the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy, several physiological indicators of inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus are consistent with an augmented, rather than a diminished, inhibition. In brain slices obtained from epileptic (kindled) rats, the excitatory drive onto inhibitory interneurons was increased and was paralleled by a reduction in the presynaptic autoinhibition of GABA release. This augmented inhibition was sensitive to zinc most likely after a molecular reorganization of GABAA receptor subunits. Consequently, during seizures, inhibition by GABA may be diminished by the zinc released from aberrantly sprouted mossy fiber terminals of granule cells, which are found in many experimental models of epilepsy and in human temporal lobe epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W1994909028,"Exposure of eukaryotic cells to agents that generate DNA damage results in transient arrest of progression through the cell cycle. In fission yeast, the DNA damage checkpoint associated with cell cycle arrest before mitosis requires the protein kinase p56chk1. DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light, gamma radiation, or a DNA-alkylating agent has now been shown to result in phosphorylation of p56chk1. This phosphorylation decreased the mobility of p56chk1 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was abolished by a mutation in the p56chk1 catalytic domain, suggesting that it might represent autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of p56chk1 did not occur when other checkpoint genes were inactive. Thus, p56chk1 appears to function downstream of several of the known Schizosaccharomyces pombe checkpoint gene products, including that encoded by rad3+, a gene with sequence similarity to the ATM gene mutated in patients with ataxia telangiectasia. The phosphorylation of p56chk1 provides an assayable biochemical response to activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the G2 phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2161164474,Small proteins or protein domains generally require disulfide bridges or metal sites for their stabilization. Here it is shown that the beta beta alpha architecture of zinc fingers can be reproduced in a 23-residue polypeptide in the absence of metal ions. The sequence was obtained through an iterative design process. A key feature of the final design is the incorporation of a type II' beta turn to aid in beta-hairpin formation. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis reveals that the alpha helix and beta hairpin are held together by a defined hydrophobic core. The availability of this structural template has implications for the development of functional polypeptides.
https://openalex.org/W2060773435,"The neuromodulator serotonin has widespread effects in the nervous systems of many animals, often influencing aggression and dominance status. In crayfish, the effect of serotonin on the neural circuit for tailflip escape behavior was found to depend on the animal's social experience. Serotonin reversibly enhanced the response to sensory stimuli of the lateral giant (LG) tailflip command neuron in socially dominant crayfish, reversibly inhibited it in subordinate animals, and persistently enhanced it in socially isolated crayfish. Serotonin receptor agonists had opposing effects: A vertebrate serotonin type 1 receptor agonist inhibited the LG neurons in dominant and subordinate crayfish and had no effect in isolates, whereas a vertebrate serotonin type 2 receptor agonist enhanced the LG neurons' responses in all three types of crayfish. The LG neurons appear to have at least two populations of serotonin receptors that differ in efficacy in dominant, subordinate, and socially isolate crayfish."
https://openalex.org/W2086282444,"The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes possesses a chromosomal region, the mga regulon, that contains co-regulated genes important to the virulence of these bacteria. A novel gene located in the mga regulon of a S. pyogenes strain of serotype M1 was cloned and sequenced. It translates into a protein of 305 amino acid residues, including a signal sequence of 32 amino acids and a central region consisting of three tandem repeats. The sequence represents a novel structure with no significant homology to any previously published sequence. The protein was purified from the streptococcal culture media where it is present in substantial amounts. Affinity chromatography of human plasma on Sepharose coupled with the protein specifically adsorbed two plasma proteins which were identified as clusterin and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG). The interactions between the streptococcal protein and the plasma proteins were further characterized using purified clusterin and HRG. Inhibition experiments indicated that they have affinity for overlapping or closely located sites in the streptococcal protein. Both clusterin and HRG are regulators of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9) of complement. When the streptococcal protein was added to serum, complement-mediated lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes and guinea pig erythrocytes was inhibited. In addition, the streptococcal protein was incorporated into C5b-C9 in serum, indicating the location of its action. The name, protein SIC, streptococcal inhibitor of complement-mediated lysis, is therefore suggested for this novel protein. The occurrence of protein SIC and its gene was investigated in a collection of S. pyogenes strains comprising 55 different M serotypes. Only M1 and M57 strains were positive in this screening, indicating that protein SIC could be a virulence determinant. Thus, during recent years, the M1 serotype has been connected with a world-wide increase of severe and toxic S. pyogenes infections.

Thus, during recent years, the M1 serotype has been connected with a world-wide increase of severe and toxic S. pyogenes infections. INTRODUCTIONStreptococcus pyogenes is an important human pathogen causing a number of acute suppurative infections such as erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis, and pharyngitis. These Gram-positive bacteria also cause a serious toxic shock-like syndrome, whereas glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever are serious poststreptococcal sequelae. To elude the host defense and establish an infection, S. pyogenes has developed multiple molecular mechanisms. Some of these are dependent on genes of the mga regulon. The genes of this regulon are under the control of a positive regulator gene, previously called mry (Caparon and Scott, 1987) or virR (Simpson et al., 1990). According to a recent agreement, this regulator should now be called mga, multigene regulator of group A streptococcus.Based on structural variations in the antiphagocytic M protein (for references, see Fischetti(1989) and Kehoe(1994)), S. pyogenes can be divided into more than 80 different serotypes. Since the late 1980s unusually severe S. pyogenes infections have been reported world-wide, infections which have predominantly been associated with the M1 serotype (for references, see Martin and Single (1993) and Musser et al. (1993)). This serotype is also connected with glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. The strain studied here, AP1, is of the M1 serotype. In AP1, the regulatory gene mga is followed by emm1, the gene for M1 protein. Immediately downstream of emm1 is sph (Åkesson et al., 1994), the gene encoding an IgGFc-binding M protein-related molecule called protein H (Gomi et al., 1990; Åkesson et al., 1990). Located adjacent to sph is a previously uncharacterized gene. This gene and its product are the subject of the present report. The data described imply that this extracellular protein, in the following referred to as protein SIC, plays a role in S. pyogenes pathogenicity and virulence through previously unknown molecular mechanisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Bacteriophage, and PlasmidsProtein SIC and the sic gene were isolated from S. pyogenes strain AP1 (40/58) of the M1 serotype from the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Prague, Czech Republic. Forty-eight additional strains of different M serotypes were also obtained from this institute. These strains have been described (Ben Nasr et al., 1995). S. pyogenes strains of serotypes M3, M33, M42, M52, M61, and M67 were kindly provided by Dr. U. Sjöbring, Lund University, and a collection of 35 M1 strains isolated in Sweden 1980-89 were kindly provided by Dr. Stig Holm, Umeå University. One S. pyogenes strain of serotype M1 and two of type M57 were from the late Dr. L. W. Wannamaker. The sic gene was cloned from a λEMBL3 clone described previously (Åkesson et al., 1994). Plasmid vectors pUC18/19 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985) and pK18/19 (Pridmore, 1987) were used in subcloning experiments.

The Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used as host for recombinant plasmids. Streptococci were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract and E. coli in LB broth.Proteins and AntiseraRecombinant M1 protein, protein PAB, and streptococcal cysteine proteinase (SCP) were purified as described previously (Åkesson et al., 1994; de Château and Björck, 1994; Berge and Björck, 1995). Human serum albumin (HSA) was from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody MCaE11 directed against a neoantigen of polymerized C9 within the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement (Mollnes et al., 1985b) was kindly provided by Dr. T. E. Mollnes, The National Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Antisera against purified streptococcal protein SIC and SCP were raised in rabbits. Sheep anti-rat clusterin (polyclonal IgG fraction) cross-reacting with human clusterin was purchased from Quidel (San Diego, CA). Goat antisera against human histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) was a kind gift from Dr. William T. Morgan, University of Missouri, Kansas City, MO. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and donkey anti-sheep IgG (ICN) were used as secondary antibodies.Purification of Protein SICStreptococcal protein SIC was purified by growing AP1 bacteria to midlog phase (A600 = 0.5) and precipitating the culture supernatant with 30% ammonium sulfate. The resulting precipitate was resuspended to 1/100 of the starting volume with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against the same buffer. This material was applied to a Mono Q column on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Using a linear NaCl gradient, a single sharp peak was eluted at 0.3 M NaCl. Corresponding fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia) in PBSA (0.03 M phosphate, 0.12 M NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.2). Fractions containing the suspected protein SIC were pooled, and the identity of the protein was confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing and later by Western blotting using antisera against protein SIC. The yield was 0.5-2 mg of purified protein SIC per liter of culture. Recombinant protein SIC was purified from an E. coli strain JM109 harboring the sic gene in pHD389. The strain was grown to midlog phase at 30°C before inducing protein production by raising the temperature to 40°C for 4 h. The culture supernatant was collected, and purification of protein SIC was performed as described above. In order to examine the presence of protein SIC in other group A streptococcal strains, cultures grown to midlogarithmic phase were precipitated with 30% ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were washed with ice-cold ethanol, dissolved in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum against protein SIC.Purification of Clusterin and HRGFor the purification of clusterin and HRG, citrated fresh human plasma supplemented with 1 mM benzamidine and 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used. Clusterin was purified by a method modified from a previous study (Wilson and Easterbrook-Smith, 1992). Thus, human plasma was differentially precipitated with polyethylene glycol (12-23%, w/v). The precipitate was then passed over an IgG-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with PBSA, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. The material was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and subjected to a Mono Q column. Using a linear NaCl gradient, a protein peak eluted at 0.3 M NaCl was found to contain a single band of 80 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The material gave rise to a single band of 35 kDa when run under reducing conditions in the presence of 5%β-mercaptoethanol. The bands were identified as clusterin in Western blot experiments using anti-clusterin antibodies. HRG was purified using the protocol of Saigo et al.(1989). Briefly, plasma was absorbed with CM-Sephadex (Pharmacia). The matrix was washed extensively with distilled water, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with 0.5 M NH4HCO3. After dialysis against PBS, the material was applied to a HiTrap Heparin column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with PBS, and proteins were eluted with 1.0 M NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column. A linear NaCl gradient was used, and the peak at 0.25 M NaCl was collected. The resulting preparation consisted of two major bands of 70 and 63 kDa when examined by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The identity of the bands with HRG was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-HRG antisera.Polymerase Chain ReactionsPCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). For amplification of the sic gene for cloning, primers S1 and S2 (Fig. 2), corresponding to base pairs (bp) 97-123 and bp 928-905 of the sic sequence (Fig. 1), were used. To investigate the occurrence of sic in other group A streptococcal isolates, PCR was performed with the S1 and S2 primer with an annealing temperature at 20°C below the Tm of the shortest primer (46°C). Templates for the reactions were prepared by resuspending a single bacterial colony in 100 μl of water, vortexing the sample vigorously, and then boiling it for 5 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 5 μl of the resulting supernatant were used in a 50-μl reaction. In order to determine the relationship of sic to other genes of the streptococcal mga regulon, PCRs with two different primer pairs outlined in Fig. 2 were performed. In one reaction, the H1 primer corresponding to the conserved membrane anchoring motif of cell wall proteins of Gram-positive cocci; bp 1357-1381 of the sph sequence (Gomi et al., 1990) and the S2 primer corresponding to the end of the sic sequence were used. In another reaction, the S3 primer corresponding to bp 871-890 of the sic sequence (Fig. 1) and the C1 primer from the signal sequence of the C5a peptidase gene, bp 888-868 in the scpA sequence (Chen and Cleary, 1990), were used. Reactions were performed with AP1 chromosomal DNA as the template.Figure 1:Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the sic gene from S. pyogenes strain AP1. The first 188 nucleotides representing the sequence between the protein H gene (sph) and the sic gene and the first 131 nucleotides of the coding sequence have been published (Gomi et al., 1990). In this work, the sequence from nucleotide 7 in the coding sequence was determined. The start of the signal sequence (Ss), the NH2-terminal short repeat region (SRR), and the tandem repeats R1-R3 are indicated with arrows. The short repeats (I-V) are marked with bars. Possible −35 and −10 promoter sequences and the ribosomal binding site (RBS) are denoted with dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cloning Techniques and Sequence DeterminationThe PCR product amplified for the cloning of the sic gene was generated with primers containing recognition sites for NarI and XbaI. This fragment of 830 bp was purified, digested with NarI and XbaI, and cloned into pHD389 digested with the same enzymes. Standard cloning procedures were used (Sambrook et al., 1989). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega. DNA sequencing was performed with Sequenase (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ordered sets of deletions in template plasmid DNA were prepared using exonuclease Bal31 (Promega). Computer search for sequence homology was made in the GenBank and EMBL data bases. Analysis of sequence data was performed using the GeneWorks program (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA).Electrophoresis and ElectroblottingSDS-PAGE was performed as described (Neville, 1971) using gels of 8% or 12% acrylamide content and 3.3% cross-linking. Before loading, samples were boiled for 3.5 min in an equal volume of buffer containing 2% SDS. Samples run under reducing conditions were boiled in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Western blotting was performed by transferring proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) as described by Towbin et al. (1979). After blocking, membranes were incubated for 1 h with antisera against protein SIC (1:200, v/v), HRG (1:500, v/v), or antibodies toward clusterin (5 μg/ml), followed by a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:1000 v/v). For visualization of bound antibody, membranes were incubated in 0.02% (w/v) 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol, 0.06% (v/v) H2O2 in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0.Affinity ChromatographyIn plasma absorption experiments, citrated fresh human plasma was mixed with the protease inhibitors benzamidine and iodoacetic acid to final concentrations of 5 mM each. 5 ml of undiluted plasma was immediately added to 1 mg of protein SIC coupled to Sepharose. After end to end rotation for 4 h at room temperature, the protein SIC-Sepharose was washed extensively with PBS (200 times the column volume), and the proteins bound to the column were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. As a control, 5 ml of plasma was absorbed simultaneously with glycine-Sepharose. pH was adjusted to 7.5 by adding 1 M Tris, and the eluates were concentrated about 100-fold. Purified radiolabeled clusterin, HRG, or HSA (4 × 105 cpm in 1.0 ml of PBS) were run on columns of Sepharose coupled with protein SIC, M1 protein, or HSA. After washing with PBS, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, and the radioactivity in the fractions was measured in a γ counter.ELISAIndirect ELISA (Engvall and Perlmann, 1971) was performed by coating microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc, Denmark) overnight at 4°C with serial dilutions of protein SIC (starting concentration 2 μg/ml). The plates were washed in PBST and incubated with clusterin (5 μg/ml) or HRG (1.25 μg/ml) diluted in PBST containing 1% gelatin (PBSTG). Bound proteins were detected by purified antibodies to clusterin (10 μg/ml) or antisera against HRG (1:2000, v/v), and binding was visualized by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit or sheep IgG (1:5000, v/v). All incubations were done at 37°C for 1 h and followed by a washing step. Substrate solution, 0.1% (w/v) 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonate), 0.012% (v/v) H2O2 in 100 mM citric acid, 100 mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.5, was added, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was determined after 30 min.A competitive ELISA was performed using the same procedure specified above except for the following: microtiter plates coated with either clusterin (1.5 μg/ml) or HRG (0.5 μg/ml) were incubated with a mixture of protein SIC (2 μg/ml for binding to clusterin; 1 μg/ml for binding to HRG) and serial dilutions of the competitor protein (starting concentration 20 μg/ml). Bound protein SIC was detected by a specific rabbit antisera (1:1000 v/v) followed by a secondary antibody toward rabbit IgG (1:3000 v/v) and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonate)/ H2O2.Binding of protein SIC to C5b-C9 complexes generated in serum was detected with a capture ELISA modified from Mollnes et al. (1985a). Microtiter plates were coated with 1.0 μg/ml MCaE11, a monoclonal antibody against a neoantigen of polymerized C9. Serum diluted 1/50 in PBSTG was added to the wells followed by serial dilutions of protein SIC or SCP (starting concentrations 10 μg/ml), and the plates were incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Diluted serum was also preincubated with protein SIC or SCP at various concentrations for 3 h, after which generation of C5b-C9 complexes was stopped by addition of EDTA at 10 mM. The incubation mixtures were then transferred to antibody-coated microtiter plates for analysis. Detection of protein SIC and SCP was performed as described above using specific rabbit antisera diluted 1/1000.Complement-mediated Hemolytic AssaysHemolytic assays in free solution were performed essentially as reported with target cells added in excess (Nilsson and Nilsson, 1984). Sheep erythrocytes, treated with rabbit antibody (NBL, Stockholm, Sweden) to yield optimally sensitized cells (EA), were used to measure classical pathway function. Assays were performed with Veronal-buffered saline (VBS) containing 0.15 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+. Alternative pathway-mediated hemolysis of guinea pig erythrocytes (GpE) was performed in VBS containing EGTA at a final concentration of 16 mM and Mg2+ at 4 mM. Various quantities of protein SIC were added to human serum diluted to a concentration causing 10% lysis of erythrocytes. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, EA or GpE were added at a concentration of 5 × 109 cells per ml and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding a 15-fold volume of cold VBS containing 10 mM EDTA. After centrifugation, hemolysis was measured as the absorbance of the supernatant at 541 nm. The final human serum dilutions were 1:40 for assays of the classical pathway and 1:20 for the alternative pathway. The serum used was free from antibodies toward protein SIC. Complement-mediated hemolysis in gel was studied according to the procedure described by Truedsson et al. (1981) using EA or GpE in agarose as target cells. 5 μl of undiluted human serum and 1.5 μg (in 5 μl) of protein SIC or protein PAB were applied to adjacent wells in the gels with a distance of 2-4 mm. Additionally, 1.5 μg of bacterial proteins were added after 2, 4, 6, and 8 h of incubation. After incubation of the gels at 4°C for 16 h, lysis was induced at 37°C for 3 h.Other MethodsNH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of proteins electrotransferred to PVDF membranes were performed on an Applied Biosystems 470A gas-liquid solid phase sequenator. Clusterin, HRG, and HSA were labeled with 125I using the Bolton and Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The specific activities were between 3 and 10 μCi per μg of protein.RESULTSSequencing of the sic GeneThe previously reported sequence of the protein H gene (sph) revealed the first 138 bp of an open reading frame 188 bp downstream of the stop codon for sph (Gomi et al., 1990). To determine the structure of this possible downstream gene, a phage clone, λ1:4 (Åkesson et al., 1994), harboring both the M1 gene (emm1) and sph was employed for subcloning. A 2.2-kbp SspI/EcoRI fragment of λ1:4 that contained the open reading frame except for the first six nucleotides was cloned into the vector pUC19. Sequencing of this subclone revealed that the entire open reading frame was 915 bp encoding a putative amino acid sequence of 305 residues (Fig. 1). The first 32 amino acid residues represents a typical bacterial signal sequence including a positively charged NH2-terminal region, a hydrophobic core, and a polar cleavage region. The predicted mature protein has 273 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 30.677 kDa. The most characteristic feature of the sequence is a central repeat region consisting of three tandem repeats of 29, 29, and 21 amino acid residues each (R1-R3), showing 90-95% internal homology. The sequence preceding the R repeats also contains repeats although these are only five or nine amino acids long. In Fig. 1, five different repeats in this short repeat region (SRR) are indicated. They appear only twice each, and, except for repeat IV, they are not in tandem. Instead, some of the repeats are overlapping. The sequence located COOH-terminal of the R repeats is characterized by a high proline content, and, in a short stretch (residue 200-220), the prolines are evenly spaced every third or fourth residue. Computer-assisted analysis of the sequence predicted the protein to be highly hydrophilic with a pI of 4.2. A thorough search of the data bases with the entire sequence, or fragments of the sequence including all kinds of repeats, did not reveal any obvious homology either at the nucleotide or the amino acid level.Location of sic in the mga Regulon of AP1A further mapping of sic in the mga regulon of the AP1 strain was accomplished by PCR of chromosomal DNA with two sets of primers (Fig. 2). A reaction with the H1 primer corresponding to the sequence of M-like genes encoding the consensus membrane-anchoring motif (Fischetti et al., 1990) and the S2 primer corresponding to the 3′ end of sic generated a fragment of 1.2 kbp. This confirms the intergenic distance of 188 bp between sph and sic as determined by sequencing. The PCR performed with the S3 primer from the 3′ end of sic and the C1 primer corresponding to a part of the signal sequence of the C5a peptidase gene (scpA) generated a 2.2-kbp product. These experiments demonstrate that sic is located 188 bp downstream of sph and approximately 2.1 kbp upstream of scpA (Fig. 2).Cloning and Expression of Protein SIC in E. coli and Purification of the Protein from Streptococcal Culture MediumOligonucleotides were constructed from the sic sequence to generate a PCR fragment corresponding to the mature protein. This fragment was amplified and cloned into the inducible expression vector pHD389. After growing the clone and inducing expression, a periplasmic lysate was examined by SDS-PAGE which showed the overexpression of a 34-kDa protein as compared to the host E. coli strain. Even higher amounts of the 34-kDa product were detected when analyzing the culture medium after precipitation with 80% ammonium sulfate. The protein was purified using precipitation of the culture medium with 30% ammonium sulfate, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration (Fig. 3B). The purified product was seen as a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the yield was about 5 mg of purified protein per liter of culture.Figure 3:SDS-PAGE analysis of protein SIC after consecutive purification steps. The purification of the wild-type protein SIC from S. pyogenes is shown in A, and the purification of the recombinant protein from E. coli is shown in B. The material in lanes 1 was precipitated from culture medium with 80% ammonium sulfate followed by precipitation with 30% ammonium sulfate (lanes 2).

Consequently, a purification scheme similar to that used for the recombinant protein was applied to the culture medium of streptococcal AP1 bacteria, and a protein with identical migration on SDS-PAGE was obtained (Fig. 3A). The estimated amount of protein SIC in a 1-liter culture was 10-15 mg from which 1-2 mg of purified protein was obtained. NH2-terminal amino acid analysis of the protein showed that the first five amino acids (ETYTS) were identical with the start of the mature protein as indicated by the nucleotide sequence. Thus, the gene product of sic was shown to be expressed by the AP1 strain as an extracellular protein.Absorption of Plasma Proteins with Immobilized Protein SICBeing a secreted product, protein SIC is most likely active outside the bacterial cell. On the streptococcal chromosome, the sic gene is found in a regulon encoding proteins which interact with host molecules, particularly plasma proteins. In order to examine if protein SIC also has affinity for plasma proteins, the molecule was coupled to Sepharose and used to absorb human plasma. After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the protein SIC-Sepharose were eluted with glycine buffer, pH 2.0. The eluted material was lyophilized, resuspended in PBS at 50 times the concentration, and examined on SDS-PAGE. As seen in Fig. 4, two additional bands appeared as compared to the background pattern obtained after absorption with glycine-Sepharose. The bands were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane, excised from the membrane, and subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. The band of 80 kDa (labeled I in Fig. 4) showed the presence of two residues in equimolar yields after each sequencing cycle. The two sequences (DQTVSDNELQ and SLMPFSPYEP) were identical with the NH2-terminal sequences of the α and β chains of the plasma protein clusterin (Jenne and Tschopp, 1989; Kirszbaum et al., 1989). The band of 70 kDa (labeled II in Fig. 4) had the sequence VSPTDCSAVE, identifying the protein as HRG (Koide et al., 1986). Plasma absorption experiments were performed with recombinant or streptococcal protein SIC coupled to Sepharose, and the same results were obtained.Figure 4:SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins eluted from protein SIC-Sepharose after plasma absorption.

Firstly, clusterin and HRG were purified from human plasma. The observations made with human plasma were then re-examined by affinity chromatography of radiolabeled clusterin and HRG on protein SIC-Sepharose. About 30% of the 125I-clusterin and about 60% of the 125I-HRG were retained after chromatography on a protein SIC-Sepharose column. In contrast, less than 5% of iodine-labeled albumin was eluted from the column (Fig. 5). Additionally, less than 5% of 125I-clusterin or 125I-HRG was bound to columns of M1 protein or HSA-Sepharose (data not shown). The interactions were also tested by indirect ELISA in which the binding of clusterin or HRG to protein SIC was shown to be"

https://openalex.org/W1968530627,"The mouse Zic gene, which encodes a zinc finger protein, is expressed in the developing or matured central nervous system in a highly restricted manner. We identified two novel Zic-related genes (Zic2, Zic3) through genomic and cDNA cloning. Both genes are highly similar to Zic(1), especially in their zinc finger motif. A comparison of genomic organization among the three Zic genes showed that they share common exon-intron boundaries and belong to the same gene family. Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 were determined to mouse chromosome 9, 14, and X using an interspecific backcross panel. Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection showed that Zic2 and Zic3 are expressed in a restricted manner in the cerebellum at the adult stage. However, the temporal profile of the mRNA expression in the developing cerebella differ in the three Zic genes. Furthermore, we found that the Drosophila pair-rule gene, odd-paired is highly homologous to the Zic gene family. The similarity was not only the zinc finger motif, but also the exon-intron boundary was the same as those of mouse Zic gene family.

These findings suggest that the Zic gene family and Drosophila odd-paired are derived from a common ancestral gene. A molecular analysis of the early development of Drosophila elucidated the basic molecular mechanisms that establish the regional specification of the developing organism (Ingham, 1988). A parallel attempt has been made to understand developmental mechanisms of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). 1The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemPCRpolymerase chain reaction. The Drosophila genes involved in the generation of anterior-posterior differences have vertebrate homologues that appear to have developmental roles in the CNS. Several gene families that control the regionalization of the mammalian CNS have been isolated (Rubenstein et al., 1994). Often, structurally related genes that belong to the same gene family control the coordinated process of CNS development. central nervous system polymerase chain reaction. The Zic protein (Aruga et al., 1994) is a zinc finger protein with a molecular mass of 48 kilodaltons. The expression of Zic is restricted to the dorsal region of the neural tube at a specific embryonic stage, whereas in the adult, it is restricted to the cerebellar granule cells and neurons of a few other nuclei (Zic, zinc finger protein of the cerebellum). We speculate that the Zic gene is involved in regional specification and cell lineage determination based upon its expression profile. In this study, we searched structurally Zic-related genes and identified novel genes (Zic2 and Zic3) that were highly homologous to the Zic gene. Their predicted amino acid sequences and genomic organization suggest that they belong to the same class of gene family. The chromosomal locations of Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 were determined by means of an interspecific backcross panel. The expression was largely restricted to the cerebellum in adults. Furthermore, we found homology between the Zic gene family and odd-paired, a Drosophila pair-rule segmentation gene (Benedyk et al., 1994). odd-paired is a gene required for the timely activation of engrailed and wingless in Drosophila embryos. Genomic clones of Zic1 were isolated from a BALB/c mouse genomic library (LI016, distributed by a Japanese Cancer Resource Bank) using the mouse Zic cDNA fragment (Aruga et al., 1994). Low stringency hybridization proceeded using a 129/Sv mouse genomic library (a gift from Dr. K. Yamamura, Kumamoto University) using a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment from pGSTzic-ZF (Aruga et al., 1994). We characterized the clones with the same restriction fragments according to genomic Southern blot analysis (data not shown). The hybridization conditions were 5 × SSPE, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon testis DNA, 2 × 105 cpm/ml radioactive probes incubated at 50°C for 18 h. Membranes were sequentially washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42, 56, and 65°C. The second intron of Drosophila odd-paired was isolated by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primer pair: 5′-CACGTCCACACGTCGGA-3′ and 5′-TCGCTGTCGTAGCCGTG-3′ based on the sequence of the second and third exons (Benedyk et al., 1994), respectively. The genomic DNA prepared from Drosophila melanogaster, Canton S, was used as a template. The cDNA clones were isolated from cDNA libraries generated from mice cerebella (Furuichi et al., 1989) or mice embryos (12 days postcoitum). 2T. Saito and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished results. Screening and sequencing analyses proceeded as described (Aruga et al., 1994). The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper appears in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank nucleotide sequence data bases with the following accession numbers, D70848 and D70849. The three Zic genes were mapped in a panel of an interspecific backcross of (C57BL/6Ros (B) × Mus spretus (S))F1 × M. spretus (BSS) that was characterized for the segregation of more than 500 loci including centromeric heterochromatin (Hayashizaki et al., 1994). Variations in Zic genes were identified between the progenitor strains using PCR and sequencing gel or single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (Mashiyama et al., 1990). For these analyses, 50 ng of genomic DNA from the backcross panel was amplified with three sets of primers 5′-ATAAGTGTGAGGTGACTCCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGACTCTGCCCTACAGTAC-3′ (which amplify part of intron 2 of Zic1 gene), 3J. Aruga and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished results. 5′-GGTGGATAGAAGTTTGTCCAT-3′ and 5′-AAACCATTTTCTTCCACATTACT-3′ (which amplify 2220 to 2380 (D70848) in the 3′-untranslated region of the Zic2 gene), 5′-AAATTATGGCAGGATGCATG-3′ and 5′-CCATGAGAAGCACTGTTCAA-3′ (which amplify 3124 to 3283 (D70849) in the 3′-untranslated region of the Zic3 gene). PCR proceeded in the buffer described by Mashiyama et al. (1990), except for the presence of 29.6 MBq/ml [α32P]dCTP instead of 5′ end-labeled primers. PCR consisted of 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 55.5°C (Zic1), or 58°C (Zic2 and Zic3) for 80 s and 72°C for 120 s. The PCR products were denatured at 80°C for 5 min in a formamide dye mixture and resolved by electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gel (for Zic2 and Zic3) or 5% acrylamide gel (N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide to acrylamide ratio of 1:49) containing 45 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA at room temperature (for Zic1). A total of more than 55 backcross progeny was scored as either BS-, B-, or SS- (S-) type indicating the segregation of B and S alleles from the F1 parent. The distribution of the segregation among the progeny was compared with the established genetic map from this cross using Map Manager (Manly and Elliott, 1991). The chromosomal location of Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 loci were integrated into a 2 × 2 panel of a BSS backcross to minimize recombination frequency (Hayashizaki et al., 1994). RNA was isolated from various organs of ICR mice (purchased from Nihon SLC) as described (Aruga et al., 1994). Northern blots were performed as described (Aruga et al., 1994). Genomic fragments containing the first exon without zinc finger domains were used as the probes. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (1989) with a slight modification. Briefly, the 2824 to 3349 region of Zic3 gene (D70849), which corresponds to the 3′-untranslated region, were subcloned into the Bluescript vector (Stratagene). Sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. The hybridized RNA-RNA duplexes were digested in 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 2 μg/ml RNase T1, 40 μg/ml RNase A at 17°C for 40 min. The digested materials were digested with proteinase K, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated before electrophoresis on a sequencing gel. Both analyses used 20 μg of total RNA. To test whether or not there are genes structurally related to Zic in the mouse genome, we performed a series of Southern blots using various regions of Zic cDNA (Aruga et al., 1994) (data not shown). Several bands were detected with probes containing the segments coding the zinc finger motif. When a mouse genomic library was screened with this probe at low stringency, we obtained several positive clones. These positive clones were classified into five types of Zic-related genes including Zic itself (hereafter, Zic is referred to as Zic1). Of these, we examined the expression in various organs of mice at various developmental stages and confirmed the expression of two genes. The cDNAs of two novel genes designated as Zic2 and Zic3 (Fig. 1) were isolated from the cDNA library prepared from mouse cerebella or embryos, and the nucleotides were sequenced. Zic2 and Zic3 proteins had a calculated molecular mass of 55.3 and 50.6 kilodaltons. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 (Figure 1:, Figure 2:) revealed that there are several similar regions in the three genes. The conserved regions are located in a linear fashion. The most extensive homology was found in the zinc finger domain (97% between Zic1 and Zic2, 91% between Zic1 and Zic3 and 91% Zic2 and Zic3 over 158 amino acids). We found that Zic1 bound to DNA probes containing the 5′-GACAACAAAC-3′ sequence recognized by GLI protein (Aruga et al., 1994). The high similarity in the zinc finger domain suggests that Zic2 and Zic3 bind similar sequences. There was also similarity in the three regions including the amino and carboxyl termini (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). The overall homologies between the proteins are 64% (between Zic1 and Zic2), 64% (between Zic1 and Zic3), and 59% (between Zic2 and Zic3). Except for the zinc finger domain, the amino acid compositions were similar to that of the Zic1 protein. There were some polyalanine and polyhistidine sequences. The carboxyl-terminal flanking the zinc finger motif is enriched with serine/threonine residues. Zic2 is relatively large because of the insertion of extra sequences in the serine-rich region (Aruga et al., 1994). In addition to the Zic2 and Zic3, we isolated Zic1 genomic clones. All three genes were composed of three exons, containing the zinc finger domain. The third exon contains large 3′-untranslated regions. The nucleotide sequences of the two introns adjoining the splice junctions are consistent with the recognized consensus sequence GT/AG (Fig. 2D). The exon-intron boundaries are conserved in homologous sites in the zinc finger motif. Thus, it seems likely that these three genes are derived from a common ancestral gene. To determine the chromosomal locations of the mouse Zic genes, we analyzed the segregation of the gene by means of a BSS-Ros interspecific backcross. Differences in the length of the PCR products or in single strand conformation polymorphism analysis were used to segregate the alleles from C57BL/6Ros or M. spretus. The segregation of these differences was determined in progeny of this cross (Fig. 3, A and B). A comparison of the segregation of Zic1, -2, and -3 with characterized loci (Hayashizaki et al., 1994) revealed a close linkage between Zic1 and D9Ncvs13 (3/56 recombinants), D9Ncvs15 (2/56 recombinants), Zic2 and D14Ncvs12, D14Ncvs59 (both 0/55 recombinants), Zic3 and DXNcvs1, Hprt (both 1/55 recombinants) (Fig. 3, A and B). The gene orders shown in Fig. 3C were indicated from the minimization of recombinations. Thus, the Zic1, -2, and -3 genes are located in mouse chromosomes 9, 14, and X, respectively. In the regions where the Zic1 and Zic3 genes were mapped, there are some mutations that result in abnormal behavior. ducky (Snell, 1955) which causes abnormal behavior and histologically severe dysgenesis of hindbrain and spinal cord, as well as myelin deficiency, is located near the position of Zic1 and trembly which causes tremors and seizures in hemizygous males (Taylor et al., 1978) is 1 centimorgan proximal to the Hprt gene, at the position of Zic3 gene. We do not, however, have any concrete data linking these genes. We found by means of Southern blotting that Zic1 has at least one homologous gene in various species including fish, amphibians, reptiles, and avians (Aruga et al., 1994). Correspondingly, we isolated Zic-related cDNAs from various species. 4J. Aruga, N. Yokota, K. Nakata, N. Fujimoto, and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished results. It is likely that the Zic-opa gene family is phylogenically conserved. The Zic1 gene was originally identified and characterized as being expressed in regions of cerebellar granule cell lineage in a highly restricted manner (Aruga et al., 1994). The Zic1 gene was most homologous with the Caenorhabditis elegans sex-determining gene, tra-1 (Zarkower and Hodgkin, 1992) Drosophila ciD (Orenic et al., 1990) and human GLI (Kinzler et al., 1988). However, a homology search against the most recent version of the data base showed that there was significantly higher homology with the Drosophila pair-rule gene, odd-paired (opa) (Benedyk et al., 1994) (Fig. 2, C and D). The homology was high throughout the zinc finger region (80% identity over 169 amino acids between Zic1 and Opa protein) (Fig. 2B). The most notable similarity in the two proteins was found between the two cysteine residues of the first zinc finger. They are present only in Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 and Opa in the known zinc finger proteins. Outside the zinc finger region, there were some short stretches of similar amino acid residues in the amino and carboxyl termini (Fig. 2, B and C). The amino acid composition is also similar among the three Zic and Opa proteins. The amino-terminal region is alanine-rich, while the carboxyl-terminal region is serine-rich. We compared the genomic organization of the three Zic genes and that of opa. The positions of introns in the three Zic genes were conserved in the opa gene (Fig. 2D). The genomic organization of opa, which is composed of three exons with a relatively long first intron (Benedyk et al., 1994), was also similar to that of Zic gene family. These similarities in the genomic organization suggest that the mouse Zic genes and Drosophila opa are derived from a common ancestral gene. The homology between the Zic-opa and GLI-ciD gene family is significantly high in their zinc finger domain. However, we consider that the Zic-opa gene family belongs to another subclass of zinc finger proteins for the following reasons. The exon-intron organization of the Zic-opa gene family is different from that of GLI (-ciD-tra1) gene family (Ruppert et al., 1988; 1990; Hui et al., 1994). The similarity in the non-zinc finger region in GLI, GLI2, GLI3, and CiD is not conserved in Zic1, Zic2, Zic3, and Opa, and vice versa. Drosophila opa is a pair-rule gene, which is essential for the parasegmental subdivision of the Drosophila embryo; opa mRNA and protein are found throughout all segment primordia. It appeared that Opa does not act in a spatially restricted manner. However, the expression of Zic1 is a highly restricted in the adult mouse CNS, although the mRNA was found in a broad domain, namely, a large area of the alar plate of entire neural tube and the surrounding mesenchyme at specific embryonic stages (Aruga et al., 1994). There is apparent similarity in their expression during development. We showed that Zic1 is expressed in the adult mouse cerebellum in a highly restricted manner (Aruga et al., 1994). To examine the expression of Zic2 and Zic3 in the CNS, we performed Northern blots and ribonuclease protection analyses. In the various organs from adult mice, Zic2 mRNA was detected only in the cerebellum as a single band of 3.5 kilobases (Fig. 4A). Zic3 mRNA was detected in the cerebellum and faintly present in the olfactory bulb according to the ribonuclease protection assay. There seemed to be less Zic3 mRNA than that of Zic1 and Zic2 as more time was required to visualize the Zic3 mRNA (3.5 kilobases) by autoradiography (Fig. 4B) after Northern blotting. The tissue distribution of Zic1 mRNA (Aruga et al., 1994) is similar to that of Zic3, whereas Zic2 is unique in that it was detected only in the cerebellum even after a longer exposure (data not shown). We examined the mRNA levels in younger mice because Zic1 is expressed in the developing neural tissue at days postcoitus. The developmental profile in the whole brain (fore-, mid-, hindbrain) showed that throughout the embryonic days 12 to 18, the mRNA levels seemed to be relatively constant. The high level of mRNA in embryonic day 12 observed using the Zic1 probe (Aruga et al., 1994) was not found with Zic2 or Zic3. In the postnatal developing cerebella (Fig. 4D), the profile differed among the three genes. The Zic3 gene peaked soonest at 5 days after birth, whereas Zic2 peaked at 11 days. Zic1 mRNA peaked in 5 to 7 days. These periods correspond to the stage when the precursors of granule cells are differentiating into the mature neurons. However, whether or not Zic2 and Zic3 are expressed in the granule cells as seen in Zic1 must be determined before their role in cerebellar development can be investigated. Our preliminary data indicated that another gene (Zic4) is also expressed in the cerebellum.3 Combining with the highly restricted expression of the Zic1 gene in the cerebellar granule cells (Aruga et al., 1994), the Zic gene family is unique in that all of the members of the family are expressed in the adult cerebellum in a highly restricted manner.

https://openalex.org/W2032943308,"Adult rat ventricular myocytes and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) both express an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) following exposure to soluble inflammatory mediators. However, NOS2 gene expression is regulated differently in response to specific cytokines in each cell type. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induces NOS2 in both, whereas interferon γ (IFNγ) induces NOS2 expression in myocytes but not in CMEC. Therefore, we examined the specific signal transduction pathways that could regulate NOS2 mRNA levels, including activation of 44- and 42-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; ERK1/ERK2) and STAT1α, a transcriptional regulatory protein linked to cell membrane receptors. Although IL-1β treatment increased ERK1/ERK2 activities in both cell types, IFNγ activated these MAPKs only in myocytes. STAT1α phosphorylation, consistent with IFNγ-induced signaling, was readily apparent in both cell types, and binding of activated STAT1α from cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions from IFNγ-treated adult myocytes to a sis-inducible element could be demonstrated by gel-shift assay. The farnesyl transferase inhibitor BZA-5B blocked activation of ERK1/ERK2 and induction of NOS2 by IFNγ and IL-1β in myocytes. IL-1β and IFNγ-induced NOS2 gene expression in myocytes was also down-regulated by both protein kinase C (PKC) desensitization and by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, implicating PKC-linked activation of Ras or Raf in the induction of NOS2 by IL-1β and IFNγ in cardiac muscle cells. In CMEC, the MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 blocked activation of ERK1/ERK2 and down-regulated IL-1β-mediated NOS2 induction, whereas activation of ERK2 in the absence of cytokines by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphoserine protein phosphatases, also induced NOS2 mRNA. These data demonstrate that ERK1/ERK2 activation appears to be necessary for the induction of NOS2 by IL-1β and IFNγ in cardiac myocytes and CMEC. In the absence of ERK1/ERK2 activation by IFNγ in CMEC, phosphorylation of STAT1α is not sufficient for NOS2 gene expression. These overlapping yet distinct cellular responses to specific cytokines may serve to target NOS2 gene expression to specific cells or regions within the heart and also provide for rapid escalation of NO production if required for host defense.

https://openalex.org/W1972978465,"Together with the 31-kDa microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP), four polypeptides designated MP340 (340 kDa), MP78 (78 kDa), MP70 (70 kDa), and MP25 (25 kDa) have previously been identified in tissue extracts designed specifically to solubilize the microfibrillar component of elastic fibers. In the present study, both MP78 and MP70 were shown to be forms of a protein which is closely related to the human protein βig-h3, and MP340 was confirmed to be the bovine form of fibrillin-1. Peptide sequences from MP25 proved to be unique, and affinity-purified anti-MP25 antibodies were shown, by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, to localize specifically to the elastin-associated microfibrils. This confirmed that MP25 was a distinct component of these structures. Expression screening of nuchal ligament cDNA libraries yielded a cDNA, cM10A (770 base pairs) which encodes amino acid sequences matching those of the MP25 peptides. Further library screening with cM10A identified cDNAs which encode the complete primary structures of bovine and human MP25. Bovine and human MP25 were found to be around 80% homologous and contain 170 and 173 amino acids, respectively. Data base searches revealed that MP25 had significant similarity of structure only with MAGP, indicating that the two proteins form a new family of microfibrillar proteins. In acknowledgment, MP25 has been formally renamed MAGP-2, and MAGP is referred to as MAGP-1. The close similarity between the two proteins (57%) is confined to a central region of 60 amino acids where there is precise alignment of 7 cysteine residues. Elsewhere the MAGP-2 molecule is rich in serine and threonine residues and contains an RGD motif. MAGP-2 lacks the proline-, glutamine-, and tyrosine-rich sequences and a hydrophobic carboxyl terminus, characteristic of MAGP-1. These structural differences suggest that MAGP-2 has some functions which are distinct from those of MAGP-1. The locus of the human MAGP-2 gene was identified on chromosome 12 in the region of 12p12.3-12p13.1. Together with the 31-kDa microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP), four polypeptides designated MP340 (340 kDa), MP78 (78 kDa), MP70 (70 kDa), and MP25 (25 kDa) have previously been identified in tissue extracts designed specifically to solubilize the microfibrillar component of elastic fibers. In the present study, both MP78 and MP70 were shown to be forms of a protein which is closely related to the human protein βig-h3, and MP340 was confirmed to be the bovine form of fibrillin-1. Peptide sequences from MP25 proved to be unique, and affinity-purified anti-MP25 antibodies were shown, by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, to localize specifically to the elastin-associated microfibrils. This confirmed that MP25 was a distinct component of these structures. Expression screening of nuchal ligament cDNA libraries yielded a cDNA, cM10A (770 base pairs) which encodes amino acid sequences matching those of the MP25 peptides. Further library screening with cM10A identified cDNAs which encode the complete primary structures of bovine and human MP25.

We investigated syntaxin 1 expression in pancreatic β cells and the functional role of syntaxin 1 in the insulin release mechanism. Expression of syntaxin 1A, but not 1B, was detected in mouse isolated islets by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure. An immunoprecipitation study of metabolically labeled islets with an anti-rat syntaxin 1/HPC-1 antibody demonstrated syntaxin 1A protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼35 kDa. Immunohistochemistry of the mouse pancreas demonstrated that syntaxin 1/HPC-1 was present in the plasma membranes of the islets of Langerhans. In order to determine the functional role of syntaxin 1 in pancreatic β-cells, rat syntaxin 1A or 1B was overexpressed in mouse βTC3 cells using the transient transfection procedure. Transfection of βTC3 cells with either syntaxin 1 resulted in approximately 7-fold increases in their immunodetectable protein levels. Glucose-stimulated insulin release by syntaxin 1A-overexpressing cells was suppressed to about 50% of the level in control cells, whereas insulin release by syntaxin 1B-overexpressing and control cells did not differ. Next, we established stable βTC3 cell lines that overexpressed syntaxin 1A and used them to evaluate the effect of syntaxin 1A on the regulatory insulin release pathway. Two insulin secretogogues, 4-β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or forskolin, increased insulin release by untransfected βTC3 cells markedly, but their effects were diminished in syntaxin 1A-overexpressing βTC3 cells. Glucose-unstimulated insulin release and the proinsulin biosynthetic rate were not affected by syntaxin 1A overexpression, indicating a specific role of syntaxin 1A in the regulatory insulin release pathway. Finally, in vitro binding assays showed that syntaxin 1A binds to insulin secretory granules, indicating an inhibitory role of syntaxin 1A in insulin exocytosis via its interaction with vesicular proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2044050650,"CBP2 is an RNA tertiary structure binding protein required for efficient splicing of a yeast mitochondrial group I intron. CBP2 must wait for folding of the two RNA domains that make up the catalytic core before it can bind. In a subsequent step, association of the 5' domain of the RNA is stabilized by additional interactions with the protein. Thus, CBP2 functions primarily to capture otherwise transient RNA tertiary structures. This simple one-RNA, one-protein system has revealed how the kinetic pathway of RNA folding can direct the assembly of a specific ribonucleoprotein complex. There are parallels to steps in the formation of a much more complex ribonucleoprotein, the 30S ribosomal subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2022584932,"We have previously described the ability of arachidonic acid (AA) to regulate GLUT4 gene expression (Tebbey, P. W., McGowan, K. M., Stephens, J. M., Buttke, T. M., and Pekala, P. H.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 639-644). Chronic exposure (48 h) of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells to AA resulted in an ∼90% suppression of GLUT4 mRNA accumulation. This decrease was demonstrated to be due to a 50% decrease in GLUT4 gene transcription as well as a destabilization of the GLUT4 message (t1/2 decreased from 8.0 to 4.6 h). In the current study we have identified, at least in part, the mechanism by which AA exerts its effects on GLUT4 expression. Compatible with a cyclooxygenase mediated event, the AA-induced suppression of GLUT4 mRNA was abolished by pretreating the cells with the inhibitor, indomethacin. Consistent with this observation, exposure of the cells to 10 μM PGE2 mimicked the effect of AA, in contrast to products of the lipoxygenase pathway which were unable to suppress GLUT4 mRNA content. Quantification of the conversion of AA to PGE2 demonstrated a 50-fold increase in PGE2 released into the media within 7 h of AA addition. Cyclic AMP levels were also increased 50-fold with AA treatment consistent with PGE2 activation of adenylate cyclase. Various long chain fatty acids, including the nonmetabolizable analog of AA, eicosatetraenoic acid (ETYA), also decreased GLUT4 mRNA levels. The effect of ETYA, a potent inhibitor of both lipo- and cyclooxygenases and a potent activator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), suggested the presence of a second pathway where nonmetabolized fatty acid functioned to suppress GLUT4 mRNA levels. Further support for a PPAR-mediated mechanism was obtained by exposure of the cells to the classic PPAR activator, clofibrate, which resulted in a ∼75% decrease in GLUT4 mRNA content. Nuclear extracts prepared from the adipocytes contained a protein complex that bound to the PPAR responsive element (PPRE) found in the promoter of the fatty acyl-CoA oxidase gene. When the adipocytes were treated with either AA or ETYA, binding to the PPRE was disrupted, consistent with an ability of these fatty acids to control gene expression by altering the occupation of a PPRE.

INTRODUCTIONGlucose transport across the plasma membrane represents the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism and is a highly regulated process in the animal cell. Facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell is carried out by a family of stereospecific transport proteins known as the glucose transporters (GLUT1 through GLUT5 and GLUT7). These integral membrane proteins are members of a gene family in which tissue-specific expression of one or more members will in part determine the net rate of glucose entry into the cell. In addition to tissue-specific expression, hormones, growth factors, and fatty acids can influence the net flux of glucose across the plasma membrane (Kahn, 1992; James et al., 1989; Birnbaum, 1989; Corneilus et al., 1990; Stephens and Pekala, 1992; Tebbey et al., 1994). 1McGowan, K. M., DeVente, J. E., Carey, J. O., Ways, D. K., and Pekala, P. H.(1996) J. Cell. Physiol.167, in press. In addition to roles in the biosynthesis of lipids and energy production, fatty acids are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Fatty acids in general and arachidonic acid (AA) 2The abbreviations used are: AAarachidonic acidTNFtumor necrosis factorPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPPREperoxisome proliferator response elementPGE2prostaglandin E2ETYAeicosatetraenoic acidBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayNDGAnordihydroguaiaretic acidHPETEhydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. specifically have been demonstrated to be physiological regulators of the adipocyte glucose transport system (Hardy et al., 1991; Murer et al., 1992; Hunnicut et al., 1994; Tebbey et al., 1994). Arachidonic acid (20:4), a major metabolically important polyunsaturated fatty acid present in mammalian cells, is synthesized in the liver from dietary linoleic acid (18:2) and then transported via serum albumin or lipoproteins to various tissues. Serum levels of AA are low relative to other fatty acids except in obesity and diabetes where levels can be significantly elevated over normal matched controls (Distel et al., 1992; Svedberg et al., 1990; Grunfeld et al., 1981). In addition, many cells possess a high affinity arachidonyl-CoA synthetase which facilitates selective accumulation of AA even when other fatty acid species are in excess (Neufeld et al., 1983; Taylor et al., 1985). Such characteristics imply an important role for AA in cellular growth and function and as evidence for such, AA has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression (Tebbey and Buttke, 1992; Glaslow et al., 1992; Ntambi, 1992; Clarke and Abraham, 1992; Tebbey et al., 1994). Specifically, AA was found to suppress the transcription rate of a number of genes, including: the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 in T-cells (Tebbey and Buttke, 1992), the hepatic fatty acid synthase (Clarke and Abraham, 1992), and GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Tebbey et al., 1994). Interestingly, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 and GLUT4 are coordinately expressed during the differentiation process in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Kaestner et al., 1989, 1990) and results obtained in transient co-transfection assays suggest the possibility of identical mechanisms of activation of the promoters for both the GLUT4 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 genes (Kaestner et al., 1990; Christy et al., 1989). Thus, control of the expression of these genes by AA may be part of a generalized regulation of adipose-specific gene expression.These in vitro results are supported by dietary experiments demonstrating that high safflower oil content diets (rich in ω-6 fatty acids) resulted in decreased cellular content and distribution of GLUT4 in rat adipocytes (Ezaki et al., 1992). Insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was decreased to 51% of controls, and GLUT4 protein content of both plasma and microsomal membranes decreased by 35%. Fish oil feeding (increased ω-3 fatty acids) transiently improved the safflower oil-mediated decrease of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity by increasing the amount of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 proteins. These data suggest that the regulatory properties of fatty acids may be determined by specific structure-function relationships.Previous studies from our laboratory (Tebbey et al., 1994) examined the mechanisms by which AA can modulate glucose homeostasis in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Chronic exposure of the adipocytes to 50 μM AA was demonstrated to alter both basal- and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and render the cells insulin resistant. The AA treatment specifically reduced the GLUT4 content of both the plasma and intracellular membranes, while GLUT1 content increased slightly. Consistent with the down-regulation of the protein, GLUT4 mRNA levels decreased to 10% of the initial content. Mechanistically the decrease was determined to be the result of both transcriptional down-regulation (50% of control) and a destabilization of the message (GLUT4 mRNA t1/2 decreased by ∼43%). These data suggested that AA, in a manner similar to insulin (Flores-Riveros et al., 1993a) and TNF (Stephens and Pekala, 1991, 1992), down-regulates expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter in adipocytes.The oxidation of AA to very potent biological molecules is mediated by three different enzyme systems to include: the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase. Thus, it became important to determine if oxidation of AA was necessary for its effect on GLUT4 or whether the observed effects were mediated by alternative pathways. In the current report we demonstrate that mechanistically fatty acids may act via two independent mechanisms, only one of which requires an oxidized metabolite of AA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

Cells were cultured, maintained, and differentiated as described previously (Tebbey et al., 1994). The cells were maintained for 10 days post-differentiation and then treated with the indicated agents for various times prior to RNA isolation.Fatty AcidsAll fatty acids used were absorbed onto diatomaceous earth and subsequently complexed to essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) to yield a FA:BSA ratio of ∼1.4:1 (Tebbey and Buttke, 1992; Buttke et al.,1989). FA/BSA was added to cells from a 2.5 mM stock solution to yield a final concentration of 100 μM.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysesTotal RNA was isolated by extraction with guanidine isothiocyanate and centrifugation through 5.7 M cesium chloride (Chirgwin et al., 1979) or by the TRIzol Method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern analyses were performed as described previously (Stephens and Pekala, 1991).DNA ProbesGLUT4, a 2.8-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment encoding the 3T3-L1 homolog of the adipose/muscle (insulin-responsive) glucose transporter (Kaestner et al., 1989); β-actin, a 1.9-kilobase pair HindIII fragment obtained from Dr. D. W. Cleveland (Cleveland et al., 1980).Enzyme Immunoassay for PGE2Cells were treated with 100 μM AA/BSA for various times. At the indicated times 100-μl aliquots of medium were taken and analyzed for PGE2 content using an enzyme immunoassay kit for PGE2 (Cayman Chemical) based on the ELISA method.Enzyme Immunoassay for cAMPCells were treated with 100 μM AA/BSA for various times and at the indicated times the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cell debris was pelleted and cAMP was then extracted from the supernatant with an equal volume of 3:1 mixture of Freon/tri-n-octylamine. The upper aqueous phase was collected (∼500 μl) and then assayed for cAMP content using an enzyme immunoassay kit for cAMP (Cayman Chemical) based on the ELISA method.Sphingomyelin AssayCells were labeled with [3H] choline chloride (specific activity of 1 mCi/ml) at 0.5 μCi/ml for 6 days after initiation of differentiation, and the cells were grown in normal media for the remaining 3 days. On day 9 the cells were treated with either 100 μM AA or 5 nM TNF for the indicated times, the lipids extracted, and labeled sphingomyelin quantified by the bacterial sphingomyelinase method as described by Jayadev et al. (1994).Preparation of Nuclear ExtractAfter the indicated treatments for various times, the cells were pelleted in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended in 3 ml of M3 lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The nuclei were extracted using 250 μl of cold M4 extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.4 M KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min and then the nuclear debris and DNA pelleted at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Nuclear extracts were assayed for protein concentrations by the method of Bradford(1976).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)EMSAs were performed using the direct repeat half-site PPRE (5′-AATTTCGAGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCAGCT-3′). Briefly, ∼100 ng (60,000 cpm) of a 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligomer was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 μl of reaction buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 88 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 150 μg of poly(dI•dC)-poly(dI•dC), 0.05% Triton X-100, and 12.5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4°C, 40 amps (200 V), for ∼2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 12 h at −80°C.Statistical AnalysesThe results of these experiments were analyzed using the Sigma-Stat package (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Comparisons of means among groups were tested for significant differences by a Newman-Keuls procedure following one-way analysis of variance. The level of statistical significance chosen for these experiments was p < 0.05.RESULTSInhibition of Cyclooxygenase Abolishes Arachidonic Acid-induced GLUT4 mRNA SuppressionAA is rapidly converted to a number of eicosanoids which express potent physiological properties. In order to identify involvement of either the lipo- or cyclooxygenase in the conversion of AA to a metabolite active in the suppression of GLUT4 gene expression, inhibitors of the two enzyme systems were used. Pretreatment of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a selective inhibitor of the lipoxygenases (IC50 = 0.2, 30, and 30 μM for 5-, 12-, and 15-LO, respectively, as opposed to 100 μM for the cyclooxygenase; Tobias and Hamilton, 1978) for 1 h at 50 μM did not significantly alter the AA-induced suppression of GLUT4 mRNA content (Fig. 1). In contrast, pretreatment with 50 μM indomethacin, which inhibits the cyclooxygenase (IC50 = 0.1 μM) selectively over the lipoxygenases (IC50 > 100 μM; Tobias and Hamilton, 1978), for 1 h completely abolished the AA-induced decrease of GLUT4 mRNA content, consistent with conversion of AA to a prostanoid which in turn mediated suppression. Similar results were observed using the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (data not shown). While these results were rather compelling, a third oxidative pathway was considered. The cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase pathway has only been considered a major pathway in liver and kidney and a minor pathway in occular and pituitary tissues (Fitzpatrick and Murphy, 1988). Its existence in adipose tissue, to our knowledge, has not been described. However, we attempted to block any potential metabolism through this enzyme system using the inhibitor SKF-541. At concentrations of up to 50 μM, this inhibitor had no effect on the AA-mediated suppression of GLUT4 mRNA. In addition, NDGA exhibits an IC50 value of 15 μM for AA-specific epoxygenase (Capdevila et al., 1988) and should have blocked the AA-induced GLUT4 down-regulation had an epoxygenase metabolite been responsible for the regulation; as seen from the data in Fig. 1, this did not occur. These results strongly indicate a cyclooxygenase metabolite rather than AA itself as the suppressive agent in the down-regulation of GLUT4 message.PGE2Suppresses GLUT4 mRNA LevelsOf the cyclooxygenase metabolites, PGE2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) are the major prostaglandins formed in the fat cell (Axelrod and Levine, 1981; Richelsen, 1987, 1992). Given the inhibition of indomethacin and ibuprofen on AA-induced GLUT4 mRNA suppression, we examined whether PGE2 could elicit the same effect as AA. The results shown in Fig. 2, indicate that exposure of the cells for 12 h to 10 μM PGE2 resulted in a marked decrease (∼70%) in GLUT4 mRNA content. The effect was significantly (p < 0.05%) more potent than either AA (∼55% decrease) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) (∼60% decrease). Treatment of the cells with the nonmetabolizable analog of prostacyclin, carbaprostacyclin, for 12 h at 5, 10, or 25 μM had little or no effect on GLUT4 mRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the specificity of PGE2.Figure 2:Effect of prostaglandin E2 on GLUT4 mRNA expression. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated for 12 h with 5 nM tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), 100 μM arachidonic acid (AA), and 10 μM prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Total cellular RNA was isolated, and 20 μg/lane were subjected to electrophoresis and Northern blot analysis. A, graphical representation of three independent experiments.

The data clearly demonstrated that, in contrast to PGE2, these lipoxygenase metabolites had no effect on GLUT4 mRNA expression.Figure 3:Effect of 5(S)-, 12(S)-, and 15(S)-HPETEs on GLUT4 mRNA expression. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated for 12 h with 5 nM TNF-α (lane 2), 100 μM AA (lane 3), 10 μM PGE2 (lane 4), 5 μM 5(S), 12(S), and 15(S)-HPETEs (lanes 5, 6, 7), and 10 μM 5, 12, and 15 (S) HPETEs (lanes 8, 9, 10). Lane 1, No treatment. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and 20 μg of each RNA sample was incubated with complementary radiolabeled GLUT4 RNA transcript and then subjected to Ribo-nuclease Protection analysis.

As shown in Fig. 4, within 1 h of AA addition to the cells, PGE2 content increased 10-fold above basal levels. A maximum 50-fold increase above basal was observed 7 h after AA addition (Fig. 4). The duration of the PGE2 peak was relatively short, lasting only ∼1 h and then returning slowly to basal levels over the next 15 h. These data suggest that AA is being converted via the cyclooxygenase pathway to PGE2, the apparent active metabolite mediating GLUT4 suppression.Figure 4:Arachidonic acid induction of PGE2 as detected by ELISA. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 100 μM AA, and aliquots of the media were removed at various times and tested for the presence of PGE2.

In adipocytes, PGE2 has been demonstrated to exhibit a concentration dependence with respect to its inhibitory or stimulatory effects on adenylate cyclase (Kather and Simon, 1977, 1979; Kather, 1982). In intact adipose cells PGE2 inhibited isoproternol-stimulated lipolysis at nanomolar concentrations, while exposure of cells to concentrations in excess of 1 μM resulted in cAMP accumulation and stimulation of lipolysis (Kather, 1981). To determine if cAMP content increases with AA treatment, we measured cAMP levels present in the cytosol at various times after the cells were treated with AA using an ELISA. As shown in Fig. 5, cAMP levels increased 50-fold above the basal level within 3 h of AA treatment. The increase in cAMP occurred consistent with stimulation of adenylate cyclase by PGE2 (compare Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Unlike the increase in PGE2, the rise in cAMP was relatively sharp, and the levels remained high for less than 30 min, potentially due to the desensitization of the enzyme. These data are consistent with AA metabolism to PGE2 which acts in an autocrine fashion to increase cAMP levels.Figure 5:Arachidonic Acid induction of cAMP as detected by ELISA. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 100 μM AA, and at the indicated times the cells were harvested and cAMP was extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The content of cAMP was then determined by an ELISA. The data are plotted as the mean picomoles of cAMP/ml ± S.D. The graph represents two independent determinations. Where not indicated with an error bar, the error of the data lies within the data point itself.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Specificity of the AA Regulatory EffectSpecificity of AA in suppressing GLUT4 mRNA levels was investigated using a series of fatty acids as well as a nonmetabolizable analog of AA. To obtain a maximal response, based on preliminary studies, the cells were exposed to the fatty acid-albumin complex at a final concentration of 100 μM for 24 h. The results, displayed in Fig. 6, indicate that all fatty acids examined, stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), linoleic acid (18:2), linolenic acid (18:3), γ-linolenic acid (γ18:3), mead fatty acid (20:3), AA (20:4), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5), and the acetylenic analog of AA, ETYA, were able to suppress GLUT4 mRNA levels by at least 50% with AA providing the maximum suppression of 80%. While 18:2 and γ 18:3 can be converted to AA and potentially lead to increased cAMP, none of the other fatty acids tested exhibit this potential. To confirm this, we examined the potential for 18:0, 18:1, and ETYA to increase cAMP levels; our data indicated that cAMP did not increase over the 5-h time frame of the experiment (mean ± S.D. of the [cAMP] over the 5-h time course, control: 178 ± 32 pmol/ml; 18:0-, 18:1-, and ETYA-treated: 149 ± 28, 139 ± 19, and 159 ± 21 pmol/ml, respectively). Interestingly ETYA, which inhibits AA uptake, AA-specific and nonspecific acyl-CoA synthetases, the cyclooxygenase, and all lipoxygenases, PLA2 as well as the cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase, and thus cannot be converted to PGE2, was as effective as AA in suppressing GLUT4 mRNA accumulation. In addition, the suppression of GLUT4 mRNA accumulation could not be blocked by addition of indomethacin to the cultures. These studies are consistent with the premise that fatty acids may regulate GLUT4 mRNA content without the requirement for further metabolism and are consistent with the presence of a second signal transduction pathway.Figure 6:Effect of ω-3 and ω-6 mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids on GLUT4 mRNA expression. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated for 24 h with 100 μM of each fatty acid. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and 20 μg/lane were subjected to electrophoresis and Northern blot analysis.

This results in generation of free ceramide and initiation of a signal transduction cascade that potentially could control GLUT4 gene expression. To determine if this regulatory pathway was viable in the adipocytes, we examined the ability of AA to activate the sphingomyelinase and initiate sphingomyelin turnover. As shown in Fig. 7, after addition of AA to the cells, no significant hydrolysis of sphingomyelin was detected. TNF activation of the sphingomyelinase at a single 40-min time point resulted in a 50% decrease in sphingomyelin and was utilized as a positive control. The data suggest that in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, AA is not mediating activation of the sphingomyelinase and generation of free ceramide.Figure 7:Effect of AA on SM hydrolysis. [3H]Choline-labeled adipocytes were treated at time 0 with 100 μM AA or 5 nM TNF.

Cross-regulation among members of both receptor superfamilies has been reported, including the counter-regulatory effects of insulin on β-adrenergic catecholamine action. Cells stimulated by insulin show loss of function and increased phosphotyrosine content of β2-adrenergic receptors.

This hypothesis was evaluated directly using recombinant human insulin receptor, hamster β2-adrenergic receptor, and an in vitro reconstitution and phosphorylation assay.

Protein phosphorylation plays a prominent role in the regulation of cell signaling. A populous family of G-protein-linked receptors mediate activation of a diverse class of effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and various ion channels, via a less populous class of G-proteins(1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). These G-protein-linked receptors share many features, including regulation via protein phosphorylation(2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

In the current work, we directly test the hypothesis that the β2-adrenergic receptor is a substrate for growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, using recombinant receptors and a defined reconstitution assay in vitro. The results demonstrate that growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g. insulin receptor and the IGF-I 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor-IrβARrecombinant hamster β2-adrenergic receptorHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyrIRrecombinant human insulin receptorCHOChinese hamster ovaryIGF-IRIGF-I receptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. receptor) can directly phosphorylate a G-protein-linked receptor. insulin-like growth factor-I recombinant hamster β2-adrenergic receptor high pressure liquid chromatography recombinant human insulin receptor Chinese hamster ovary IGF-I receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) was prepared from lectin chromatography of cell extracts of human osteogenic sarcoma, a cell line replete in IGF-IR(11Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniack A.D.

In vitro, phosphorylation of the rβAR was achieved in a reconstitution assay, whereby 5 μl (100-200 fmol) of rIR and 20 μl (10-20 pmol) of β2AR (or 20 μl of buffer) were incubated at 22°C in a final volume of 45 μl in (final concentrations) 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (40 Ci/mmol) were then added to give a final concentration of 5 μM ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated at 30 min by the addition of 50 μl of 2× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol. Proteins were denatured for 5 min at 95°C and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were made visible by exposing the dried gel to X-Omat AR film (Kodak). The amount of label incorporated into rβ2AR by insulin-stimulated rIR in this detergent-dispersed reconstitution system was defined by phosphoroimage analysis (Beta-scan) and compared with the label incorporated in the rIR β-subunit. Under the conditions employed, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of rβ2AR was approximately 15% of that incorporated into the rIR β-subunit itself. rIR (5 μl, 100-200 fmol) from CHO-T cells or from COS-1 cells was reconstituted with rβAR (20 μl, 10-20 pmol) in the absence or the presence of insulin (100 nM) and incubated for 30 min at 22°C with [γ-32P]ATP (5 μM) as described above. Phosphorylated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. The regions of interest were excised from the gel, rehydrated, and subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6 M HCl(7Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agric. Exp. Stn.

Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of the β2AR displaying phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in vivo (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

The peptide sequences employed as internal standards for the HPLC and high voltage electrophoresis after tryptic digestion were as follows: L339, LLCLRRSSSKAYGNGYSSNSNGKTD; T362, TDYMGEASGCQLGQEK; R62, RLQTVTNYFITSLACAD; Y132, YIAITSPFKYQSLLTKNKAR; and I135, ITSPFKYQSLLTKNKAR. Partially purified rIR (wheat germ agglutinin extracts from CHO-T cells) was incubated in the absence or the presence of insulin (100 nM), 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP, and the synthetic peptides at the concentrations indicated for 30 min at 22°C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphopeptides were separated by Tricine gel electrophoresis(13Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Synthetic peptides containing tyrosine residues 141, 350, 354, and 364 were labeled in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP and separated on Tricine gels. The bands corresponding to rβ2AR or the synthetic peptides were excised from the gels and treated with L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (40 μg/ml) for 18 h at 37°C(9Baltensperger K.

The tryptic eluate was then separated on a microbore HPLC (Applied Biosystems) using a 220-mm Aquapore OD-300 column and a gradient of acetonitrile (0-50% in 45 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and Cerenkov radiation ([32P] window) was measured for each fraction. The standards for tryptic digests of L339 and T362 reported earlier (6Karoor V.

Tryptic digestion of rβ2-adrenergic receptor and of synthetic peptides phosphorylated in vitro by rIR was performed as described above.

Briefly, the tryptic eluates from the HPLC peaks were separated in two dimensions on cellulose thin-layer plates. Aliquots (10 μl) of tryptic eluates were spotted onto the TLC plates and electrophoresed at 1000 V for 60 min in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water, 50:156:1794). Following electrophoresis, the plate was air-dried overnight and subjected to chromatography at a right angle to the direction of electrophoresis in a phosphochromatography buffer (1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water, 15:10:3:12). The plates were dried, and the peptides were identified by autoradiography. The standards for tryptic digests of L339 and T362 reported earlier (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.

In cultured smooth muscle cells, insulin impairs the function and increases the phosphotyrosine content of β2AR (4Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address the possibility that a G-protein-linked receptor might serve as a substrate for an intrinsic tyrosine kinase growth receptor, we reconstituted the two receptors in vitro. rIR was isolated and partially purified from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-T) that stably overexpresses the human insulin receptor(10Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This rIR preparation reduced levels of uncleaved proreceptor and showed marked increase of rIR β-subunit phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Marked insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the rβAR (Mr, 45,000) as well as of the rIR β-subunit (Mr, 86,000) was observed following reconstitution of purified rβ2AR expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and rIR purified from CHO-T cells in the presence of detergent (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). No phosphorylation of rβAR was evident in reconstitutions performed in the absence of rIR. Phosphorylation of some incompletely processed proreceptor (Mr, 180,000) present in the IR preparations was observed occasionally as shown here. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of rβAR was observed in reconstitutions with lectin-purified IR from either CHO-T cells or a second source, SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells, which were transiently transfected with the human insulin receptor cDNA (not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the rβAR and rIR products from an in vitro phosphorylation reaction revealed phosphotyrosine labeling of the rβAR, whether performed with rIR expressed in CHO-T (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) or COS-1 (lanes 3 and 4) cells. The rIR β-subunit was predominantly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), providing an internal control. Some phosphoserine in the rIR β-subunit was detected, which is due to low level serine kinase activity of the IR tyrosine kinase(9Baltensperger K. Lewis R.E. Woon C.W. Vissavajjhala P. Ross A.H. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7885-7888Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, upon overexposure of the autoradiography, some phosphoserine could be detected in phosphorylated rβAR (not shown), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the insulin receptor directly interacts with and phosphorylates the rβAR. We explored whether the β2-adrenergic receptor was a substrate for a second growth factor-activated tyrosine kinase receptor, the IGF-I receptor, which is structurally closely related to the IR(14Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). We assayed the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation of rβAR in vitro in reconstitution studies with IGF-IR purifed from human osteogenic sarcoma cell extracts (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5) and compared it with the phosphorylation of rβAR by rIR (Fig. 3, lane 1, and Fig. 1). The IGF-1R phosphorylated rβAR in response to stimulation by high concentrations (1 μM) of insulin (lane 3). IGF-1R-dependent phosphorylation of the 45,000 Mr protein was absent in the reconstitutions devoid of rβAR (lanes 4 and 5). A small amount of phosphorylation was observed in the lectin-purified extract rich in IGF-IR in the absence of hormonal stimulation (lane 3), which may reflect phosphorylation catalyzed by platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which was activated (autophosphorylated) in this fraction (see ∗, Fig. 3, lanes 2-5). These observations demonstrate that tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, in addition to the IR, can catalyze specific phosphorylation of rβAR in response to insulin. In an effort to explore the site(s) for insulin-stimulated, rIR-catalyzed phosphorylation, recently we prepared synthetic peptides corresponding to cytoplasmic regions of the β2AR that harbors tyrosyl residues, i.e. Tyr132, Tyr141, Tyr350, Tyr354, and Tyr364(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and analyzed their potential as substrates for rIR. For the in vitro assay(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), no labeling of peptides by rIR was observed in the absence of insulin. Insulin (10 nM)-stimulated rIR-catalyzed phosphorylation of β2-adrenergic receptor peptides was found prominently in peptides L339 (Tyr350 and Tyr354), T362 (Tyr364), and to a lesser extent peptides Y132 (Tyr132 and Tyr141), and I135 (Tyr141). The synthetic peptides were designed not only to probe all cytosolic tyrosyl residues available for phosphorylation by IR but also to provide a source of tryptic fragments in which the candidate sites for tyrosine kinase phosphorylation were imbedded(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Maps of tryptic digests might permit analysis of the sites phosphorylated on the β2AR in response to insulin in vitro (Fig. 4). Tryptic digests of peptides phosphorylated in vitro by rIR in response to insulin provided markers for HPLC analysis (Fig. 4, A-C). The retention times for the tryptic fragments subjected to HPLC separation agreed well with the retention times calculated from the sequence information (not shown). For tryptic digests of phosphorylated I135 peptide, uncleaved peptide was detected routinely (∗, Fig. 4A). Tryptic digests of phosphopeptide Y132 display the same mobility as the fragments of I135 (not shown), i.e. fraction 4 (Fig. 4A). The Y132 peptide was shown previously to be the preferred substrate for insulin-stimulated, rIR-catalyzed phosphorylation(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using these labeled standards, we established that β2AR reconstituted in vitro with rIR in the presence of insulin was phosphorylated predominantly on peptides harboring residues Tyr132/Tyr141, Tyr350/Tyr354, and Tyr364 (Fig. 4D). Phosphorylation of the rβ2AR by rIR in vitro was not detected in the absence of insulin. High voltage electrophoresis followed by thin-layer chromatography of the tryptic fragments (Fig. 5, A-C) provides additional markers for analysis of phosphopeptides derived from the β2AR phosphorylated by insulin-stimulated rIR using the in vitro, reconstitution assay (Fig. 5D). The two-dimensional analysis extends the results of reverse-phase HPLC, establishing that the predominant sites of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation catalyzed by the rIR in vitro are Tyr132/Tyr141, Tyr350/Tyr354, and Tyr364 (Fig. 5D). Peptides harboring Tyr132 and/or Tyr141 are substrates for rIR-catalyzed phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation, the peptide harboring both Tyr132 and Tyr141 being the preferred substrate(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The analysis for I135 only is displayed (Fig. 5A), being representative of tryptic fragments from Y132 also, which behave identically with those of I135 in both the HPLC and two-dimensional analyses (not shown). Two-dimensional analysis of tryptic fragments of β2AR phosphorylated by rIR in vitro revealed labeling of Tyr132/Tyr141, as shown here. Thus, in vitro phosphorylation of the β2AR by the IR tyrosine kinase is confined to Tyr132/Tyr141, Tyr350/Tyr354, and Tyr364. In the current work we exploited the ability to prepare rIR, rbAR, and IGF-IR-enriched fractions from human osteogenic sarcoma cells to directly test the hypothesis that a G-protein-linked receptor can act as a substrate for an intrinsic tyrosine-kinase growth factor receptor. The following observations provide compelling evidence in support of this hypothesis: (i) insulin stimulates rIR-catalyzed phosphorylation of the rβ2AR in a reconstituted, in vitro assay; (ii) insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the rβ2AR in vitro is confined to tyrosyl residues; (iii) the sites phosphorylated in vitro in response to insulin are those phosphorylated in vivo, as determined by structural analysis of β2AR isolated from metabolically labeled cells; (iv) insulin at high concentrations stimulates in vitro phosphorylation of rβ2AR catalyzed by purified IGF-IR; and (v) mutagenesis of these tyrosyl residues of the β2AR in vivo results in loss of insulin-stimulated counter-regulation of β2AR function(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, the bradykinin receptor has been shown to be phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues in response to serum(15Jong Y.J. Dalemar L.R. Wilhelm B. Baenziger N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10994-10998Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the angiotensin II AT1 receptor has been reported to be a substrate for phosphorylation by the src family of tyrosine kinases(16Paxton W.G. Marrero M.B. Klein J.D. Delefontaine P. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based upon these observations we propose a new paradigm in which two prominent pathways in cell signaling cross-talk to each other at the most proximal point, receptor to receptor. Interestingly, the sites on the β2AR phosphorylated by the IR and IGF-IR include a well known motif for tyrsoine kinase growth factor receptors at Tyr364(17Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar), a prominent GRB2 site at Tyr350(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

The co-migration of the tryptic fragments harboring Tyr132 and Tyr141 preclude definition of the contribution of each to phosphotyrosine labeling by the IR, either in vitro (present study) or in vivo (6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated, IR-catalyzed phosphorylation of peptide Y132, which harbors Tyr132/Tyr141, however, was prominent, whereas that for peptide I135, which lacks Tyr132, was decidely poor(6Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this site will be required, because phosphorylation of Tyr132 creates a Shc binding site, and this site is conserved among many G-protein-linked receptors, including receptors for neuropeptide Y, tachykinin, A2-adenosine, thyrotropin releasing factor, and serotonin (Genebank). Although speculation, the full range of adaptor molecules known to play a prominent role in tyrosine kinase receptor signaling may be made available to G-protein-linked receptors, once phosphorylated by a tyrosine kinase activated in response to a growth factor.

Some proteins, such as the adaptor protein Shc, and a frequently observed Shc-associated protein, p145, are common substrates in a variety of receptor signaling pathways and are thus of special interest. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc and p145 coprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies following B cell antigen receptor (BCR) cross-linking or interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor activation in B cells, and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment or IgG Fc receptor (FcγR) cross-linking in macrophages. In the case of BCR stimulation, we have shown that this represented the formation of an inducible complex. Furthermore, in response to LPS activation or FcγR cross-linking of macrophages and BCR cross-linking (but not IL-4 treatment) of B cells, we observed a similar tyrosine-phosphorylated p145 protein associated with the tyrosine kinase Syk. We did not detect any Shc associated with Syk, indicating that a trimolecular complex of Shc, Syk, and p145 was not formed in significant amounts. By several criteria, the Syk-associated p145 was very likely the same protein as the previously identified Shc-associated p145. The Syk-associated p145 and the Shc-associated p145 exhibited identical mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identical patterns of induced tyrosine phosphorylation. The p145 protein that coprecipitated with either Shc or Syk bound to a GST-Shc fusion protein. In addition, a monoclonal antibody developed against Shc-associated p145 also immunoblotted the Syk-associated p145.

Receptors for antigens, cytokines, and growth factors utilize tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins to initiate and propagate intracellular events that result in cellular responses. As many of these receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, this increase in cellular phosphorylation can result from the recruitment and activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases including Syk, ZAP-70, Src family tyrosine kinases(1Howe L. Weiss A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and JAK family tyrosine kinases(2Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Targets of these kinases include enzymes that generate second messengers, regulators of Ras and other Ras-like G proteins, transcription factors, and a variety of other proteins that are believed to play a role in receptor signaling(3DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

These two proteins are produced by utilization of two in-frame translation initiation sites. Each Shc isoform contains a C-terminal SH2 domain, a proline-rich central domain with multiple collagen-α1-type repeats, and at the N terminus, a recently identified phosphotyrosine interaction domain(12Pelicci G.

All of these domains are likely to be important for mediating protein-protein interactions(12Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani G. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Tyr-317 of the central domain of Shc directs binding of the Grb-2•SOS-1 complex to Shc via the SH2 domain of Grb-2(16Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar). By virtue of this association, Shc has been implicated in Ras activation. The localization of SOS-1 to the plasma membrane is necessary for the activation of Ras(17Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Although Shc is not itself a membrane protein, it can bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated activated IL-2 receptor(18Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1599-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), erythropoeitin receptor(10Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G.

Presumably this binding, coupled with Grb-2 binding to phosphorylated Shc, would direct Grb-2•SOS complexes to the membrane following receptor activation.

Depending upon the cell type analyzed, this protein has been referred to as p140, p145, or p150. It can appear as a single band or as several closely spaced bands. These Shc-associated proteins may well be the same protein or very similar isoforms of the same protein. In this report, we used BCR-stimulated B lymphocytes as a model system to demonstrate that the p145•Shc association is an inducible event and that complex formation and maintenance correlates with levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. In examining responses via other signaling receptors, we found association of tyrosine-phosphorylated p145 with Shc in response to IL-4 treatment of B lymphocytes and FcγR cross-linking or LPS treatment of macrophages. To address which tyrosine kinases may phosphorylate Shc and p145, we looked for direct association of these substrates with specific kinases. We found that Syk kinase coprecipitated with the p145 protein following most but not all of the same stimuli that induced p145 to associate with Shc. These observations suggest that p145 may have an important role in coordinating signaling pathways from a number of receptors.

LPS from Salmonella minnesota was obtained from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI) or List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and chicken serum were purchased from Sigma. Pervanadate solution was prepared as described(24Evans G.A. Garcia G.G. Erwin R. Howard O.M. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23407-23412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines used in this study (murine pre-B and B cell lines 70Z/3, WEHI-231, Bal-17, 2PK3; human B cell lines Daudi and Ramos and murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM glutamine, and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Chicken B cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% chicken serum. Splenic resting B cells were prepared by antibody- and complement-mediated lysis of T cells, followed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described previously(25Ashwell J.D. DeFranco A.L. Paul W.E. Schwartz R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 881-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). p145 protein in Shc immunoprecipitates was separated from other precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE. Purified p145 protein was excised from gels and mixed with RIBI adjuvant as per the manufacturer's protocol (RIBI, Hamilton, MT; BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with antigen-adjuvant mixture and boosted with antigen at 7 and 14 days. Fusions were performed using spleen cells and fusion partner Sp2/0-Ag14. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for reactivity with p145 protein by immunoblotting as described below. WEHI-231 cells were washed twice and then resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in cysteine-free, methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were starved for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in fresh labeling medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (50 μCi/ml). Cells were labeled for 2-4 h and stimulated as described below. Murine B lymphocytes (5 × 106 cells/ml in culture medium) were stimulated at 37°C for 3-5 min (unless otherwise indicated) with medium only, goat anti-IgM antibodies (15 μg/ml, unless otherwise indicated), or IL-4 (100 units/ml). Cell suspensions were then diluted with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM sodium vanadate (PBS/vanadate), pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4. For FcγR stimulations of macrophages, 1 × 107 cells/ml suspended in culture medium were incubated on ice for 30 min with 2.4G2 antibody (40 μg/ml). Cells were then warmed to 37°C and treated with or without cross-linking antibody (10 μg/ml MAR18.5) for 10 min. Cells were then washed and lysed as described above. For LPS responses in macrophages, LPS (5 μg/ml) was added to cultures of adherent, confluent RAW 264.7 cells for 5 min. Following stimulation, cells were scraped off the plate and the cell suspensions were treated as described above. Chicken B cells (1 × 107/ml) in culture medium plus 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, were incubated at 37°C for 4 min with or without 400 μM pervanadate(24Evans G.A. Garcia G.G. Erwin R. Howard O.M. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23407-23412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following stimulation, cells were washed by centrifugation once with ice-cold PBS/vanadate. Cell pellets were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na3VO4. Solubilized cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g for 10 min) to remove nuclei and insoluble cellular debris. Immunoprecipitations, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously(26Gold M.R. Crowley M.T. Martin G.A. McCormick F. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were precleared by incubation with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. Precleared lysates were incubated with anti-Shc polyclonal antibody, used at a concentration of 1 μg of antibody/mg of cell lysate protein. Anti-Syk polyclonal antiserum was used at a concentration of 5 μl of antiserum/mg of cell lysate protein. For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, 4G10 hybridoma supernatant was used at a 1:5 dilution. Alternatively, anti-Shc monoclonal antibody was used at 1 μg/ml or anti-Syk antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1 μg/ml in TBST) for 30-60 min. Bands were visualized using the Renaissance chemiluminecence detection system (DuPont). The full-length sequence of the p52 isoform of Shc was generated by PCR from a Shc cDNA clone (kind gift of P. G. Pelicci, University of Perugia, Italy). The identity of the resulting fragment was verified by sequencing using standard techniques and the fragment was ligated into the polylinker of the bacterial expression vector pG-IKS (a generous gift of Dr. Khoi Lee, UCSF). GST fusion proteins encoded by this vector contain a 5-amino acid recognition element for the catalytic domain of bovine heart muscle kinase, which was used to label the fusion protein with [γ-32P]ATP. Purified GST-Shc fusion proteins were produced as described previously(27Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Shc and Syk immunoprecipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Membranes were denatured and then renatured with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, blocked with milk and incubated with 250 × 103 cpm/ml radioactively labeled GST-Shc overnight as described(13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). After hybridization, membranes were washed and then exposed to film. Bound GST-Shc was removed from membranes before reprobing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Membranes were first incubated in stripping solution (0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.7) at 50°C for 30 min. Membranes were then washed, reblocked, and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting as described above. Recent reports have demonstrated that stimulation through a variety of receptors in different cell types results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the signaling adapter protein Shc and the association of Shc with a 145-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. For example, BCR cross-linking in B lymphocytes(4Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar), macrophage colony-stimulating factor treatment of myeloid cells(21Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5682-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and IL-3, Steel factor, and erythropoietin treatment of responsive hematopoietic stem cell lines (22Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) all induce the appearance of a 140-150-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in Shc immunoprecipitates. This could reflect induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p145, induced association of p145 with Shc, or both. In order to better understand the nature of this complex and, hence, its role in B cell responses, it was important to determine first whether Shc•p145 was present as a complex in unstimulated B cells or whether the association of p145 and Shc required stimulation of the cells. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated Shc from either resting or BCR-stimulated 35S-labeled cells (Fig. 1A). Biosynthetically labeled p145 only coprecipitated with Shc after cell stimulation, demonstrating that the association between these proteins was inducible. Other Shc-associated proteins were also observed in this way. The prominent 70-kDa species visible only in stimulated lysates was detected by anti-mouse Ig immunoblotting and therefore is likely to be endogenous immunoglobulin μ heavy chain that was immunoprecipitated by the stimulating antibody. In addition to p145, proteins of 40, 45, 100, and 110 kDa coprecipitated with Shc at 15 and 30 min following stimulation. The identity of these bands was unknown, and none were recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. However, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the same samples showed the prominent doublet of Shc-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at 140 and 145 kDa (Fig. 1B). In addition, a weaker tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 150 kDa was sometimes seen. To confirm that the inducibly associated 140- and 145-kDa proteins were indeed the tyrosine-phosphorylated species observed, the 35S-labeled Shc immunoprecipitates were dissociated by treatment with 2% SDS and then reimmunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The metabolically labeled protein doublet at 140-145 kDa was reprecipitated in this way (data not shown), indicating that these bands corresponded to the p145 tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We believe that these bands were all isoforms of the same protein as each of these proteins exhibited the same properties in all of the experiments reported here. The nature of the changes that caused differential migration are not known at this time. These bands retained their different mobilities after de-phosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase (data not shown), suggesting that some property other than phosphorylation was responsible for the differential mobility of these bands. We also examined the kinetics of the Shc•p145 complex formation to determine whether this was a transient response or a prolonged signaling event following BCR stimulation (Fig. 1). The phosphotyrosine content of Shc and p145 increased rapidly and then decreased sharply by 30 min after stimulation. This response peaked at 8-10 min (data not shown). There was only faintly detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated p145 associated with Shc by 90 min after stimulation. The association of p145 with Shc as detected with biosynthetically labeled protein declined over a similar time course (Fig. 1A), except that the sensitivity of detection by metabolic labeling was less so the small amount of complex remaining at 90 min could only be detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The correlation observed between tyrosine phosphorylation and association was consistent with a requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and/or p145 proteins for the complex to remain intact. As Shc has two domains capable of interacting with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, it is likely that BCR stimulation induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p145 and this in turn led to Shc binding. Indeed, it was recently reported that p145 isolated from fibroblasts must be tyrosine-phosphorylated for in vitro association with Shc(13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins by BCR cross-linking requires the activities of intracellular tyrosine kinases. As the tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn play important roles in signaling by the BCR(28DeFranco A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we employed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to examine whether either of these kinases associated with Shc and/or Shc-associated p145 upon stimulation of B cells. The Syk- or Lyn-immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In agreement with previous reports(29Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that Syk was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to BCR stimulation in B cells. Additionally, Syk immunoprecipitates (but not Lyn immunoprecipitates; data not shown) from BCR-stimulated B cells contained a p145 tyrosine-phosphorylated doublet (Fig. 2A). This Syk-associated doublet comigrated with the Shc-associated p145 doublet, suggesting they might be the same proteins. This suggested the possibility that Shc and Syk might interact to form a trimolecular complex with p145. However, there was no detectable Shc protein in the anti-Syk immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B). Correspondingly, there was no Syk detected in the anti-Shc immunoprecipitates. Thus, the Syk•p145 complex did not include detectable amounts of Shc. The p145 protein associated with Syk appeared to be the same as the p145 associated with Shc both by electrophoretic mobility and pattern of anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. To determine in a more direct manner whether these tyrosine-phosphorylated p145 proteins were indeed the same protein, we examined whether Shc could associate with p145 protein that was isolated by virtue of its association with Syk. For this purpose, we made use of previous observations that recombinant proteins containing full-length Shc fused to GST (GST-Shc) can interact with Shc-associated p145 resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose(13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Shc or Syk immunoprecipitates containing either Shc-associated or Syk-associated p145 respectively were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 32P-labeled GST-Shc proteins. As previously reported, GST-Shc proteins associated with p145 that had been coprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies. Importantly, GST-Shc also associated with p145 that had been coprecipitated with anti-Syk antibodies (Fig. 3A). The signal associated with Syk-associated p145 was comparable to that seen with Shc-associated p145. This observation provides evidence that the p145 proteins that associated with Syk and with Shc were the same. Finally, the Shc-associated and Syk-associated p145 proteins were immunologically related. Hybridomas were generated from spleen cells of mice immunized with purified, Shc-associated p145. Monoclonal antibodies were selected on the basis of reactivity with Shc-associated p145 by immunoblotting. One monoclonal antibody, 4U2, reacted in an immunoblot with both the Shc-associated, and Syk-associated p140, p145, and p150 phosphotyrosine containing proteins (Fig. 4). This monoclonal also reacted with a protein of 165 kDa, which did not appear to be tyrosine-phosphorylated. The identity of this protein is not known. The anti-p145 reactivity did not represent anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity since this monoclonal antibody still immunoblotted p145 that was dephosphorylated by calf intestinal phosphatase (data not shown). As p145 had not been previously reported to coprecipitate with Syk, it was important to demonstrate that the observed coimmunoprecipitation of Syk and p145 in activated B cells was not due to anti-p145 reactivity in the anti-Syk antiserum. To address this issue, we made use of a chicken B cell line (S1.10) in which Syk is not expressed because the syk genes had been disrupted by homologous recombination (31Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The knockout cells responded poorly to BCR stimulation, as previously reported, but they exhibited appreciable tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins following treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. In the parental Syk-expressing chicken B cell line, DT40, pervanadate treatment resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p145 and its coimmunoprecipitation with Shc and to a lesser extent with Syk (Fig. 5). The p145 protein appeared as a single band in these chicken cells, a pattern that has been reported previously in some mammalian cell types(13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 21Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5682-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the pervanadate-treated syk- cells (S1.10), phosphorylated p145 was coprecipitated by the anti-Shc antiserum but not by the anti-Syk antiserum (Fig. 5). Thus, anti-Syk antiserum only immunoprecipitated p145 from cells expressing Syk protein, demonstrating that the coprecipitation of the two proteins was not due to a cross-reactivity of the anti-Syk antiserum with p145 or some other p145-associated protein. Next, we wanted to see if other means of stimulating B cells would also lead to the signaling events described above. We chose to examine IL-4, as this cytokine has several physiologically important effects on B lymphocytes. For example, IL-4 can increase surface expression of class II major histocompatibility complex proteins, induce class switching to IgE, and potentiate proliferation induced by BCR stimulation. The signaling mechanisms that lead to these responses are only partly understood. It is known that, as with other cytokine/hematopoeitin receptors, the IL-4 receptor can activate JAK kinases and STAT t"
https://openalex.org/W2092052750,"In order to characterize the structure and regulation of members of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) family (Type IV PDEs; PDE4 family), we have cloned from the rat a cDNA, pRPDE39, encoding a novel member of this family, which we call RNPDE4A8. Sequencing of the pRPDE39 cDNA shows it to be encoded by the rat PDE4A gene, but to differ from two other PDE4A transcripts, RD1 (pRPDE8; RNPDE4A1) and pRPDE6 (RNPDE4A5), by the presence of a unique region at its 5′ end, consistent with alternative mRNA splicing. The pRPDE39 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 763 amino acids, of which all but 21, located at the extreme amino terminus, are found in the pRPDE6 protein. Expression of pRPDE39 in COS cells produced a protein of 98 ± 1.4 kDa, as determined by immunoblotting with an antiserum specific to the carboxyl-terminal regions of all PDE4A proteins, compared to a predicted value of 87.5 kDa. RNase protection analysis detected pRPDE39 mRNA only in testis. Immunoblotting of testis extracts demonstrated two bands of 97 ± 2 and 87 ± 3 kDa, the larger of which co-migrated with the band seen in COS cells expressing pRPDE39. COS cell expressed pRPDE39 partitioned between a high speed pellet (particulate) fraction (15% of protein; 8% of activity) and a cytosolic fraction. The particulate fraction had a Km for cAMP of 3.3 ± 0.6 μM, and the cytosolic fraction a Km of 5.4 ± 2.8 μM. The Vmax values for the pRPDE39 protein, relative to the RD1 protein, were 0.16 ± 0.06 and 0.29 ± 0.05 for the particulate and cytosolic forms, respectively. The pRPDE39-encoded PDE activity could not be removed from the particulate fraction by high salt concentrations, or by nonionic detergents. The pRPDE39-encoded enzyme was inhibited by rolipram at an IC50 of 0.5 ± 0.2 μM for the particulate form and 1.0 ± 0.2 μM for the cytosolic form, which are values typical of PDE4 family members. The highly tissue-specific distribution of the pRPDE39 mRNA suggests that the pRPDE39 protein functions to modulate a cAMP signaling pathway that is present largely, if not exclusively, in the testis.

INTRODUCTIONThe cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE(s)cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase(s)rolipram4-[3-(cyclopentoxyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidinoneUCRupstream conserved region. are a large family of enzymes that are differentiated from other cyclic nucleotide PDEs by their high specificity and affinity for cAMP and by their inhibition by a specific class of compounds, including the antidepressant drug rolipram(1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bolger G.B. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 8: 851-859Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). They are also the closest mammalian homologs of the dunce gene of Drosophila melanogaster, which was first isolated as a mutation affecting learning and memory(3Qiu Y.H. Chen C.N. Malone T. Richter L. Beckendorf S.K. Davis R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cAMP-specific PDE proteins are encoded by four genes in mammals (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), and at least three of these genes encode multiple PDE isoforms, generated from different alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts (reviewed in Refs. 2Bolger G.B. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 8: 851-859Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 4Conti M. Jin S.L. Monaco L. Repaske D.R. Swinnen J.V. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of this diversity of cAMP-specific PDE isoforms is not known. However, the rat PDE4 genes have different patterns of expression in tissues, suggesting, but not proving, that they have different functions (5Davis R.L. Takayasu H. Eberwine M. Myres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Swinnen J.V. Joseph D.R. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various alternatively spliced mRNAs from each of at least three different PDE4 genes also have different regional patterns of expression in the brain(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by various alternatively spliced mRNAs from some of the mammalian PDE4 genes have, in some cases, been shown to have functional differences: for example, the different proteins encoded by various rat PDE4D mRNAs differ in their regulation by phosphorylation(10Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and those encoded by different rat PDE4A transcripts differ in cellular localization (see below).We and others have isolated cDNA clones derived from different mRNA transcripts of the rat PDE4A gene, studied the tissue distribution of these mRNAs, and analyzed the biochemical and pharmacologic properties and tissue localization of their encoded proteins(5Davis R.L.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) cDNA clones, encodes an enzyme of 610 amino acids that is expressed primarily in the brain, particularly the cerebellum(9Bolger G.B.

Houslay M.D. Biochem J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The RD1 protein is present exclusively in the high speed pellet, or particulate, fraction of cellular extracts, consistent with its associating directly or indirectly with membranes. A second rat PDE4A transcript, RNPDE4A5, represented by the pRPDE6 cDNA, is also expressed in brain and encodes a protein of 844 amino acids that is present in both particulate and cytosolic forms(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We now report a novel alternatively spliced mRNA transcript from the rat PDE4A locus, which we call RNPDE4A8 (using the accepted nomenclature(1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar)), and demonstrate that it is expressed almost exclusively in the testis. RNPDE4A8 encodes a rolipram-inhibited, cAMP-specific PDE of 763 amino acids that is present in both particulate and cytosolic forms. The highly specific tissue-specific distribution of the RNPDE4A8 protein suggests that it functions in a signal transduction pathway that is present largely, or exclusively, in the testis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsA rat (Rattus norwegenesis; Sprague-Dawley strain) brain cDNA library, cloned into the EcoRI site of Lambda ZAP, was obtained from Stratagene. DNA modifying and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs or Life Technologies, Inc. Culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Sequence reagents and radionucleotides and [3H]cAMP were from Amersham. Leupeptin was from Peptide Research Foundation (distributed by Scientific Marketing Associates). Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma or Boehringer. Rolipram was a generous gift from Schering AG.Isolation and Analysis of cDNA ClonesProcedures were as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), unless otherwise specified. The rat brain cDNA library was screened with a hybridization probe from a portion of the rat pRPDE3 cDNA (rat PDE4D locus), corresponding to amino acids 83 to 333 of the alignment published previously(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled using random priming, and hybridization was done at 68°C in 6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, and the final wash at 68°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands with Sequenase, using the manufacturer's instructions, or by dye-cycle sequencing using an ABI prism sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Amino acid sequence alignments were performed with the Genalign program (Intelligenetics).RNase Protection AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from various tissues of rat (Rattus norwegenesis) using the guanidine thiocyanate/CsCl method(17MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Single-stranded antisense RNA probes were generated from portions of cDNAs cloned under the control of the SP6 promoter (in pGEM3Zf or pGEM4Zf (Promega)). The probe for the 3′ terminus of pRPDE8 corresponded to nucleotides 2172 to 2433, outside of the coding region(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The probes for the alternatively spliced 5′ portions of the cDNAs corresponded to amino acids 32-93 of pRPDE6 (Fig. 2) and to noncoding regions (9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) of pRPDE8 (nucleotides 1-156) and pRPDE39 (nucleotides 1-205). RNase protection was done as described(18Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), with 10 μg of RNA per reaction. RNase digestions were done for 1 h at 35°C with RNase ONE (Promega), at a concentration of 3 units/reaction, with the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Gels (6% acrylamide, 7 M urea, 1 × TBE) were autoradiographed at −70°C for 1-4 days with intensifying screens.Generation and Expression of COS Cell Expression VectorsConstructs containing the full ORF of RD1 (pRPDE8) cDNA in pSVL (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)) and pRPDE6 cDNA in pSV.SPORT1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) have been previously described (12Shakur Y.

J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In both of these constructs, the insert is expressed under the control of the SV40 early promoter. The met26RD1 construct expresses a truncated species of pRPDE8 (RD1) lacking the first 25 amino acids(12Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To generate pcDNA-RPDE39, the complete ORF of pRPDE39 was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter, using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites present in the cDNA. Transfection of monkey COS-7 cells was done as described previously (15McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Generation and Characterization of AntiseraA rabbit polyclonal antiserum, described previously(14Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L. Campbell A.M. Beattie J. Daly C. Houslay M.D. Biochem J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was generated against a synthetic peptide of 12 amino acids of the sequence COOH-TPGRWGSGGDPA-NH3. This sequence corresponds to a portion of the carboxyl-terminal region in common with all of the known rat PDE4A proteins. Several antisera were generated independently in this manner, and all performed similarly. All the results in this paper were obtained with one antiserum (271), as described previously(14Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L. Campbell A.M. Beattie J. Daly C. Houslay M.D. Biochem J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Preparation and Fractionation of Tissue HomogenatesHomogenates from whole brain or testis were prepared as described previously for cerebellum(13Lobban M. Shakur Y. Beattie J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L. Campbell A.M. Beattie J. Daly C. Houslay M.D. Biochem J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These homogenates were then fractionated as follows. For the low speed pellet (P1), they were spun at 1000 × gav for 10 min. The supernatant from this step was then spun at 100,000 × gav for 1 h to yield a high speed pellet (P2; particulate) fraction and a supernatant (SN; cytosol) fraction.Treatment of High Speed Pellet Fractions with Salt or DetergentHigh speed pellet preparations (0.2 mg) were treated with KHEM buffer (50 mM KCl, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, 10 mM EGTA, 1.92 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2) containing a range of NaCl or Triton X-100 concentrations, respectively. They were then incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in KHEM plus the appropriate NaCl or Triton X-100 concentration, and the pellet and supernatant were then analyzed by immunoblotting.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingThese were as described previously(15McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 222: 680-682Crossref Scopus (205998) Google Scholar).Relative Vmax DeterminationsThese were performed as described previously(14Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L. Campbell A.M. Beattie J. Daly C. Houslay M.D. Biochem J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of high speed pellet protein (25-200 μg) from COS cells, transfected with various PDE-expressing plasmids, were analyzed by immunoblotting. The blots were scanned, and the optical density versus μg of sample protein plotted in order to determine the relative concentrations of PDE in each of the preparations. For the Vmax determinations, amounts of membrane protein which would provide equal amounts of PDE protein were used in PDE assays. Vmax values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk (20Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) plots.PDE AssaysPDE activity using 1 μM cAMP as substrate was assayed by a modification of the procedure of Thompson and Appleman (21Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Rutten et al. (22Rutten W.J. Schoot B.M. Dupont J.S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 315: 378-383Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as described previously(23Marchmont R.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All assays were conducted at 30°C, and, in all experiments, a freshly prepared slurry of Dowex:H2O:ethanol (1:1:1) was used. In all experiments, initial rates were taken from linear time courses of activity. Dose-dependent inhibition by rolipram was determined in the presence of Km for cAMP concentrations of cAMP over a range (8-10 different values) of 10 nM to 100 μM rolipram. The IC50 was then determined from these values. Rolipram was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide as a 1 mM stock and diluted in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2 to provide a range of concentrations in the assay. The residual levels of dimethyl sulfoxide were shown not to affect PDE activity over the ranges used in this study. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as a standard(24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar).RESULTSIsolation of cDNA Clones for the RNPDE4A8 mRNATo search for additional mRNA splice variants encoded by the rat PDE4A gene, a probe from the 5′ end of the pRPDE3 cDNA clone (rat PDE4D gene(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) was used to screen a rat testis cDNA library. A testis library was chosen because of the work of Swinnen et al. (6Swinnen J.V. Joseph D.R. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5325-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) demonstrating that PDE4A transcripts were present in testis. Three different cDNA clones, all derived from the same mRNA, were each isolated multiple times. The longest of these, pRPDE39 (Fig. 1), contained one open reading frame (ORF), which was confirmed over its entire length by at least one other overlapping cDNA clone. pRPDE39 encodes a protein of 763 amino acids, of which all but 21, located at the extreme amino terminus, are contained in pRPDE6 (Fig. 2). The putative initiation ATG of the pRPDE39 protein is preceded upstream by termination codons in all three frames, although it only weakly satisfies the criteria of Kozak(25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). Like pRPDE6, but unlike RD1 (pRPDE8), pRPDE39 contains complete upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2). UCR1 and UCR2 are regions of the amino-terminal sequence that are unique to the cAMP-specific PDEs and are highly conserved among species as evolutionarily divergent as D. melanogaster and humans(18Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The point of divergence between pRPDE39 and pRPDE6 (indicated by A in Fig. 2) corresponds to the major point of alternative splicing in the D. melanogaster dunce mRNAs (3Qiu Y.H. Chen C.N. Malone T. Richter L. Beckendorf S.K. Davis R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and also in alternatively spliced mRNAs from the human PDE4A and PDE4D genes(18Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This suggests that pRPDE39 and pRPDE6 are derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs, and that their unique 5′ regions are encoded by separate exon(s).Figure 1:Structure of mRNA transcripts from the rat PDE4A gene. The numbers indicate cDNAs derived from each transcript, as follows: 1, pRPDE6 (RNPDE4A5); 2, pRPDE39 (RNPDE4A8); 3, pRPDE8 (RNPDE4A1; also represented by the RD1 cDNA); 4, met26RD1, an engineered construct containing a deletion of all of the upstream regions of transcripts 1, 2, and 3, and using the methionine at amino acid position 26 of pRPDE8 as the initiation codon(12Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The heavy line indicates sequences common to D. melanogaster and mammalian cAMP-specific PDEs, which contain the consensus regions upstream conserved region 1 (UCR1), upstream conserved region 2 (UCR2), and the catalytic region (Catalytic), as indicated in the bottom of the figure. Thinner lines indicate sequence regions unique to each cDNA. The lines merge where the sequences of the cDNAs join that of the consensus sequence.

Transcripts from this gene had been shown previously to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues, although the relative contributions of the pRPDE6, RD1 (pRPDE8), and pRPDE39 transcripts in each of these tissues was not defined(5Davis R.L. Takayasu H. Eberwine M. Myres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Swinnen J.V. Joseph D.R. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, we have reported previously the distribution of the pRPDE6 and RD1 (pRPDE8) mRNAs(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and their respective proteins, in the brain (15McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The distribution of the various alternatively spliced PDE4A mRNAs in various rat tissues was measured by RNase protection (Fig. 3). Single-stranded RNA probes complementary to the alternatively spliced regions of the pRPDE6, pRPDE8, and pRPDE39 cDNAs were used to probe total RNA isolated form various rat tissues. To determine the total amount of PDE4A mRNA in each of these tissues, a probe from the 3′ terminus of pRPDE8, which detects all known PDE4A transcripts, was used as a comparison. Using this probe, transcripts from the PDE4A gene were found to be expressed in almost all tissues examined, as described previously(5Davis R.L. Takayasu H. Eberwine M. Myres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Swinnen J.V. Joseph D.R. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This probe was designed to protect a 240-nucleotide fragment, but also generated a number of larger bands with the digestion and electrophoresis methods used (Fig. 3A). With a probe from the alternatively spliced region of the pRPDE8 cDNA, pRPDE8 transcripts were found to be most abundant in brain, with a roughly equal distribution in various regions of the brain, as reported previously(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). pRPDE6 transcripts were by far the most abundant in the olfactory bulb. The predominant band seen with the pRPDE6 probe was 135 nucleotides, which was smaller than the faint signals generated from nonolfactory brain tissues that we reported previously(9Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A 135-nucleotide signal was also seen from cerebral cortex tissues on prolonged (3-4-day) exposures of the pRPDE6 autoradiogram. pRPDE39 transcripts were highly expressed in testis, with little or no expression in any other tissue examined.Figure 3:Expression of the alternatively spliced mRNAs from the PDE4A gene in tissues. RNase protection assays with probes corresponding to the 3′ terminus of pRPDE8 (A) and the alternatively spliced regions of pRPDE8 (B), pRPDE6 (C), and pRPDE39 (D) was performed using total RNA (10 μg) from various rat tissues. Arrowheads indicate the position of the RNA fragment protected by each probe. Size markers (in nucleotides) are indicated in the outside lanes, or as short horizontal lines on the sides of the panels, representing MspI-digested pBR322. Lanes are as follows: 1, probe without RNase; 2, kidney; 3, testis; 4, heart; 5, lung; 6, spleen; 7, liver; 8, skeletal muscle; 9, olfactory bulb; 10, brainstem; 11, cerebellum; 12, occipital cortex; 13, parietal cortex; 14, temporal cortex; 15, frontal cortex; 16, tRNA (10 μg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of the pRPDE39 cDNA in COS CellsTo characterize the PDE encoded by the pRPDE39 cDNA, it was expressed in COS cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus intermediate early gene promoter. Immunoblotting of extracts from COS cells expressing pRPDE39, using an antibody raised against a dodecapeptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, demonstrated that the pRPDE39-encoded protein migrated as single species of 98 ± 1.4 kDa (Fig. 4), as compared to a predicted value of 87.5 kDa. By comparison, the RD1 protein and the pRPDE6 protein migrated at approximately 76 kDa and 107 kDa, respectively, as reported previously(15McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All of these values are greater than those predicted on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence of these proteins. It is possible that this may reflect particular conformational properties or the anomalous binding to SDS, of these proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Figure 4:Expression of pRPDE39 protein in various tissues and in COS cells, as measured by immunoblotting.

The types VIII-B and -C cDNAs differ from that of type VIII-A by deletion of 90 and 198 base pair exons, respectively, which encode a 30-amino acid extracellular domain with two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation and a 66-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Stable expression of types VIII-A, -B, and -C cDNAs in human embryonal kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells leads to the appearance of novel proteins, which are recognized by type VIII-specific antibodies and which co-migrate with immunoreactive species detected on immunoblots of rat brain membranes. Types VIII-A and -C are modified by N-linked glycosylation, while type VIII-B is insensitive to treatment with N-glycosidase F.

Adenylyl cyclase activity of each of the variants is stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin and the EC50 for activation of type VIII-C is one fourth of that for either type VIII-A or -B. Type VIII-C also has a distinct Km for substrate, which is approximately 4-12-fold higher than that for types VIII-A or -B depending on whether Mn2+ or Mg2+ is the counterion for ATP.

McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor AP-1 is comprised of members of the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) protein families(24Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 25Vogt P.K. Bos T.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 55: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that a Jun-Fos heterodimer is an integral component of the nuclear complex bound to this essential GSTP1 promoter element in a multidrug-resistant derivative (VCREMS) of the human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF7. In addition, we have identified a negative regulatory element (−105 to −86) that acts to suppress GSTP1 transcription in MCF7 cells(1Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of the GSTP1 proximal promoter revealed the presence of two putative Sp1 binding sites (−57 to −49 and −47 to −39) located downstream of the AP-1 response element. The transcription factor Sp1 was first identified as a regulatory protein that bound multiple GC-rich boxes in the 21-bp repeat elements of the SV40 early promoter(26Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Since this initial observation, Sp1 has been shown to regulate the activity of a large number of viral and cellular promoters. The DNA binding domain of Sp1 consists of three zinc finger motifs (31Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) and recognizes the 9-bp sequence GGGGCGGGG, in which each triplet is thought to be contacted by one of the three zinc fingers(32Kadonaga J.T.

In addition, the functional significance of these DNA-protein interactions in regulating GSTP1 promoter activity is addressed. Finally, we investigate the involvement of Sp1 in mediating the suppressive effects of the GSTP1 transcriptional repressor in MCF7 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureThe VCREMS cell line (a generous gift from Dr. Bridget Hill) was derived by selecting the human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF7, for resistance to vincristine(36Whelan R.D.H. Waring C.J. Wolf C.R. Hayes J.D. Hosking L.K. Hill B.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). VCREMS, MCF7, the human bladder carcinoma cell line, EJ, HepG2, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin mixture (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland).Northern AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was isolated from MCF7, VCREMS, EJ, HepG2, and HeLa cells using the procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62963) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoretically fractionated and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham International, Amersham, UK). A full-length (800 bp, EcoRI-digested) GSTP1 cDNA fragment (38Kano T. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5626-5630PubMed Google Scholar) was labeled by the random priming method (39Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16566) Google Scholar) and used to determine the relative levels of GSTP1 mRNA in each cell line. Northern blots were washed to high stringency: 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Autoradiography was performed using X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak) and two intensifying screens at −70°C.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayNuclear extracts from MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells were prepared using the method described by Dignam et al. (40Dignam S.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(1Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of MCF7, VCREMS, or EJ nuclear extract was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2 ng of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled DNA fragment in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 12 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 0.12 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Each reaction mixture was then loaded onto a prerun (200 V for 2 h at 4°C) 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 cross-linking ratio) containing 0.3 × TBE. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 2 h at 4°C, and the gel was then dried and autoradiographed.In competition experiments, the reaction mixture was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA (or 3 μl of polyclonal anti-human Sp1 antisera; a generous gift from Dr. Stephen Jackson) before the addition of radiolabeled probe.The following oligonucleotides and their complementary sequences were used as probes and competitors: the GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32, 5′-CACTGGGGCGGAGCGGGGCGGGACCACCCT-3′; 5′-CACTGTCAAGGAGCGGGGCGGGACCACCCT-3′ (M1); 5′-CACTGGGGCGGAGCGTCAAGGGACCACCCT-3′ (M2); 5′-CACTG TCAAGGAGCG TCAAGGGACCACCCT-3′ (M3); the GSTP1 promoter fragment −53 to −32, 5′-CGGAGCGGGGCGGGACCACCCT-3′ and the Sp1 consensus sequence 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ from the SV40 early promoter (32Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem.

McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by ligating deletion fragments of the GSTP1 promoter (−105 to +36, −73 to +36, and −65 to +36 with HindIII and SalI linkers) into the HindIII/SalI-digested pCAT. Basic vector (Promega, Southampton, UK).Using p73CAT as a template, mutated GSTP1 promoter fragments were generated by PCR using the following upstream primers (with HindIII linkers) to prepare p73Sp1M1CAT, p73Sp1M2CAT, and p73Sp1M3CAT: 5′-GCCGTGACTCAGCACTGTCAAGGAGCGGGGCGGGACCACCCT-3′ (p73Sp1M1CAT), 5′-GCCGTGACTCAGCACTGGGGCGGAGCGTCAAGGGACCACCCT-3′ (p73Sp1M2CAT), and 5′-GCCGTGACTCAGCACTGTCAAGGAGCGTCAAGGGACCACCCT-3′ (p73Sp1M3CAT).Using p73Sp1M1CAT, p73Sp1M2CAT, or p73Sp1M3CAT as a template, an oligonucleotide representing the GSTP1 promoter region −105 to −59, was used as an upstream primer (with HindIII linker) in PCR to generate the three mutated GSTP1 promoter fragments used to prepare p105Sp1M1CAT, p105Sp1M2CAT, and p105Sp1M3CAT: 5′-AGTCCGCGGGACCCTCCAGAAGAGCGGCCGGCGCCGTGACTCAGCAC-3′.The downstream primer (nucleotides +17 to +36 with SalI linker) used in PCR to generate the six mutated fragments for preparation of the three p73CAT and three p105CAT mutant constructs was 5′-ACTCACTGGTGGCGAAGACT-3′.Following preparation, all constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method(42Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52331) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection AssaysDNA transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (43Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Gorman (44Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 3. IRL Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar) with the exception that glycerol was omitted. Cell extracts were assayed for protein content(45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was determined as described previously (46Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) and modified by Sambrook et al. (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In all experiments, pCAT. Control (Promega), which contained the SV40 enhancer and promoter, was used as a positive control, and the promoterless pCAT. Basic was used as a negative control.RESULTSCell-specific Expression of GSTP1 mRNATo examine the role of Sp1 in regulating activity of the GSTP1 promoter in different cell types, we tested the expression of GSTP1 mRNA in five cell lines, MCF7, VCREMS, EJ, HepG2, and HeLa. Following this analysis, we chose to utilize MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells, which exhibited widely varying endogenous levels of GSTP1 mRNA (Fig. 1).The cell line expressing the highest amount of GSTP1 mRNA was the human bladder carcinoma cell line, EJ. In addition, we also used the human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF7, in which GSTP1 mRNA was not detectable by Northern analysis, and its multidrug-resistant derivative, VCREMS in which substantial levels of GSTP1 mRNA were readily measurable.In Vitro Binding of Nuclear Proteins to the GSTP1 Promoter Fragment −61 to −32 in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ CellsAnalysis of the GSTP1 proximal promoter region (−73 to −27) revealed three potentially important features that are highlighted in Fig. 2, namely one putative AP-1 binding site (−69 to −63) and two sequences homologous to Sp1 recognition elements (−57 to −49 and −47 to −39). Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated a functional role for the AP-1 response element, which binds a Jun-Fos heterodimer in VCREMS cells(1Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the importance of the two putative Sp1 binding sites had not been investigated.Figure 2:Primary structure of the GSTP1 proximal promoter. The putative AP-1 (−69 to −63) and Sp1 (−57 to −49 and −47 to −39) recognition motifs are shaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of these potential recognition sequences in the GSTP1 promoter to bind Sp1 was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. For these studies, four double stranded DNA probes spanning the GSTP1 promoter region, −61 to −32, were prepared (Fig. 3A). The wild-type sequence (−61 to −32) contained both of the Sp1-like elements. M1 contained a 4-bp mutation in the distal site (−57 to −49), whereas a 4-bp mutation was introduced into the proximal site (−47 to −39) to generate M2. In addition, M3 contained 4-bp mutations in both elements. The ability of each of these four GSTP1 promoter fragments to bind proteins in nuclear extracts prepared from MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells was then tested.Figure 3:In vitro binding of nuclear proteins to the GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32. A, mutational analysis of the two potential Sp1 binding sites located within the GSTP1 promoter. B, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrating the nuclear complexes (10 μg of nuclear extract per reaction) in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells that bound the GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32 and the mutated fragments M1, M2, and M3. C, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrating the nuclear complexes (10 μg of nuclear extract per reaction) in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells bound to a single Sp1 binding site. The GSTP1 promoter fragment −53 to −32 and the Sp1 consensus sequence from the SV40 early promoter were used as probes. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3B shows that the wild-type sequence bound three major complexes. Interestingly, both the mobility pattern and the relative intensity of these bands were similar in each cell line. Despite the mutations described above, M1 and M2 both gave the same result as the wild-type sequence. This finding suggests that perhaps sequences flanking the Sp1 motifs were responsible for the observed band shift pattern or alternatively that only one of the two Sp1 elements was occupied at one time. The latter explanation seemed more likely because M3, which contained specific mutations in both of the Sp1-like elements, failed to bind any nuclear proteins.To further emphasize this possibility, a GSTP1 promoter fragment spanning nucleotides −53 to −32 and thus containing only the proximal Sp1 motif and a probe containing a single Sp1 consensus sequence from the SV40 early promoter, produced the same results as the wild-type sequence, which contained two potential Sp1 binding elements (Fig. 3C).DNA Binding Specificity of the Nuclear Complexes Bound to the GSTP1 Promoter Fragment −61 to −32To determine the binding specificity of these nuclear proteins, the ability of M1, M2, and M3 to compete for the three complexes bound to the wild-type sequence was assessed (Fig. 4). Consistent with results shown in Fig. 3B, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled M1 or M2 was able to efficiently compete for the nuclear proteins bound to the wild-type sequence, whereas no competition was observed with excess unlabeled M3.Figure 4:DNA binding specificity of the nuclear complexes bound to the GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32. Double stranded oligonucleotides containing the mutated fragments M1, M2, and M3 (see Fig. 3A) were used at 100-fold molar excess to compete for the nuclear complexes (10 μg of nuclear extract per reaction) bound to the wild-type GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32. Binding specificity was confirmed using 100-fold molar excess of the Sp1 consensus sequence from the SV40 early promoter as a positive control and the AP-1 binding site from the human collagenase promoter as a negative control. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, efficient competition for the three nuclear complexes was observed with the single Sp1 consensus sequence from the SV40 early promoter but not with the nonspecific AP-1 binding site from the human collagenase promoter. As shown for the experiments presented in Fig. 3(B and C), identical results were observed in all three cell lines.Sp1 Polyclonal Antisera Inhibited Binding of Two of the Nuclear Complexes Bound to the GSTP1 Promoter Element −61 to −32Results presented above have demonstrated that three major complexes were specifically bound to the GSTP1 promoter region −61 to −32. However, despite the presence of two sequence motifs exhibiting strong homology with an Sp1 binding site, this data did not prove that Sp1 was represented by any of these nuclear complexes.To clarify this matter, nuclear extracts were incubated with a polyclonal Sp1 antibody for 20 min before the −61 to −32 probe was added to the reaction. Fig. 5 clearly shows that the Sp1 antibody disrupted binding of the complexes I and II in all three cell lines, although the high mobility complex III was unaffected. Importantly, preimmune sera did not interfere with the DNA binding activity of any of the three complexes. These results conclusively demonstrated that Sp1 was an integral component of complexes I and II in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells. However, the protein composition of complex III remains unknown.Figure 5:Inhibition of complex formation with Sp1 polyclonal antisera. MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ nuclear extracts (10 μg/reaction) were preincubated with polyclonal antisera (3 μl/reaction) raised against bacterially expressed human Sp1 for 20 min prior to the addition of the GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32. Preimmune serum was used as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the Absence of the AP-1 Element, the Two Sp1 Binding Motifs Were Insufficient to Support GSTP1 TranscriptionTo assess the functional importance of these Sp1 binding sites for GSTP1 transcription, transient transfection assays were performed with the GSTP1 promoter deletion constructs, p73CAT and p65CAT (containing the GSTP1 promoter fragments, −73 to +36 and −65 to +36, respectively). p73CAT contained an intact AP-1 response element (−69 to −63) as well as the two Sp1 motifs, but the AP-1 site had been disrupted in p65CAT. Fig. 6 clearly shows that p73CAT was strongly active in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells. However, in all three cell lines, loss of the AP-1 element abolished transcriptional activity of the GSTP1 promoter. This result clearly indicated that the two Sp1 motifs, in the absence of the AP-1 element, were not sufficient for GSTP1 transcription.Figure 6:In the absence of the AP-1 element, the Sp1 binding sites alone were insufficient to confer optimal activity to the GSTP1 promoter. The GSTP1 promoter fragments −73 to +36 and −65 to +36 were subcloned into the pCAT. Basic vector to generate p73CAT and p65CAT, respectively. Both of these constructs were transfected into MCF7 (black bars), VCREMS (cross-hatched bars), and EJ (shaded bars) cells, and their relative CAT activities were determined. pCAT.

The results were compared between cell lines by correcting for pCAT. Control activity levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, the role played by the two Sp1 binding sites in contributing to the high level of CAT activity observed for p73CAT was not clear, i.e. could the essential AP-1 element still confer optimal GSTP1 promoter activity in the absence of the Sp1 binding sites?The Presence of the Distal Sp1 Binding Site Was Required for Optimal Activity of the GSTP1 PromoterThe data presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5 show that using nuclear extract prepared from MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells, Sp1 was bound to the GSTP1 promoter fragment −61 to −32. Moreover, these experiments strongly indicated that only one of the two putative Sp1 response elements was utilized. However, this approach did not establish the functional importance of these DNA-protein interactions.The mutants described in Fig. 3A were introduced by PCR into the GSTP1 promoter fragment −73 to +36 and subcloned into the pCAT. Basic vector to generate p73Sp1M1CAT, p73Sp1M2CAT, and p73Sp1M3CAT. These mutated constructs were transfected into MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells, and their transcriptional activity was compared with that of p73CAT (Fig. 7). The results of these experiments showed that in all three cell lines, mutation of the distal Sp1 site (−57 to −49; p73Sp1M1CAT) reduced GSTP1 promoter activity by 45, 57, and 78% in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells, respectively. In contrast, mutation of the proximal binding motif (−47 to −39; p73Sp1M2CAT) had only a relatively marginal effect on GSTP1 transcription. Consistent with these results, mutation of both Sp1-like elements (p73Sp1M3CAT) produced effects on GSTP1 promoter activity similar to those of mutation of the distal site alone.Figure 7:The presence of the distal Sp1 binding site was required for optimal activity of the GSTP1 promoter. The mutations, M1, M2, and M3 (see Fig. 3A), were introduced by PCR into the GSTP1 promoter fragment −73 to +36 and subcloned into the pCAT. Basic vector to generate p73Sp1M1CAT, p73Sp1M2CAT, and p73Sp1M3CAT. These constructs were transfected into MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells, and their CAT activities were compared with that of p73CAT. The numbers at the top of each lane refer to CAT activities derived from each construct relative to p73CAT, which was given an activity level of 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together with the in vitro binding data, these results demonstrated that in MCF7, VCREMS, and EJ cells, Sp1 was preferentially bound to the distal Sp1 recognition sequence and that this interaction was required for optimal activity of the GSTP1 promoter.Loss of Sp1 Binding to the GSTP1 Promoter Did Not Inhibit GSTP1 Trans"
https://openalex.org/W1973895879,"Using metabolic labeling techniques in human intestinal epithelial cell lines in tissue culture and in situ hybridization techniques in normal and inflamed (Crohn's) intestine, recent studies have shown that there is synthesis of acute phase proteins in enterocytes. Moreover, these studies have shown that acute phase protein biosynthesis in enterocytes is regulated by inflammatory cytokines in a manner characteristic of the physiologic acute phase response. In the course of these studies it was noticed that one inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), mediated selective down-regulation of the enterocyte-specific, differentiation-dependent integral membrane protein sucrase-isomaltase (SI) in the Caco2 intestinal epithelial cell line. In the current study we examined the effect of several other inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interferon γ (IFNγ) on synthesis of SI in Caco2 cells, examined the possibility that inflammatory cytokines affect the synthesis of other enterocyte integral membrane proteins using lactase as a prototype, and examined the possibility that SI gene expression was down-regulated in villous enterocytes in vivo during the local inflammatory response of Crohn's disease. The results show that IL-6 and IFNγ each mediate a decrease and TNFα mediates an increase in synthesis of SI in Caco2 cells. The magnitude of down-regulation by IL-6 and IFNγ is significantly greater than the up-regulation by TNFα. IL-1β has no effect on synthesis of SI. Synthesis of lactase is not affected by any of the cytokines. There is a marked specific decrease in SI gene expression in villous enterocytes in acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum as compared to adjacent uninflamed ileum and normal ileum. Taken together, these data show that inflammatory cytokines have specific and selective effects on the expression of the brush border hydrolase SI in tissue culture and in vivo and provide evidence for a previously unrecognized mechanism for disaccharidase deficiency in intestinal inflammation.

Moreover, there is evidence that expression of these gene products in extrahepatic sites is regulated by cytokines in a manner characteristic of the physiologic acute phase response. For instance, we have found that positive acute phase reactant α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) is expressed in human intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco2 and T84 (10Perlmutter D.H. Daniels J.D. Auerbach H.S. De Schryver-Kecskemeti K. Winter H.D. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9485-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, moreover, that IL-6 mediates an increase in synthesis of α1-AT in these cell lines (11Hafeez W. Ciliberto G. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Caco2 and T84 cells were found to synthesize many other positive and negative acute phase reactants including α1-antichymotrypsin, serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen, ceruloplasmin, complement proteins C3, C4, and factor B, α-fetoprotein, and transferrin(12Molmenti E.P. Ziambaras T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14116-14124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of all these acute phase reactants was regulated by cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in exactly the same way that they are regulated in liver cells. In fact, effects of IL-1 and IL-6, which were found to be additive, synergistic, and antagonistic in liver cells in previous studies, were also observed in the intestinal epithelial cell lines. Finally, for at least one of these proteins, α1-AT, in situ hybridization analysis of normal and inflamed human intestine has shown that the expression and regulation of the acute phase gene in the cell lines accurately recapitulates expression and regulation of this gene in vivo (13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies of the acute phase response in the Caco2 cell line(12Molmenti E.P. Ziambaras T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14116-14124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that IL-6 had a marked and selective down-regulating effect on the expression of sucrose-isomaltase (SI). SI is not an acute phase reactant, but it is an enterocyte-specific, differentiation-dependent integral membrane protein. It is expressed in the adult small intestine where, as a brush border hydrolase, it is involved in the final steps of digestion of sucrose, starch and glycogen. Its expression is limited to the villous enterocyte(14Traber P.G. Yu L. Wu G.D. Judge T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G123-G130PubMed Google Scholar, 15Traber P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman L.R. Chang E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21815-21820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, together with lactase and intestinal alkaline phosphatase it is often used as a marker of terminal differentiation of enterocytes. SI is synthesized as a co-translationally glycosylated high mannose precursor with a molecular mass of ∼210 kDa(17Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This precursor is also subject to O-glycosylation in the Golgi and is finally targeted to the apical membrane. After SI has reached the apical membrane as a single-chain glycoprotein, it undergoes post-insertional cleavage by intraluminal pancreatic trypsin into the sucrase (molecular mass ∼130 kDa) and isomaltase (molecular mass ∼145 kDa) subunits(18Hauri H.P.

Physiol. 1991; 261: G847-G857PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we examined the possibility that inflammatory cytokines other than IL-6 mediate changes in expression of the SI gene in the model enterocyte cell line Caco2, whether inflammatory cytokines regulate expression of other brush border hydrolases in Caco2 cells, and whether SI gene expression is regulated in a local site of inflammation, acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. Ribonuclease A was purchased from Sigma, ribonuclease T1 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and DNase I and ribonuclease inhibitor were purchased from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI). 35S-UTP and [32P]CTP were purchased from DuPont NEN.

A subclone of Caco2 cells, Caco2/15, which has undergone only a limited number of passages and has higher levels of sucrase-isomaltase expression(24Cross H.D. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1173-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perlmutter D.H. Cole F.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. J. Biol.

Twelve days after reaching confluence, monolayers of these cells in six-well plates were rinsed well and then incubated at 37°C for time intervals up to 24 h in serum-free control medium with or without cytokine(s). Cells were then rinsed again and incubated at 37°C for 30-45 min in the presence of methionine-free medium containing 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were then solubilized and cell lysates subjected to clarification and trichloroacetic acid precipitation to determine relative total protein synthesis according to previously described protocols(10Perlmutter D.H. Daniels J.D. Auerbach H.S. De Schryver-Kecskemeti K. Winter H.D. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9485-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysate were incubated overnight at 4°C in 1% Triton X-100, 1.0% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, with excess antibody. Immune complexes were then precipitated with excess formalin-fixed staphylococci-bearing protein A (Immunoprecipitin, Life Technologies Inc.), washed, released by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and applied to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Gels were dried for fluorography as described previously(24Cross H.D. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1173-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A model 2222 Ultrascan XL laser densitometer from LKB Instruments, Inc. (Houston, TX) was used for scanning of fluorograms. Jejunal and ileal tissue was obtained from 2 different organ donors through the Mid America Transplant Association (St. Louis, MO). These studies were approved by the Human Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine. Ileal tissue from 2 patients with Crohn's disease was obtained at the time of ileocolonic resection. Sections of ileum with acute inflammation were compared to adjacent uninflamed sections from each patient. Adjacent sections were fixed in formalin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined for routine histology in the Department of Anatomic Pathology. Acute inflammation was defined by conventional pathologic criteria. For immunostaining, cryostat sections (8 μm thick) of jejunum and ileum were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and exposed to 70% ethanol for 5 min. For detection of SI, monoclonal anti-SI at a dilution of 1:1000 and the immunogold silver enhancement staining technique was used(13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Tissues were preincubated for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% nonfat powdered milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Anti-SI antibody was diluted in the same buffer and applied to the sections. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 1 h with gold-labeled anti-mouse serum. Silver enhancement solution (Amersham, Birmingham, United Kingdom) was added according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sections were examined under light and epi-polarized microscopy. Substitution of the anti-SI with nonimmune mouse serum produced no specific labeling. For detection of α1-AT, adjacent sections were subjected to conventional immunofluorescence (13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with rabbit anti-human α1-AT IgG (1:1000 dilution) and Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig. Again, there was no staining with nonimmune rabbit serum substituted for anti-α1-AT. For SI, a 420-base pair fragment from the 5′ coding region (+28 to +448) subcloned into the SalI/EcoR I site of Bluescript KS− was provided by Dr. P. G. Traber(26Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For SAA, the pAI cDNA clone (27Sipe J.D. Colten H.R. Goldberger G. Edge M.D. Tack B.F. Cohen A.S. Whitehead A.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Woo P. Sipe J. Dinarello C.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15790-15795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. S. B. Dowton, was digested with PstI. A 191-base pair fragment at the 5′ end of pAI was subcloned into plasmid pGEM 3Z. For protection assays, 32P-labeled antisense complementary RNA probe was synthesized using linearized plasmid (5 μg), [32P]CTP (50 μCi), and T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. From this reaction mixture, 1/1000 of the final product was allowed to hybridize overnight to 10 μg of total cellular RNA in 50% formamide at 55°C. RNase digestion was performed at room temperature with RNase A and T1, and the protected fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: immediately after harvesting, tissues were divided into 2-cm-long fragments and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (8 μm) of tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and prehybridized by proteinase K digestion (10 μg/ml for 10 min). Hybridization with the 35S-UTP-labeled antisense probe was performed at 55°C for 24 h in 60% formamide, 15% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8), and 400 mM NaCl. Sections were then subjected to RNase A digestion to remove all nonhybridized single-stranded RNA, washed at stringencies of up to 0.1 × SSC at 55°C for 30 min, and exposed to photoemulsion at 4°C. The slides were developed 21 days after the emulsion dipping. Cellular expression of mRNA was indicated by the presence of silver grains. “Background” signal was defined as the density of grains on the glass slide, where no tissue was present. To be certain that the hybridization signal was specific for probe, sequential sections of the same tissue were hybridized under identical conditions using 35S-UTP-labeled sense probe. Using the sense probe, scattered refractile bodies were found over tissue and slide, but no specific hybridization signal was ever found. In previous studies we found that IL-6 mediated a marked decrease in synthesis of SI in Caco2 cells(12Molmenti E.P. Ziambaras T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14116-14124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we compared the effect of IL-6 to that of several other cytokines (Fig. 1). Caco2 cell monolayers were incubated at 37°C for 24 h with control serum-free medium or medium supplemented with IL-6 alone, IL-1β alone, IL-6 and IL-1β together, or IFNγ. Monolayers were rinsed extensively and then pulse-radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min. Monolayers were then lysed, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SI antibody, and immunoprecipitates analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. A single radiolabeled polypeptide close to the 200-kDa marker was identified in control Caco2 cells in this experiment and in all subsequent experiments. Because this ∼200-kDa radiolabeled polypeptide was identified after a relatively short pulse interval, it was thought to correspond to pro-SI. There is a marked decrease in pro-SI in Caco2 cells incubated with IL-6 alone or IFNγ alone. This decrease is also seen in Caco2 cells incubated with both IL-1β and IL-6 but not with IL-β alone, indicating that IL-6 is responsible for the down-regulation seen with combination of the two cytokines. The effects are highly selective and specific, as shown by sequential immunoprecipitation of the same cell lysates with antibodies to positive acute phase complement proteins factor B, C3 and C4 (Fig. 1, second, third, and fourth panels). There is an increase in synthesis of factor B mediated by IL-6, IL-1β, and IFNγ and a synergistic increase in synthesis of factor B mediated by the combination of IL-1β and IL-6. In the case of C3, there is an increase in synthesis mediated by IL-1β alone or when together with IL-6. IL-6 alone and IFNγ alone mediated minimal increases in synthesis of C3. Synthesis of C4 is increased in response to IFNγ but is not affected by IL-6 or IL-1β. All of these changes in synthesis of acute phase complement proteins are consistent with changes seen previously in Caco2 cells(12Molmenti E.P. Ziambaras T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14116-14124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in HepG2 cells (3Perlmutter D.H. Matuschak G. Multiple System Organ Failure. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 229-265Google Scholar), and are characteristic of changes in plasma concentration of this proteins during the inflammatory response in vivo (3Perlmutter D.H. Matuschak G. Multiple System Organ Failure. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 229-265Google Scholar). Next we examined the possibility that regulation of SI biosynthesis by inflammatory cytokines was concentration-dependent. In Fig. 2, the results show that IL-6 and IFN-γ, indeed, mediate concentration-dependent decreases in SI biosynthesis (Fig. 2, upper panels). An effect was evident at concentrations of IL-6 as low as 10 ng/ml and of IFNγ as low as 200 units/ml. These concentration-dependent effects were specific as shown by sequential immunoprecipitation for C3. There is a concentration-dependent increase in C3 mediated by IFNγ (Fig. 2, lower panels). IL-6 has minimal effects on synthesis of C3. We also examined the effect of TNFα on synthesis of SI (Fig. 3, left panel). In contrast to IL-6 and IFNγ, TNFα mediated a modest concentration-dependent increase in SI synthesis in Caco2 cells. The effect was evident at concentrations of TNFα as low as 10 ng/ml. The magnitude of this increase was less than that mediated by TNFα on synthesis of C3 (Fig. 3, right panel) and less than the magnitude of the decrease in SI biosynthesis mediated by IL-6 and IFNγ. Quantitative analysis by densitometric scanning of five separate experiments shows that the optimal effect of IL-6 on SI biosynthesis resulted in a decrease to 37.4 ± 19.0% of control, of IFNγ resulted in a decrease to 51.3 ± 22.1% of control, and of TNFα resulted in an increase to 170.6 ± 21.0% of control. The effects of IL-6, IL-1β, IFNγ, and TNFα on SI could not be attributed to general effects on cell number or metabolic activity because there was no significant effect on DNA content or on total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein determinations in these experiments (data not shown). Moreover, changes in cell number or metabolic activity would not explain the increase in synthesis of some proteins, decrease in others, and no change in still others on sequential immunoprecipitation. Finally, examination of a subclone of Caco2 cells expressing high levels of SI under basal conditions, Caco2/15 cells, gave identical results (data not shown). Next we examined the effect of cytokines on synthesis of another enterocyte-specific integral membrane disaccharidase, lactase (Fig. 4). In the same experiments in which selective and specific changes in synthesis of SI and complement proteins are noted, there was no significant change in the synthesis of lactase. There was also no change in the synthesis of another enterocyte integral membrane protein, alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). At least with respect to inflammatory cytokines in this model system, there appears to be discordant regulation of the two disaccharidases and the three enterocyte membrane proteins. The results of the experiments with lactase and alkaline phosphatase, which are considered markers of terminal differentiation in enterocytes and Caco2 cells, make it unlikely that the down-regulating effect of IL-6 and IFNγ on SI are due to a general effect of these cytokines on the state of differentiation of Caco2 cells. Several different approaches were used to examine the possibility that SI gene expression is down-regulated in intestine during inflammation. First, we harvested RNA from normal jejunum, normal ileum, inflamed, and adjacent uninflamed ileum from patients with Crohn's disease and subjected it to RNase protection assay with a radiolabeled SI antisense cRNA probe (Fig. 5, left panel). A single protected fragment is present in normal jejunum and, to a lesser extent, in normal human ileum. There is no significant change in SI RNA levels in uninflamed ileum from a patient with Crohn's disease, but a marked decrease in SI RNA levels is observed in acutely inflamed ileum from the same patient. This decrease is highly specific as shown by subjecting the same RNA to RNase protection assay with an antisense cRNA probe for the positive acute phase reactant SAA (Fig. 5, right panel). A single protected fragment for SAA mRNA is present in IL-6-activated Caco2 cells. The same fragment is barely detected in normal jejunum but not present in normal ileum or in uninflamed ileum from Crohn's disease. It is induced in acute inflamed Crohn's ileum. Results were identical when the same analysis was done for another control, α1-AT mRNA, here (data not shown) and in previous studies(13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Results were identical when the additional normal donor and Crohn's donor were examined (data not shown). Although these data indicate that SI mRNA levels determined in whole intestine are specifically decreased in acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum, this type of analysis could be affected by changes in total mRNA per gm tissue, total mRNA per enterocyte, number of enterocytes per g of tissue or per intestinal surface area in the acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. We used two types of analysis that determine SI expression per enterocyte, immunostaining and in situ hybridization analysis, to exclude the possibility that the results were explained by these confounding variables. We subjected cryostat sections from the same tissues to immunostaining for SI to determine whether the decrease was enterocyte-specific (Fig. 6a). The results show that anti-SI antibody stains the cell surface of villous enterocytes from normal ileum. There is a patchy decrease in this staining in uninflamed Crohn's ileum, but a marked decrease, almost complete absence, of SI immunostaining in acutely inflamed ileum. Results were identical when the other normal donor and the other Crohn's donor were examined (data not shown). When adjacent sections of the same tissue are subjected to immunostaining with positive acute phase reactant α1-AT (Fig. 6b), there is a patchy increase in uninflamed Crohn's ileum and a marked increase in acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. The staining of enterocytes with α1-AT is cytoplasmic and extends into the crypt as compared to SI, which is membranous and confined to the villus. These results of α1-AT immunostaining are identical to our previous results in tissues from 2 other normal individuals and 3 other individuals with Crohn's disease(13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Finally, we subjected cryostat sections from the same tissues to in situ hybridization analysis for even more sensitive evaluation of cell-specific SI gene expression (Fig. 7a). Sections from normal ileum and from acutely inflamed ileum and adjacent uninflamed ileum from patients with Crohn's disease were again examined. To make the analysis strictly comparable, these sections were hybridized together with the same prep of 35S-labeled antisense cRNA and sense RNA probes, washed together, subjected to autoradiography together for the same length of time, and photographed together. The results show silver grains within enterocytes lining the villi of normal ileum with antisense SI cRNA. There were no silver grains in the villous enterocytes with sense SI probe. Refractile bodies (arrowheads) could be seen over the villous epithelium and lamina propria with antisense cRNA or sense RNA, or when sections were hybridized without any probe; thus, these are nonspecific by definition. There was a patchy decrease in silver grains in uninflamed Crohn's ileum but a marked and diffuse decrease in silver grains in the villous enterocytes of acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. The difference in density of silver grains between normal ileum and Crohn's ileum was also confirmed by quantitation of the number of silver grains per high power field. For this analysis silver grains per high power field were counted on the base, lower third, middle third, and upper third of 8 different villi from the normal ileum, on 7 different villi from inflamed ileum, and on 8 different villi from uninflamed adjacent ileum from 2 normal and 2 Crohn's donors. The results showed counts of 168 ± 33.6 for normal, 32.0 ± 11.0 for inflamed ileum specimen, and 137.0 ± 37.09 for uninflamed ileum. The difference between normal and inflamed ileum was statistically significant (p < 0.001 by ANOVA and by Tukey's test of multiple comparisons). The difference can also be seen on multiple villi when the sections are shown at lower magnification (Fig. 7b). The decrease in enterocyte-specific SI mRNA in inflamed ileum was specific in that there was an increase in enterocyte-specific α1-AT mRNA in the same specimens (data not shown) and in 3 other individuals with Crohn's disease in our previous studies(13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of ribonuclease protection assays, immunostaining, and in situ hybridization analysis provide internally consistent evidence for selective and specific decrease in SI gene expression in acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. The results of immunostaining and in situ hybridization analysis show that there is a decrease in cell surface SI expression and SI mRNA per enterocyte in the inflamed Crohn's ileum. The results of this study show that inflammatory cytokines mediate changes in expression of the SI gene in intestinal epithelial cells. IL-6 and IFNγ mediate concentration-dependent decreases, and TNFγ mediates a concentration-dependent increase in the biosynthesis of SI in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2. On the other hand, IL-1β has no effect on synthesis of SI in Caco2 cells. The effects of each cytokine on SI synthesis are specific and selective in that they occur in the context of marked changes in expression of other target genes, particularly acute phase genes. This includes cytokine-specific and target gene-specific changes. IL-6 mediates a decrease in SI synthesis at the same time as it mediates an increase in complement proteins factor B, C3, and α1-AT. IL-1β has no effect on synthesis of SI while it mediates an increase in factor B and C3 synthesis. IL-1β also has no effect on synthesis of SI when it is used together with IL-6, even though it has an additive effect on factor B and a synergistic effect on SAA in the same experiment. IFNγ mediates a decrease in SI synthesis at the same time as it mediates an increase in factor B and C4 synthesis. In contrast, TNFα mediates an increase in synthesis of SI and C3, but has little effect on the other genes. The decrease in SI biosynthesis in Caco2 cells activated by IL-6 or by IFNγ could not be attributed to a general effect on cell number or metabolic activity per cell or to heterogeneity within the cell line because sequential immunoprecipitation of the same labeled cell lysates showed an increase in factor B, C3, and α1-AT in the case of IL-6 and an increase in C4 in the case of IFNγ. Similarly the increase in biosynthesis of SI in Caco2 cells treated with TNFα could not be attributed to a general effect or heterogeneity because sequential immunoprecipitation showed no change in synthesis of α1-antichymotrypsin and α1-AT. The changes in SI synthesis are also unlikely to reflect a general effect on the state of differentiation of Caco2 cells because on sequential immunoprecipitation there were no changes in synthesis of two other enterocyte integral membrane proteins that are markers of terminal differentiation in Caco2 cells, lactase and alkaline phosphatase. In order to examine the possibility that the effects of inflammatory cytokines on SI gene expression in enterocytes are relevant to physiologic and pathophysiologic situations in vivo, we used RNase protection assays and immunofluorescent and in situ hybridization analyses to determine SI gene expression in inflamed ileum from patients with Crohn's disease. Previous studies have shown that there is increased complement proteins in intestinal loop fluid from patients with Crohn's disease (29Ahrenstedt O. Knutson L. Nilsson B. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Odlind B. Hallgren R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and increased α1-AT gene expression in enterocytes from acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum(13Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The results of our studies showed that there is a marked decrease in expression of the SI gene in villous enterocytes of acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. The decrease could not be attributed to generalized damage to the enterocytes in that there was evidence for substantial increases in SAA and α1-AT gene expression in the same epithelial cells using analysis of cell-specific expression by immunostaining and in situ hybridization. Taken together, these results indicate that there is a specific and selective decrease in SI gene expression in villous enterocytes in one type of intestinal inflammatory condition and that the specificity and selectivity of the effect recapitulates the changes in gene expression elicited in a human intestinal epithelial cell line in tissue culture in response to IL-6 or IFNγ. The data do not prove that IL-6 and/or IFN-γ are responsible for the decrease in SI gene expression in vivo. Moreover, the data do not address whether locally- or systemically-derived cytokines are responsible. However, the fact that there is a gradient in the changes in gene expression when comparing the acutely inflamed to the adjacent uninflamed Crohn's ileum is more consistent with an effect of locally-derived cytokine, or cytokines. Expression of all the cytokines studied here, IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ, has been detected in the bowel in inflammatory bowel disease(30Sartor B.A. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 533-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the data do not necessarily imply that TNFα is absent from, or not acting on, villous enterocytes in acutely inflamed Crohn's ileum. The net effect on SI gene expression here could depend on many factors, including the relative endogenous expression/activity of receptors and soluble receptors/receptor antagonists. SI is an integral membrane glycoprotein of enterocytes, which digests dietary disaccharides. Its expression is confined to the small intestine in the adult. Its expression is altered by changes in dietary nutrients and by diabetes mellitus. It is also expressed aberrantly in colonic polyps, adenomas and adenocarcinomas, probably as a result of dedifferentiation to a fetal colonocyte program in these conditions. Several cis-acting DNA binding domains in the upstream flanking region of the SI gene and trans-acting DNA binding proteins that regulate its intestine-specific transcription have been identified in recent studies (26Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cis-acting elements and transcription factors, which could mediate down-regulation of SI gene expression in response to IL-6 and IFNγ or up-regulation of SI gene expression in response to TNFα, have not been described. There is, however, no a priori reason that these cytokines directly act on SI gene expression. Cross and Quaroni (24Cross H.D. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1173-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that epidermal growth factor mediates a marked decrease in SI gene expression in Caco2 cells, raising the possibility that the effects of cytokines could be mediated indirectly through epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, or, for that matter, through other related growth factors. The results of this study do not provide any information about the clinical relevance of depression in SI gene expression in inflammatory bowel disease. It is known that lactose malabsorption is as common in inflammatory bowel disease as it is in the general population(33Kirschner B.S. DeFavaro M.V. Jensen W. Gastroenterology. 1981; 61: 629-632Google Scholar), but there is relatively little information in the literature about sucrose malabsorption. Nevertheless, the results do raise the possibility that cytokines can mediate an effect that inhibits SI gene expression in Crohn's disease, in infectious enteritis, or in perturbations of the intestinal flora that result in the local release of cytokines such as IL-6 and IFNγ. We are indebted to Dr. E. Molmenti for help with in situ hybridization analysis and to Joyce L. Williams for preparing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2058420723,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) impairs insulin secretion from pancreatic islets and may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. IL-1 increases islet expression of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, and the resultant overproduction of NO participates in inhibition of insulin secretion because NO synthase inhibitors, e.g. NG-monomethyl-arginine (NMMA), prevent this inhibition. While exploring effects of IL-1 on islet arachidonic acid metabolism, we found that IL-1 increases islet production of the 12-lipoxygenase product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 12-(HETE). This effect requires NO production and is prevented by NMMA. Exploration of the mechanism of this effect indicates that it involves increased availabilty of the substrate arachidonic acid rather than enhanced expression of 12-lipoxygenase. Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the facts that IL-1 does not increase islet 12-lipoxygenase protein or mRNA levels and does not enhance islet conversion of exogenous arachidonate to 12-HETE. Mass spectrometric stereochemical analyses nonetheless indicate that 12-HETE produced by IL-1-treated islets consists only of the S-enantiomer and thus arises from enzyme action. IL-1 does enhance release of nonesterified arachidonate from islets, as measured by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, and this effect is suppressed by NMMA and mimicked by the NO-releasing compound 3-morpholinosydnonimine. Although IL-1 increases neither islet phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities nor mRNA levels for cytosolic or secretory PLA2, a suicide substrate which inhibits an islet Ca2+-independent PLA2 prevents enhancement of islet arachidonate release by IL-1. IL-1 also impairs esterification of [3H8]arachidonate into islet phospholipids, and this effect is prevented by NMMA and mimicked by the mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin. Experiments with exogenous substrates indicate that NMMA does not inhibit and that the NO-releasing compound does not activate islet 12-lipoxygenase or PLA2 activities. These results indicate that a novel action of NO is to increase levels of nonesterified arachidonic acid in islets.

PGE2 may negatively modulate insulin secretion (11Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and exerts proinflammatory effects(12Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B. Morrison A. Lefkowith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of islets to interleukin-1 (IL-1) suppresses glucose-induced insulin secretion and augments islet PGE2 synthesis(13Hughes J.H. Easom R. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), an effect attributable to increased expression of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase-2 and to activation of cyclooxygenase-2 by nitric oxide (NO), which is overproduced by IL-1-treated islets(14Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13767-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The latter effect reflects increased expression of the inducible isoform of NO synthase by IL-1-treated islets(14Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13767-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cytokines such as IL-1 are thought to participate in induction of islet dysfunction and destruction in type I diabetes mellitus(15Rabinovitch A. Diabetes Rev. 1993; 1: 215-240Google Scholar), and both NO and PGE2 are mediators which may adversely affect islet function(16McDaniel M.L. Hughes J.H. Wolf B.A. Easom R.J. Turk J.

Little is known about the influence of IL-1 on islet 12-HETE production, but 12-lipoxygenase products may promote insulin secretion from islet β-cells. Fuel insulin secretagogues stimulate islet 12-HETE production; exogenous 12-HPETE, the precursor of 12-HETE, stimulates insulin secretion(1Metz S. VanRollins M. Strife R. Fujimoto W. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); and pharmacologic inhibitors of 12-lipoxygenase suppress both 12-HETE production and insulin secretion with identical concentration dependences(1Metz S.

McDaniel M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and immunochemical analyses indicate that islet 12-lipoxygenase is selectively expressed in β-cells but not in α-cells or in pancreatic exocrine cells(18Shannon V.R. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Holtzman M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E908-E912Crossref Google Scholar). The β-cell 12-lipoxygenase (18Shannon V.R. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Holtzman M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E908-E912Crossref Google Scholar) corresponds to the leukocyte isoform(19Hada T. Hagiya H. Suzuki H. Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Matsuda S. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Asekawa T. Morita Y. Ishimura K. Kim H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has different catalytic properties, primary structure, and tissue distribution compared to the platelet 12-lipoxygenase isoform(20Chang W. Liu Y. Ning C. Suzuki H. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18734-18739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The leukocyte isoform is also expressed by neuroendocrine cells in addition to islets(19Hada T. Hagiya H. Suzuki H. Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Matsuda S. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Asekawa T. Morita Y. Ishimura K. Kim H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further suggesting a role for this 12-lipoxygenase isoform in secretory events. Several observations suggested the possibility that IL-1 might suppress islet 12-HETE production and that this might contribute to suppression of glucose-induced insulin secretion.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the platelet 12-lipoxygenase isoform has been reported to be inhibited by NO(24Nakatsuka M. Osawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1630-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have therefore characterized the effects of IL-1 on islet 12-HETE production in the studies described here. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-220 g) were from Sasco (O'Fallon, MO); collagenase from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN); tissue culture medium (CMRL-1066), penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and L-glutamine from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Pentex bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid free, fraction V) was from Miles Laboratories (Elkhart, IN); rodent Chow 5001 from Ralston Purina (St. Louis, MO); and D-glucose from the National Bureau of Standards (Washington, D.C.). Arachidonic acid was obtained from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN), dissolved in ethanol just before use, and diluted in albumin-free buffer(25Wolf B.A. Pasquale S.M. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Ramanadham S. Gross R. Turk J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). IL-1β was from Cistron Biotechnology (Pine Brook, NJ); NG-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate from Calbiochem; actinomycin D from Sigma; and Tran35S-labeled methionine (1117 Ci/mmol) from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). PGE2 radioimmunoassay materials and [2H8]12-HETE were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Both [3H8]arachidonic acid and [3H8]12-HETE (100 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. [2H8]Arachidonic acid was prepared by catalytic reduction of eicosa-(5,8,11,14)-tetrynoic acid (Hoffman LaRoche) with [2H2]gas(27Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3510-3511Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-12-lipoxygenase antiserum was a gift from Dr. Michael Holtzman (Washington University, St. Louis), and its preparation and properties have been described(18Shannon V.R. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Holtzman M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E908-E912Crossref Google Scholar). Media included KRB (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2); nKRB (KRB supplemented with 3 mMD-glucose); cCMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 from Life Technologies, Inc., supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% (w/v) each of penicillin and streptomycin); and Hanks' balanced salt solution from Life Technologies, Inc. (supplemented with 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin). Islets were isolated aseptically from male Sprague-Dawley rats, as described(28McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), by collagenase digestion of excised, minced pancreas, density gradient isolation, and manual selection under microscopic visualization(28McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were transferred into Falcon Petri dishes containing 2.5 ml of cCMRL-1066, placed under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, and cultured for various periods at 37°C with or without IL-1 or other additives. Islets (about 400/condition) were placed in Petri dishes (10 × 35 mm) and suspended in cCMRL medium (1 ml) containing no additives, IL-1β (5 units/ml) alone, IL-1 plus NMMA (0.5 mM), IL-1 plus actinomycin D (1 μM), or IL-1 plus CHX (10 μM). Incubations were then performed (2-24 h, 37°C). At the end of incubations, medium was removed for measurement of PGE2, 12-HETE, nitrite plus nitrate, insulin, and arachidonic acid. In some experiments, islets that had been incubated without or with IL-1 were removed from incubation medium and their secretion of insulin and production of eicosanoids examined in a subsequent incubation. In such experiments, islets were washed (3 times, nKRB), transferred to siliconized test tubes (10 × 75 mm), and preincubated (30 min, 37°C) in nKRB (0.2 ml). At the end of the preincubations, medium was removed and islet incubated (30 min, 37°C, under 5% CO2, 95% air) in KRB medium containing either 3 mMD-glucose or 17 mMD-glucose plus 0.5 mM carbachol. At the end of that incubation, islet suspensions were placed in silanized Sorvall centrifuge tubes (10 × 75 mm) and centrifuged (2000 rpm, 2 min). Eicosanoids were extracted separately from supernatant and islet pellet (27Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3510-3511Google Scholar) and measured. In other experiments, islets that had been preincubated without or with IL-1 were incubated with arachidonic acid (10-100 μM). In such experiments, islets were removed from cCMRL, and 400 islets per condition were resuspended in nKRB medium with no BSA. Arachidonic acid was then added in ethanol (final ethanol concentration 0.1%) and incubations performed (20 min, 37°C). At the end of incubations, 12-HETE and PGE2 were extracted from medium and measured. Insulin content of islet pellets was determined as described (3Turk J. Colca J. Kotagal N. McDaniel M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 794: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) after extraction with 75% ethanol, 1.5% HCl. Under the conditions of these studies (up to 24 h incubation with 5 units/ml IL-1), IL-1 is not cytotoxic to islets, and effects on insulin secretion are fully reversible upon removal of IL-1 from medium and continued culture(29Corbett J. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Lack of cytotoxicity in our experiments is also reflected by normal islet morphology, preservation of islet number, preservation of islet total acid-ethanol-extractable insulin content, and constant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression during incubation with IL-1 and other additives for up to 24 h. Islets (about 400/condition) were incubated in cCMRL (3 h, 37°C) after additions were complete, and medium content of arachidonate was then quantitated. Control islets were incubated without further additions. SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine) was added (100 μM) to the remaining conditions. For conditions involving agents (500 μM NMMA or 50 μM hemoglobin) in addition to SIN-1, these agents were added 5 min before addition of SIN-1. PGE2 was extracted from acidified medium with octadecylsilicic acid columns (1 ml, Baker Scientific, Phillipsburg, NJ) and, after column washing, eluted with methyl formate, as described(10Turk J. Mueller M. Bohrer A. Ramanadham S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Pradelles P. Grassi I. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Eluant was concentrated to dryness, reconstituted in buffer, and PGE2 quantified by enzyme immunoassay, as described(30Pradelles P. Grassi I. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Insulin content of islet incubation medium or acid-ethanol extracts of islet pellets was measured by radioimmunoassay(31Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13499-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Medium nitrite content was measured, after conversion of nitrate to nitrite with Aspergillus nitrate reductase(32Green I.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.T. Anal.

To aliquots of medium, [2H8]12-HETE (20 ng) and [3H8]12-HETE (50 nCi) were added as internal standards, and medium was acidified (pH 3.0, 1 N HCl) and extracted twice (CH2Cl2). Extracts were concentrated to dryness, and 12-HETE was converted to the pentafluorobenzyl ester (PFBE) derivative. The 12-HETE-PFBE was purified by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC on octadecylsilicic acid columns (Ultrasphere ODS 4.6 × 250 mm, Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with the solvent system (flow 1 ml/min) acetonitrile/water (70/30). The 12-HETE-PFBE peak (retention volume about 25 ml) was located by liquid scintillation counting of aliquots of eluant, extracted (CH2Cl2), concentrated to dryness, converted to the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) derivative, and analyzed by GC-NICI-MS. Quantitation of 12-HETE was performed relative to [2H8]12-HETE internal standard by reference to a standard curve(3Turk J. Colca J. Kotagal N. McDaniel M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Arachidonic acid was quantitated by stable isotope dilution GC-NICI-MS(27Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3510-3511Google Scholar). To aliquots of medium, [2H8]arachidonic acid (100 ng), and [3H8]arachidonic acid (50 nCi) were added as internal standards. Medium was acidified (pH 3.0, 1 N HCl) and extracted twice (CH2Cl2). Extracts were concentrated to dryness, reconstituted in HPLC mobile phase, and purified by RP-HPLC on an Ultrasphere ODS column described above in the solvent system (flow 2 ml/min, column temperature 37°C), acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (80/20/0.1). The arachidonate peak was located by liquid scintillation counting of column eluant (retention volume about 50 ml), extracted (CH2Cl2), concentrated to dryness, converted to a PFBE derivative, and analyzed by GC-NICI-MS. Quantitation of arachidonate was performed relative to [2H8]arachidonate internal standard by reference to a standard curve(27Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

To dry samples, 20 μl of N,N-dimethylacetamide/tetramethylammonium hydroxide/methanol (10/5/15) and 20 μl of pentafluorobenzyl bromide/N,N-dimethylacetamide () were added, and tubes were vortex-mixed and incubated (room temperature, 15 min). After concentration to dryness, water (50 μl) was added and vortex-mixed, CH2Cl2 (200 μl) added and vortex-mixed, and aqueous phase discarded. The PFBE derivative in the CH2Cl2 phase was then concentrated to dryness and reconstituted in mobile phase for HPLC analyses (12-HETE) or in heptane for GC-MS analyses (arachidonate). Before GC-MS analyses, the hydroxyl group of 12-HETE-PFBE was converted to a TMS ether derivative with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and pyridine (3Turk J. Colca J. Kotagal N.

Appropriate fractions were extracted (CH2Cl2), concentrated to dryness, reconstituted in mobile phase, and analyzed by chiral phase HPLC with two Baker-Bond (dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine) ionically coupled columns (4.3 × 25 mm) in series and a solvent system (flow 0.8 ml/min) of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (1000/8). Approximate retention times of 12-S-HETE-PFBE and 12-R-HETE-PFBE were 30.8 and 31.8 min, respectively. Fractions (0.16 ml) were collected in the region of interest, concentrated to dryness, converted to TMS derivatives, and analyzed by GC-NICI-MS. The racemic internal standard eluted as two peaks (S- and R-enantiomers) of [18O2]12-HETE. Derivatized samples of 12-HETE-(PFBE, TMS) or arachidonate-PFBE were introduced in heptane into a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (GC) via a Grob-type injector (temperature, 225°C) operated in the splitless mode and analyzed on an HP Ultraperformance capillary column (8 m length, cross-linked methylsilicone, inner diameter, 0.31 mm; film thickness, 0.17 μm) interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard 5988B mass spectrometer(35Ramanadham S.

For analysis of arachidonate-PFBE, initial oven temperature was 85°C, and 0.5 min after injection oven temperature was increased (30°C/min) to a final temperature of 200°C (retention time about 5.49 min). The GC was interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard 5988B mass spectrometer (MS) operated in NICI mode and controlled by a Hewlett-Packard RTE-A data system(35Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. Mueller M. Jett P.

https://openalex.org/W2081697857,"Earlier studies have suggested that CheZ, the phosphatase of the signaling protein CheY in bacterial chemotaxis, may be in an oligomeric state both when bound to phosphorylated CheY (CheY~P) (Blat, Y., and Eisenbach, M.(1994) Biochemistry 33, 902-906) or free (Stock, A., and Stock, J. B.(1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 3301-3311). The purpose of the current study was to determine the oligomeric state of free CheZ and to investigate whether it changes upon binding to CheY~P. By using either one of two different sets of cross-linking agents, free CheZ was found to be a dimer. The formation of the dimer was specific, as it was prevented by SDS which does not interfere with cross-linking mediated by random collisions. The dimeric form of CheZ was confirmed by sedimentation analysis, a cross-linking-free technique. In the presence of CheY~P (but not in the presence of non-phosphorylated CheY), a high molecular size cross-linked complex (90-200 kDa) was formed, in which the CheZ:CheY ratio was 2:1. The size of the oligomeric complex was estimated by fluorescence depolarization to be 4-5-fold larger than the dimer, suggesting that its size is in the order of 200 kDa. These results indicate that CheZ oligomerizes upon interaction with CheY~P. This phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization may be a mechanism for regulating CheZ activity.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation level is determined by the kinase CheA and the phosphatase CheZ(20Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Matsumura P.

The activity of the kinase, CheA, is modulated by chemotactic stimuli via the membrane chemotaxis receptors and the chemotaxis protein CheW(23Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl.

In a previous study we found that the binding of CheZ to phosphorylated CheY (CheY~P) is 2 orders of magnitude higher than to non-phosphorylated CheY, and that several molecules of CheZ can bind to a single CheY~P molecule(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Earlier observations indicated that CheZ can be in two oligomeric forms, 115 and >500 kDa, as estimated by size-exclusion chromatography (27Stock A. Stock J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3301-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (the molecular size of the monomer is 23.9 kDa(27Stock A. Stock J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3301-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The observations of both studies taken together suggest that the oligomeric state of CheZ is modulatable. Here we examine this possibility and demonstrate that CheZ is a dimer which oligomerizes upon interaction with CheY~P. The possibility that this phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization is a regulation mechanism for CheZ activity is investigated in a subsequent work (28Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) which contains a deletion from cheA to cheZ and carries the plasmid pRL22(ΔPvuII). For the overexpression of S. typhimurium CheY (CheYs) we constructed the plasmid pEWY5 as follows. cheY was amplified from total DNA of strain ST1 (31Aswad D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5′-CCGAATTCATGGCGGATAAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTCAGATGCCCAGTTTCTCAAAG-3′, which contained added EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively, at their 5′ end. The amplified fragment was digested by EcoRI and BamHI, and ligated with pBTac1 (Boeringer Mannheim) predigested by EcoRI and BamHI. The resultant plasmid, pEWY5, overexpressed CheY under the control of tac promoter. The plasmid pEWC1, used for the overexpression of S. typhimurium CheZ214FC, was constructed similarly to the construction of pEWY5 except that the primers 5′-CCGAATTCATGATGCAACCATCTATCAAGCC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTTAACAGCCAAGACTGTCCAGCAGGTC-3′ were used for the PCR. CheYs and CheZ214FC were overexpressed in RP1091 (RP437Δ(cheA-cheZ)(14Parkinson J.S. Houts S.E. J.

Radiolabeling of CheYE and CheZE was carried out by inducing the expression of CheY and CheZ in the presence of L-[14C]leucine as described previously(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purification of CheYE (nonlabeled) and CheZE (nonlabeled and radiolabeled) was carried out on a Cibacron column followed by a G-50 (for CheY) or Sepharose CL-6B (for CheZ) column as described previously(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled CheYE was purified as the non-labeled CheYE, only that smaller-scale columns (4 ml of Cibacron and 65 × 1 cm G-50) were used. CheYs was purified as CheYE(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that the bacteria were grown on Luria broth and induced with 0.66 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. CheZ214FC was purified as follows. RP1091 cells containing pEWC1 were grown at 35°C in 1.5 liter of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At OD590 = 0.4, overexpression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once by buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), resuspended in 35 ml of buffer A, and sonicated. Membranes and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 165,000 × g for 60 min. The lysate was loaded onto a 40-ml Sepharose CL-6B column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, followed by 170 ml of buffer A containing 275 mM NaCl. CheZ was eluted from the column by a 250-ml linear gradient of 275-450 mM NaCl in buffer A. The CheZ-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a 5-kDa cut-off membrane, using an Amicon chamber (model 52). The concentrated fractions were loaded onto a 20-ml hydroxylapatite column, pre-equilibrated with buffer B (10 mM NaPi, pH 7.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The column was washed with 60 ml of buffer B, and CheZ was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of buffer B containing 10-200 mM NaPi. The CheZ-containing fractions were concentrated to a volume of 2 ml and loaded onto a Sephadex G-150 column (50 × 1.5 cm), pre-equilibrated with a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The CheZ-containing fractions were concentrated and stored in 10% glycerol at −80°C. The reaction mixture (20 μl) for cross-linking contained NaCl (90 mM), KCl (10 mM), MgCl2 (5 mM), Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 8.5 for cross-linking by dimethylsuberimidate (DMS) or 35 mM, pH 7.9, for cross-linking by 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)), and CheZE (1.3 μM). CheYE (20 μM), and acetyl phosphate (AcP, 18 mM) were also added as appropriate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of DMS (3 mg/ml) or EDC followed by NHS (66 and 13 mM, respectively), and allowed to proceed for 3 h (with DMS) or 40-60 min (with EDC plus NHS) at room temperature (22-25°C). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (×5 concentrated). The samples were boiled for 10 min, and 22-μl aliquots were used for 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained, dried, and autoradiographed. Quantitative analysis of the radioactivity associated with the different cross-linking products was carried out with a PhosphoImager (Fujix, Bas 1000). CheZ214FC (100 μM, 200 μl) was incubated with 0.5 mM fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) in Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.9) for 30 min at room temperature (22-25°C). After incubation, CheZ was separated from the unreacted fluorescein by application onto a 0.8-ml G-50 mini-column and briefly spinning at 480 × g. The eluted labeled CheZ was dialyzed against Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.9) containing 1.5 mM dithiothreitol. The labeled CheZ was stored at −80°C. CheZE, CheYE (14 kDa), CheW (18 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa) samples (150 μl of 2 mg/ml) were loaded onto a 5-20% isokinetic sucrose gradient (5 ml) in Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.9), KCl (100 mM), and MgCl2 (5 mM). The samples were spun at 290,000 × g for 24 h (20°C) in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. After centrifugation, 130-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for protein concentration by the Bradford technique(33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). The size of CheZE was estimated by plotting a calibration line of (molecular size)0.67 against the distance traveled by the protein peak(34Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CheZ alone or a mixture of CheZ (20 μM), CheY (100 μM), and AcP (18 mM) was run through a size-exclusion HPLC Bio-Sil TSK-250 column (7.5 × 600 mm; Bio-Rad; 23°C), utilizing HP 1040 A diode array chromatography system, and Waters HPLC system, composed of two pumps (model 510) and an automatic controller. Prior to separation, the column was pre-equilibrated with a solution of Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.9), KCl (100 mM), MgCl2 (5 mM), and AcP (18 mM). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fluorescence depolarization studies with fluorescein-labeled CheZ214FC were carried out with a Perkin Elmer LS 50 B luminescence spectrometer equipped with a fluorescence polarization accessory. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 520 nm, respectively (5-nm slit width). The phosphatase activity of CheZ was assayed by monitoring the steady-state level of CheY phosphorylation in the presence of [32P]acetyl phosphate (AcP, synthesized as described(35Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 228-231Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) and varying concentrations of CheZ. CheY (20 μM) was incubated in Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.9) and MgCl2 (5 mM) with [32P]AcP (20 mM, 200-400 cpm/pmol) and varying concentrations of CheZ. The reaction (20 μl) was quenched after 10 min of incubation at room temperature (25°C) by 100 μl of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 20 μg of ovalbumin. (We verified that trichloroacetic acid does not hydrolyze CheY⁁P under our experimental conditions.) The level of CheY phosphorylation was determined as described earlier(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In order to examine the possibility of phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of CheZ, we monitored the oligomeric state of CheZ by cross-linking in the presence or absence of CheY~P. When cross-linked by DMS which cross-links amines(36Davis G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), some of the CheZ molecules appeared to form two bands migrating on SDS-PAGE as 43- and 49-kDa proteins (Fig. 1, lane 2). These bands probably correspond to CheZ dimers (the monomeric size of CheZ is 23.9 kDa). The two distinct bands of the dimer possibly reflect two different positions of DMS links between the CheZ monomers. The addition of CheY (14 kDa) did not cause any change in the cross-linking products observed (lane 4). However, the addition of CheY together with the phosphodonor AcP (37Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) caused the appearance of two additional cross-linking products of 38 and >94 kDa (lane 5). (A more accurate determination of the size of >94 kDa product is made below.) AcP in the absence of CheY had no effect (lane 3). The 38-kDa band probably corresponds to a 1:1 CheY-CheZ complex which reflects the increase in binding of CheZ to CheY upon phosphorylation(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The >94 kDa band may be an oligomeric complex of CheZ which possibly contains also CheY (see below). In order to verify that the CheZ dimer and the oligomeric complex are not cross-linking artifacts, we used an additional cross-linker and cross-linking-free techniques. A mixture of EDC and NHS mediates the cross-linking of amines to carboxyl groups(38Staros J.V. Wright R.W. Swingle D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). CheZ exposed to this mixture formed a single defined band at 46 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In the presence of non-phosphorylated CheY, most of CheZ remained as a dimer (lane 3). A sharp change in the oligomeric state of CheZ was observed when CheY was added together with AcP. Under these conditions all the CheZ formed a >94 kDa cross-linking product (lane 4), which appeared on a 10% SDS-PAGE as a 90-200-kDa smear and a distinct band at 145 kDa (Fig. 2B). As in the case of DMS, AcP in the absence of CheY did not form the >94-kDa complex (Fig. 3A, lane 3). These results confirm that an oligomeric complex of CheZ is formed in the presence of CheY~P.Figure 3:The dependence of CheZ oligomerization on CheY~P. The cross-linking was carried out as in Fig. 2A, except for the modifications indicated below. Unless mentioned otherwise, the CheY and CheY57DE concentrations were 20 μM. A, cross-linking of [14C]CheZ in the presence of varying concentrations of CheY. B, quantification of the dependence of the amount of oligomer formed on the concentration of CheY. The relative intensity of each oligomer band was measured by a PhosphoImager and calculated relatively to the intensity of the band formed in the presence of 20 μM CheY. The results are the mean of two experiments, one of which is the experiment shown in panel A. C, cross-linking of [14C]CheZ under conditions which prevent the phosphorylation of CheY.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the cross-linking products observed in this study resulted from specific interactions, we repeated all the above mentioned experiments in the presence of SDS (0.5%). (SDS does not interfere with cross-linking mediated by random collisions(39Carpenter F.H. Harrington K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5580-5586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) Only the monomeric form of CheZ was observed; the formation of all the cross-linking products was prevented by SDS (data not shown), indicating that the interactions were specific. The EDC-NHS-mediated cross-linking of CheZ (Fig. 2) was much more efficient than the DMS-mediated cross-linking (Fig. 1). This may be the consequence of the small number of lysine residues and the high number of aspartate and glutamate residues in CheZ (6 residues versus 37, respectively(40Mutoh N. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 161-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). For this reason the subsequent cross-linking studies were carried out with EDC-NHS. If the phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of CheZ is physiologically significant, it should depend on the concentration of CheY~P. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the amount of the oligomer was indeed dependent on the concentration of CheY added in the presence of access AcP. Furthermore, CheY57DE which cannot be phosphorylated due to the substitution of Glu for the phosphorylation site, Asp57(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), did not promote the oligomer formation even in the presence of AcP (Fig. 3C, lane 7). Similarly, depletion of Mg2+ (necessary for CheY phosphorylation(42Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5436-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)) also prevented the formation of the oligomer (lane 5). In order to estimate the relative content, if any, of CheY in the oligomer, we carried out the cross-linking experiment with radiolabeled CheY or radiolabeled CheZ in parallel (Fig. 4). [14C]CheY cross-linked in the presence of CheZ and AcP (Fig. 4, lane 4) indeed formed a band migrating at the same position as the CheZ oligomer (lane 1). This band was not formed in the absence of CheZ and AcP (lane 3; the faint high molecular size band seen in this lane represents aggregates too large to enter the gel). This result indicates that the CheZ oligomer contains also some CheY cross-linked to it. We quantified the amount of CheY cross-linked to the CheZ oligomer by a PhosphoImager. The result was 0.48 ± 0.18 (mean ± S.D., three independent determinations) molecules of CheY per monomer of CheZ, suggesting a CheZ:CheY ratio of 2:1. Our observation that, in the absence of CheY~P, CheZ appears as a dimer in cross-linking experiments, is in apparent conflict with Stock and Stock's (27Stock A. Stock J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3301-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observation, reproduced by us, that CheZ behaves as a tetramer when run on an HPLC size-exclusion column. In order to solve this discrepancy we estimated the size of CheZ by zonal centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. As shown in Fig. 5, the CheZ peak appeared between the peaks of CheW (18 kDa) and ovalbumin (43 kDa) at a location which, according to the formula described under “Experimental Procedures,” is the site of a 35 ± 4 kDa (mean ± S.D., two determinations) globular protein. This estimation is closer to the cross-linking results, which indicated that CheZ is a dimer (47.8 kDa), than to the HPLC results which indicated a tetramer. The difference between the size estimations of the different approaches suggests that CheZ is non-globular (see “Discussion”). To confirm the oligomerization of CheZ in the presence of CheY~P, we initially attempted to use size-exclusion chromatography. Running a mixture of CheZ, CheY, and AcP through the HPLC column yielded only two peaks, eluted at retention times identical to those obtained when CheZ and CheY were run separately. This could mean either that, in contrast to the cross-linking results, the CheY~P-induced oligomerization does not occur at all, or that the oligomer is unstable and readily dissociates when CheY and/or AcP are separated from CheZ on the column. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used fluorescence depolarization, which, unlike size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation analysis, allows interaction between CheZ and CheY~P throughout the experiment. To enable the measurement of the rotational diffusion of CheZ by fluorescence depolarization, we had first to fluorescently label CheZ. For this purpose we replaced phenylalanine 214 of CheZ with cysteine by using a mismatch primer and PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutated protein, CheZ214FC, retained normal CheY phosphatase activity (Fig. 6) and therefore could serve as a model for wild-type CheZ. CheZ214FC contains a single cysteine residue and therefore could be labeled at a specific site by fluorescein-5-maleimide. The anisotropy, which reflects the rotational diffusion and therefore also the size of the fluorescein-labeled CheZ214FC(43Weber G. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 44Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman, San Francisco1980: 454-465Google Scholar), was dependent on the concentration of added CheY (Fig. 7A). In the absence of AcP, the anisotropy increased only moderately with the concentration of CheY and was not saturated within the concentration range of the experiment (0-45 μM CheY). This moderate change in anisotropy was probably the result of the low-level binding of non-phosphorylated CheY to CheZ(26Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the presence of AcP, the anisotropy was increased over 2-fold, indicating a large decrease in the rotational diffusion of CheZ upon CheY phosphorylation. The increase in anisotropy was saturated already at 4 μM CheY. The anisotropy change was rapid; it was completed prior to the first measurable time point (~30 s). In order to estimate the magnitude of the size change, the anisotropy of CheZ was measured at varying viscosity values in the presence or absence of CheY~P. The data, presented in the form of a Perrin plot (43Weber G. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 44Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman, San Francisco1980: 454-465Google Scholar), are shown in Fig. 7B. In the Perrin plot the slopes of the curves are inversely related to the molecular dimension and therefore to the molecular size(43Weber G. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 44Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman, San Francisco1980: 454-465Google Scholar). The slope was 4.8-fold smaller in the presence of CheY~P than in its absence, suggesting that upon CheY phosphorylation CheZ formed a complex which is approximately 4-5-fold larger in volume than the CheZ dimer. The fact that we did not detect CheY~P-induced oligomerization of CheZ in size-exclusion chromatography, but did observe it using fluorescence depolarization, suggests that the oligomer is unstable and dissociates in the absence of CheY~P.Figure 7:Fluorescence depolarization studies of fluorescein-labeled CheZ214FC. The experiment was carried out in the absence (○) or presence (•) of 18 mM AcP. A, the effect of CheY on the fluorescence anisotropy (A = (I∥ - I⊥)/(I∥+ 2I⊥)) (44Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman, San Francisco1980: 454-465Google Scholar) of CheZ. The measured solution contained fluorescein-labeled CheZ214FC (0.2 μM), Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.9), MgCl2 (5 mM) and increasing concentrations of CheYs. B, Perrin plot of the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-labeled CheZ214FC (1.0 μM in the same buffer conditions as in A). When present, the concentration of CheYs was 20 μM. The medium viscosity was increased by sucrose up to 4.6 cPoise. In this viscosity range the change in fluorescence anisotropy reflects mainly the rotation of the whole CheZ-fluorescein conjugate, and to a much lesser extent the free rotation of the probe (fluorescein). The latter rotation is not expected to be affected by the presence of CheY and AcP. Therefore, to a first approximation, the slopes of these lines, can be taken as the inverse of the respective molecular volumes (43Weber G. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we have shown that CheZ is a dimer which further oligomerizes upon interaction with CheY~P. The significance of these findings is discussed below. The different approaches used in this study to probe the molecular size of CheZ have yielded conflicting results. When run on a size-exclusion column, CheZ appears as a tetramer ((27Stock A. Stock J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3301-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this study). In the cross-linking experiments, CheZ appeared as a dimeric protein (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:). In zonal centrifugation, the estimated size of CheZ was between a monomer and a dimer (Fig. 5). Since it is well known, both experimentally (45Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 69-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 47Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and theoretically(48Giddings J.C. Kucera E. Russell C.P. Myers M.N. J. Phys. Chem. 1968; 72: 4397-4408Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar), that the molecular size of non-spherical proteins can be overestimated severalfolds by size-exclusion chromatography(45Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 69-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 47Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 48Giddings J.C. Kucera E. Russell C.P. Myers M.N. J. Phys. Chem. 1968; 72: 4397-4408Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and that the size can be underestimated in zonal centrifugation(47Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that CheZ is a non-spherical dimer. The major finding of this study is that, in the presence of CheY~P, there is further oligomerization of the CheZ dimer. However, it is not possible to determine, on the basis of the results, whether CheY~P is an integral part of the oligomer at a CheZ:CheY~P ratio of 2:1, or whether it is just bound to an oligomer comprising CheZ alone. The results of the fluorescence depolarization implied that the oligomer is about 4-5 times larger than the CheZ dimer formed in the absence of CheY~P. This suggests that the size of the oligomer is in the order of 200 kDa. This size is about at the top of the size range observed in the cross-linking experiments (Fig. 2B). The size estimation of the oligomer from the fluorescence depolarization is only a first degree approximation, because it was based on the assumption that both the oligomer and the CheZ dimer are spherical(43Weber G. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 44Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman, San Francisco1980: 454-465Google Scholar), an assumption which, according to our own results, is probably incorrect. Determination of the exact size or shape is beyond the resolution of the applied methods. A better estimation of the size of the oligomer is rather difficult by currently available methods because, at this stage, there is no obvious way to separate the oligomer from CheY~P and maintain it in a stable form. For example, techniques in which the shape contribution can be estimated (e.g. light scattering) cannot distinguish between the oligomer and CheY~P in the mixture. Nevertheless, these difficulties in size and shape estimation do not affect the conclusions reached in this study, as neither the exact size nor the shape of the oligomer are necessary for the conclusions. It should be noted that the CheZ oligomer, observed in this study, is different from the CheZ homopolymer (27Stock A. Stock J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3301-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the CheZ-CheAs multimeric complex(49Matsumura P. Roman S. Volz K. McNally D. Soc. Gen. Microbiol. Symp. 1990; 46: 135-154Google Scholar), observed earlier, in the sense that the oligomer of this study is not stable and it readily dissociates in the absence of CheY~P. In the fluorescence depolarization experiments, the anisotropy of fluorescein-labeled CheZ was increased to a large extent in the presence of CheY~P (Fig. 7A). This observation could, in principle, be attributed either to a significant increase in the molecular volume of CheZ, or to a large conformational change at the vicinity of the fluorescein moiety that restricts its free rotation. The following observations strongly suggest that a significant increase in the molecular volume of CheZ, i.e. CheZ oligomerization, is the mechanism responsible for the anisotropy change. (i) To a first approximation, the Perrin plot (Fig. 7B) is composed of two distinct rotations: a fast rotation of the probe, and a slow rotation of the whole protein. To determine the rotational freedom of the probe, we extrapolated the straight line of the Perrin plot to 1/anisotropy = 0. Since the straight line shown in the figure represents the rotation of the protein, the extrapolated value represents the hypothetical case in which the protein rotation is frozen but the probe rotates freely. As shown in Fig. 7B, both the dimeric and the oligomeric forms of CheZ fall in the same anisotropy range (1/anisotropy values of 4.0 and 4.8 for the dimer and oligomer, respectively). This indicates that the rotation of the probe itself is not significantly affected by the oligomerization, and therefore that the anisotropy change is not the result of a change in the probe rotation. (ii) An increase in anisotropy could, in principle, be due to a decrease in the lifetime of the excited state of the probe, reflected in a reduced efficiency of the fluorescence. However, the large oligomerization-dependent change in anisotropy was accompanied by only a minor reduction (7%) in the fluorescence efficiency. The lack of substantial changes in the fluorescence efficiency and in the motional freedom of the probe, is supported by the observation that both the 214F → C substitution (Fig. 6) and the conjugation of this cysteine with fluorescein maleimide 2Y. Blat and M. Eisenbach, unpublished observations. did not affect the activity of CheZ. It is well known in a variety of systems, including bacterial signal transduction systems(50Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1992; 257: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 51Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), that oligomerization regulates protein activity. Accordingly, it is conceivable that the oligomerization may either activate or inhibit the phosphatase activity of CheZ. In the first possibility, a burst of CheY phosphorylation will activate CheZ and will thereby promote faster deactivation of CheY. Fast deactivation of CheY will prevent non-beneficial too long periods of tumbling. If the other possibility is correct and oligomerization inhibits the phosphatase activity of CheZ, the oligomerization may serve as an amplification step in which phosphorylation of CheY leads to oligomerization of CheZ, inhibition of its phosphatase activity, and, consequently, further increase in the level of CheY~P. The results described in the subsequent paper (28Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1232-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that the first possibility is the correct one.

https://openalex.org/W2139425717,"Human progesterone receptor (PR) is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues; three sites (Ser102, Ser294, and Ser345) are inducible by hormone agonist, while at least six others are basally phosphorylated and exhibit a general increase in response to hormone. In this study we have used high performance liquid chromatography phosphopeptide mapping and manual peptide sequencing to investigate how two different progestin antagonists, RU486 and ZK98299, affect site-specific phosphorylation of PR isolated from T47D breast cancer cells. As compared to the progestin agonist R5020, RU486 stimulated a similar increase in overall incorporation of [32P]phosphate per PR molecule (2.5-2.6-fold for PR-A and 2.1-fold for PR-B), and at the site-specific level, RU486 stimulated both the basal and inducible sites to the same extent as R5020. In contrast, ZK98299 produced only a minimal increase in overall phosphorylation (1.2-fold for PR-A and 1.1-fold for PR-B) which was due to a reduced stimulation of the basal sites and failure to induce any of the three hormone-dependent sites. No inappropriate phosphorylation sites were detected in response to either RU486 or ZK98299. In cotreatment studies, ZK98299 blocked the increase in overall phosphorylation of PR induced by R5020, demonstrating that the failure of this antagonist to stimulate specific phosphorylation sites is not due to an inefficient interaction with PR in the intact cell. These results indicate that the biological effects of RU486 are not mediated by an alteration in the phosphorylation state of PR, whereas failure to promote phosphorylation of certain sites may contribute to the antagonist action of ZK98299. Additionally these results support the concept of two mechanistic classes of anti-progestins that affect PR differently in vivo.

Additionally these results support the concept of two mechanistic classes of anti-progestins that affect PR differently in vivo. All members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family that have been analyzed so far are phosphoproteins, and as a general property they become hyperphosphorylated as a rapid response to binding hormone in the cell(1Kuiper G.G.J.M.

The major targets for phosphorylation are serine residues located in the N-terminal domain that is required for maximal transcriptional activity. However, sites in the hinge and C-terminal ligand binding domain have also been identified in certain receptors, as well as a minor phosphotyrosine site in estrogen receptor(18Castoria G.

Although the functional role for phosphorylation of steroid receptors remains poorly defined, initial site-directed mutagenesis studies have provided direct evidence that phosphorylation of certain sites is important for receptor activity. For example, substitution of a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue for Ser118 of human estrogen receptor resulted in as much as a 60% reduction in transcriptional activity(13Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and substitution of alanine for Ser530 of chick PR decreased the sensitivity of the receptor to progesterone(20Bai W.

Human PR is expressed from a single gene as two distinct molecular forms, PR-A and PR-B. The B form contains an additional 164-amino acid N-terminal sequence; otherwise the two proteins are identical throughout their common N-terminal domain and DNA and steroid binding domains(21Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of human PR is complex. PR-B has at least nine phosphoserines N-terminal to the DNA binding region(3Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol.

Three sites identified as Ser81, Ser102, and Ser162(11Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are contained in the unique N-terminal segment of PR-B; the remaining sites are common to PR-A and PR-B. There appears to be two classes of phosphorylation sites based on how they are affected by progestin agonists. Three sites found in Ser-Pro consensus sequences, Ser102, Ser294, and Ser345, are highly inducible and were detected as major new sites only after treatment of cells with hormone agonist. The remaining sites are basally phosphorylated in the absence of hormone and exhibit a general increase in response to hormone agonist(12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, progestin agonists such as R5020 cause human PR to exhibit a slightly slower electrophoretic mobility on SDS-gels which is associated with phosphorylation of a single site at Ser345(12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steroid analogs have been developed that function as potent competitive antagonists of progesterone(22Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these compounds inactivate PR remains unresolved. Because progestin agonists and antagonists induce different conformational changes in the C-terminal domain of human PR, it is generally believed that an altered receptor conformation plays an important role(23Weigel N.L. Beck C.A. Estes P.A. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Christensen K. Edwards D.P. Mol Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1585-1597PubMed Google Scholar, 24Allan G.F. Tsai S.F. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been suggested that anti-progestins fall into two mechanistic classes. One class, represented by ZK98299 (Onapristone), has been shown in vitro to fail to induce PR association with target DNA(26Klein-Hitpass L. Cato A.C.B. Henderson D. Ryffel G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Bocquel M.T. Ji J. Ylikomc T. Benhamou B. Vergezac A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Another class of compounds, which includes the clinically important antagonist RU486 (Mifapristone), is capable of inducing high affinity association of PR with target DNA(28El-Ashry D. Oñate S.O.K.,N.S. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1545-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Meyer M.-E. Pornon A. Ji J. Bocquel M.-T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Nature. 1988; 336: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus it is generally believed that RU486 interferes with a receptor activation step downstream of DNA binding and that ZK98299 impairs receptor binding to DNA. This hypothesis for two classes of anti-progestins is based largely on in vitro receptor DNA binding studies and has come under challenge by studies that have assessed PR binding to specific target DNA sequences in vivo (32Delabre K. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4421-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Truss M. Bartsch J. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11333-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that progestin agonists affect overall phosphorylation of human PR differently than antagonists, implying that an altered phosphorylation state of PR may contribute to the antagonist activity of these compounds. RU486 was reported to stimulate as much as a 2-3-fold higher incorporation of [32P]phosphate into human PR as compared to the progestin agonist R5020, and ZK98299 stimulated 60% less total incorporation than R5020(3Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Takimoto G.S. Tasset D.M. Eppert C. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additionally, ZK98299 failed to promote the upshift of PR mobility on SDS-gel electrophoresis that is associated with phosphorylation(34Takimoto G.S. Tasset D.M. Eppert C. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whether these differences in total levels of phosphorylation represent general quantitative changes at all phosphorylation sites and/or qualitative changes, including phosphorylation of inappropriate sites, has not been investigated. In this study we have used methods developed previously for identification of PR phosphorylation sites (11Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol.

[3H]R5020 (promegestone: [17α-methyl-3H]17α, 21-dimethyl-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3, 20-one; 87 Ci/mmol), unlabeled R5020, carrier-free [32P]H3PO4 (8200-9200 Ci/mmol), and EXPRE35S protein labeling mix (1,175 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. RU486 (Mifapristone) was a gift from Roussel-UCLAF (Romainville, France) and ZK98299 (Onapristone) was provided by Dr. David Henderson, Schering (Berlin). AB-52 is a mouse monoclonal immunoglobin G produced against purified human PR that recognizes both the A and B isoforms of PR(35Estes P.A. Suba E.J. Lawler-Heavner J. Elashry-Stowers D. Wei L.L. Sullivan E.P. Toft D.O. Horwitz K.B. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. Phenylisothiocyanate and HPLC reagents were purchased from J. T. Baker Inc. and triethylamine, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and sequencing-grade trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Sigma. Sequelon-AA membranes and Mylar sheets were obtained from Millipore Corp. (Milford, MA). T47D human breast cancer cells were cultured as described previously(36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At 24 h prior to radiolabeling, cultures were switched to medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum that was stripped of steroid hormones by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal. For labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, the serum containing medium was removed and cells were preincubated in phosphate-free serum-free medium (phosphate-free minimal essental medium, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then incubated for another 6 h at 37°C in phosphate-free minimal essental medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.83 mCi/ml). For labeling with [35S]methionine, paired cultures of T47D cells were incubated for 48 h with minimal essential medium containing 5% charcoal-treated serum supplemented by the addition of 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. As determined from previous experiments, this results in steady-state 35S-labeling of PR protein in T47D cells(37Edwards D.P. Estes P.A. Fadok V.A. Bona B.J. Oñate S. Nordeen S.K. Welch W.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2482-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ligands or vehicle (ethanol) were added for the last 2 h of radiolabeling. The turnover rate of 32P incorporated into PR in T47D cells was determined by pulse-chase experiments. Between 4 and 6 h after chase with excess unlabeled phosphate, 32P counts were no longer detected in immunoprecipitated PR (data not shown). Thus to achieve uniform 32P labeling of PR, T47D cells were incubated for a total of 6 h with [32P]orthophosphate. Harvested cell pellets were lysed in KPFM buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 12 mM monothioglycerol) containing 0.5 M NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described previously(36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant, considered as a whole cell extract, was dialyzed against KPFM or diluted 1:1 with KPFM to reduce the salt concentration before immunoprecipitation. Radiolabeled PR in whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibody AB-52 (35Estes P.A. Suba E.J. Lawler-Heavner J. Elashry-Stowers D. Wei L.L. Sullivan E.P. Toft D.O. Horwitz K.B. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using protein A-Sepharose as an immunoabsorbent as described previously(30DeMarzo A.M. Oñate S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10491-10501Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with KPFM containing 0.3 M NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound protein, and immobilized receptors were eluted with 2% SDS-sample buffer and electrophoresed on 7.0% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously(30DeMarzo A.M. Oñate S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10491-10501Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The 32P- and 35S-labeled receptors were detected by autoradiography of fixed gels. In phosphopeptide mapping experiments, unfixed wet gels were exposed to x-ray film to detect the position of radiolabeled PR bands, gel pieces corresponding to PR-A and PR-B were then excised, and radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting. To determine the 35S counts in PR bands, excised gel pieces containing either PR-A or PR-B were digested and solubilized in Absolve (DuPont NEN) for 30 min at 55°C, and 35S was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. Gel-purified receptors were extracted and digested with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (20 μg) as described previously (11Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This digestion protocol resulted in a highly reproducible phosphopeptide mapping profile, indicating digestion to completion, and a >70% recovery of 32P counts was obtained from gel pieces. The extracted 32P-labeled tryptic peptides were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, dried under vacuum, and redissolved in 100 μl of 50% formic acid. The [32P]peptides were then separated on a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column by a 0-45% H20:acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column, controlled by a Gilson HPLC system, was run for 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 32P-Labeled peptides were detected by an in-line β-RAM radio-HPLC detector from IN/US Systems (Tampa, FL) using a 0.5-ml flow cell. To determine the number and position of phosphorylated residues in each of the HPLC-eluted phosphopeptides, we performed manual Edman degradation by the method of Sullivan and Wong (38Sullivan S. Wong T.-W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Each of the major phosphopeptide peaks collected by HPLC was dried down, dissolved in 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile, and immobilized on an arylamine-Sequelon disk. An aliquot (30 μl) of the redissolved [32P]peptide was spotted on the disk and incubated at 50°C for 5 min by placing the disk on a Mylar sheet on top of a heating block. The aqueous solvent was then evaporated, and the peptide was covalently linked to the disk by adding 5 μl of ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide solution (10 mg/ml in 0.1 M MES, pH 5.0) and allowing the disk to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. The disk was then washed three times with methanol and subjected to Edman degradation beginning with treatment for 10 min at 50°C with 0.5 ml of coupling reagent (methanol:water:triethylamine:phenylisothiocyanate; 7:1:1:1, v/v). After five washes with 1 ml of methanol, the disk was reheated to 50°C for 6 min with 0.5 ml of trifluoroacetic acid to cleave the N-terminal residue. The trifluoroacetic acid solution was placed in a vial, and the disk was washed with 1 ml of trifluoroacetic acid and 42.5% phosphoric acid (9:1, v/v). The wash was combined with the trifluoroacetic acid solution, and 32P was quantitated by Cerenkov counting. The disk was then washed five times with 1 ml of methanol before the next cycle was started. In previous time course studies we have shown that the progestin agonist R5020 stimulates a sequential increase in phosphorylation of human PR in T47D cells(12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Most of the net increase in 32P incorporation into PR occurs rapidly within a few minutes of hormone addition. This is followed by a slower phosphorylation that is associated with an upshift of the electrophoretic mobility of PR on SDS gels. The major difference between upshifted and nonupshifted PR is the phosphorylation of Ser345 in the upshifted band. Because PR is phosphorylated on multiple different sites, the upshift occurs with only a slight further increase in total 32P incorporation(12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the effects of progestin antagonists on phosphorylation of PR by incubating T47D cells for a total of 6 h with [32P]orthophosphate and adding ligand for the last 2 h of labeling. As determined in preliminary studies (see “Experimental Procedures”), these conditions result in uniform 32P-labeling of PR, and this time of exposure to hormone agonist is sufficient to stimulate both stages of phosphorylation. To extract total cellular PR (cytosol and nuclear) and to minimize dephosphorylation during in vitro processing, cell lysates were prepared in buffers containing 0.5 M NaCl and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride and 50 mM potassium phosphate). Radiolabeled PR in cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with the PR-specific monoclonal antibody AB-52(35Estes P.A. Suba E.J. Lawler-Heavner J. Elashry-Stowers D. Wei L.L. Sullivan E.P. Toft D.O. Horwitz K.B. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and 32P-labeled receptors were isolated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, both the A and B forms of PR were basally phosphorylated in the absence of hormone, and R5020 treatment resulted in a substantial increase in total 32P incorporation into both forms of the receptor. Additionally, the majority of the hyperphosphorylated receptors exhibited a slight upshift in electrophoretic mobility after R5020 treatment. It should be noted that PR-B in the absence of hormone shows band heterogeneity on SDS-gels resulting in its migrating as a doublet or triplet, whereas PR-A is a singlet band. After 2 h of hormone agonist treatment, all of the PR-B bands show a slight slowing (upshift) in electrophoretic mobility, while PR-A typically forms a doublet (Fig. 1)(3Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Takimoto G.S. Tasset D.M. Eppert C. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 36Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Treatment with RU486 produced an increase in total 32P incorporation and a mobility upshift that was similar to that observed with R5020 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, ZK98299 produced only a modest increase in total 32P incorporation into the A and B forms of PR and failed to produce the same mobility upshifts as R5020 and RU486 (Fig. 1A). We have normalized 32P incorporation into PR-protein by steady-state labeling of paired T47D cell cultures with [35S]methionine. The fold increase in total 32P incorporation normalized to PR protein was calculated by taking the ratio of 32P to 35S counts in the PR bands excised from SDS gels. Based on average values from multiple independent determinations, R5020 stimulated a 2.6- and a 2.1-fold increase in total 32P incorporation per receptor molecule, respectively, for PR-A and PR-B (Table 1). RU486 stimulated similar increases of 2.5- and 2.1-fold, respectively, for PR-A and PR-B. In contrast, ZK98299 promoted minimal 1.2- and 1.1-fold increases in PR-A and PR-B (Table 1). It is of interest to point out that total 32P-labeling of PR-B was higher than PR-A (Fig. 1 and Table 1) which is consistent with the fact that PR-B contains three additional phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal segment unique to PR-B that are not present in PR-A (11Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). These results show that ZK98299 and RU486 have distinct effects on the overall level of phosphorylation of PR in vivo.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Because ZK98299 has a lower binding affinity for PR than R5020(32Delabre K.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we questioned whether the failure to stimulate hyperphosphorylation might be due simply to an inefficient interaction of ZK98299 with PR in vivo as opposed to actually blocking phosphorylation when bound to PR. To compensate for the lower affinity cells were incubated with a much higher concentration of ZK98299 (500 nM) than either R5020 or RU486 (80 nM). However, one cannot be certain that cellular PR was fully occupied by ZK98299 even under these conditions. Therefore, we conducted the experiment shown in Fig. 2 and presented quantitatively in Table 2. T47D cells were labeled for 6 h with 32P, and during the last 2 h of labeling cells were treated either with ZK98299 or R5020 alone, or they were coincubated with ZK98299 and R5020. The concentration of ZK98299 (500 nM) was the same here as in all other experiments. However, R5020 was lowered from 80 to 20 nM to maximize competition for binding to PR by ZK98299. An SDS-gel of immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled PR shows that ZK98299 effectively inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of PR stimulated by R5020 (Fig. 2). The fold increase in total 32P incorporation into PR-A and PR-B was quantitated, and the data show that R5020 stimulation of 32P incorporation into PR was essentially eliminated by cotreatment with a 25-fold excess of ZK98299 (Table 2). It should be noted that the fold increase in overall phosphorylati"

Cloning of a cDNA encoding p150Glued from rat revealed 31% amino acid sequence identity with the product of the Drosophila gene, Glued. A dominant Glued mutation results in neuronal disruption; null mutations are lethal. However, the Glued gene product has not been characterized. To determine whether the Glued polypeptide is functionally similar to vertebrate p150Glued, we characterized the Glued protein in the Drosophila S-2 cell line. Antibodies raised against Glued were used to demonstrate that this protein sediments exclusively at 20 S, and associates with microtubules in a salt- and ATP-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitations from S-2 cytosol with the anti-Glued antibody resulted in the co-precipitation of subunits of both cytoplasmic dynein and the dynactin complex. An affinity column with covalently bound Glued protein retained cytoplasmic dynein from S-2 cytosol. Based on these observations, we conclude that Glued is a component of a dynactin complex in Drosophila and binds to cytoplasmic dynein, and therefore the mutant Glued phenotypes can be interpreted as resulting from a disruption in the function of the dynactin complex. p150Glued is the largest polypeptide in the dynactin complex, a protein heteromultimer that binds to and may mediate the microtubule-based motor cytoplasmic dynein.

INTRODUCTIONThe vertebrate dynactin complex is a 20 S protein heteromultimer that is thought to be involved in mediating intracellular transport by the microtubule-based motor protein, cytoplasmic dynein(1Schroer T.A.

The dynactin complex consists of 10 polypeptides, of molecular mass = 150, 135, 62, 50, 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kDa(3Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Pfister K.K. Clark S. Meyer D. Vallee R.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). While these polypeptide were originally identified as substoichiometric components of cytoplasmic dynein preparations(7Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was subsequently found that dynein and the dynactin complex form distinct 20 S complexes in cytosol that were separable by ion exchange chromatography (2Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1639-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) or immunoprecipitation(3Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Pfister K.K. Clark S. Meyer D. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15318-15323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration of two distinct complexes made unclear the relationship between dynein and the dynactin complex in processes of intracellular motility. In an in vitro motility assay, although cytoplasmic dynein alone could move microtubules along glass, both complexes were required to move vesicles along microtubules(2Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1639-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Also, evidence from genetic studies suggested that the two complexes were involved in similar processes in vivo (8Li Y.-Y. Yeh E. Hays T. Bloom K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, in vertebrate cells, components of both the dynactin complex and cytoplasmic dynein were found to localize to the same subcellular structures, including the centrosome during interphase, and kinetochores and spindle microtubules during mitosis (2Gill S.R.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that affinity matrices containing either covalently bound p150Glued, the largest polypeptide in the dynactin complex(2Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1639-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Pfister K.K. Clark S. Meyer D. Vallee R.B. J. Biol.

Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), provides a clear demonstration that the two complexes are capable of a direct biochemical interaction.Several of the component polypeptides of the vertebrate dynactin complex have been characterized. The 45-kDa protein, centractin, shares ∼50% amino acid sequence identity with skeletal muscle actin, and has been classified as a member of the Arp-1 family of actin-related proteins(3Paschal B.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1777-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There is also 1 mol of conventional actin present per dynactin complex(5Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. Schroer T.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The 37- and 32-kDa polypeptides of the dynactin complex have been identified by antibody cross-reactivity as the α and β subunits of the F-actin binding protein, capping protein or CapZ(5Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Characterization of rat cDNA clones encoding the 150-kDa polypeptide indicated that this protein shared 31% amino acid sequence identity with the product of the Glued gene of Drosophila melanogaster (21Holzbaur E.L.F. Hammerback J.A. Paschal B.M. Kravit N.G. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Swaroop A. Swaroop M. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the 150-kDa rat polypeptide was subsequently named p150Glued(3Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Pfister K.K. Clark S. Meyer D. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15318-15323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Drosophila Glued gene has been extensively characterized by traditional genetic approaches. The original dominant Glued mutation, Gl results in abnormal eye formation in heterozygotes, with a reduced number of facets and a smooth shiny surface(23Plough H.H. Ives P.T. Genetics. 1935; 20: 42-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These macroscopic aberrations result from gross disruptions of the optic lobe, as well as disorganization of axonal projections between the retinal cells and the medulla neuropil (24Harte P.J. Kankle D.R. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Homozygotes for Gl as well as null mutants at the Glued locus die by the first instar stage of development (24Harte P.J. Kankle D.R. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Garen A. Miller B.R. Paco-Larsen M.L. Genetics. 1984; 107: 645-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of embryos to survive to this stage is probably due to maternal contribution of Glued transcripts to the zygote(25Garen A. Miller B.R. Paco-Larsen M.L. Genetics. 1984; 107: 645-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Swaroop A. Sun J.-W. Paco-Larson M.L. Garen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies showed that Glued is transcribed in virtually all tissues and at multiple stages of Drosophila development(26Swaroop A. Sun J.-W. Paco-Larson M.L. Garen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, mosaic analyses of mutations induced at the Glued locus by somatic recombination showed a failure to recover homozygous cells in heterozygous flies(27Harte P.J. Kankel D.R. Genetics. 1982; 101: 477-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that Glued is essential for the viability of individual cells.Although Drosophila Glued and rat p150Glued share significant sequence identity, the homology between them is discontinuous and patchy(21Holzbaur E.L.F. Hammerback J.A. Paschal B.M. Kravit N.G. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Regions of p150Glued and the Glued polypeptide that share particularly high sequence identity include an N-terminal domain that has recently been shown to mediate the binding of p150Glued to microtubules (16Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and a highly charged C-terminal motif that is involved in the binding of p150Glued to centractin (16Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The conservation of these functional domains supports the contention that the two polypeptides may be involved in analogous cellular functions in vertebrates and Drosophila. However, related proteins have been identified that also share extensive sequence identity with the microtubule binding domain of p150Glued, including the human endosome-microtubule linker protein, CLIP-170 (28Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the yeast microtubule binding protein, BIK-1(29Berlin V. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2573-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Glued, p150Glued, and CLIP-170 also share remarkable similarity in predicted secondary structure outside of this domain, including extensive predicted α-helices with heptad repeats of hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1). Therefore, based on sequence comparisons alone it is unclear whether Glued and p150Glued polypeptides are related members of a large family of microtubule binding proteins, or if they share a homologous function in the dynactin complexes of Drosophila and rat, respectively.To date, there has been no biochemical or cell biological characterization of the Glued gene product in Drosophila. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Glued and p150Glued are members of functionally homologous dynactin complexes. To approach this question, antibodies were raised to recombinant Glued protein and used to examine the biochemical properties and cellular distribution of Glued in the embryonically derived Drosophila Schneider 2 (S-2) cell line(30Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar). We find that the Glued polypeptide is a member of an oligomeric, microtubule-associated, dynactin complex which localizes to the centrosome of cultured cells. In addition, like p150Glued, we demonstrate that Glued is capable of a direct interaction with Drosophila cytoplasmic dynein in S-2 cell cytosol. The similarity in biochemical behavior and subcellular localization of these two proteins indicates that they are involved in analogous cellular functions, and in turn, that dynactin function is essential for cell viability in Drosophila.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Cytosolic SupernatantsS-2 cells, cultured as described(30Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), were harvested in mid-log phase, pelleted, rinsed once in PHEM buffer (50 mM PIPES, 1The abbreviations used are: PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. 50 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.0) and homogenized in 1.5 volumes of homogenization buffer (PHEM with 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml n-tosyl-L-arginine methylester and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 45,000 × g in a Ti60 rotor (Beckman) at 4°C, followed by centrifugation for 60 min at 4°C in a Ti-60 rotor at 145,000 × g. The resulting cytosolic extract was used fresh for all experiments. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cytosol was prepared in RIPA buffer without SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate), with the protease inhibitors described above. To generate rat brain cytosol, frozen rat brains were homogenized in 1.5 volumes of PHEM buffer with protease inhibitors, and the homogenate was processed similarly.Sucrose Gradient Fractionation of S-2 CytosolA half-milliliter of fresh S-2 cytosol was loaded onto a 12-ml 5-25% linear sucrose density gradient in PHEM buffer or RIPA buffer without SDS and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 17 h at 4°C in a Ti SW-41 rotor (Beckman). Gradients were calibrated with catalase (11.3 S), thyroglobulin (19 S), and bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase (26.6 S) as standards. One milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Isolation of Microtubule-associated ProteinsATP was depleted from freshly prepared S-2 or rat brain cytosol by incubation for 15 min at 37°C with 3 units/ml hexokinase and 50 mM glucose. Microtubules were then assembled in the cytosol by addition of taxol to 40 μM and incubation at 37°C for 15 min. Exogenous bovine brain microtubules, assembled from DEAE-purified tubulin dimers and stabilized with taxol (31Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), were added to the cytosol at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and the incubation continued for 15 min. Microtubules were then pelleted through a 6% sucrose cushion at 65,000 × g in a Ti-60 rotor, washed in PHEM with 40 μM taxol, and extracted in a minimal volume of either 10 mM MgATP or 0.4 M NaCl in PHEM buffer. ATP and NaCl extracts were loaded onto 5-25% linear sucrose density gradients and run as above. Gradient fractions were concentrated by methanol precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Construction of Glued Affinity Matrix and Affinity ChromatographyA 2.0-kilobase BamHI fragment of the Glued cDNA (kind gift of Dr. A. Garen, Yale University) that codes for amino acids 599-1319 from the C terminus of Glued (Fig. 1) was subcloned into the pET15b bacterial expression vector (Novagen). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 (Novagen), and purified by the His-Tag (Novagen) system on a Ni2+ affinity column under denaturing conditions as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The purified protein was dialyzed into coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8), and bound overnight at 4°C to CH-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Following blocking and washing according to manufacturer's specifications (Pharmacia), 0.5 ml of the affinity matrix was packed into a column, equilibrated in PHEM buffer, and the column was loaded with ∼2 ml of S-2 cytosol. The column was washed with 200 bed volumes of PHEM plus 50 mM NaCl, and eluted with a step gradient of PHEM plus 0.5 M NaCl and then PHEM plus 1.0 M NaCl. The eluates were concentrated by methanol precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Antibody Production and ImmunocytochemistryThe bacterially expressed and purified fragment of the Glued cDNA was used to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified against the Glued affinity matrix described above. The purified antibodies were eluted from the affinity matrix in 100 mM triethylamine, and transferred into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 50 mM NaPO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with or without 1% bovine serum albumin by gel filtration over a NAP-10 column (Pharmacia). Affinity purified antibodies were used for all experiments described.For immunoprecipitation, protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) were loaded with anti-Glued or anti-p150Glued antibodies (16Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) in PBS at 4°C overnight. Cytosol was pre-cleared by incubation with unloaded protein A beads for 30 min at 4°C, prior to incubation with antibody-bound beads for 3 h at 4°C, with agitation. The beads were then rinsed extensively with RIPA buffer without SDS and eluted with sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Protein eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore). For some immunoprecipitation experiments, Western blots were probed with biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) conjugated primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescense (DuPont) or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and H2O2. For all other experiments, Western blots were probed with rabbit primary antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG and then rabbit peroxidase anti-peroxidase (Jackson Immunologicals) and developed similarly. The anti-centractin antibody has been described previously(18Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the anti-dynein heavy chain antibody DD1 (17Vaisberg E.A. Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) was the kind gift of Dr. E. Vaisberg.For immunofluorescent localization of the Glued polypeptide, coverslips of S-2 cells were fixed at −20°C in methanol with 1 mM EGTA, blocked for at least 1 h in PBS with 10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin, and rinsed in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in primary antibody, rinsed in PBS, incubated for 1 h in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunologicals) that had been preadsorbed against fixed S-2 cells, rinsed, and mounted in Tris-buffered Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) mounting media with 0.5% n-propyl gallate (Kodak) to retard photobleaching. Microtubules were localized with the rat monoclonal anti-yeast tubulin antibody YL1/2 (Serotec) and centrosomes were localized with rabbit anti-Drosophila γ-tubulin antibody ((32Zheng Y. Jung M.K. Oakley B.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 817-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), the kind gift of Dr. Y. Zheng). Immunofluorescence was performed on a Leica TCS laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 100×/1.4 oil objective, a krypton-argon laser and fluorescein and Texas red filters. Contrast enhancement and “sharpening” convolutions were applied to images using the Leica software prior to recording on T-MAX 100 film using a Focus Imagecorder Plus (Focus Graphics).RESULTSGlued Is a Member of a Microtubule-associated Polypeptide ComplexIn order to characterize the biochemical behavior of the Glued protein in Drosophila S-2 cells, we raised polyclonal antibodies to the C-terminal half of the Glued protein, expressed in E. coli. Affinity purified antibodies reacted specifically with a doublet of 150/135 kDa in whole S-2 cell cytosol (Fig. 2). The presence of an immunoreactive doublet of polypeptides of 150 and 135 kDa is also characteristic for p150Glued isolated from various vertebrate species(2Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I.

As a test for immunologic relatedness between Glued and rat p150Glued, the anti-Glued antibodies were used to probe a 0.4 M NaCl extract of rat brain microtubules, which is highly enriched in p150Glued(21Holzbaur E.L.F.

The anti-Glued antibody reacted solely with a 150-kDa polypeptide in the rat sample (Fig. 2). The immunoreactive rat polypeptide was identical in mobility to a 150-kDa polypeptide recognized when immunoblots were re-probed when polyclonal antibodies to rat p150Glued(16Waterman-Storer C.M.

However, the anti-p150Glued antibodies did not cross-react with Glued protein in S-2 cytosol.Figure 2:Cross-reactivity of anti-Glued antibodies with p150Glued from rat brain microtubule salt extract. Proteins from whole S-2 cell cytosol (lane 1) or rat brain microtubule 0.4 M NaCl extract (lane 2) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (A) or transferred to Immobilon-P and probed with anti-Drosophila Glued antibodies (B).

In order to examine the microtubule binding properties of the Glued protein, microtubules were assembled from endogenous tubulin in S-2 cytosol by addition of taxol. Because of the low level of tubulin in S-2 cells as compared to neuronal tissue, excess exogenous taxol-stabilized bovine brain microtubules were also added to the assay. After incubation, the microtubules and associated proteins were isolated by centrifugation, and following a buffer wash, the microtubules were extracted with either 10 mM ATP or 0.4 M NaCl, and the resulting fractions were examined by immunoblot with the anti-Glued antibody (Fig. 3, A and B). The Glued polypeptide was observed to remain soluble in the cytosol until microtubules were assembled, and then to co-sediment with microtubules (Fig. 3, A and B). Extraction of the pellet with either 10 mM MgATP or 0.4 M NaCl released the 150-kDa Glued protein from microtubules into the supernatant. In contrast, most of the 135-kDa Glued polypeptide did not co-sediment with microtubules (Fig. 3B), and therefore very little of the 135-kDa protein was extracted from microtubules by either ATP or salt (Fig. 3B). The ATP- and salt-sensitive microtubule binding of the Glued polypeptide was compared to the behavior of rat brain p150Glued under similar conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). The p150Glued polypeptide co-sedimented with microtubules, and was nearly fully released with either ATP or elevated ionic strength, as had been previously noted for the rat protein(7Collins C.A.

Samples from the preparation were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to Immobilon P, the blot stained with Coomassie Blue (A), destained, and probed with anti-Glued (S-2, B) or anti-p150Glued antibodies (Rat, B). S-2 cell cytosol was prepared by two successive rounds of centrifugation (45k, 45,000 × g; 145k, 145,000 × g; S, supernatant; P, pellet). ATP was depleted in the cytosol, microtubules were assembled, and exogenous, taxol-stabilized, bovine brain microtubules were added. Microtubules were then sedimented and washed (MT; S, post-microtubule supernatant; P, buffer washed microtubule pellet). The microtubule pellet was then extracted of associated proteins with either 10 mM ATP (ATP; S, ATP extract of microtubules; P, post-ATP extracted pellet) or 0.4 M NaCl (NaCl; S, NaCl extract of microtubules, P, post-NaCl extracted pellet). Rat brain (Rat) was processed similarly, but only the 10 mM ATP (ATP, S and p) and 0.4 M NaCl (NaCl, S and P) extracts of microtubules are shown for comparison. The ATP extract of S-2 microtubules was then sedimented through a 5-25% sucrose gradient and the fractions analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Glued antibodies (C). Arrowhead corresponds to the position of a 150-kDa molecular mass marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ATP eluate of microtubules from S-2 cell extracts was further fractionated on 5-25% linear sucrose density gradients. Immunoblots of the gradient fractions indicated that Glued sedimented at 20 S (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that microtubule-associated Glued polypeptide is part of a large protein complex. To determine whether the Glued polypeptide exists in S-2 cytosol exclusively as a component of a macromolecular complex, whole cytosol was fractionated on a 5-25% sucrose density gradient. Analysis of gradient fractions by immunoblotting revealed that both the 150- and 135-kDa Glued polypeptides sedimented solely as a peak at ∼20 S (Fig. 4). The absence of detectable immunoreactivity at a lower sedimentation coefficient suggests that there is not a significant fraction of free Glued subunits in S-2 cytosol.Figure 4:Sedimentation behavior of the Glued polypeptide in S-2 cell cytosol. Whole S-2 cell cytosol was subjected to centrifugation through a 5-25% sucrose density gradient, and the gradient fractions analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to Immobilon-P, and the blot Stained with Coomassie Blue (A). The blot was destained and probed with anti-Glued antibodies (B).

Because calcium is necessary for prohormone processing enzyme activity, secretory granule fusion with the plasma membrane, and possibly sorting to the regulated pathway, we treated permeabilized cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 to determine the role of calcium in pro-SRIF cleavage and nascent vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here we demonstrate that pro-SRIF cleavage was markedly inhibited when lumenal free calcium was chelated with EGTA in the presence of A23187. Surprisingly, submillimolar free calcium (∼15 μM) was sufficient to maintain prohormone cleavage efficiency, a value far lower than that estimated for total calcium levels in the TGN and secretory granules. Experiments using both A23187 and the protonophore CCCP revealed that free calcium is absolutely required for efficient pro-SRIF cleavage, even at the optimal pH of 6.1. Secretory vesicle formation by contrast was not inhibited by calcium chelation but rather by millimolar extralumenal free calcium. Together, these observations demonstrate that pro-SRIF processing and budding of nascent secretory vesicles from the TGN can be uncoupled and therefore have distinct biochemical requirements. Interestingly, our data using intact GH3 cells demonstrate that basal secretion of SRIF-related material is largely calcium-dependent and therefore cannot be equated with constitutive pathway secretion. These results underscore the importance of determining calcium requirements before assigning a secretion event to either the constitutive or regulated secretory pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2053359918,"Fluorescent analogs of the proteinase zymogen, plasminogen (Pg), which are specifically inactivated and labeled at the catalytic site have been prepared and characterized as probes of the mechanisms of Pg activation. The active site induced non-proteolytically in Pg by streptokinase (SK) was inactivated stoichiometrically with the thioester peptide chloromethyl ketone, Nα-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-(D-Phe)-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl; the thiol group generated subsequently on the incorporated inhibitor with NH2OH was quantitatively labeled with the fluorescence probe, 2-((4′-iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; and the labeled Pg was separated from SK. Cleavage of labeled [Glu]Pg1 by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was accompanied by a fluorescence enhancement (ΔFmax/Fo) of 2.0, and formation of 1% plasmin (Pm) activity. Comparison of labeled and native [Glu]Pg1 as uPA substrates showed that activation of labeled [Glu]Pg1 generated [Glu]Pm1 as the major product, while native [Glu]Pg1 was activated at a faster rate and produced [Lys]Pm1 because of concurrent proteolysis by plasmin. When a mixture of labeled and native Pg was activated, to include plasmin-feedback reactions, the zymogens were activated at equivalent rates. The lack of potential proteolytic activity of the Pg derivatives allowed their interactions with SK to be studied under equilibrium binding conditions. SK bound to labeled [Glu]Pg1 and [Lys]Pg1 with dissociation constants of 590 ± 110 and 11 ± 7 nM, and fluorescence enhancements of 3.1 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.1, respectively. Characterization of the interaction of SK with native [Glu]Pg1 by the use of labeled [Glu]Pg1 as a probe indicated a ∼6-fold higher affinity of SK for the native Pg zymogen compared to the labeled Pg analog. Saturating levels of ε-aminocaproic acid reduced the affinity of SK for labeled [Glu]Pg1 by ∼2-fold and lowered the fluorescence enhancement to 1.8 ± 0.1, whereas the affinity of SK for labeled [Lys]Pg1 was reduced by ∼98-fold with little effect on the enhancement. These results demonstrate that occupation of lysine binding sites modulates the affinity of SK for Pg and the changes in the environment of the catalytic site associated with SK-induced conformational activation. Together, these studies show that the labeled Pg derivatives behave as analogs of native Pg which report functionally significant changes in the environment of the catalytic site of the zymogen."

Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. 32P-Labeled PC12 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-MacMARCKS antibody and subjected to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously(3Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled MacMARCKS was visualized by autoradiography. PC12 cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and differentiated for 5 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 ng/ml NGF. The cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 120 mM phosphate buffer containing 4% (w/v) sucrose and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously(19Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Mundigl O.M. Matteoli M. Daniell L. Thomas-Reetz A. Metcalf A. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The coverslips were incubated with affinity-purified anti-MacMARCKS antibody (1:50 dilution), followed by a 1:1000 dilution of a Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tago, Burlingame, CA). Synaptophysin was visualized using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-synaptophysin antibody in conjunction with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, Westgrove, PA). Stained cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope using a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective. Confocal microscopy was performed using the Molecular Dynamics Image Space software and a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Synaptosomes were purified from rat cerebrocortices as described previously (21Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) with minor modifications(22Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A.A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The final purified synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in phosphate-free incubation buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) to 2 mg/ml and radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) for 45 min (23Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.I. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 281-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extrasynaptosomal [32P]orthophosphate was removed by centrifugation of the synaptosomes at 1000 × g for 5 min. Radiolabeled synaptosomes (100 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence of 300 nM phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu) or were depolarized by the addition of KCl to a final concentration of 40 mM (isotonicity being maintained by a corresponding decrease in the concentration of NaCl). Incubations were terminated by the addition of 4 volumes of cold lysis buffer. Samples were then immunoprecipitated with the MacMARCKS antibody. A myristoylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of PC12 cells labeled with [3H]myristic acid using a rabbit antiserum raised against murine MacMARCKS (Fig. 1A). The 48-kDa protein was heat stable and was the only protein recognized upon immunoblotting with antiserum to MacMARCKS (Fig. 1B). The protein was phosphorylated when 32P-labeled PC12 cells were stimulated with PMA, suggesting that it is a PKC substrate (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated phosphoprotein had an isoelectric point of 4.2 (Fig. 1C), identical to that of MacMARCKS(3Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The 48-kDa protein was also phosphorylated in PC12 extracts by purified PKC, and two-dimensional thermolytic phosphopeptide mapping showed a single phosphopeptide that was identical to that generated from purified recombinant murine MacMARCKS (data not shown) or from purified rabbit macrophage MacMARCKS phosphorylated by PKC(3Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The 48-kDa protein was not GAP-43/neuromodulin since it migrated differently to GAP-43/neuromodulin on a two-dimensional gel, and its phosphopeptide map differed from that of GAP-43/neuromodulin (Fig. 1C and data not shown). In addition, the antibody to MacMARCKS did not recognize GAP-43/neuromodulin, nor did an antibody to GAP-43/neuromodulin recognize MacMARCKS (data not shown). These data indicate that the 48-kDa PKC substrate in PC12 cells is MacMARCKS.Figure 2:MacMARCKS is phosphorylated upon depolarization of PC12 cells. A, PC12 cells radiolabeled with 32Pi were either not treated (lane 1), exposed to PMA (200 nM, 30 min, lane 2), or subjected to depolarization (60 mM KCl for 1 min) either in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of 1.5 mM extracellular Ca2+. PC12 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-MacMARCKS antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. B, PC12 cells were prelabeled with [3H]myristic acid, treated with control buffer (C), 60 mM KCl (K+), or 200 nM PMA and fractionated to isolate particulate (P) and cytosol (S) fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-MacMARCKS antibody, and MacMARCKS was visualized by fluorography after 10% SDS-PAGE. C, PC12 cells were radiolabeled with 32Pi and treated and fractionated as described in B. Immunoprecipitated MacMARCKS was visualized by autoradiography after 10% SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MacMARCKS displayed a basal level of phosphorylation in unstimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 2A). PMA treatment or KCl-induced depolarization increased MacMARCKS phosphorylation 4-fold (Fig. 2A). Depolarization-induced phosphorylation was completely dependent on Ca2+ in the medium (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Since the related PKC substrate, MARCKS, is released from membranes upon phosphorylation(13Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we examined whether phosphorylation similarly displaces MacMARCKS from membranes. In both unstimulated cells and in cells depolarized with elevated KCl, greater than 95% of [3H]myristoylated MacMARCKS was associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 2B). Similarly, most of the phosphorylated MacMARCKS was associated with the membrane fraction of control or depolarized PC12 cells (Fig. 2C), although the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of the cytosolic protein appears higher than its membrane-bound counterpart (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). PMA treatment resulted in the release of approximately 20% of [3H]myristoylated MacMARCKS from the membrane. The stoichiometry of PMA-induced phosphorylation of the cytosolic form was also greater than that of the membrane bound protein (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). NGF-treated PC12 cells were stained with affinity-purified antibody to MacMARCKS. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that MacMARCKS was localized throughout the cell in a punctate pattern, with prominent staining in neuronal processes and varicosities (Fig. 3, A and B). Confocal microscopy confirmed these results and further demonstrated the staining of MacMARCKS in neuronal processes (Fig. 3C). By double-labeled immunofluorescence microscopy, MacMARCKS co-localized with synaptophysin (Fig. 3, C and D), a marker of small synaptic vesicles and endosomes in PC12 cells(19Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Linstedt A.D. Vetter M.L. Bishop J.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Co-localization of MacMARCKS and synaptophysin was especially evident in distal neuronal processes (Fig. 3, C and D, arrows) and was also prominent in the perinuclear region. NGF-induced differentiation did not influence the level of expression of MacMARCKS protein, as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). The presence of MacMARCKS in the tips of neuronal processes of PC12 cells and its co-localization with synaptophysin led us to examine whether it is found in isolated nerve termini. 32P-Labeled synaptosomes were treated with either the active phorbol ester PDBu or elevated KCl, and phosphorylated MacMARCKS was immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). Stimulation of endogenous PKC with PDBu resulted in near maximal phosphorylation of MacMARCKS within 20 s, and these levels were sustained for at least 2 min (Fig. 4, A and B). The initial kinetics and extent of depolarization-dependent phosphorylation of MacMARCKS paralleled that of PDBu-induced phosphorylation, but was more transient (Fig. 4, A and B). We examined the distribution of MacMARCKS in subcellular fractions from rat cerebral cortex using a procedure that results in the isolation of a variety of vesicular populations including a highly purified synaptic vesicle fraction(14Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). As expected, both synapsin 1 and synaptophysin were highly enriched in purified synaptic vesicles (CPG3) and were absent from soluble fractions (S3 and LS2) (Fig. 5). MacMARCKS was detected in most membrane fractions, including small vesicles (P3 and LP2) and purified synaptic vesicle fractions (CPG3). MacMARCKS was also present in the soluble fractions (S3 and LS2). MARCKS was detected in most membrane fractions including small vesicles (P3 and LP2) and was also enriched in soluble fractions (S3 and LS2). In contrast to MacMARCKS, MARCKS was not detected in the synaptic vesicle (CPG3) fraction (Fig. 5). We have shown that the PKC substrate, MacMARCKS, is present in the distal neuronal processes of PC12 cells, in rat brain synaptosomes, and on small vesicles and synaptic vesicles isolated from rat brain. The protein is phosphorylated when PC12 cells or rat brain synaptosomes are stimulated with phorbol ester or depolarized with elevated levels of KCl. Depolarization-induced phosphorylation of MacMARCKS is dependent upon external Ca2+. MacMARCKS is phosphorylated by PKC in vivo, since phosphopeptide maps generated from the protein phosphorylated in PC12 cells are identical to those generated from recombinant MacMARCKS phosphorylated in vitro by purified PKC. The phosphopeptides correspond to the underlined amino acids (KKKKFS[1]FKKPFKLSGLS[2]FKR), and are found within the effector domain of MacMARCKS, where both serines [1] and [2] are phosphorylated by PKC(3Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that PKC has a role in neurosecretion (25Dekker L.V. Graan P.N.E. Gispen W.H. Prog. Brain Res. 1991; 89: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). First, most conventional isozymes of PKC are expressed at high levels in neurons and are present in synaptic termini(25Dekker L.V. Graan P.N.E. Gispen W.H. Prog. Brain Res. 1991; 89: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Kaczmarek L.K. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Second, phorbol esters promote the release of neurotransmitters, although the release is not restricted to a specific transmitter (28Shapira R. Silberberg S.D. Ginsburg S. Rahamimoff R. Nature. 1987; 325: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Zurgil N. Zisapel N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Nichols R.A. Haycock J.W.

Brain Res. 1987; 403: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This effect is stereospecific; only phorbol esters that activate PKC induce neurotransmitter release(32Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Third, PKC inhibitors prevent KCl-induced neurotransmitter release(25Dekker L.V. Graan P.N.E. Gispen W.H. Prog. Brain Res. 1991; 89: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although these data should be interpreted with caution because of poor specificity of the inhibitors. Fourth, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, which activate PKC, are elevated in active presynaptic termini(33Pozzan T. Gatti G. Dozio N. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although there is much evidence that PKC is involved in neurotransmitter release, the mechanism by which PKC exerts this effect is unknown. Most recent investigations of the role of PKC in neurosecretion have concentrated on two PKC substrates found in nerve termini, MARCKS(8Wu W.S. Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5249-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34Ouimet C.C. Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.I. Albert K.A. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1683-1698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neuromodulin (also known as GAP-43 or B-50)(35Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Oestreicher A.B. Versteeg D.H.G. Gispen W.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. De Wit M. Hens J.J.H. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1645-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The current study implicates a third PKC substrate, MacMARCKS. MARCKS and MacMARCKS are related proteins that share a number of features. Both are elongated, rod-shaped molecules with a similar domain structure. They have a myristoylated N terminus, a highly conserved MH2 domain, and a basic effector domain that contains the PKC phosphorylation sites and which binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner(3Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). MARCKS binds and cross-links actin in a phosphorylation-regulated manner(37Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and preliminary data suggest that the effector domain of MacMARCKS also binds actin. 3A. Aderem, unpublished observation. The function of MacMARCKS in the presynaptic terminal is not yet clear, but it is likely to be involved with the rearrangement of actin during neurosecretion and/or membrane retrieval. By analogy with the synapsins (38Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), it may have a role in reversibly tethering synaptic vesicles to actin filaments. Alternatively, MacMARCKS might regulate actin structure at the presynaptic terminal, thereby affecting access of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane. A possible role for MacMARCKS in membrane retrieval at the presynaptic junction is supported by its behavior in macrophages, where it is known to associate with phagosomes and endosomes.2 PKC-dependent phosphorylation prevents calmodulin binding to MacMARCKS(3Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol.

A. 1982; 79: 5249-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 41Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that both neuromodulin and MARCKS act as regulated calmodulin stores(39Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that MacMARCKS has a similar function. This is an attractive hypothesis since PKC-dependent phosphorylation has been shown to mobilize calmodulin, an event that activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinases implicated in neurosecretion(42MacNicol M. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12197-12201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, neuromodulin (GAP-43) would be more suitable as a Ca2+ sink than MARCKS or MacMARCKS, since it binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-independent manner (43Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 527-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Since MARCKS, MacMARCKS, and the calmodulin-dependent protein-kinases would compete for calmodulin as the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ increases, calmodulin availability and hence Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity could be regulated subtly by the phosphorylation of MARCKS and MacMARCKS.

https://openalex.org/W2076773887,"Abstract The three-dimensional structure of human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) complexed with the sulfonamide fluorophore 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (dansylamide) has been determined to 2.1-A resolution by x-ray crystallographic methods. Unlike other arylsulfonamide inhibitors of CAII, the naphthyl ring of dansylamide binds in a hydrophobic pocket in the active site, making van der Waals contacts with Val-121, Phe-131, Val-143, Leu-198, and Trp-209. Interestingly, a conformational change of Leu-198 is required to accommodate dansylamide binding, which rationalizes the enhanced dansylamide affinity measured for certain Leu-198 variants (Nair, S. K., Krebs, J. F., Christianson, D. W., and Fierke, C. A. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 3981–3989). Modeling studies indicate that a second binding mode, in which the fused aromatic ring is rotated out of the hydrophobic pocket, is sterically feasible. Both experimentally observed and modeled binding modes have implications for new leads in the design of avid CAII inhibitors. Finally, the structure of the CAII-dansylamide complex has implications for its exploitation in zinc biosensor applications, and possible routes toward the optimization of fluorophore design are considered on the basis on this structure."

https://openalex.org/W2055012664,"It was shown that Cys-168 is required for RNase T function and thermostability and that its hydrophobic properties are important for this role (Li, Z., Zhan, L., and Deutscher, M. P.(1996) J. Biol Chem. 271, 1127-1132). To understand the molecular basis for these findings, further studies of Cys-168 and RNase T structure were carried out. Treatment of RNase T with the sulfhydryl-modifying agent 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) leads not only to inactivation, but also to monomerization of the protein. Similarly, specifically converting Cys-168 to either serine or asparagine leads to loss of activity and to monomer formation at 37°C. However, at 10°C the serine mutant remains as a dimer and retains full RNase T activity, whereas the asparagine derivative shows only a low level of activity and of dimer formation. These data show a strong correlation between activity and the dimer form of RNase T. The importance of dimer formation was also shown in vivo using genetic studies. An inactive mutant of RNase T, termed HA2, which exists as a dimer at 37°C in vitro, completely suppresses endogenous RNase T activity in vivo and in vitro when introduced into a RNase T+ cell on a multicopy phagemid, most likely as a consequence of inactive heterodimer formation. Introduction of the HA2 gene on a single-copy plasmid, as expected, leads to a proportionally smaller effect on endogenous activity. The dominant negative effect displayed by the HA2 protein can be relieved by an additional mutation in HA2 RNase T that abolishes its ability to dimerize. An inactive mutant asparagine derivative of Cys-168, which also does not dimerize, also shows little of the dominant negative phenotype. Thus, these data demonstrate that RNase T dimerizes in vivo, that the dimer form is required for RNase T activity, and that Cys-168 is needed for dimerization of the enzyme.

Interestingly, Cys-168 does not appear to participate directly in substrate binding or catalysis. Rather, this residue contributes a hydrophobic group that is important for RNase T structure, affecting the protein's thermostability and ultimately its activity. In this study, we examine the structural role of Cys-168 in more detail. Our data demonstrate that treatments which modify or alter this residue convert RNase T to an inactive monomer, and that restoration of activity is related to dimer formation. Moreover, inactive RNase T can display a dominant negative effect in vivo, but only if the mutant protein is capable of dimerizing. These findings indicate that Cys-168 is involved in the dimerization of the RNase T subunits and that dimer formation is required for RNase T activity. The bacterial strains, plasmid, and phages used are as described here and in a companion study(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Likewise, the reagents used in the experiments reported here have been described (4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Assays for RNase T activity, protein quantitation, immunoblotting, recombinant DNA procedures, and DNA sequencing were all carried out as previously described(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the rnt gene present in a phagemid was carried out by a modification of the procedure previously described for naked DNA(5Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics: A Manual for Genetic Engineering. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar). The single-stranded phagemid pBS(+) carrying the wild type rnt gene was produced by infecting strain CA244 harboring the phagemid with the helper phage R408. Phagemid particles (1 × 109 colony-forming units in 0.7 ml of 2 × YT medium) were mixed with 0.4 ml of 0.5 M KPO4 (pH 6.0), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.8 ml of 7% NH2OH-HCl in 0.45 M NaOH. The mixture was incubated for up to 150 min at room temperature, and the treatment was stopped by dilution at 1:100 into yeast extract, tryptone medium. The mutagenized phagemid preparation was introduced into strain CA244 CCA− by mixing with an equal volume of culture containing cells in excess and incubating for 20 min at 37°C. Infected cells were spread on YT medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and resistant colonies were screened for RNase T activity by assay. The rnt gene from identified RNase T− mutants were then recloned into untreated vectors to eliminate any possible effects of mutated vectors. Cells were grown in YT medium to an A550≈ 1, and S100 extracts were prepared as previously described(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Columns of Ultrogel AcA44 were equilibrated with buffer A (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 M KCl, 10% glycerol) at the indicated temperature. The S100 extracts were adjusted to 1 M KCl prior to addition to the column. Fractions were collected, and the elution position of RNase T was determined by a dot-blot assay using RNase T antibody coupled with a peroxidase-labeled second antibody(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Treatment of RNase T with DTNB 1The abbreviations used are: DTNB5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results in covalent modification of all the cysteine residues in the protein and complete loss of RNase T activity(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this modification affects the structure of RNase T, S100 extracts from a strain overexpressing the enzyme were subjected to gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA44, and the location of RNase T was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Untreated RNase T protein elutes as a symmetrical peak at a position corresponding to a globular protein with a size of approximately 50 kDa, in agreement with that previously determined for the dimeric form of the enzyme(6Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, DTNB-treated RNase T elutes as two peaks; the major one elutes later than dimeric RNase T, indicating that it is of smaller size. SDS-PAGE of the RNase T in this peak, followed by immunoblotting, showed that it is not degraded (Fig. 2). This, coupled with its elution position upon gel filtration, demonstrates that DTNB treatment converts a major portion of RNase T to the free monomer. Thus, the Cys residues of RNase T are involved in some manner in dimerization of the protein.Figure 2:Immunoblotting of RNase T from cell extracts and gel filtration. Cell S100 extracts (5 μg, except HA2, 10 μg, and Ha2-1, 20 μg) or gel filtration peaks containing an equivalent amount of RNase T were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred, and detected by RNase T antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified RNase T was run as the standard to determine the size of the RNase T+ bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The second RNase T peak generated by DTNB modification actually is slightly larger than the dimeric form of the enzyme (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the material in this peak indicated that the RNase T polypeptide present also is of normal size (Fig. 2). However, SDS-PAGE run under nonreducing conditions revealed that RNase T is also present in several bands of various sizes that are larger than the dimeric form of the enzyme (data not shown). We suspect that these represent cross-linked products between RNase T and other proteins that form by disulfide interchange with the DTNB-modified protein. In our companion study(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we showed that the RNase T proteins resulting from mutations at position 168 displayed increased temperature sensitivity. To determine whether this effect also might be due to the dimerization state of RNase T, we have examined several of the RNase T mutant proteins by gel filtration run at different temperatures. The three mutants studied bear either a serine, an asparagine, or a valine substitution at position 168. The C168S mutant retains ≈5% of RNase T activity under standard assay conditions, and it rapidly loses this residual activity upon incubation at 37°C. The C168N mutant is essentially inactive under standard assay conditions(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The valine mutant is fully active, but it is somewhat more temperature-sensitive than the wild type enzyme(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As noted above (Fig. 1), wild type RNase T elutes at the dimer position at 37°C, and as shown in Fig. 3A, it elutes at the identical position at 10°C. In contrast, the C168S mutant protein elutes at the monomer position at 37°C, but it elutes at the dimer position at 10°C (Fig. 3B). At 20°C the protein elutes in between the monomer and dimer position, undoubtedly reflecting an equilibrium between the two forms of the protein (Fig. 3B). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the 37°C peak fraction indicated that the RNase T polypeptide is of normal size (Fig. 2). The RNase T activity of the C168S mutant protein correlates very well with its dimerization state. At 10°C, when the mutant protein is a dimer, nuclease activity in a S100 extract is >90% that of the wild type; this decreases to ≈75% at 20°C and, as already noted, to <10% at 37°C, when the protein is a monomer. Study of the C168N mutant protein leads to the same conclusion, i.e. dimerization is required for activity. Gel filtration at 37°C, at which the enzyme is inactive, shows only the monomer form (Fig. 3C). Even at 10°C, the C168N mutant elutes primarily between monomer and dimer, with at most a small shoulder extending into the dimer position. For this mutant protein, RNase T activity at 10°C is at most ≈25% of wild type. Thus, the C168N mutant, which contains a more hydrophilic substitution at position 168, and is less active at each temperature, also is more temperature-sensitive for dimerization. The valine mutant protein, on the other hand, runs on gel filtration as the dimer form at 10, 20, and 37°C (data not shown). These data support the conclusions that the Cys residue at position 168 participates in dimer formation, that the hydrophobicity of the residue at this position is important, and that RNase T activity depends on the dimer form of the enzyme. To determine whether RNase T dimerizes in vivo and whether both subunits need to be active for RNase T to function, we have examined whether a plasmid-borne rnt mutant gene would exert a dominant negative effect on wild type RNase T expressed from the chromosome. To do this, an inactive RNase T mutant was constructed by random mutagenesis of a rnt gene cloned in the phagemid pBS(+). The details of the method are described under “Experimental Procedures,” but it should be noted that the single-stranded phagemid DNA present in the phage particle provides a useful starting material for in vitro mutagenesis, and can be conveniently and efficiently introduced into F+ cells by infection. This represents a major improvement over current methods which use isolated DNA and cell transformation. Screening of RNase T− clones was carried out in CCA− cells that lack the enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, as described in our companion study(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a CCA− background, lowered RNase T activity leads to faster growth. Thus, after phagemid infection, the largest colonies were assayed for RNase T activity in vitro. By this method, one mutant, termed HA2, with very low RNase T activity, was selected. Based on DNA sequencing (data not shown), the HA2 rnt gene contains two mutations that would lead to Arg-15 → His and Gly-28 → Arg in RNase T. The HA2 protein is normal with regard to its amount and size (see Fig. 2; as noted in the legend, twice as much HA2 protein was loaded), and it exists as a dimer at 37°C (Fig. 4). However, the HA2 protein is essentially devoid of RNase T activity. In a RNase T− cell, the HA2 gene in the multicopy vector pBS(+), results in a level of RNase T activity equivalent to only 13% of that present in a RNase T+ cell containing the single chromosomal copy of rnt (Table 1); no RNase T activity is detectable when the HA2 gene is introduced into a RNase T− cell on the single copy plasmid pOU61 (Table 1). Thus, the HA2 gene results in a RNase T with considerably < 1% of wild type activity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Of most interest, however, is that the presence of this HA2 protein exerts a dominant negative effect on the endogenous RNase T activity present in the RNase T+ cell (Table 1). Thus, when HA2 is present on pBS(+), it completely suppresses the activity arising from the chromosomal rnt+ gene (Table 1), and all that is seen is the 13% activity due to the HA2 protein. Likewise, when HA2 is present on pOU61, it decreases RNase T activity over 70%. These findings strongly suggest that the HA2 protein must form a heterodimer with the wild type RNase T monomer resulting in an inactive protein. Indeed, the level of RNase T activity remaining (28%) when HA2 is introduced into the RNase T + cell via pOU61, is just what would be expected for the amount of wild type dimer that should be formed (33%) upon random association of monomers, considering that pOU61 is present at ≈2 copies/cell(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The dominant negative effect of the HA2 protein can also be examined in vivo by determining how it influences the growth rate of a CCA− T+ cell. It has already been noted that the growth of CCA− cells is exquisitely sensitive to the level of RNase T activity present(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Table 2, introduction of the HA2 gene into a CCA− T− cell has little effect on growth, whether present on pBS(+) or pOU61. However, introduction of HA2 into the CCA− T+ cell leads to much faster growth, and the effect is greater when HA2 is present on the multicopy plasmid. These data show that in vivo the presence of the HA2 protein greatly suppresses RNase T activity, in agreement with the in vitro measurements.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To further demonstrate that the dominant negative phenotype exhibited by the HA2 protein is due to its association with wild type RNase T monomers and the formation of inactive heterodimers, the HA2 rnt gene was subjected to further mutagenesis followed by screening in CCA− T+ cells for slow growing colonies and assaying for increased RNase T activity. One mutant, HA2-1, was selected based on these criteria. The HA2-1 protein contains a Gly-206 → Ser change in addition to the two changes already present in HA2. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the protein is of normal size; however, it is present at only ≈25% of the wild type amount. HA2-1 displays no RNase T activity on its own (Table 1) and runs primarily as the monomer upon gel filtration at 37°C (Fig. 4). As shown in Table 1, the HA2-1 protein shows much less of the dominant negative effect exhibited by HA2 when present in pBS(+), decreasing RNase T activity only 30%. Likewise, HA2-1 has much less effect on the growth of CCA− T+ cells than HA2 (Table 2). These data show that elimination of the dimerization capabilities of HA2 also greatly relieves its dominant negative phenotype, supporting the conclusion that the effects of HA2 are dependent on its ability to dimerize with wild type RNase T monomers. The effect of Cys-168 on dimer formation was also examined by the dominant negative assay. Thus, the C168N mutant, which has low activity in vivo and in vitro (4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was tested for its ability to affect RNase T activity in a T+ host. As shown in Table 1, the C168N gene, even when introduced on the multicopy pBS(+) plasmid, has only a small effect (≈30% decrease) on the endogenous RNase T activity, indicating relatively poor interaction of this protein with wild type monomers. This is as expected considering the inability of this mutant protein to dimerize even at low temperature (Fig. 3). The poor dominant negative effect of C168N was also seen in vivo. The low RNase T activity due to C168N, when present on the multicopy plasmid pBS(+), has a significant effect on growth of CCA−T− cells (Table 2). However, its effect on CCA−T+ cells is even greater, rendering the cells inviable, and indicating that the endogenous RNase T activity must be functional. These data confirm that the C168N protein shows little dominant negative effect on the endogenous RNase T, in agreement with the in vitro activity measurements presented in Table 1. Thus, these data show, also by the dominant negative assay, that Cys-168 is necessary for dimer formation. The data presented in this study relate the dimerization state of RNase T protein, RNase T activity, RNase T thermostability, and the Cys residue at position 168. RNase T normally is isolated as a dimer, and the information presented here indicates that it also exists as a dimer in vivo. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the dimer form of RNase T and its catalytic activity. Treatments or alterations which were shown to lead to a loss of RNase T activity(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar), also result in dissociation of RNase T to the monomer form. Thus, DTNB modification or conversion of Cys-168 to hydrophilic residues, each of which causes loss of RNase T activity, also leads to monomerization of the protein. Most convincingly, lowering the temperature to which RNase T is exposed, stabilizes the dimer form to different degrees depending on the mutant, and results in a concomitant retention of catalytic activity. These findings strongly support the conclusion that it is the dimeric RNase T that is the catalytically competent form. This conclusion is strengthened by the data indicating that the dimer is present in vivo. Many RNase T− mutants when present on the multicopy phagemid pBS(+) lead to faster growth when introduced into CCA− T+ cells, implying a reduction in the endogenous RNase T activity by the excess of inactive enzyme (data not shown). With one mutant, HA2, endogenous RNase T activity can be completely suppressed, and the degree of suppression depends on the amount of mutant RNase T made. These data are most consistent with the formation of heterodimers between wild type monomers and the excess of mutant monomers present. Moreover, when the ability of the mutant to dimerize is lost, such as with the HA2-1 mutant, its dominant negative effect also is greatly decreased. These data, which agree completely with the in vitro gel filtration results, indicate that dimers form in vivo as well. What is the role of Cys-168 in the dimerization process? Clearly, this residue is important because its modification by DTNB or its alteration by mutagenesis can result in monomerization. On the other hand, other hydrophobic residues, such as Val or Ala, also retain more or less activity, and presumably can maintain the dimeric state. Yet, based on the temperature sensitivity of their RNase T activity(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar), these alternate residues at position 168 lead to somewhat less stable dimers. Perhaps, a Cys residue at this position can lead to transient disulfide formation with the corresponding Cys on the other monomer which can help to stabilize the dimer. Analysis of the RNase T sequence by the methods of Chou and Fasman (7Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar) and Garnier et al. (8Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3411) Google Scholar) suggest that Cys-168 is located near the end of a region (residues 151-168) rich in hydrophobic moieties. Helical wheel analysis shows that Cys-168 is part of a hydrophobic helical face that conceivably could function as a dimerization domain (Fig. 5). Additional mutations in this region might be useful for addressing this question. Interestingly, another mutation, Gly 206 → Ser, which is present in HA2-1, also affects dimer formation in the background of the other HA2 changes. Whether residue 206 is close in the three-dimensional structure to the hydrophobic region encompassing Cys-168 remains to be determined. The studies presented here raise some interesting points regarding the active site of RNase T. The dominant negative phenotype exhibited by certain of the mutants suggest that both subunits must be active in order to generate a functional RNase T and that RNase T monomers are not active. One possibility to explain these observations is that both subunits contribute to a single binding site for tRNA. In support of this suggestion is the finding presented in our companion study (4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that tRNA stabilizes the C168S mutant against temperature inactivation. Since the serine mutant monomerizes at 37°C (Fig. 3), and the dimer is needed for RNase T activity, this observation suggests that tRNA maintains the enzyme in the dimer form. This would also explain the binding of tRNA to the C168S mutant at 37°C determined by fluorescence quenching, shown in our companion study(4Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, in a situation in which the monomer and dimer forms of RNase T are in equilibrium, binding of tRNA only to the dimer form would drive the protein in that direction. This conclusion also predicts that the monomer would bind tRNA weakly, or not at all. In fact, the C168N mutant, which is largely monomeric even at low temperatures (Fig. 3), binds relatively poorly to Affi-Gel blue. 2Z. Li, L. Zhan, and M. P. Deutscher, unpublished observation. Affi-Gel blue is known to strongly bind tRNA binding proteins(9Deutscher M.P. Masiakowski P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 1949-1956Google Scholar). The fact that the C168N mutant, which is a monomer, binds to this matrix considerably more weakly than either the wild type or C168S mutant protein, is consistent with poor nucleic acid binding by the monomer. On the other hand, because the HA2 mutant is inactive, but still dimerizes, a functional active site is not simply generated by dimerization. It is possible, but less likely, that each subunit contains its own tRNA binding site, and that correct interaction between the two subunits is necessary to render these sites active. Clearly, further structural work on this important RNA processing enzyme will be necessary to resolve these points."

PCNA was first described by Miyachi et al. (1978) as a nuclear antigen restricted to proliferating cells that reacts with sera from some patients with the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus, hence the name proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

It is required for both DNA replication and DNA repair (Shivji et al., 1992). The gene for PCNA has been highly conserved throughout the course of evolution (Mathews, 1989). The ability of PCNA-specific antibodies to inhibit inducible DNA synthesis in isolated nuclei (Wong et al., 1987), and of PCNA antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit proliferation of Balb/c 3T3 cells (Jaskulski et al., 1988), supports the importance of this protein in cell cycle progression. However, to date all of the cellular functions of PCNA during the cell cycle have not been elucidated. In addition to its role as a processivity factor in DNA replication, PCNA may function in the regulation of cell cycle progression (McAlear et al., 1994; Xiong et al., 1993). Recently, PCNA has been found in complexes with a variety of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and p21, one of the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, also known as Waf1 or Cip1 (Xiong et al., 1992; Waga et al., 1994). Also p21 controls DNA replication by direct interaction with PCNA (Waga et al., 1994; Flores-Rozas et al., 1994). Therefore it is important to understand the regulation of PCNA expression and the function(s) of PCNA within the cell cycle. proliferating cell nuclear antigen concanavalin A cAMP response element dihydrofolate reductase electrophoretic mobility shift assay interleukin 2 initiator element nucleotide. Previous studies have shown transcriptional regulation of PCNA (Morris and Mathews, 1990; Shipman-Appasamy et al., 1990). The promoter region and the introns of the PCNA gene are involved in the transcriptional regulation of PCNA (Alder et al., 1992; Huang et al., 1994). Post-transcriptional regulation also seems to play a role in its regulation. During growth factor stimulation of lymphocytes or 3T3 cells, there is an increase in PCNA mRNA stability (Chang et al., 1990; Shipman-Appasamy et al., 1990; Baserga, 1991). Increased PCNA transcription has been demonstrated in IL-2-stimulated T cells (Shipman-Appasamy et al., 1990), but it could not be found in serum-stimulated 3T3 cells (Baserga, 1991). This suggests that lymphocytes and fibroblasts use different mechanisms for regulating levels of PCNA mRNA. We have shown transcriptional regulation of PCNA during IL-2 induced proliferation of T lymphocytes. Tandem CRE binding sites in the murine PCNA promoter are required for optimal promoter activity and the IL-2-induced PCNA transcriptional activation (Huang et al., 1994; Orten et al., 1994; Feuerstein et al., 1995). Morris and Matthews(1991) have shown that the corresponding CRE-binding site in the human PCNA gene is required for adenovirus E1A-driven transactivation. Proteins and enzymes involved in DNA synthesis are coordinately regulated with growth in mammalian cells: they are induced in late G1 to early S phase of the cell cycle. These include PCNA, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, and DNA polymerase α among others (Hofbauer and Denhardt, 1991). The molecular basis of this regulation has yet to be established. Promoter sequences known for some of these genes differ markedly. Recent studies of these promoters have shown that the binding site for transcription factor E2F is important for DHFR and thymidine kinase expression (Blake and Azizkhan, 1989; Dou et al., 1994). Similar motifs are known to be present in the promoter of other DNA synthesis genes, namely, those of DNA polymerase α and possibly thymidine synthase (Pearson et al., 1991). The presence of an E2F binding site in promoters of several genes encoding DNA synthesis proteins suggests that growth regulation of these proteins may take place by a common mechanism (Nevins, 1992). This is similar to the regulation of the DNA synthesis genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which a regulatory element, identical in sequence with the recognition site for restriction enzyme MluI (ACGCGT), plays a central role (Lowndes et al., 1991). One hypothesis for the mechanism of coordinate regulation of DNA synthesis genes in mammalian cells is that the transcription factor E2F plays a central role in activating DNA synthesis genes during growth stimulation (Nevins, 1992). E2F represents a group of related transcription factors with similar DNA-binding specificity that interacts with pRB-related pocket proteins (La Thangue, 1994). Sequence comparison indicates that an E2F-like binding site is present between +10 and +17 of the murine PCNA promoter. In addition to the tandem CRE binding site, our previous results suggested that the proximal PCNA promoter containing the E2F-like site is critical for IL-2-induced transcriptional activation (Huang et al., 1994). Thus, we analyzed the requirement of this E2F-like site for optimal promoter activity and for protein-DNA interactions in the PCNA promoter proximal region and demonstrate a functional role for the E2F-like site in PCNA transcriptional regulation. A 1.8-kilobase PCNA genomic sequence was isolated previously from a Balb/c liver genomic library and subcloned into the pBluescript vector (Shipman-Appasamy et al., 1990). The pPCNA5-LUC plasmids were constructed by inserting polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA fragments containing the PCNA promoter (−182 to +143) into a HindIII site of the promoterless pSVOA vector (De Wet et al., 1987; Huang et al., 1994). The cloned murine T helper cell line, L2, was maintained as described previously (Prystowsky, 1989; Huang et al., 1994). Eight days following exposure to irradiated allogenic spleen cells and 10-20 units/ml IL-2, L2 cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. At this time, the cells are in a G1-resting state (Sabath et al., 1986). To insure that the cells were in a resting state, L2 cells were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with additives without IL-2. After 24 h, 1.0 × 107 L2 cells in 10 ml of medium were stimulated with 100-150 units/ml of IL-2. Human recombinant IL-2 was a gift of Chiron (Emeryville, CA) (Rosenberg et al., 1984). This substance was 98% pure and contained 0.01 ng of endotoxin/3.6 × 106 units of IL-2; specific activity was evaluated by the manufacturer. Freshly prepared splenocytes were from CBA/J mice, separated from erythrocytes using density gradient centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque (1.090 g/ml). Splenocytes at a concentration of 6 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with additives containing 500 ng/ml ConA were incubated for 72 h prior to extraction of proteins. PCNA-LUC constructs were transfected transiently into L2 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (Ausubel et al., 1992). To increase the transfection efficiency, L2 cells were stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-2 for 20 h prior to transfection. Then L2 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (Huang et al., 1994). Briefly, resting cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline twice, pelleted, and resuspended in 600 μl of a solution containing equal parts of DNA and DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and incubated at 37°C with 150 units/ml IL-2 until harvesting at 53 h post-transfection, which was optimal for IL-2-induced luciferase expression in L2 cells. Cells were harvested, washed with Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by freeze-thawing. Luciferase activity was assayed as described previously using a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer and expressed in relative light units (Ausubel et al., 1992). Quantitation of transfected luciferase DNA by slot blotting was used to correct for variation in transfection efficiency (Maniatis et al., 1982). Cellular extracts were prepared from induced and non-induced cells as described previously (Dignam et al., 1983; Shreiber et al., 1989). 0.5-1 × 106 cells were collected, washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended and washed in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline. Then the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by gentle pipetting. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 25 μl of a 10% solution of Nonidet P-40 was added and the tube was vigorously vortexed for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and the tube was vigorously rocked at 4°C for 15 min on a shaking platform. The nuclear extract was centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed at 4°C and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots at −70°C. Protein concentration was quantitated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (Garner et al., 1981). Briefly, 5,000-15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 1) and 3-5 μg of cell extract were mixed at room temperature for 15 min in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Either poly(dI-dC) or salmon sperm DNA was used as nonspecific competitor DNA. The binding complexes were separated by 4.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) at 4°C in buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA at 25 mA. Gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Competition experiments were performed as described previously (Huang et al., 1994). Sequence of oligonucleotides (sense strand) used for EMSA are listed below with numbers indicating the positions of start and end bases of the oligonucleotides within the PCNA promoter.

Site-specific mutagenesis at PCNA E2F-like site was accomplished as described (Prelich, 1993) using a two-step polymerase chain reaction method. This method produced a fragment (nt −182 to +143) of the PCNA promoter (pPCNA5) with the desired mutations. HindIII sites flanked this fragment, allowing cloning into the pSVOA vector. The DNA sequence of all mutated PCNA promoters was determined to insure that the desired product was prepared and to confirm that the subcloned DNA fragment is in the correct orientation in the vector. The methylation interference assay was performed essentially as described previously (Huang et al., 1994). Partially methylated PCNA ST probes were 32P-labeled at 5′-ends and incubated with L2 cell nuclear extract and poly(dI-dC). After gel electrophoresis, free DNA and protein bound DNA were cut and electrophoretically transferred to a DEAE membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and eluted according to the supplier's protocol. After cleavage with piperidine, the various DNA fractions were analyzed by urea-PAGE (15%) electrophoresis and autoradiography (Ausubel et al., 1992). Maxam and Gilbert DNA sequencing reactions were performed as described previously (Ausubel et al., 1992) and G, G + A, T + C, and C reactions were carried using a commercial Maxam and Gilbert DNA sequencing kit (Du Pont, Westwood, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedures for UV cross-linking were essentially as described by Chodosh et al. (1986). PCNA ST was labeled with both [α-32P]dCTP and bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (Sigma). The binding reactions were scaled up 5-fold and 90 μg of nuclear extracts were used for each reaction. Initial studies showed maximal binding by 30 min. The reactions were irradiated, the products were mixed with SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer, and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of the photoaffinity labeling reaction was established by including 500 μg of either a nonspecific oligonucleotide or PCNA ST. Only the latter oligonucleotide should eliminate specific labeling of PCNA-specific binding. We used an oligonucleotide containing a CCAAT box motif derived from the PCNA promoter (−99 to −70) as a nonspecific competitor (5′-CCACGGGTACGATTGGTCCTTGAGGAGAGG-3′). Sequence analysis of the region around the PCNA transcription start site (+1) suggests the presence of putative transcription factor binding sites, including a PEA3 site (5′-AGGAAGC-3′) between −14 and −8, a sequence sharing homology with the TdT (Smale and Baltimore, 1989) initiator element (Inr) around +1 (CATT), and an E2F-like site (5′-TTGCGGGC-3′) between +10 and +17 (Fig. 1). To determine the complexity of the protein(s) interacting with these sequences, a 36-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide (ST) spanning all three sites (PCNA −14 to +22) was radiolabeled and used in an EMSA (Fig. 1). A series of DNA-protein binding complexes were formed when this probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from the cloned T lymphocyte L2 and mouse splenocytes (Fig. 2). Notably, IL-2 and ConA induce the formation of several complexes with ST in stimulated L2 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) and in splenocytes (Fig. 2A), respectively. In contrast to PCNA ST, when the same extracts from L2 cells were used with a probe containing a USF binding motif (Gregor et al., 1990; Huang et al., 1994), USF binding activity did not change significantly during IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). The binding pattern of these induced complexes is very similar in IL-2 stimulated L2 cells and ConA-stimulated splenocytes (Fig. 2A). Initial competition experiments using unlabeled ST as well as a non-related oligonucleotide as competitors of complex formation indicated that complexes I, II, and III are specific for PCNA ST (data not shown). Among them, complex I and II were consistently present in all nuclear extracts we prepared but complex III binding activity varied with different nuclear extract preparations. In addition, three fast migrating bands (Fig. 2B) are not detected reproducibly in other experiments. To determine where the various IL-2-inducible nuclear proteins bind to the PCNA promoter, a series of short oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) each containing only one of the three putative protein binding sites was made: ST-1 (PEA3), ST-2 (Inr), and ST-3 (E2F). Complex formation with radiolabeled ST-1, ST-2, ST-3, and ST were compared by EMSA using a 24-h IL-2-stimulated L2 cell nuclear extract (Fig. 3). Results in Fig. 3A demonstrated that only ST-3 retains the ability to form all three complexes (complexs I, II, and III). The fast migrating band present in this analysis was not found reproducibly in other experiments. To determine whether the putative binding sites are required for complex formation, a series of binding site mutations (see “Materials and Methods”) was made in these oligonucleotides based on previously defined consensus sequences of PEA, Inr, and E2F sites and on mutation studies (Yoo et al., 1991; Smale and Baltimore, 1989; Mudryj et al., 1990). Fig. 3B shows a competition binding experiment in which ST was 32P-labeled and incubated with IL-2-stimulated L2 cell extract. Excess amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the non-mutated or mutated binding site were used as competitors of complex formation. Among them, ST-3 was the most efficient competitor. In contrast, ST-3m1, an oligonucleotide with a mutation in the E2F-like site (see Fig. 3B) failed to inhibit any of the binding activities. This result indicates that the E2F-like site is essential for complex formation. It is interesting that both ST-1 and ST-2 show some dose-dependent inhibition of the binding activities (Fig. 3B). Since there is no obvious common sequence among ST-1, ST-2, and ST-3, this result suggests that the binding protein(s) may have multiple contact sites along the PCNA promoter sequence. It is more striking that ST-2m which has a mutated Inr element failed to inhibit complex formation, suggesting that the protein complexes may also contact the Inr element. To reconcile these data with Fig. 3A where there was no detectable binding to radiolabeled ST-1 and ST-2, we propose that the interaction of the three complexes with sequences from ST-1 and ST-2 (including the Inr element) is of low enough affinity that the interactions can only be inferred in the presence of high concentrations of oligonucleotides used during competition. On the basis of the data presented in Fig. 3, we conclude that the E2F-like site is required for initiating complex formation and the protein complexes may contact other sequences within the PCNA promoter. We noted that a sequence (5′-GGGCGC-3′) between +14 and +19, which overlaps with the E2F-like site, has only one mismatch out of 6 bases when compared to the SP1 consensus sequence (5′-GGGCGG-3′). To determine the contribution of the E2F-like site and the SP1 site to complex formation, one additional E2F-like site mutation ST-3m2 (see “Materials and Methods”), was made. Unlike ST-3m1, ST-3m2 should only interfere with E2F binding but not the binding to the putative SP1 site. Results in Fig. 4A showed that both ST-3m1 and ST-3m2 abolished the formation of all three complexes, suggesting that the overlapping SP1 site is not required for complex formation. In addition to the three bands, some faster migrating bands appear variably in different experiments. A fast migrating band may represent an SP1-binding complex because this complex apparently still forms with the ST-3m2 probe in which the SP-1 site is intact, but not with the ST-3m1 probe. The results of a competition binding experiment are shown in Fig. 4B. Consistent with the results from Fig. 4A, mutations in the E2F-like site, both ST-3m1 and ST-3m2, reduce the inhibition of complex formation with the wild type ST-3 probe. The relative binding affinity for the wild type and mutated E2F-like sequences is: ST-3 >> ST-3m2 > ST-3m1. In addition to complexes I, II, and III, a series of fast migrating complexes could be detected with the radiolabeled ST-3 probe. The two bands immediately below complex II (a1 and a2) and the fastest migrating band (a3) show a competition pattern similar to complex II suggesting that they may also form on the E2F-like site. However, the nature of these binding complexes is not ascertained because of their low abundance and because they are only present in some of our nuclear extract preparations. The relatively abundant fast migrating bands (b and c) were judged to be nonspecific for the E2F-like site, band c might represent an SP-1 related binding factor since band c is competed by ST-3 m2 but only very poorly by ST-3m1. The functional relevance of these binding activities is unknown. To determine the contribution of this E2F-like site to PCNA promoter activity, two PCNA mutants (M-1 and M-2) corresponding to the mutations in ST-3m1 and ST-3m2 were prepared in the context of the pPCNA5-LUC construct (−182 to +143) as described previously (Huang et al., 1994). In these constructs, PCNA genomic sequences were inserted into a HindIII site of a promoterless vector pSVOA. These constructs were transiently transfected into IL-2-stimulated L2 cells by the DEAE-dextran method. Because of the difficulties in transfecting quiescent L2 cells, we stimulated L2 cells with IL-2 for 22 h prior to transfection, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 5 shows that mutations in the E2F-like site (M-1 and M-2) cause partial reduction in PCNA promoter activity. The relative promoter strengths of the wild type promoter and the two promoter mutants are consistent with the results of the relative binding affinity determined by EMSA (Fig. 4C), wt > M-2 > M-1. These data demonstrate that the E2F-like binding activity is required for optimal PCNA promoter activity and transcriptional activation of the PCNA gene in IL-2-stimulated T cells. To determine the exact contact bases of these binding complexes within the PCNA promoter, methylation interference analysis was performed. In this experiment, only the two relatively abundant complexes, I and II, were analyzed (Fig. 6). ST was end-labeled and partially methylated by dimethyl sulfate before being subjected to EMSA. Both the protein-bound and free oligonucleotides were recovered from the gel and treated with piperidine, which specifically cleaves all the methylated guanidine (G) residues. Then the cleavage products were resolved on a sequencing gel. Methylation interference analysis for both of the DNA strands is shown in Fig. 6. Maxam and Gilbert DNA sequencing reactions were performed to confirm the positions of the G-residues in the PCNA promoter sequence. Methylation interference analysis of the shifted bands corresponding to complex I and complex II resulted in identical interference patterns centered at the E2F-like site on both strands. The pattern shows specificity for the E2F-like site on both strands with the top (coding) strand results more clearly overlapping with the E2F-like motif. The top strand contains three G-residues within the E2F site that interfere with E2F binding when methylated. On the bottom strand, one of the two G-residues within the E2F-like site shows methylation interference. The second G residue in the center of the E2F-like motif is very poorly cleaved in the free DNA and, thus, it is impossible to determine whether there is methylation interference at this position. This pattern is consistent with the results obtained from both EMSA and competition experiments (Fig. 4). Notably, the Inr sequence CATT located at −2 to +2 is not protected in the methylation interference analysis suggesting that the nuclear protein is in close contact with DNA at the E2F-like site. Our data show variable and weak methylation interference at the PEA3 site which we believe is inconclusive and requires further experimentation to determine if there is protein binding at this site. Taken together, we conclude that the major binding complexes form at the E2F-like sequence between +10 and +17. To determine whether a member of the transcription factor E2F family binds to the PCNA E2F-like site, nuclear proteins binding to oligonucleotides containing the E2F consensus sequence derived from the hamster DHFR promoter were compared with those binding to the PCNA E2F-like site. We concluded on the basis of these data (Fig. 7) that the E2F family members do not bind to the PCNA E2F-like site because: 1) there is no cross-competition between the PCNA E2F-like site and DHFR-E2F site (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 10). 2) E2F binds to the hamster DHFR-E2F oligonucleotide only in the presence of salmon sperm DNA but not with poly(dI-dC) as carrier DNA (Fig. 7, lanes 7-11). In contrast, complexes binding to PCNA E2F-like sequence only form with poly(dI-dC) but not with salmon sperm DNA as carrier DNA (compare lane 1 and 6). In addition, anti-E2F-1 antibody failed to supershift the complex formed with the PCNA E2F-like site. 2D. Huang and M. B. Prystowsky, unpublished data. These results demonstrate that the proteins that bind to the PCNA E2F-like site are clearly distinct from the E2F family of proteins. To provide additional support for the contention that nuclear proteins binding to the PCNA E2F-like site are distinct from previously characterized E2F family members, the DNA-binding component of this complex was identified biochemically by photoaffinity labeling using a bromodeoxyuridine-substituted radiolabeled probe. Complexes formed between ST probe and IL-2-stimulated L2 cell nuclear extract were resolved in an EMSA and were covalently cross-linked by UV irradiation; subsequently, the cross-linked species were subjected to SDS-polyarylamide gel electrophoresis. Several labeled bands were obtained with different doses of UV irradiation. The specificity of the photoaffinity labeling was determined by adding either nonspecific or specific DNA to the binding reactions. The labeling of the 180-kDa band was not competed with an excess of nonspecific oligonucleotide in the binding reaction (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and 7) but was efficiently competed with a specific competitor: an oligonucleotide bearing PCNA E2F-like site (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 8). The binding specificity of the labeled species of 30- and 43-kDa proteins were not clear. These data demonstrated that a 180-kDa protein binds specifically to PCNA E2F-like site. It is distinct from the known E2F-binding proteins because E2F family members have been characterized to be 40-60 kDa. In mammalian cells, stimulation of quiescent cells by serum or growth factors causes a marked increase in the mRNA levels of PCNA, and other genes coding for proteins of the DNA synthesis machinery, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, DNA polymerase α, and thymidine synthase (Pardee, 1989; Nevins, 1992). The growth factor-responsive expression of the mouse PCNA gene in L2 cells requires elements within a 180-base pair region immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site (Huang et al., 1994). Previously we have shown that tandem cAMP response element binding protein/ATF binding sites located at nucleotides from −37 to −52 in the PCNA promoter are critical for IL-2-induced PCNA promoter activity (Huang et al., 1994). In this report, we identify an E2F-like motif with the sequence 5′-TTGCGGGC-3′ located between +10 and +17 of the murine PCNA promoter that is required for PCNA transcriptional regulation. It is worth noting that in several other genes, including the hamster and murine DHFR promoters, E2F elements are found within a sequence near transcription start sites and are critical for transcriptional regulation (Blake and Azizkhan, 1989; Means et al., 1992). Transcription factor E2F was originally identified as a protein binding to a cis-element needed for the activation of the adenoviral early E2 gene promoter (Kovesdi et al., 1986; Berk, 1986). There are at least six similar but not identical E2F-like sites found in promoters of several cellular genes, with the sequence often being TTTCGCGC or TTTGGCGC (Mudryj et al., 1990; Nevins, 1992). Regulation of E2F activity involves its interactions with multiple cellular proteins including pRB, cyclin A, and cdk2 (Nevins, 1992). The retinoblastoma protein pRB as a tumor suppressor forms a specific complex with E2F providing an important mechanism for pRB regulation of cell growth. E2F-1 cDNA was cloned by virtue of its ability to bind to pRB (Helin et al., 1992). Soon after its cloning, it became apparent that the term E2F represents a family of transcription factors including E2F-1, DP-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4, and E2F-5 (La Thangue, 1994; Lees et al., 1993; Ginsberg et al., 1994; Sardet et al., 1995). Recent studies have shown E2F-1 and DP-1 normally form heterodimers in binding to the E2F site. Therefore, E2F is an expanding group of related transcription factors with similar DNA-binding specificity that appear to function in cell cycle regulation. Although there is sequence similarity between the PCNA promoter +10 to +17 region and the consensus E2F binding site, we concluded that distinct proteins bind to the PCNA E2F-like site based on the following observations: 1) there is no cross-competition between the PCNA E2F-like site and an oligonucleotide containing the E2F consensus sequence from the DHFR promoter (Fig. 7) or the E2F site from the adenoviral E2 promoter (data not shown). 2) The optimal condition for complex formation differs, when used as a nonspecific competitor DNA in the binding reactions, poly(dI-dC) favors complex formation with the PCNA E2F-like site while salmon sperm DNA favors complex formation with the DHFR-E2F site. 3) Results from a UV cross-linking experiment indicate that a protein of 180 kDa binds to the PCNA E2F-like site. In contrast E2F-1 is a 54-kDa nuclear protein previously identified in cross-linking experiments by several groups (Mudryj et al., 1990; Chellappan et al., 1991). The other E2F proteins have molecular mass ranging from 40 to 60 kDa. Therefore, this 180-kDa protein binding to the PCNA E2F-like site is distinct from all known E2F family proteins. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this 180-kDa protein is related to the E2F family of transcription factors. RNA polymerase is known to bind to DNA at the transcription start site to form an initiation complex with general transcription factors such as TFIID. Three forms of RNA polymerase II large subunit have been described, each differing in apparent molecular mass, 180, 210, and 240 kDa (Sawadogo and Sentenac, 1990; Young, 1991). Is it possible that the 180-kDa protein binding next to the initiation site represents RNA polymerase? Our results argue that this protein is not RNA polymerase because: first, methylation interference data indicate that the 180-kDa protein contacts a small region (nt +12 to +19) within or adjacent to the E2F-like site, while previous analyses have revealed that RNA polymerase protects a much larger region of DNA on both sides of the initiation site (Sawadogo and Sentenac, 1990); second, the interaction of the 180-kDa protein with DNA requires the E2F-like site, while RNA polymerase is thought to bind to DNA in a nonspecific manner. A similar situation exists with studies of the DHFR promoter and our findings with the mouse PCNA promoter. E2F proteins have been shown to bind to the E2F site in the murine DHFR promoter between nt −10 and −3 (Slansky et al., 1993) but Means et al. (1992) have shown that HIP1, a 180-kDa protein also binds near this site at −9 to −1. This sequence has been shown to function as the initiator element that controls the start site for murine DHFR transcription (Means and Farnham, 1990). The protein binding to the PCNA E2F-like site that we characterized in this report is similar to HIP1 protein. 1) Both proteins have molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa. 2) Both bind to a sequence at or adjacent to the transcription initiation site. 3) Both proteins contact sequences which share homology to the E2F site. Our data suggest that the 180-kDa protein does not bind to the hamster DHFR E2F site (Fig. 7). We noticed that the murine DHFR E2F motif contains a G as the second base 5′ of the E2F site, in contrast, the hamster E2F motif contains an A at the −2 position. Previously it has been shown that the sequence adjacent to the murine DHFR E2F core sequence is required for complex formation of HIP1 (Means et al., 1992). Therefore a difference of the sequences in the −2 position of the DHFR E2F elements may account for the observation that this 180-kDa protein binds to the PCNA E2F-like site as well as the murine DHFR E2F motif but not to the hamster DHFR E2F motif. Mutations that abolish complex formation on this E2F-like site only reduced PCNA promoter activity moderately, to about 60-80% of the wild type promoter activity. One of the explanations for this is that other cis-elements including the tandem CRE/ATF binding sites in the PCNA promoter also contribute substantially to optimal promoter activity. Further experiments making double or multiple mutations of these cis-elements in the PCNA promoter should help to determine the cooperation between these sites for PCNA promoter activity. The identification of an E2F-like binding site in the PCNA promoter and of nuclear proteins interacting with this E2F-like site in this report provides a basis for further study on the mechanism of PCNA transcriptional regulation and contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms by which IL-2 activates T lymphocyte proliferation.

Raji-cell p36 was shown in Western blots with antipeptide antibodies to be induced at least 400-fold and by immunofluorescence microscopy to co-localize with the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, protein disulfide isomerase. These results show that p36 is a new interferon-α-induced protein that localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the cell region in which the lupus inclusions form, and that p36 is probably physically associated with the lupus inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2075584921,"EVI1 is a zinc finger oncoprotein that binds via fingers 1-7 to the sequence GACAAGATAA. The target genes on which EVI1 acts are unknown. This binding motif overlaps with that for the GATA transcription factors, (T/A)GATA(A/G), and GATA-1 can bind to and activate transcription via a GACAAGATAA motif. The possibility has been raised that, when overexpressed in leukemogenesis, EVI1 may function by interfering with the differentiation-promoting action of GATA factors. To explore this, we have assessed the affinity of EVI1 for the GATA binding sites derived from erythroid-specific GATA-1 target genes, and found only low affinity interactions. We examined the contacts between EVI1 and DNA by methylation interference studies, which revealed extensive contacts between EVI1 and its binding site. The importance of the contacts for high affinity binding was shown by in vitro quantitative gel shift studies and in vivo cotransfection studies. To examine what types of sequences from mouse genomic DNA bind to EVI1, we isolated and sequenced five EVI1-binding fragments, and each showed the GACAAGATA site. The data presented contribute to our knowledge of the binding specificity of EVI1, and yield a clearer picture of what sequences can, and cannot, act as targets for EVI1 action."

https://openalex.org/W1965918735,"Escherichia coli RNase T, which is responsible for the 3' processing and end-turnover of tRNA and the maturation of 5 S RNA, is extremely sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and to oxidation, suggesting a role for cysteine residues in its activity. Titration of homogeneous RNase T with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) revealed that the 4 cysteine residues present in each of the two protein subunits are in a reduced form and that 1 or 2 of them are important for activity. To identify these residue(s), each of the cysteines in RNase T was changed individually to either serine or alanine. The serine mutant at position 168 is greatly reduced in RNase T activity both in vivo and in vitro; likewise, the serine mutant at position 112 and the alanine mutants at positions 112 and 168 also display decreased RNase T activity. Mutations at the other cysteine positions show little or no change. Kinetic analyses of the mutant enzymes showed that the Km values of C168S and C168A are increased considerably, whereas their Vmax values are reduced only slightly compared to the wild type enzyme. The other mutant enzymes are little changed. Additional amino acid replacements at position 168 showed that the in vivo and in vitro activities of RNase T are in the order Cys approximately Val > Ala >> Ser >> Asn approximately Asp, which closely follows the relative hydrophobicity of these amino acid residues. However, the affinity for tRNA, determined by fluorescence quenching, is not altered in C168S, suggesting that Cys-168 is not directly involved in substrate binding. Interestingly, proteins altered at position 168 showed increased temperature sensitivity as the residue at that position became less hydrophobic. These data indicate that Cys-168 contributes a hydrophobic group that influences the structure and ultimately the catalytic activity of RNase T."

https://openalex.org/W1994118625,"The 11.5-kDa zinc-binding protein (ZnBP, parathymosin-α), a potent inactivator of 1-phosphofructokinase, is found only in the cytoplasm of most tissues despite the presence of the putative nuclear localization signal PKRQKT. Recent reports on nuclear uptake of ZnBP could not exclude the participation of unspecific diffusion. We show here that wild-type ZnBP overexpressed in COS cells accumulates exclusively in the nucleus but that ZnBP with a mutated or deleted PKRQKT motif appears both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In contrast, fusion proteins between ZnBP and parts of the endoplasmic reticulum protein calreticulin required the intact PKRQKT motif for nuclear import. The motif RKR, located nine amino acids upstream of the PKRQKT motif, is also involved in the active nuclear import of ZnBP. In contrast to rat hepatocytes and kidney cells in situ, which have ZnBP almost exclusively in the cytosol, we find ZnBP in Reuber H35 hepatoma cells and normal rat kidney cells only in the nuclei. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes translocate their ZnBP to the nucleus in <24 h during standard cell culture conditions.

Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5892-5900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ZnBP is found in the cytoplasm of liver, brain, adrenal gland, smooth muscle, kidney, lung, spleen, and testis, whereas it is only weakly detectable in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue(2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa and in duct cells of the exocrine pancreas, it has preferentially been observed in the nuclei(2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J.

As shown by affinity chromatography, ZnBP is able to bind in a Zn2+-dependent manner not only to 1-phosphofructokinase but also to other glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes, e.g. aldolase, hexokinase/glucokinase, and others (3Brand I.A. Heinickel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20984-20989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1-phosphofructokinase-inactivating property has been located on a tryptic 43-amino acid peptide containing four acidic clusters of glutamic acid and aspartic acid representing two specific and two unspecific zinc binding sites(4Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Kratzin H. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The sequence of this peptide was used to isolate and sequence both a full-length cDNA clone from a rat liver library (5Trompeter H.-I. Brand I.A. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the corresponding genomic DNA(6Trompeter H.-I. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence revealed the identity of ZnBP with rat parathymosin-α (7Komiyama T. Pan L.-X. Haritos A.A. Wideman J.W. Pan Y.E. Chang M. Rogers I. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1242-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and showed the presence of the motif PKRQKT, which resembles the nuclear localization signal (NLS) TKKQKT of prothymosin (8Manrow R.E. Sburlati A.R. Hanover J.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the known “prototype” signal PKKKRKV of SV40 large T-antigen(9Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 367-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The injection of parathymosin-α (ZnBP) and prothymosin into Xenopus oocytes resulted in the accumulation of the injected proteins in the nucleus(10Watts J.D. Cary P.D. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it was not excluded in these experiments, whether the relatively small ZnBP (Mr = 11,471) may have entered the nucleus simply by diffusion through the nuclear pore and thereafter been retained in this compartment. Therefore, it remained an open question whether the sequence PKRQKT could function as a NLS and actively translocate ZnBP into the nucleus. Fusion of human growth hormone lacking the signal sequence to the N termini of prothymosin and parathymosin-α (ZnBP) resulted in HeLa S3 cells in a nuclear localization of both fusion proteins, supporting the idea that prothymosin and ZnBP are imported into the nucleus in an active manner (11Clinton M. Graeve L. El-Dorry H. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6608-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To examine the structure of the putative NLS in ZnBP and its influence on the intracellular localization, we have now overexpressed in COS cells wild-type and point-mutated cDNAs with modified or deleted NLS as well as fusion constructs with a segment of calreticulin (12Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) lacking its ER import sequence. Since the fusion constructs code for a 48-kDa protein, intracellular distribution of the ZnBP fusion protein should no longer be determined by simple diffusion. Using these constructs, we can show that the import of ZnBP into the nucleus requires an active bipartite nuclear targeting sequence. As ZnBP was found in most rat organs (including liver and kidney) to be restricted to the cytosol(2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar), we have also analyzed by immunofluorescence the localization of endogenous ZnBP in NRK and H35 Reuber hepatoma cells and studied the effect of standard cell culture conditions on the distribution of ZnBP in isolated rat hepatocytes. Surprisingly, ZnBP was found almost exclusively in the nucleus not only in the two permanent cell lines, but also in hepatocytes cultured for 12-24 h, indicating a potential role of ZnBP during proliferation or differentiation. All restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes came from Life Technologies, Inc. Taq polymerase was from Cetus Corp., Weiterstadt, Germany. Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene. The expression vector pCMV2 (13Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Gerald Thiel (Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Germany). Rat calreticulin cDNA was a gift of Dr. Birte Sönnichsen (this institute), dihydrofolate reductase-DNA was a gift of Dr. Detlev Doenecke (Institute for Biochemistry I, University of Göttingen, Germany). All mutagenesis reactions were performed using the T7-GEN in vitro mutagenesis kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 936-bp full-length EcoRI cDNA-fragment coding for ZnBP-WT (wild-type) (5Trompeter H.-I. Brand I.A. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was subcloned into M13mp18, and single-stranded DNA was used as a template to hybridize phosphorylated 24-mer mutagenic oligonucleotides. Polymerization/ligation reactions, MspI/HhaI cuts, and exonuclease III digestions were performed according to the supplier's instructions. DNAs were then transformed into competent Escherichia coli SURE cells (Stratagene), mutant plaques were picked, and single-stranded as well as replicative form DNA were prepared. The primary structures of the mutants were verified by sequencing using the Pharmacia T7Sequencing kit. The mutation ZnBP-Δ1 was introduced via two-step PCR. The first amplification was performed to introduce the amino acid exchange, and the second was performed to add a C-terminal antigenic c-myc tag. EcoRI inserts of the replicative form DNA as well as the ZnBP-WT EcoRI fragment were subcloned into expression vector pCMV2 (13Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for transient transfection of COS cells. This vector offers a human cytomegalovirus promoter as well as a SV40 origin of replication. All subcloning and DNA analyzing procedures followed established methods(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Calreticulin-ZnBP fusion genes CR-ZnBP-WT, CR-ZnBP-Stop91, CR-ZnBP-Thr91, and CR-ZnBP-Ser92 were constructed as follows. The 1544-bp EcoRI calreticulin cDNA fragment used in our experiments contains 12 bp of the 5′-nontranslated region, a 51-bp region coding for the ER import sequence (including a BglI site), as well as an acidic cluster and a KDEL coding sequence near the 3′-end. A 1239-bp BglI fragment was used as a template for PCR reactions. Primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381A synthesizer and designed to delete the ER import sequence but to reconstitute the 5′-nontranslated region at the N terminus together with an ATG. The N-terminal primer carried in addition SstI and EcoRI sites at its 5′-end. The C-terminal primer excluded the acidic cluster, and the KDEL sequence of calreticulin and contained a MluI site, allowing in-frame fusion of the calreticulin PCR product to the N terminus of the ZnBP variants. The PCR-generated translated regions of the ZnBP variants contained a 5′-MluI site and a 3′-HindIII site for vector ligation. PCR reactions were performed in a Biomed 60 thermocycler using either 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (calreticulin) or 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (ZnBPs) and 0.75 μM concentrations of each primer. Primers were annealed at 60°C for 1.5 min, polymerization time was 1.5 min (1 s extend/cycle) at 72°C, and denaturation occurred at 92°C for 2 min. 35 cycles were performed in each reaction. Resulting PCR products of 1076 bp (calreticulin) and 324 bp (ZnBPs) in length were analyzed and purified on 0.7-1% agarose gels. DNAs were digested with SstI/MluI (calreticulin) and MluI/HindIII (ZnBPs). ZnBP fragments were subcloned into the SstI/HindIII precut pGEM-4Z vector (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). Recombinant colonies were identified by blue/white color phenotype, and plasmid DNA was restriction analyzed. Plasmid DNA of pGEM-4Z/ZnBP was then linearized with SstI and MluI, and calreticulin PCR fragments were subcloned into the vector-ZnBP constructs, resulting in the complete fusion genes. Fusion gene clones were analyzed by Southern hybridization of various restriction fragments, and EcoRI/HindIII fragments were subcloned into pCMV2. To generate the fusion construct CR-ZnBP-Δ1, the ZnBP fragment of CR-ZnBP-WT was replaced via MluI/HindIII by the two-step PCR product, ZnBP-Δ1, mentioned above. Construction of the dihydrofolate reductase fusion genes was based on three different dihydrofolate reductase PCR products, which all coded for the same part of dihydrofolate reductase (amino acids 2-186). The first contained an EcoRI site at its 5′-end followed by a Kozak sequence(15Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), an ATG, and restriction sites HindIII and MluI for later introduction of ZnBP variants. Its 3′-end contained the motif PKRQKT, a c-myc tag, the stop codon, and a XbaI site. The second PCR product contained the same 5′-structure as the first one, but it possessed only a BglII site (and no stop codon) at its 3′-end used for fusion with the third PCR product, which contained a 5′-BglII site and shared its 3′-end with the first PCR fragment. This first dihydrofolate reductase PCR product was cloned into pCMV2 directly, resulting in vector pD. The other two were subsequently cloned into pGEM4Z and thereby fused by the BglII sites. The resulting EcoRI/XbaI fragment (containing a dimeric dihydrofolate reductase fragment) was subcloned into pCMV2, resulting in vector pDD. The HindIII/MluI sites present in the 5′-region of the dihydrofolate reductase inserts in pD and pDD were used to introduce PCR-generated fragments of ZnBP spanning an N-terminal portion (amino acids 1-34, ZnBP-N) or the central acidic cluster (amino acids 35-72, ZnBP-C). In additional constructs, the entire coding region of ZnBP in its variants ZnBP-WT and ZnBP-Thr91 was subcloned into pD and pDD. All overexpression constructs were sequenced to verify the fidelity of PCR reactions and fusion borders as well; pCMV2 constructs were used for overexpression studies. COS cells as well as H35 Reuber hepatoma cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) including 10% FCS. NRK cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium α (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% FCS (heat-inactivated). Perfusion of rat livers was performed as described by Kleinecke et al. (16Kleinecke J. Düls C. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1979; 107: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fresh hepatocytes were cultivated on collagen-plated coverslips and maintained in medium M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1.5% (w/v) of both penicillin and streptomycin, 10−7M dexamethasone, and 10−9M porcine insulin. Cells were grown at 37°C for 45 min, 4 h, or 24 h. Subsequent immunofluorescence studies of all cell lines were performed as described below. For Northern blot studies, the 936-bp ZnBP cDNA (5Trompeter H.-I. Brand I.A. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was labeled with 32P using the random priming method(17Feinberg A.D. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Total RNA from fresh hepatocytes as well as from hepatocytes cultivated for 4 and 24 h was isolated as described in (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Northern blotting onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (Dupont NEN) and hybridization were performed at 42°C as described in (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridized membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC (5 min), twice in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at 60°C (30 min), and twice in 0.1 × SSC at 20°C (30 min) and exposed to x-ray film for 3-24 h. For Western blotting, transfected cells were analyzed using purified anti-ZnBP. Immunoblots of ZnBP-transfected cells, as well as of rat hepatocyte cell lysates were performed and stained as given in (2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar), fusion protein blotting followed standard procedures(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), with additional renaturation at 42°C in Tris-buffered saline for at least 6 h(2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit ZnBP-antibody p42 (2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar) was affinity-purified on a ZnBP-coupled Sepharose 4B column. DNAs used for transfections were purified on QIAGEN columns (Diagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the supplier's instructions. About 7 × 104 COS cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. COS, NRK, and H35 Reuber hepatoma cells as well as rat hepatocytes were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Double immunofluorescence was performed using affinity-purified rabbit anti-ZnBP (diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% FCS) or monoclonal mouse anti-SV40 large T-antibody (Dianova, 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% FCS) following standard procedures. Goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate and goat anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugate secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch/Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used in 1:200 dilutions in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% FCS. Samples were embedded in Moviol and visualized at emission wavelengths of 519 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and 572 nm (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate), respectively. To visualize ZnBP from rat hepatocytes with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies, endogenous peroxidase of permeabilized hepatocytes was inhibited by incubation of cells with 0.5% H2O2 in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. Incubation with the anti-ZnBP antibody was performed as described above followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1:2000 in Tris-buffered saline, 10% FCS). The staining reaction was performed with 5 ml of 100 mM citrate (pH 6), 100 μl of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Eastman Kodak Co.) solution (12 mg/ml in acetonitrile/H2O (4:1)), and 500 μl 0.3% (w/v) 4-chloro-1-naphtol (in CH3OH and 2 μl 30% H2O2) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by washing in Tris-buffered saline. Three point mutations (ZnBP-Stop91, ZnBP-Ser92, and ZnBP-Thr91) were introduced into the 936-bp cDNA of ZnBP (see Fig. 1). Mutation ZnBP-Stop91 converts the codon AAG for Lys91 in the PK91R92QKT motif into the stop codon TAG, yielding a protein lacking the last 11 amino acids including the putative NLS. ZnBP-Ser92 and ZnBP-Thr91 exchange Ser and Thr for the original Arg92 and Lys91, respectively, thereby expressing the mutated nuclear localization signals PKS92QKT and PT91RQKT. By Western blotting, it was assured that the affinity-purified anti-ZnBP antibody reacted only with the overexpressed wild-type or mutated ZnBPs (Fig. 2, upper panel), but not with endogenous COS cell proteins (Fig. 2, lower panel, lane E). Using this antibody, ZnBP-WT transiently overexpressed in COS cells was found almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). In contrast, protein expressed from ZnBP-Stop91 was observed not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). Expression products from ZnBP-Ser92 and ZnBP-Thr91 revealed the same intracellular distribution as ZnBP-Stop91, i.e. they gave a prominent nuclear staining with additional fluorescence from the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, E and G). A significant difference between the mutants could not be observed. Intracellular localization of SV40 large T-antigen in the same cells was used as control for intact nuclei. These results indicate that the putative NLS (PKRQKT) had influenced the nuclear localization of ZnBP in COS cells, as mutated and deleted forms of this motif were accompanied by an additional cytoplasmic localization.Figure 3:Immunofluorescence of COS cells overexpressing constructs ZnBP-WT (A and B), ZnBP-Stop91 (C and D), ZnBP-Ser92 (E and F), and ZnBP-Thr91 (G and H). Double-immunofluorescence was performed using anti ZnBP antiserum (panels A, C, E, and G) and anti-SV40 large T-antigen antiserum (panels B, D, F, and H). All COS cells display SV40 large T-antigen immunoreactivity in their nuclei. Wild-type ZnBP (A) appears almost exclusively in the nuclei, whereas mutant variants (C, E, and G) are detected also in the cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since a 11.5-kDa protein is able to diffuse passively into the nucleus(19Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we examined the localization of a larger fusion protein containing ZnBP to distinguish between passive diffusion and NLS-dependent active nuclear import. To this end, we overexpressed fusion constructs between a segment of calreticulin (12Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and ZnBP, resulting in a fusion protein of approximately 48 kDa (see Fig. 2, lower panel, and Fig. 4). A 1239-bp BglI fragment of a full-length calreticulin cDNA, which lacks part of the ER import sequence, served as template for PCR. The N-terminal primer was designed to reconstitute the 5′-nontranslated region, possibly important for translation efficiency(15Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), but to delete the complete ER import sequence, thus resembling the N terminus of the mature calreticulin. The C terminus excluded the acidic clusters and the C-terminal ER retention signal KDEL and was fused in frame to PCR products of the translated regions of the various ZnBP-DNAs. Fig. 4 illustrates the structure of these fusion DNAs. The resulting four fusion DNAs (designated CR-ZnBP-WT, CR-ZnBP-Stop91, CR-ZnBP-Ser92, and CR-ZnBP-Thr91) were subcloned into pCMV2 and overexpressed in COS cells as described above. Western blot examination of the fusion proteins revealed that the purified anti-ZnBP antibodies were also able to recognize the fusion proteins, which displayed a molecular mass of about 48 kDa (Fig. 2, lower panel). The results of the overexpression of these constructs in COS cells are shown in Fig. 5. Like ZnBP-WT, the CR-ZnBP-WT expression product was found exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 5A), displaying the same distribution as SV40 large T-antigen (Fig. 5B). In contrast, protein expressed from CR-ZnBP-Stop91 was only detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). A significant number of the CR-ZnBP-Stop91-transfected cells displayed a weak signal over their nuclei, but this resulted only from an overlay of cytoplasm as indicated by laser scan microscopy, which showed that the nuclei were essentially free from immunoreactive antigen (results not shown here). Fusion proteins from CR-ZnBP-Ser92 and CR-ZnBP-Thr91 again showed the same distributions as the CR-ZnBP-Stop91 expression product (Fig. 5, E and G).Figure 5:Immunofluorescence of COS cells overexpressing constructs CR-ZnBP-WT (A and B), CR-ZnBP-Stop91 (C and D), CR-ZnBP-Ser92 (E and F), and CR-ZnBP-Thr91 (G and H). Experiments were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 3. Panels A, C, E, and G show results with anti ZnBP antiserum; panels B, D, F, and H show those with anti-SV40 large T-antigen antiserum. Wild-type fusion products (A) are located in the nuclei, whereas mutant fusion variants (C, E, and G) are restricted to the cytosol, indicating the active role of a NLS of ZnBP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the results described so far strongly support an active, NLS-mediated import of ZnBP into the nucleus, these experiments do not allow any conclusions to be drawn concerning an interaction of ZnBP with nuclear components. Therefore, we constructed two pCMV2-based vectors (pD and pDD), which overexpressed dihydrofolate reductase (pD) and a dimeric form of dihydrofolate reductase (pDD). The first (pD) should still be able to diffuse into the nucleus, whereas the other (pDD) should be excluded from the nucleus due to its larger molecular mass. The structure of these constructs is given in Fig. 6. The motif PKRQKT as well as a c-myc tag were added to the C termini to allow for nuclear import and detection of the expressed proteins. The N-terminal restriction sites HindIII and MluI allowed the in-frame subcloning of any PCR-generated ZnBP fragment into pD and pDD. In addition to the complete ZnBP-DNAs (ZnBP-WT and ZnBP-Thr91, resulting in pD-ZnBP-WT, pDD-ZnBP-WT, pD-ZnBP-Thr91, and pDD-ZnBP-Thr91), we introduced PCR products coding only for an N-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 1-34 (pD-ZnBP-N and pDD-ZnBP-N) or for the central acidic cluster spanning amino acids 35-72 of ZnBP (pD-ZnBP-C and pDD-ZnBP-C). Proteins expressed from pD (pD without ZnBP-insert, pD-ZnBP-WT, pD-ZnBP-Thr91, pD-ZnBP-N, and pD-ZnBP-C) had molecular masses of 26.5-38 kDa, enabling them to passively diffuse into the nucleus, whereas proteins expressed from pDD (pDD-ZnBP, pDD-ZnBP-Thr91, pDD-ZnBP-N, and pDD-ZnBP-C) had molecular masses >60 kDa, excluding them from passive diffusion into the nucleus. This concept allows the direct comparison of the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of ZnBP-containing dihydrofolate reductase chimeras with that of control constructs expressing only the dihydrofolate reductase fusion partner. Moreover, it permits the distinction between distribution effects based on active import and effects resulting from nuclear interaction of the expressed proteins. All constructs were overexpressed in COS cells. Expressed proteins were detected by immunofluorescence with an anti c-myc antibody. As a control, pD without ZnBP insert was also expressed. Results are given in Figure 7:, Figure 8:. Surprisingly, all proteins expressed from pDD vector (except for pDD-ZnBP-WT) remained in the cytoplasm, despite their C-terminal motif PKRQKT (Fig. 8, B-D). In contrast pDD-ZnBP-WT, expressing wild-type ZnBP in the dihydrofolate reductase environment was found almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 8A). pDD-ZnBP-Thr91, as well as the calreticulin fusion protein of this variant (CR-ZnBP-Thr91, Fig. 5G), remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8B). This demonstrates that the motif PKRQKT alone is necessary but not sufficient to function as an active NLS. The overexpression of the pD constructs gave a clear hint for a nuclear retention of ZnBP (Fig. 7). Protein expressed from pD alone (without ZnBP-sequences but containing the PKRQKT-motif) appeared equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 7A). Insertion of wild-type ZnBP (pD-ZnBP-WT) resulted in a nearly exclusive nuclear localization due to its active import (Fig. 7B). In contrast to the distribution of products expressed from pD without ZnBP-insert, all other ZnBP inserts (pD-ZnBP-Thr91, pD-ZnBP-N, and pD-ZnBP-C) led to a clear shift of the expressed proteins toward the nucleus (Fig. 7, C-E), although the products of the corresponding pDD constructs had remained in the cytoplasm, indicating the absence of NLS-mediated transport. Therefore, the nuclear import of pD chimeras must have resulted from passive diffusion into the nucleus. The increased nuclear retention of the products of pD-ZnBP-Thr91, pD-ZnBP-N, and pD-ZnBP-C as compared with that of pD (Fig. 7A) points to an interaction of ZnBP-sequences with nuclear components. The finding that constructs expressed from pDD remain in the cytoplasm despite their motif PKRQKT suggests that this motif alone is not sufficient to direct a protein into the nucleus, although mutations of this motif inhibit active import. ZnBP contains the sequence RKR nine amino acids upstream of this motif. This raised the possibility that this sequence might contribute to a bipartite NLS as it had been found in nucleoplasmin (9Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 367-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and other nuclear proteins. To analyze the influence of the RKR motif on the intracellular distribution of ZnBP, we constructed an additional mutation of ZnBP, namely ZnBP-Δ1, in which the lysine in the RKR motif is exchanged for an alanine, and a C-terminal c-myc tag was added. The ZnBP-fragment of CR-ZnBP-WT was replaced by this mutant. Otherwise, this fusion gene displayed the same structure as the other calreticulin fusion genes (see Fig. 4) and was overexpressed in COS cells. Expressed proteins were detected by the anti c-myc antibody. CR-ZnBP-Δ1 was restricted to the cytoplasm and did not appear in the nucleus (Fig. 8E). This result was similar to that obtained with CR-ZnBP-Stop91, Cr-ZnBP-Thr91, and CR-ZnBP-Ser92, which possess a wild-type RKR-motif but a deleted or mutated PKRQKT-sequence (see Fig. 5) and demonstrates the contribution of the lysine residue in the RKR motif to the function of the NLS of ZnBP. Therefore, the functionally active nuclear import motif of ZnBP is a bipartite NLS. We have described previously (2Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J"
