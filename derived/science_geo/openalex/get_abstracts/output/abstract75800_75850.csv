https://openalex.org/W1590377765,"Abstract Chloroperoxidase can utilize chloride, bromide, and iodide ions and catalyze the formation of a carbon-halogen bond in the presence of suitable acceptor molecules. Suitable halogen acceptor molecules are β-keto acids, cyclic β-diketones, and substituted phenols. An optical assay has been developed to measure the halogenating activity of chloroperoxidase. The assay is based on the conversion of monochlorodimedon to the corresponding gem-dihalo derivative. The optical assay is based on the loss of absorbance at 278 mµ associated with the formation of the dihalo derivative from the monohalo compound. In the optical assay, crystalline chloroperoxidase preparations catalyze the formation of the dichlorodimedon from monochlorodimedon, chloride ion, and hydrogen peroxide at a rate of 67,000 moles of product formed per min per mole of enzyme. When bromide ion replaces chloride ion in the optical assay, the rate of formation of monobromo-monochlorodimedon is approximately twice the rate of formation of dichlorodimedon. The chloroperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation of tyrosine can be followed by measuring the decrease in tyrosine fluorescence associated with the formation of the mono- and dihalogenated tyrosines. At low concentrations of halogen anion (0.33 mm) the relative activity among the halogen anions for the halogenation of tyrosine is approximately 5.1:4.8:1 for iodide, bromide, and chloride, respectively. At higher concentrations of halogen anion, 3.3 mm, the ratio of activity between bromide and chloride falls to 3:1. At 3.3 mm iodide concentration, the enzymatic formation of elemental iodine masks the tyrosine fluorescences measurements so that rate comparisons cannot be made in this instance. Crystalline chloroperoxidase preparations catalyze the chlorination of tyrosine at a rate of approximately 7500 moles of product formed per min per mole of enzyme. Fluoride is not a substrate for chloroperoxidase but is an inhibitor of the halogenation reaction. The results indicate that fluoride ion can compete for both the hydrogen peroxide- and the halogen anion-binding sites on chloroperoxidase. Chloroperoxidase shares with other peroxidases the ability to catalyze the oxidation of iodide to iodine. The rate of iodine formation is about 1.5 times the rate of chlorination of monochlorodimedon when the reactions are compared, with equivalent amounts of enzyme and under saturating conditions for all substrates."

The former increase the binding of calciumn to the phospholipids; the latter decrease it. The data can be correlated with the effects of these drugs Otl peripheral nerve.

https://openalex.org/W1479786080,"Abstract Electrophoretic studies of the binding of iron to transferrin indicate that the stability constants of the two binding sites are approximately equal. The iron in each site also acts independently in relaxing the protons of the solvent water. It appears likely, then, that the binding sites are equivalent and independent. Similar results have been obtained for conalbumin, corroborating the evidence that the two proteins have similar structure."
https://openalex.org/W1576575116,"Abstract Anomalous boundaries resulting from the binding of a buffer constituent give the appearance of electrophoretic inhomogeneity to pure crystalline native monomeric cytochromes c from 10 species (man, horse, hog, guanaco, Pekin duck, pigeon, turkey, tuna, a moth (Samia cynthia), and the screw worm fly). The electrophoretic patterns depend on the particular cytochrome c used and its concentration, as well as the nature of the anion and its concentration. At pH 6.9 the order of increasing cathodic mobility of the protein is phosphate l chloride ≤ iodide l sulfate l cacodylate. Cations have no effect. The isoionic points of all the cytochromes c tested are at pH 10.04 ± 0.04 and are identical with the isoelectric points in the nonbinding tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-cacodylate buffer. At pH values removed from the isoelectric region the electrophoretic mobilities of various cytochromes c differ, as expected from the different net charges calculated from the amino acid compositions of the proteins. The changes in the chromatographic mobility of cytochrome c on cation exchange resins at different ionic strengths are probably caused by the same buffer reaction phenomena which affect the electrophoretic behavior of the protein. The remarkable evolutionary constancy of isoionic points and net charges at neutral pH is related to the importance of those physicochemical parameters in all cytochrome c physiological reactions and may represent a case of compensating evolutionary variations."

The soluble stearyl acyl carrier protein desaturase system from Euglena has been separated into three components, a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidase, the desaturase, and a nonheme iron protein (ferredoxin). The enzyme requires reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and molecular oxygen. Desaturation is inhibited by KCN but is not affected by carbon monoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1529591060,"The complex consisting of dioldehydrase and dimethylbenzimidazolycobamide coenzyme (DBC) can, in addition to its catalytic function, react with oxygen, glycolaldehyde, and glyoxal. The enzyme-coenzyme complex does not serve a catalytic function in these reactions, but participates as a reactant. However, the properties of the noncatalytic reaction suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in the catalytic and noncatalytic reaction. The reaction with oxygen leads to the inactivation of the enzyme-DBC complex. Spectral changes suggest the formation of hydroxocobalamin. Upon denaturation of the inactive complex, hydroxocobalamin and several nucleosides derived from the adenosyl moiety of DBC are detected. When glycolaldehyde is added to the enzyme-coenzyme complex, the complex becomes inactivated and glycolaldehyde is converted to glyoxal and to an as yet unidentified minor compound. In this reaction, 1 mole of enzyme-coenzyme complex is inactivated per mole of glycolaldehyde consumed. The reaction with glycolaldehyde also results in changes in the spectrum of the coenzyme. When the inactivated complex is denatured, DBC is no longer present; instead, hydroxocobalamin is isolated. A single nucleoside is formed from the adenosyl moiety, which has been tentatively identified as 5'-deoxyadenosine. The noncatalytic reactions show that the enzyme-coenzyme complex can function as electron donor and acceptor and that DBC participates in both of these processes. The ability of the coenzyme to function as oxidizing and reducing agent suggests that its chemical properties are modified as a result of the interaction with the apoenzyme. It is proposed that the modified coenzyme functions in both the catalytic and the noncatalytic reaction and that the ability of the enzyme-coenzyme complex to act as electron donor and acceptor is utilized in the catalytic reaction."

It is suggested that the gate for the sodium channel is located on the exterior surface of the axon, because tetrodotoxin is not lipid soluble."
https://openalex.org/W1483895425,"The discovery was made that an orthophosphate-repressible alkaline phosphatase exists in Neurospora crassa. Variable phosphate levels in the culture medium caused the enzyme to vary in the order of 100-fold in its range of specific activities. The properties of this 20-fold purified enzyme clearly differentiated it from the alkaline phosphomonoesterase of N. crassa, a Pi-repressible alkaline phosphomonoesterase in Escherichia coli, and the alkaline phosphatase of yeast. The enzyme is a nonspecific phosphohydrolase with a pH optimum of 9.0 to 9.5 that cleaves many phosphomonoesters and also pyrophosphate. It is stimulated by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and unaffected by a number of metallic ions tested in the absence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The enzyme is stable in the pH range between 7 and 8 but loses activity rapidly at pH 9.0. This loss of activity at pH 9.0 is retarded by phosphate esters serving as substrates, by certain metallic ions, and by Pi. The presence of both a repressible and a Pi-nonrepressible alkaline phosphoesterase in N. crassa represents a finding not generally observed in other species."
https://openalex.org/W1564970503,"Abstract An optical rotatory dispersion study of the three genetic variants of β-lactoglobulin has been carried out in the wave length region of 195 to 300 mµ. The results allow several conclusions. (a) The native secondary structures of all three genetic variants are close to being identical. (b) The structure of the native β-lactoglobulins is predominantly not α-helical. This is shown by the profile of the optical rotatory dispersion curve between 228 and 240 mµ which displays a small maximum instead of a minimum at 233 mµ. (c) The optical rotatory dispersion data is consistent with a native structure composed of 10 to 15% α-helix, with the remainder being essentially equal amounts of random and (probably) β structures. (d) In the native protein, some aromatic residues are present in an ordered, optically active conformation, which is destroyed by denaturation leading either to unfolding or to α-helix formation. (e) Addition of methanol (to more than 30% by volume) causes a sharp transition of the β-structured regions to α-helices; this is followed by a similar slow transformation of the randomly folded regions."
https://openalex.org/W1897054806,"Abstract 1. Clostridium tetanomorphum contains an adenosylating enzyme, that converts B12s (a reduced form of vitamin B12 in which the cobalt atom is in the +1 oxidation state) to the cobamide coenzyme, adenosyl-B12 (B12s + adenosine triphosphate → adenosyl-B12 + tripolyphosphate). 2. The enzyme has been purified approximately 300-fold, with an over-all recovery of about 40% by treatment of sonically disrupted cells with protamine, followed by selective heat denaturation and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The purified enzyme is free from B12a reductase and glutamate mutase. 3. The pH optimum for the enzyme is 8.0. Michaelis constants for B12s and ATP are 1.0 and 1.6 x 10-5 m, respectively. B12s cannot be replaced by B12r or B12a (forms of B12 in which the oxidation state of cobalt is +2 and +3, respectively). ATP can be replaced by cytidine triphosphate and, to a lesser degree, by the triphosphates of uridine, guanosine, and inosine. Mn++ is required as divalent cation; Co++ and Mg++ are less effective. 4. With the purified enzyme the forward reaction can be demonstrated spectrophotometrically by means of the increase in absorbance at 525 mµ as B12s is converted to adenosyl-B12. No evidence could be obtained for reversal of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1505098764,"Abstract Rats fed a purified diet containing 1% orotic acid for 2 days accumulate large amounts of uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosamine in the liver. This accumulation is not the result of a block in utilization of uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosamine, but probably results from increased synthesis de novo. These rats appear to suffer from a defect in the feedback control of l-glutamine-d-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase by uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine. The injection of glucosamine into control animals greatly reduces the synthesis de novo of glucosamine as measured by the incorporation of fructose into the glucosamine of uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine. Duazomycin A, a glutamine analogue, completely prevents the synthesis de novo of glucosamine derivatives in the liver by inhibiting the amidotransferase, and reduces liver uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosamine levels by 85% in 4 hours. Duazomycin A does not significantly reduce either the conversion of glucosamine to uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosamine or the utilization of available uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosamine for glycoprotein synthesis. Duazomycin A does inhibit glycoprotein synthesis indirectly, however, by reducing the level of uridine diphospho-N-acetylhexosamine in the liver. This reduction can be prevented by the infusion of glucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1532199075,"The thermodynamic parameters of the stereoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to the all-trans configuration have been measured in n-heptane between 20 and 80° (C). ΔF = -1100 to -1400 cal mole-1, ΔH = +150 cal mole-1, and ΔS = +4.4 e.u. The kinetic parameters have been measured in several solvents, which differ in their polarity, and in the presence of I2 as catalyst. For the uncatalyzed isomerizations, the Arrhenius energy (Ea) varies between 22,400 and 26,200 cal mole-1, and the Arrhenius or frequency factor (A) between about 108 and 1011 sec-1. In the presence of I2, A increases with relatively little change in Ea. In terms of the theory of absolute reaction rates, this means that chiefly the configurational parameter, ΔS‡, changes; ΔH‡ varies only slightly. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of isomerization are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561858775,"Abstract The mechanism of cyanide cleavage of peptide bonds involving the cystine amino group has been shown to involve scission of the disulfide bond to yield a sulfhydryl and a thiocyano group. In pH ranges below 8, the latter cyclizes to produce an acyliminothiazolidine moiety on the peptide chain. This product is unstable and hydrolyzes spontaneously to effect cleavage of the peptide link on the cystine amino group. Increasing the pH favors disulfide scission but decreases the rate of ring closure. Above pH 10, thiocyanate ion is eliminated from the primary reaction products. Since the disulfide scission is unsymmetrical, reoxidation of the newly formed sulfhydryl groups is necessary to convert all cysteine residues to iminothiazolidine rings at the NH2-terminal ends of peptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1539015398,"Abstract 1. A variety of naturally occurring and nonmetabolized amino acids were accumulated by fetal and adult calvaria in the rat by processes which are energy dependent, saturable, and sodium sensitive. 2. α-Aminoisobutyric acid and glycine were transported by mediated processes which differ, at least in part, from those utilized for l-proline and hydroxy-l-proline. This conclusion is based on kinetic analysis and response to the removal of Na+ from the incubation medium. 3. α-Aminoisobutyric acid and glycine were noted to be transported by mediated mechanisms in the absence of the Na+, suggesting the presence of two transport systems for these substrates in the osseous tissue used. 4. These results indicate that the dependence on Na+ may be a useful criterion with which to characterize transport mechanisms within the group of neutral amino acids, as well as between cationic and neutral substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1502000149,"Abstract The kinetics of aminoacyl transfer from aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid to ribosomal protein has been examined with rat liver preparations. A lag in the initial rate of incorporation with resolved aminoacyl-transferring enzymes is observed with low (4 mm) concentrations of reduced glutathione; this lag is abolished when transferase II is incubated with a sulfhydryl compound, such as glutathione or 2-mercaptoethanol, prior to the addition of the other reaction components. The sulfhydryl activation is dependent on time and on glutathione concentration, and is inhibited by oxidized glutathione. The total extent of amino acid incorporation is also dependent on sulfhydryl concentration. A sulfhydryl requirement in aminoacyl transfer, other than for the activation of transferase II, was not detected. The initial rate of amino acid incorporation is markedly stimulated when transferase II, glutathione, ribosomes, guanosine triphosphate, and NH4Cl are incubated prior to the addition of aminoacyl soluble RNA and transferase I. This transferase II-ribosome interaction, which involves GTP and a monovalent cation, yields a product which is partially protected against inhibition by oxidized glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1529685279,Abstract Rat liver ribosomes prepared from the rapidly sedimenting pellet of a liver homogenate or from the microsomal pellet by the treatment of these pellets with sodium deoxycholate in buffer are deficient in polyribosomes and contain primarily ribosome dimers. Dimer formation can be prevented and a good polyribosome pattern can be obtained from both these pellets provided treatment with sodium deoxycholate takes place in the presence of liver supernatant. It has been shown that the polyribosomes isolated from the rapidly sedimenting pellet incorporate glycine into acid-insoluble material in vivo and are broken down into single ribosomes and ribosome dimers by ribonuclease.

Factor VII, essentially free of Factor X but containing traces of prothrombin, and Factor X, very low in Factor VII, have been prepared by a combination of adsorption to and elution from barium sulfate and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. 2. The activation of Factor X by lung microsomes is due to contamination of Factor X with Factor VII rather than to a direct attack on the Factor X molecule by lung microsomes. 3. Factor VII, lung microsomes, and calcium react to form a complex which is able to act as enzyme in activating Factor X. Indirect evidence has been obtained indicating the enzymatic activity of the complex is due to activated Factor VII."

https://openalex.org/W2042959005,"The high-density (1.063 to 1.21 g/ml) lipoprotein in human serum was analyzed as activator for a lipoprotein lipase isolated from chicken adipose tissue. The activating capacity was lost when the lipoprotein was extracted with a mixture of ethanol and ethyl ether (3:2 by volume) at -10 degrees C and it was restored upon incubation of the extracted protein with aqueous sols of either whole phospholipids or the lecithin fraction prepared from the high-density lipoprotein. Since phospholipid sols alone proved ineffective as substrate activators, the complex which forms upon incubation of the extracted lipoprotein with phospholipids appears to be a necessary requirement for lipoprotein lipase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1531775500,"6-Hydroxynicotinic acid was demonstrated to be the first intermediate in the degradation of nicotinic acid by a clostridium. In the presence of pyruvate, other intermediates accumulated; two of these were identified, one as 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinic acid, and the other as α-methyleneglutaric acid. The pathways for nicotinic acid degradation may be considered as involving successive oxidative and reductive steps to 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinic acid, then through some unidentified steps to α-methyleneglutaric acid, which is subsequently converted to propionic and acetic acids and carbon dioxide. Pyruvate and lactate were shown not to be obligatory intermediates in the production of propionate.

https://openalex.org/W1564124755,"Abstract The incorporation of adenine-8-14C and cytidine-3H into the soluble ribonucleic acid (sRNA) of intact rabbit reticulocytes in vitro was studied. The 14C which is incorporated into the sRNA is located primarily in the adenosine of the terminal pCpCpA group. The incorporated 3H appears to be predominantly in the 2 cytidine monophosphate residues of the terminal group. Studies on the kinetics of the incorporation of adenine and cytidine into ATP, CTP, and sRNA indicate a turnover time of 4 to 8 hours for the terminal adenosine and an average of about 30 hours for the 2 CMP residues of the terminal group. Puromycin at 100 µg per ml had little or no effect on the incorporation of adenine and cytidine into the sRNA of the intact reticulocytes although it inhibited the rate of incorporation of leucine into protein by 98%."
https://openalex.org/W1886694631,"Abstract The mean rotational relaxation times of human macroglobulin (γM) conjugated with 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl-chloride, its subunit (γMs), and its tryptic fragment (Fabµ) have been determined by the technique of polarization of fluorescence. Strikingly low values were found for γM (80 nsec) and γMs (69 nsec). These low values as well as other properties of γM and γMs are consistent with internal degrees of rotational freedom. The Fabµ fragment had a relaxation time indicative of a compact structure, and it is suggested that it may represent the effective rotational subunit in γM. Parallel studies with human 7 S γ2-globulin (γG) immunoglobulin and with its papain fragments yielded results and conclusions similar to those determined for γM and to those reported for γG of other species."
https://openalex.org/W2032048209,"Observations of contracting muscle fibrils in cultured cells indicate that the force which restores the resting length of the sarcomere comes from the contractile elements themselves and not from external elasticity, as is now generally accepted. In light of biochemical studies on the contraction-relaxation cycle, it is postulated that the elongating force is one of internal elasticity in the sarcomere, which arises during contraction from the distortion of bonds between filaments and/or structural proteins. This mechanism of restoration may serve to establish optimal sarcomere length for production of maximum contractile force, and in cardiac muscle this mechanism may be a factor in ventricular filling."

https://openalex.org/W1568599265,"Abstract Lymph chylomicrons are at the lipid-rich end of the spectrum of the lipoproteins. The nature of their protein moiety and its biosynthesis have not yet been fully elucidated. Observations are reported on the incorporation of radioactive leucine into a density by mucosal cells of the small intestine isolated from the rat during absorption of fat. The amino acid incorporation exhibited the characteristic energy requirement and sensitivity to inhibitors of other systems for biosynthesis of proteins. The protein moiety was not homogeneous, but appeared to consist of a small number of species that could be separated by thin layer electrophoresis in starch granules. Similar, but nonidentical, electrophoretic patterns were obtained with the residual soluble intracellular protein of the intestinal mucosa and with chylomicrons of intestinal lymph. The lowest density lipoprotein was isolated from a homogenate of the mucosal cells. After removal of lipids by extraction with organic solvents, the protein moiety exhibited several unusual properties in addition to its affinity for lipids: (a) a predominance of apolar amino acids, (b) resistance to fractionation procedures involving ionic properties, (c) considerable solubility in organic solvents, and (d) peculiarities of the peptide map that were related to the foregoing features. Peptide maps were obtained after proteolytic digestion of the protein moieties of the lowest density lipoprotein fraction, the residual soluble protein, and lymph chylomicrons by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis and chromatography. Unusual maps were obtained in which most of the peptide fragments failed to move upon electrophoresis over a broad pH range, but were readily resolved by chromatography in organic solvents. Strong, although imperfect, resemblance was noted among the peptide maps of all three protein fractions. Preliminary studies of low and high density lipoproteins of rat serum revealed different, more complex peptide maps. No definitive conclusion could be drawn about the specificity of the protein which becomes associated with lipid during absorption through the intestinal mucosa. A speculative interpretation of the aforementioned similarity in peptide maps led us to suggest that lipids in transit become associated with some of the more abundant soluble proteins of the mucosal cells and that the resulting lipoprotein complexes appear in the chylomicrons of intestinal lymph. Thin layer methods of chromatography and electrophoresis were extensively employed. Their convenience and great sensitivity permitted detailed studies to be carried out on submilligram quantities of material."

https://openalex.org/W1529613373,"Abstract A very rapid procedure for the preparation of phosphoglycerate mutase from chicken breast muscle is presented. Commercially available frozen chicken breasts may be used. The enzyme is obtained in high yields, and the specific activity of the crystalline homogenous preparations is equal to that of the crystalline enzymes from yeast and rabbit muscle. The chicken breast enzyme requires 2,3-diphosphoglycerate for activity, and it is very similar in kinetic and molecular properties to the rabbit muscle phosphoglycerate mutase. Similarly, it also possesses 4 sulfhydryl groups per mole of enzyme. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 65,690. With the use of a gel filtration technique, it has been demonstrated that 2 moles of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate may be bound per mole of the enzyme. It appears that the binding of this phosphoglycerate may entail phosphoenzyme formation. Again, as with other pure phosphoglycerate mutases, the chicken breast muscle mutase shows some 2,3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase activity (about 1/40,000 the mutase activity)."

https://openalex.org/W1527015864,"Abstract When Sarcoma 37 ascites cells were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D, protein synthesis was inhibited. The inhibitory effect could be prevented or relieved by glucose or by a variety of glycolyzable substrates. The inhibitory effect was independent of the concentration of the labeled amino acid precursor. Under conditions inhibitory to protein synthesis, no significant inhibition of respiration or of amino acid uptake was observed. Actinomycin D inhibited amino acid incorporation into ribosomal and soluble protein, as well as into soluble ribonucleic acid, and these inhibitory effects were all abolished by the presence of glucose. Three analogues of actinomycin D, which were inactive as inhibitors of RNA synthesis, were inactive as inhibitors of protein synthesis in the present studies. Actinomycin D also inhibited the incorporation of mevalonic acid into sterols, and the inhibition was relieved by glucose. Although the characteristics of these inhibitions suggested an interference with the availability of oxidative energy, measurements of levels of adenine nucleotides and of incorporation of 32P-labeled orthophosphate into ATP failed to show an effect of the antibiotic on oxidative phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2166096460,"Abstract Studies with isolated rat liver mitochondria were conducted in order to determine the influence of thyroxine on swelling and peroxidation of mitochondrial lipids caused by certain divalent metal ions. The effects of micromolar concentrations of certain divalent metal ions on the swelling action of thyroxine were also investigated. Thyroxine blocks mitochondrial swelling and lipid peroxidation caused by Fe++. The hormone also blocks Cu++-induced swelling. Swelling is strikingly potentiated when thyroxine and micromolar concentrations of Ca++ or Zn++ are tested in the presence of each other. Cu++ and Sr++ at concentrations of 10 µm or less block the swelling action of thyroxine. Fe++ also blocks thyroxine swelling at relatively low concentrations of metal ion and hormone, but higher concentrations of the two agents produce swelling. A strong lipid antioxidant action is exhibited by thyroxine at a concentration of 1 µm. This concentration of the hormone is about one-tenth that necessary to produce appreciable mitochondrial swelling. The finding that the response to an organic swelling agent can be altered markedly by levels of metal ions that might be present adventitiously further illustrates the importance of considering metal contaminants in studies with isolated mitochondria."

Under this condition extrapolation of reduced viscosity to zero concentration gives a value of intrinsic viscosity of 27 dl per g, which is higher than previously accepted values determined under non-Newtonian conditions.

Nearest neighbor studies showed that the adenosine 5'-phosphate was being incorporated exclusively next to guanylate; there was none next to adenylate. These results suggest that the hydroxylamine produces in the polycytidylic acid a species by which adenosine 5'-phosphate is incorporated in place of guanosine 5'-phosphate, and then a second species is produced which will not pair with any of the normal bases."

This increase in aberrations is greater than that expected as a result of age alone."
https://openalex.org/W1967503836,"These thoughts about an ethic of international health can be summarized in a very free revision of the Hippocratic Oath: I will share the science and art by precept, by demonstration, and by every mode of teaching with other physicians regardless of their national origin. I will try to help secure for the physicians in each country the esteem of their own people, and in collaborative work see that they get full credit. I will strive to eliminate sources of disease everywhere in the world and not merely set up barriers to the spread of disease to my own people. I will work for understanding of the diverse causes of disease, including the social, economic, and environmental. I will promote the well-being of mankind in all its aspects, not merely the bodily, with sympathy and consideration for a people's culture and beliefs. I will strive to prevent painful and untimely death, and also to help parents to achieve a family size conforming to their desires and to their ability to care for their children. In my concern with whole communities I will never forget the needs of its individual members."

https://openalex.org/W1667615428,"An amino acid-incorporating system has been obtained from ungerminated wheat germ, which can be stimulated by the addition of uridylic-rich polynucleotides. Polyadenylic and polycytidylic acids fail to stimulate the incorporation of lysine and proline, respectively. The amino acid codons determined by the use of the uridylic-rich polynucleotides coincide almost perfectly with those reported for Escherichia coli. Binding of aminoacyl-sRNA to wheat germ ribosomes can be directed specifically by polynucleotides and does not require the presence of supernatant fraction or guanosine triphosphate. Polycytidylic acid failed to promote prolyl-sRNA binding by ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1519642050,"Abstract Oral administration of 3-acetylpyridine to the dog led to the excretion of 1-(3-pyridyl)ethanol in two acidic conjugate forms which were fractionated with the aid of ion exchange resins. The more acidic of the conjugate forms had the properties of a sulfate ester in comparison with synthetic material. Acidic hydrolysis of the sulfate ester fraction led to the release of (-)-1-(3-pyridyl)ethanol. Acidic hydrolysis of the other conjugate form, which had properties of a glucuronide, led to the release of 1-(3-pyridyl)ethanol which after chromatographic purification was approximately 95% pure on the basis of extinction coefficient and which was approximately 60% in the levorotatory form on the basis of optical rotation. The pyridylethanol separated after the hydrolysis of the glucuronide contained, in addition, two other Koenig-positive materials. By the chromatographic behavior of some of the latter and by analogy to the metabolism of phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, the formation of a glucuronide of (3-pyridyl)-1,2-ethanediol is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2009681720,"The ability of institutionalized retardates in scaling musical preferences was compared with that of normals. The retardates' scale values and scale forms obtained by two kinds of scaling procedures are very similar to those of normals. Deficits, however, are observed in their lower internal consistency and relative uncertainty and in higher response polarization and perseveration."
