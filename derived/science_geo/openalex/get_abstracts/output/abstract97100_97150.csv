https://openalex.org/W1980693308,"One of the most fertile methods of investigating the brain is to stimulate a part of it electrically and observe the results. So far, however, use of the method in man has been restricted by the necessity of opening the skull surgically to apply the electrodes. Much could be done, both with healthy subjects and with neurological patients, if it were feasible to stimulate through electrodes on the scalp, although the localization of the stimulus on the cortex will always be much less sharp than with electrodes on the brain surface. In an intact man, however, the brain is protected from electricity by the skull and by the scalp, both of which normally offer considerable resistance. Furthermore, the cerebral cortex does not have a particularly low electrical threshold. It is probably for these reasons (despite an occasional contrary claim1) that attempts to stimulate the brain by applying stimuli from conventional stimulators to the scalp have been stopped by pain or have otherwise failed. These obstacles have now begun to yield. Recently, it was found that, on stimulating muscles in the human hand2 without any special preparation of the skin, the effective resistance fell to low values if brief but very high voltage shocks were used. Applying the same technique to the head, it has now proved possible at the first attempt to stimulate two areas of the human cortex, without undue discomfort."

https://openalex.org/W1540979786,"In the rat hepatocyte, whether freshly separated or in primary culture, we do not find L-glutamine entry by Systems A and ASC as seen in cells previously studied. Instead the mediated entry of glutamine appears to occur exclusively by a Na+-dependent system (N) apparently specific to amino acid amides and L-histidine; however, a portion of asparagine uptake occurs by System A. The simplest evidence for the separateness of the added system is the failure of model substrates for System A (e.g. N-methylalanine) to inhibit glutamine uptake significantly, and the failure of glutamine to inhibit the uptake of L-cysteine, model substrate for System ASC, at least in this cell. As is the case for cysteine, glutamine inhibits transport by System A (although not competitively), even though showing no transport by that system. Our finding confirms an earlier inference that glutamine uptake by this cell may follow a route not taken by alanine or serine, and explains the apparently erroneous companion inference that glutamine also shares a route with these two amino acids. Its uptake has now been characterized to show a series of differences from Systems A and ASC. Especially significant in view of the importance of glutamine metabolism are an insensitivity of the new system to stimulation by either insulin or glucagon, and its distinct enhancement (not as large as that for System A) on starvation of the cells with respect to amino acids. Hence, a second system has been found to show adaptive regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1493342615,"A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been extracted from vaccinia virions and purified to near homogeneity as judged by glycerol gradient sedimentation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 500,000 and can be dissociated into putative subunits of 140,000, 137,000, 37,000, 35,000, 31,000, 22,000, and 17,000 daltons. Activity was dependent on all four ribonucleoside triphosphates, Mn2+, and a DNA template. Optimal activity occurred at pH 7.9 in the presence of 90 mM KCl or 40 mM (NH4)2SO4. All single-stranded DNAs tested served as templates. By contrast, linear double-stranded DNAs were not effectively transcribed and very low activity was obtained with circular supercoiled DNAs which contain small single-stranded regions. The synthetic alternating copolymer poly(dA-dT), which forms a completely base-paired structure, also was not transcribed, whereas poly(dA,dT) and other random copolymers served as templates. Of the four homopolydeoxribonucleotides, only poly(dC) and poly(dT) were transcribed, suggesting that initiation specifically occurs with purine ribonucleotides. In support of this, higher Km values were obtained for GTP and ATP (333 and 80 micro M, respectively) than for UTP and CTP (22 and 12 micro M, respectively) using a DNA template. The RNA polymerase was inhibited by polyanions but was resistant to rifampicin and alpha-amanitin."

https://openalex.org/W1573816125,"Penicillin kills susceptible bacteria by specifically inhibiting the transpeptidase that catalyzes the final step in cell wall biosynthesis, the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. It was hypothesized (Tipper, D., and Strominger, J. (1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 54, 1133-1141) that 1) penicillin is a structural analog of the acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the pentapeptide side chains of nascent peptidoglycan, and that 2) penicillin, by virtue of its highly reactive beta-lactam structure, irreversibly acylates the active site of the cell wall transpeptidase. Although the cell wall transpeptidase has proven elusive, a closely related penicillin-sensitive cell wall enzyme, D-alanine carboxypeptidase, has been purified from membranes of Bacillus stearothermophilus by penicillin affinity chromatography. By amino acid sequence analysis of 14C-labeled cyanogen bromide peptides generated and purified from this carboxypeptidase covalently labeled with either [14C]penicillin G or the substrate, [14C]diacetyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate, it was shown that the penicillin and substrate were both bound as esters to a serine at residue 36. Therefore, the second hypothesis stated above was proven to be correct for D-alanine carboxypeptidase. Several new methods were developed in the course of this work, including 1) a rapid penicillin-binding assay, 2) use of hydroxylamine to protect peptides against carbamylation during ion exchange chromatography in concentrated urea solutions, and 3) gel filtration chromatography in 70% formic acid, a universal solvent for peptides."

https://openalex.org/W1566713165,"Tryptophan hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4) from rat mid-brain is inactivated upon exposure to oxygen. The degree of inactivation is dependent both on the temperature and partial pressure of oxygen to which the enzyme is exposed. Furthermore, molecular oxygen, and not an oxygen or hydroxyl radical, is responsible for the inactivation. Sulfhydryl compounds and reductants partially protect the hydroxylase from inactivation by oxygen. Enzyme inhibited by oxygen can be reconstituted by anaerobic incubation in the presence of dithiothreitol and Fe2+ at 25 degrees C and in some experiments the inclusion of inorganic sulfide, in addition to dithiothreitol and Fe2+, led to even greater recoveries of activity. Preincubation of tryptophan hydroxylase with various sulfhydryl reagents or disulfide compounds also produces inactivation which can be rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol. The substrate tryptophan protects the enzyme from inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents and disulfides but not from inactivation by oxygen. Finally, the enzyme was inhibited by a variety of iron chelators. These results suggest that the catalytic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase is dependent on the oxidation-reduction status ofâ€“SH groups and iron sites, which are probably located at the catalytic (substrate binding) site of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1484492716,"In previous studies in this laboratory, highly purified liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 was shown to catalyze the hydroperoxide-dependent hydroxylation of a variety of substrates in the absence of NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and molecular oxygen, and evidence was obtained that the oxygen atom in the product was derived from the peroxide. To determine whether the cytochrome functions in such reactions by a peroxidase-type mechanism, the kinetics of its interactions with a variety of substituted hydroperoxides and peroxy acids have been determined by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The reaction of P-450LM2 with various peroxy compounds yields an intermediate with an absorption maximum at about 436 nm in the difference spectrum, with pseudo-first order or biphasic kinetics depending upon the individual rate constants and the concentration of the oxidant used. The results are in accord with a reversible two-step mechanism, as follows: P-450 + oxidant in equilibrium C in equilibrium D, where C represents a transient intermediate which is detected spectrally only under certain conditions and is probably an enzyme . oxidant complex, and D is the complex with an absorption maximum at about 436 nm in the difference spectrum. The absolute and difference spectra of C and D vary in magnitude and in the positions of maxima and minima with the organic moiety of the peroxy compound used. Whereas the kinetics of the reaction with cumene hydroperoxide and benzyl hydroperoxide is unchanged in the pH range 5.0 to 9.0, that of perbenzoic acids decreases markedly at higher pH, thus indicating that only the unionized compound reacts with the enzyme. Experiments with a variety of substituted cumene hydroperoxides, benzyl hydroperoxides, and perbenzoic acids indicated that the first equilibrium is driven to the right by hydrophobic bonding of the oxidant to P-450LM2 and that the rate of conversion of C to D is increased by electron-withdrawing substituents in the oxidant and decreased by electron donating substituents. Following the formation of Complex D, irreversible heme destruction occurs slowly. These results indicate that the reaction of liver microsomal P-450 with peroxides differs in two important respects from that of typical peroxidases; the intermediates arising from the reaction of P-450LM2 with peroxy compounds are formed reversibly, and the spectra of these intermediates vary with structural differences in the peroxy compounds. Furthermore, the absence of a common isosbestic point in the spectra observed with P-450LM2 rules out the possibility that they represent mixtures of Compounds I and II as reported for peroxidases."

https://openalex.org/W1500999073,"The major aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (the 24 S complex) isolated from rat liver, which contains lysyl-, leucyl-, and arginyl-tRNA synthetase activities, is dissociated into fully active free aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases by column chromatography on diaminooctyl-Sepharose. During the hydrophobic interaction chromatography, more than a quantitative yield of the lysyl-tRNA synthetase activity is obtained. The free lysyl-tRNA synthetase, dissociated from the synthetase complex, is purified about 2,000-fold with a 13% yield by conventional column chromatography. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase is also purified from the 24 S synthetase complex by affinity column chromatography on lysyl-diaminohexyl-Sepharose. Free lysyl-tRNA synthetase as dissociated from the synthetase complex, is evidently a dimeric enzyme with a subunit molecular weight of 66,000 +/- 3,000, as determined by gel electrophoresis, sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1606576945,"We have obtained evidence in vivo for the intracellular site of sialylation of glycoproteins and have determined the kinetics of intramembranous transport of newly synthesized sialoglycoproteins. Radioactivity of sialoglycoproteins was determined at different times in homogenate, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane fractions of liver either from slices which had been incubated with radioactive N-acetylneuraminic acid or from mice which had been injected with radioactive sugar. At short times after labeling, the Golgi apparatus contained the highest specific activity of radioactive sialoglycoproteins and over half of the total cellular radioactive sialoglycoproteins. By 15 to 25 min, most of the radioactivity in the Golgi apparatus had decreased with a concomitant increase of radioactivity in the plasma membrane. Radioactivity in the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum accounted for less than 20% of the total cellular radioactivity throughout. Control experiments indicated that leakage of soluble, labeled sialoglycoproteins from membrane vesicles and adsorption of them onto vesicles was minimal. In contrast to the above studies, labeling for short times with radioactive mannose, showed, as expected from studies in vitro, most of the radioactivity in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At longer times, the radioactivity in the rough endoplasmic reticulum decreased, with an increase in the plasma membrane. Throughout, the radioactivity in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum was low."

https://openalex.org/W1498331547,"The reactions of human hemoglobin with a series of 13 alkyl isocyanides have been examined in equilibrium titration experiments at pH 7, 20 degrees C. The ligands include: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, (+)- and (-)-sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, and benzyl isocyanides. All of these compounds exhibit sigmoidal binding curves; however, the amount of cooperativity expressed decreases with ligand length and increases as the alkyl side chains become more highly substituted. The overall affinity of hemoglobin for these compounds also exhibits a complex dependence on ligand size and stereochemistry. These results have been interpreted in terms of competing favorable hydrophobic interactions and unfavorable protein steric effects. The overall chemical potentials of the bound ligands were calculated from the sum of the observed binding free energy change and the relative chemical potentials of the isonitriles in aqueous solution. The resulting values allowed the construction of a rough, three-dimensional free energy map of steric hindrance at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron atom. This scheme suggests a cylindrical cavity of weak protein interactions into which ethyl isocyanide can easily fit. This cavity or mobile region of protein structure is surrounding by a more rigid region which results in large unfavorable steric interactions. Finally, this ring of more rigid structure is followed by an outer area where considerably smaller steric hindrance effects are observed."

https://openalex.org/W1514380693,"The reactions of 13 isonitriles with deoxyhemoglobin have been examined and characterized at pH 7, 20 degrees C. Kinetic studies have shown that these ligands can be divided into two mechanistic classes based on their size and stereochemistry. The larger and branched compounds (isopropyl, all butyl isomers, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, and benzyl isocyanides) exhibit biphasic time courses at all ligand concentrations as a result of intrinsic differences between the reactivities of the alpha and beta subunits. In contrast, the smaller isonitriles (methyl, ethyl, and n-propyl isocyanides) exhibit monophasic, and often accelerating, time courses at high ligand concentrations. At low concentrations, the smaller isonitriles also exhibit biphasic time courses; however, in this case, the two phases are due to marked differences between the dissociation rate constants of the high and low affinity quaternary conformations of the protein. Sets of equilibrium and kinetic data for the binding of 11 of the isonitriles were fitted to an expanded version of the two-state allosteric model first described by Monad, Wyman, and Changeux (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J.-P. (1965) J. Mol. 12, 108 118). The resultant rate and equilibrium constants for the R (high affinity) and T (low affinity) states were used to calculate chemical potentials for ligand molecules bound to the heme iron and for the kinetic barriers experienced by these compounds during the binding process. For the beta subunits, both the difference between the bound chemical potentials for the R and T states and the differences between the barrier potentials for the two protein conformations are independent of ligand length and stereochemistry. Thus, it would appear that steric interactions are not a major factor in the expression of cooperativity by these subunits. For alpha chains, a 30% decrease in the difference between the bound R and T state potentials is observed in going from methyl to n-hexyl isocyanide. In addition, a marked increase in the height of the T state, alpha chain kinetic barrier is observed with increasing length of the alkyl side chain. Thus, steric hindrance between the bound ligand molecule and protein residues at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron atom does appear to play a significant role in the expression of cooperativity by the alpha subunits, at least for the larger alkyl isocyanides."
https://openalex.org/W1517737213,"Previous observations suggested that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was capable of inhibiting estrogen . receptor (R . E2) activation, or translocation to the nucleus, or both. The present study attempts to define more specifically the locus of this action. To this end we have examined the physicochemical alteration produced by interaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with estrogen . receptor complex, using sucrose density gradient analysis and dissociation kinetics. Receptor transformation was inhibited when activation was performed in the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. This effect was protein- and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration-dependent. When pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was introduced postactivation it did not have any effect on the activated receptor, but when similar treatment was followed by NABH4 reduction, the complex reverted to the monomeric entity. The dissociation behavior obtained with cytosol R . E2, warmed in the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, showed a biphasic curve suggesting that a significant portion of receptors remained nonactivated as demonstrated by the fast dissociating component. Due to the fact that Tris buffers cannot be used for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate experiments, we have used a borate buffer which resulted in a displacement of the sedimentation values from a 4S to 4.6 S for the unactivated receptor and 5S to 6 S for the activated form. The observations reported suggest that at least the initial effect of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate results in the inhibition of cytosolic receptor transformation from the nonactivated to the activated form."

Metallomyoglobins examined include Fe(III), Cr(III), Rh(III), Mn(III), Fe(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Ru(II). It is shown that the protein denaturant interaction is not altered, in general, by metal substitution. Therefore reversible denaturation provides a means to assess the dependence of myoglobin conformational energy on metal electronic state. A simple relationship was found between the conformational free energy of trivalent metal derivatives (delta delta G0u) and the metal imidazole bond strength (delta Gim) of that derivative. Clear differences are observed between the divalent and trivalent metal derivatives, independent of delta Gim."
