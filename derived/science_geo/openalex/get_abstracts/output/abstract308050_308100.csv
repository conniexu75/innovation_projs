https://openalex.org/W1998420645,"New physics occurs in semiconductors when one or more dimensions of the crystal are reduced to a size comparable to bulk electron delocalization lengths (tens to hundreds of angstroms). The properties of ""quantum dots"" or semiconductor nanocrystals are now being studied, as techniques to fabricate the crystallites are developed. Temperature-dependent electron diffraction studies on nanocrystals of CdS show a large depression in the melting temperature with decreasing size, as a larger fraction of the total number of atoms is on the surface. Thermal stability may play a role in determining the uses of semiconductor nanocrystals."
https://openalex.org/W1966599239,"An analysis is made of the likely contribution of smoke particles from biomass burning to the global radiation balance. These particles act to reflect solar radiation directly; they also can act as cloud condensation nuclei, increasing the reflectivity of clouds. Together these effects, although uncertain, may add up globally to a cooling effect as large as 2 watts per square meter, comparable to the estimated contribution of sulfate aerosols. Anthropogenic increases of smoke emission thus may have helped weaken the net greenhouse warming from anthropogenic trace gases."
https://openalex.org/W2086405623,The uncrossed visual pathways to the principal primary optic centers of hooded rats are substantially larger than those of albino rats. This provides an anatomical basis for the results of a recent study on behavior which showed differences in interocular transfer in the two varieties.
https://openalex.org/W1970530702,"A record of oxygen isotopes in biogenic silica from a deep-sea sediment core from the Southern Ocean reveals that marine diatoms retain their primary isotopic composition after burial. As a result, the marine diatom record can be combined with data on coexisting planktonic foraminifera to monitor past surface temperature and isotopic composition of seawater. The coupling of these two records allows the solution of two paleotemperature equations for each core interval. Data from a South Atlantic core show that the average delta(18)O during the glacial period at this site was higher by about 1.3 per mil than average Holocene values, and that average glacial-age temperatures were not significantly different from average Holocene values."
https://openalex.org/W1993702982,"Mounting evidence for voluminous continental crust formation in the early Archean involving intracrustal melting and selective preservation of granitoid rocks suggests that initial crust formation crust formation and growth were predominantly by magmatic underplating in plumegenerated Iceland-type settings. Collision of these early islands to give rise to larger blocks is suggested by extensive horizontal shortening in both supracrustal and granitoid assemblages. Preservation of early Archean high-grade gneisses that were once at depths of 20 to 30 kilometers implies that these blocks developed thick, subcrustal roots despite high mantle heat flow. Rigid continental plates must have existed since at least 3.5 billion years ago, and greenstone belts (composed of mixed metavolcanic and metasedimentary sequences intruded by granitoid plutons) probably developed on or near these microcontinents. Paleomagnetic data with good age control from at least one ancient craton suggest that plate motion was at normal minimum average velocities of about 17 millimeters per year with respect to the poles during the period 3.5 billion to 2.4 billion years ago. If this is true on a global scale, Archean plate motion was not faster than in later geologic times."

https://openalex.org/W2002477667,"Chert is precipitating as gelatinous opal-cristobalite in lakes associated with the Coorong Lagoon of South Australia. Dolomite, magnesite, and magnesian calcite are also being deposited. High pH (9.5 to 10.2) causes dissolution of detrital silicates; lowering of pH (7.0 to 6.5) and drying of the lakes cause precipitation of chert. time."
https://openalex.org/W2020121791,"The rate of crater formation on Mars is calculated to be about 25 times higher than that on the Moon. The crater density observed by Mariner IV points to an age only one-sixth that of the lunar maria, or 300 to 800 million years. Hence no conclusions can presently be drawn from these photographs concerning the early Martian environment."

https://openalex.org/W1995403175,Liquid cultures of several freshwater and marine algae required less pressure to flow through a pipe at a given rate than the pure liquid medium before algal growth. This increased ease of flow can be attributed to long-chain polysaccharides produced in the medium during growth. Measurements of friction were used to estimate the molecular weight of an algal polysaccharide and to show the effect of bacterial action on the polymer.
https://openalex.org/W2010662118,Intercomparisons of crater counts on Mars and the Moon suggest that the age of the visible Martian surface is approximately 340 to 680 million years.
https://openalex.org/W2003115763,"The structure of liquid Na(2)Ge(2)O(5).H(2)O, a silicate melt analog, has been studied with Raman spectroscopy to pressures of 2.2 gigapascals. Upon compression, a peak near approximately 240 wavenumbers associated with octahedral GeO(6) groups grows relative to a peak near approximately 500 wavenumbers associated with tetrahedral GeO(4) groups. This change corresponds to an increase in octahedral germanium in the liquid from near 0% at ambient pressures to >50% at a pressure of 2.2 gigapascals. Silicate liquids plausibly undergo similar coordination changes at depth in the Earth. Such structural changes may generate decreases in the fusion slopes of silicates at high pressures as well as neutrally buoyant magmas within the transition zone of the Earth's mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2041538237,"If the craters on Mars were formed by asteroidal particles having spatial distributions independent of asteroid size, and if both spatial distributions and total numbers are independent of time, the average age of the craters may be less than 300 million years."
https://openalex.org/W1984452982,The feasibility of measuring terrestrial heat flow in lakes has been investigated in Lake Superior. The temperature gradient and thermal conductivity of the sediment were measured at each of four stations in water depths exceeding 250 meters. Consideration of the effects of climatic variations suggests that they may not seriously affect the values for heat flow obtained by this method. The values measured are in reasonable agreement with other continental values in the shield areas.
