A newly completed tropical Pacific atmosphere-ocean observing system documented this El Niño from its rapid onset to its sudden demise in greater detail than was ever before possible. The unprecedented measurements challenge existing theories about El Niño–related climate swings and suggest why climate forecast models underpredicted the strength of the El Niño before its onset."
https://openalex.org/W2083519852,"Long, continuous, marine sediment records from the subpolar North Atlantic document the glacial modulation of regional climate instability throughout the past 0.5 million years. Whenever ice sheet size surpasses a critical threshold indicated by the benthic oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) value of 3.5 per mil during each of the past five glaciation cycles, indicators of iceberg discharge and sea-surface temperature display dramatically larger amplitudes of millennial-scale variability than when ice sheets are small. Sea-surface temperature oscillations of 1° to 2°C increase in size to approximately 4° to 6°C, and catastrophic iceberg discharges begin alternating repeatedly with brief quiescent intervals. The glacial growth associated with this amplification threshold represents a relatively small departure from the modern ice sheet configuration and sea level. Instability characterizes nearly all observed climate states, with the exception of a limited range of baseline conditions that includes the current Holocene interglacial."

Here, RAD30 is shown to encode a DNA polymerase that can replicate efficiently past a thymine-thymine cis-syn cyclobutane dimer, a lesion that normally blocks DNA polymerases. When incubated in vitro with all four nucleotides, Rad30 incorporates two adenines opposite the thymine-thymine dimer. Rad30 is the seventh eukaryotic DNA polymerase to be described and hence is named DNA polymerase eta."

Subsequent generation of free radicals with a conventional water-based redox reaction leads to chemical cross-linking of the PB cores without disruption of the cylindrical morphology, as evidenced by cryotransmission electron microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering experiments. These wormlike rubber micelles exhibit unusual viscoelastic properties in water."
https://openalex.org/W2055326419,"The ETR1 receptor from Arabidopsis binds the gaseous hormone ethylene. A copper ion associated with the ethylene-binding domain is required for high-affinity ethylene-binding activity. A missense mutation in the domain that renders the plant insensitive to ethylene eliminates both ethylene binding and the interaction of copper with the receptor. A sequence from the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain 6803 that shows homology to the ethylene-binding domain of ETR1 encodes a functional ethylene-binding protein. On the basis of sequence conservation between the Arabidopsis and the cyanobacterial ethylene-binding domains and on in vitro mutagenesis of ETR1, a structural model for this copper-based ethylene sensor domain is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2061776631,Erythropoietin and other cytokine receptors are thought to be activated through hormone-induced dimerization and autophosphorylation of JAK kinases associated with the receptor intracellular domains. An in vivo protein fragment complementation assay was used to obtain evidence for an alternative mechanism in which unliganded erythropoietin receptor dimers exist in a conformation that prevents activation of JAK2 but then undergo a ligand-induced conformation change that allows JAK2 to be activated. These results are consistent with crystallographic evidence of distinct dimeric configurations for unliganded and ligand-bound forms of the erythropoietin receptor.

Single zeolite A crystals nucleated in amorphous gel particles of 40 to 80 nanometers within 3 days at room temperature. The resulting nanoscale single crystals (10 to 30 nanometers) were embedded in the amorphous gel particles. The gel particles were consumed during further crystal growth at room temperature, forming a colloidal suspension of zeolite A nanocrystals of 40 to 80 nanometers. On heating this suspension at 80°C, solution-mediated transport resulted in additional substantial crystal growth."

The pores in the colloidal crystals were filled with divinylbenzene (DVB), ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EDMA), or a mixture of the two. Polymerization and subsequent dissolution of the silica template leaves a polycrystalline network of interconnected pores. When mixtures of DVB and EDMA are used, the pore size of the polymer replicas can be varied continuously between 35 and 15 nanometers because the polymer shrinks when the silica template is removed."
https://openalex.org/W2070921472,"Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is thought to be activated by ligand-induced homodimerization. However, structures of agonist and antagonist peptide complexes of EPOR, as well as an EPO-EPOR complex, have shown that the actual dimer configuration is critical for the biological response and signal efficiency. The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of EPOR in its unliganded form at 2.4 angstrom resolution has revealed a dimer in which the individual membrane-spanning and intracellular domains would be too far apart to permit phosphorylation by JAK2. This unliganded EPOR dimer is formed from self-association of the same key binding site residues that interact with EPO-mimetic peptide and EPO ligands. This model for a preformed dimer on the cell surface provides insights into the organization, activation, and plasticity of recognition of hematopoietic cell surface receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2142089485,"Glucose metabolism in glycolysis and in mitochondria is pivotal to glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. One or more factors derived from glycolysis other than pyruvate appear to be required for the generation of mitochondrial signals that lead to insulin secretion. The electrons of the glycolysis-derived reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are transferred to mitochondria through the NADH shuttle system. By abolishing the NADH shuttle function, glucose-induced increases in NADH autofluorescence, mitochondrial membrane potential, and adenosine triphosphate content were reduced and glucose-induced insulin secretion was abrogated. The NADH shuttle evidently couples glycolysis with activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism to trigger insulin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1974012392,"An alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin–hydrolyzing protease particle copurifying with 26 S proteasomes was isolated and identified as tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII), a cytosolic subtilisin-like peptidase of unknown function. The particle is larger than the 26 S proteasome and has a rod-shaped, dynamic supramolecular structure. TPPII exhibits enhanced activity in proteasome inhibitor–adapted cells and degrades polypeptides by exo- as well as predominantly trypsin-like endoproteolytic cleavage. TPPII may thus participate in extralysosomal polypeptide degradation and may in part account for nonproteasomal epitope generation as postulated for certain major histocompatibility complex class I alleles. In addition, TPPII may be able to substitute for some metabolic functions of the proteasome."

New evidence from two nuclear genes, and analyses of mitochondrial DNA and 22 additional nuclear genes, join crocodilians with turtles and place squamates at the base of the tree. Morphological and paleontological evidence for this molecular phylogeny is unclear. Molecular time estimates support a Triassic origin for the major groups of living reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W1524184093,"Several lines of evidence have supported a link betweeen adipose tissue and immunocompetent cells. This link is illustrated in obesity, where excess adiposity and impaired immune function have been described in both humans and genetically obese rodents. In addition, numerous factors involved in inflammatory response are secreted by both preadipocytes and macrophages. Here we show that proliferating preadipocytes in cell lines and primary cultures, develop phagocytic activity toward microorganisms. This is demonstrated by phagocytosis assays and confocal microscopy. This function disappears when preadipocytes stop proliferating and differentiate into adipocytes. After phagocytosis, preadipocytes show microbicide activity via an oxygen-dependent mechanism. In addition, preadipocytes as well as adipocytes are stained with MOMA-2, a marker of monocyte-macrophage lineage, but are negative for specific mature macrophage markers (F4/80 and Mac-1). These results suggest that preadipocytes could function as macro-phage-like cells and raise the possibility of a potential direct involvement of adipose tissue in inflammatory processes.—Cousin, B., Munoz, O., André, M., Fontanilles, A.

https://openalex.org/W1576683498,"A diet supplemented with (R)-lipoic acid, a mitochondrial coenzyme, was fed to old rats to determine its efficacy in reversing the decline in metabolism seen with age. Young (3 to 5 months) and old (24 to 26 months) rats were fed an AIN-93M diet with or without (R)-lipoic acid (0.5% w/w) for 2 wk, killed, and their liver parenchymal cells were isolated. Hepatocytes from untreated old rats vs. young controls had significantly lower oxygen consumption (P<0. 03) and mitochondrial membrane potential. (R)-Lipoic acid supplementation reversed the age-related decline in O2 consumption and increased (P<0.03) mitochondrial membrane potential. Ambulatory activity, a measure of general metabolic activity, was almost threefold lower in untreated old rats vs. controls, but this decline was reversed (P<0.005) in old rats fed (R)-lipoic acid. The increase of oxidants with age, as measured by the fluorescence produced on oxidizing 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin, was significantly lowered in (R)-lipoic acid supplemented old rats (P<0.01). Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were increased fivefold with age in cells from unsupplemented rats. Feeding rats the (R)-lipoic acid diet reduced MDA levels markedly (P<0.01). Both glutathione and ascorbic acid levels declined in hepatocytes with age, but their loss was completely reversed with (R)-lipoic acid supplementation. Thus, (R)-lipoic acid supplementation improves indices of metabolic activity as well as lowers oxidative stress and damage evident in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2087847636,"The hunting behavior of a marine mammal was studied beneath the Antarctic fast ice with an animal-borne video system and data recorder. Weddell seals stalked large Antarctic cod and the smaller subice fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki, often with the under-ice surface for backlighting, which implies that vision is important for hunting. They approached to within centimeters of cod without startling the fish. Seals flushed P. borchgrevinki by blowing air into subice crevices or pursued them into the platelet ice. These observations highlight the broad range of insights that are possible with simultaneous recordings of video, audio, three-dimensional dive paths, and locomotor effort."
https://openalex.org/W2132837448,"Epidemiological data consistently show that reduced levels of serum albumin, which is the most abundant protein in plasma, are associated with an increased mortality risk. Various biological properties evidenced by direct effects of the albumin molecule may explain its beneficial effects. The present work aimed to investigate in vitro whether glycation or free radicals or both factors would affect the antioxidant properties of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Glycation was performed by long-term incubations (60 days) of BSA with increasing concentrations of glucose (up to 500 mmol/l) at 37°C. Minimally oxidized BSA was obtained after controlled incubations of dialyzed BSA samples with a water-soluble free radical generator [2,2′ azo-bis(2-amidinopropane) HCl]. The glycation-mediated modifications and the free radical-induced conformational changes of BSA were monitored using intrinsic fluorescence measurements of the tryptophan residues and acrylamide as a quenching agent. Thiol groups, Amadori glycophore contents, and boronate binding were also measured. We found that the changes observed in the conformation of the BSA molecule were associated with modifications of its antioxidant properties. The latter were studied by the copper-mediated oxidation of human low density lipoproteins and the free radical-induced blood hemolysis test. Our data support the concept that oxidative-induced BSA modifications are important determinants in the antioxidant properties of BSA. Glycated BSA still behaved as an antioxidant but became pro-oxidant in the presence of copper, probably by generating oxygenated species. These data confirm the key role of metals ions in this process. Although these results warrant further in vivo investigations, we propose that, considering the poor glucose control found in diabetics as well as the key role of oxidative stress in vascular complications, glycation-mediated and free radical-induced impairment of the antioxidant properties of albumin might be important parameters in vascular complications encountered in diabetes.—Bourdon, E., Loreau, N., Blache, D.

Mediator alone appeared compact, but at high pH or in the presence of RNA polymerase II it displayed an extended conformation. Holoenzyme contained Mediator in a fully extended state, partially enveloping the globular polymerase, with points of apparent contact in the vicinity of the polymerase carboxyl-terminal domain and the DNA-binding channel. A similarity in appearance and conformational behavior of yeast and murine complexes indicates a conservation of Mediator structure among eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1583862506,"Apoptosis is activated during the early phase of reperfusion after liver ischemia and after liver transplantation in animals. However, the molecular basis of ischemia-induced cell death remains poorly understood. In this study we show that hepatocytes from ischemic liver lobes undergo apoptosis after reperfusion. In vivo pretreatment of rats with a specific inhibitor of caspases abrogates the apoptotic response in ischemic liver lobes. Inhibition of apoptosis can be accounted for by total inhibition of caspase activation as assessed in an enzymatic assay and by specific affinity labeling. Treatment with a caspase inhibitor fully protects rats from death induced by ischemia/ reperfusion. These findings indicate that liver injury after ischemia/reperfusion can be prevented by inhibition of caspases. Thus, caspase inhibitors may have important therapeutic implications in liver ischemic diseases and after liver transplantation.—Cursio, R., Gugenheim, J., RicciJ, E., Crenesse, D., Rostagno, P., Maulon, L., Saint-Paul, M.-C., Ferrua, B., Auberger, P.

https://openalex.org/W2008653125,"DNA replication initiator proteins bind site specifically to origin sites and in most cases participate in the early steps of unwinding the duplex. The papillomavirus preinitiation complex that assembles on the origin of replication is composed of proteins E1 and the activator protein E2. E2 is an ancillary factor that increases the affinity of E1 for the ori site through cooperative binding. Here we show that duplex DNA affects E1 (in the absence of E2) to assemble into an active hexameric structure. As a 10-base oligonucleotide can also induce this oligomerization, it seems likely that DNA binding allosterically induces a conformation that enhances hexamers. E1 assembles as a bi-lobed, presumably double hexameric structure on duplex DNA and can initiate bi-directional unwinding from an ori site. The DNA takes an apparent straight path through the double hexamers. Image analysis of E1 hexameric rings shows that the structures are heterogeneous and have either a 6- or 3-fold symmetry. The rings are about 40–50 Å thick and 125 Å in diameter. The density of the central cavity appears to be a variable and we speculate that a plugged center may represent a conformational flexibility of a subdomain of the monomer, to date unreported for other hexameric helicases.

The synthesis of duplex DNA is a complex enzymatic process that requires the coordination of large numbers of proteins. The mechanisms are elaborate in part because the enzymes that use the complementary template strand as a guide for nucleotide incorporation catalyze this synthesis only in the 5′ to 3′ direction. Given the antiparallel nature of the duplex this usually requires that two synthetic enzymes move in opposite polarities on the two strands. Synthesis of the so-called lagging strand is discontinuous and requires the cyclical association of the enzyme, while synthesis of the other strand is continuous. Nevertheless, in many prokaryote replication systems it is clear that coordination of these enzymes is achieved and maintained by a dimeric polymerase that creates a looped DNA structure in the lagging strand. This loop is mediated by multiple protein-protein interactions across the growing fork (Ref. 1Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, and references therein). Helicases are enzymes that can catalyze the unwinding of the template strands ahead of the fork, thus allowing for new complementary strand DNA synthesis. They were initially discovered as ancillary factors required for synthesis, but recently this view of the helicase activity has been characterized as “naive” or at least incomplete (2West S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 180-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence has been presented demonstrating that the helicase is an integral member of a large protein complex that serves as a molecular motor or pump for the replication apparatus empowering the polymerase and increasing the rate of DNA polymerase synthesis (3Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). TheEscherichia coli dnaB helicase also plays a critical function in establishing the asymmetry at the growing fork. The helicase tracks on the lagging strand template but through interactions it holds the leading strand DNA polymerase while allowing for recycling of the other DNA polymerase (4Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). How helicases actually convert the binding and hydrolysis of ATP into mechanical energy resulting in DNA unwinding and can concomitantly achieve relative movement along the DNA is presently under intense investigation (5Lohman T.M. Thorn K. Vale R.D. Cell. 1998; 93: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Marians K.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1129-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). While many issues remain unresolved, it seems as if the well studied replication helicases of E. coli (and its phage encoded ones) engage DNA by encircling at least one of the DNA strands that have been prepared for this loading by other replication proteins (7Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, the dnaB helicase is loaded onto DNA in complex with dnaC to a duplex structure at oriC already melted by the dnaA protein (11Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, despite the ubiquitous presence of many DNA helicases (12Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), little is known about the relationship between such enzymes and the replication complex. However, the importance of such proteins in eukaryotic DNA replication is highlighted by the fact that many DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus encode a helicase. One type of such viral helicase can initiate unwinding from within duplex structures not prepared for activity by prior melting. These helicases encoded by the herpes simplex virus, papillomaviruses or the SV40, and polyoma viruses can serve as DNA initiators by first recognizing small repeat motifs within the origin of replication. Thus, a particularly challenging structural problem exists in determining how these proteins convert from a site-specific DNA binding mode to a helicase. For the SV40 T antigen, monomers bind to pentameric base pair repeats utilizing specific nucleotide base information. After double hexamer formation on the DNA and ATP binding DNA-protein contacts shift toward sugar-phosphate interactions (13SenGupta D.J. Borowiec J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A complex series of steps must therefore occur to change both the oligomeric state of the protein and the nature of its contacts with DNA. Presumably, both the DNA and ATP could be allosteric effectors of this change, but in the case of T antigen ATP is sufficient for hexamer formation. Similarly for the HSV-1 origin binding protein UL9 a pair of dimers interact with each other and bend the ori region as duplex DNA-binding proteins. In the presence of ATP the complex becomes an active unwinding enzyme that can extrude catenated single-stranded loops (14Makhov A. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The papillomaviruses provide a unique system for analyzing this assembly and transition process. The bovine papilloma virus type 1 (BPV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: BPV, bovine papiloma virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; SSB, single stranded-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: BPV, bovine papiloma virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; SSB, single stranded-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. encodes a 68-kDa phosphoprotein (E1) that binds site specifically to two sets of short repeats organized as inverted repeats at the viral origin of replication (15Chen G.

The protein is also an ATPase (17MacPherson P. Thorner L. Botchan M.R. Virology. 1994; 204: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and a helicase able to initiate unwinding from within a duplex DNA circle (18Seo Y.-S. Muller F. Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, unlike UL9 or the SV40 T antigen, E1 requires in vivo an ancillary viral factor in order to be targeted to the viral origin of replication (20Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6218-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The E1 protein in a cell-free DNA replication system can direct origin-specific DNA replication; however, this activity is greatly stimulated by E2 and at limiting dilutions of E1 the in vitro DNA replication becomes absolutely dependent upon E2 (22Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This dependence upon E2 reflects the cooperative interaction between E1 and E2 in binding to viral DNA (22Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Seo Y.S. Muller F. Lusky M. Gibbs E. Kim H.-Y. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The E2·E1·DNA complex initially assembled at the origin consists of two or four monomers of E1 spanning the inverted repeats and an E2 dimer occupying an adjacent binding site (15Chen G. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the E2 dimer must leave this complex in an ATP-dependent reaction before higher-order complexes of E1 assemble (26Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems as if E2 might stabilize the site-specific DNA binding conformation of E1 and either mask or allosterically block the helicase transition.In vivo, this chaperone process seems likely to have evolved to increase the likelihood of origin occupancy and perhaps to allow for the coordination of other activities of E1 with the transcriptional and segregation functions of E2 (28Lehman C.W. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4338-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Skiadopoulos M.H. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In any case understanding the differences between the E1 assembled in the preinitiation E1·E2 complex and as an active helicase on the DNA should provide insights into the transitions that must occur for all of the viral initiator proteins discussed above. E1 is believed to be structurally related to the SV40/polyoma virus-encoded large T antigens. Both helicases track on the leading strand template (23Seo Y.S. Muller F. Lusky M. Gibbs E. Kim H.-Y.

For instance, the nuclear localization domain is proximal to the site-specific DNA-binding domain and the conserved “Walker” A and B boxes of the ATP-binding domains are equivalently spaced and are about 200 amino acids displaced from the DNA-binding domain (30Park P. Yang L. Wang T. Botchan M.R. Mohr I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8700-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations of these conserved motifs affect activity in expected ways (17MacPherson P. Thorner L. Botchan M.R. Virology. 1994; 204: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Lentz M.R. Pak D. Mohr I. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mansky K.C. Batiza A. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7600-7608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, many of these alignments can now be made for other members of the SF3 family of DNA helicases that do not have analogous activities such as those from parvoviruses and the human herpes 6 virus (33Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to analyze how E1 as an active unwinding enzyme actually engages DNA. In this report we use both biochemical and electron microscopy techniques to establish that E1 initiates unwinding from the origin site and unwinds DNA bidirectionally; moreover a bi-lobed double hexameric complex similar to the images obtained for T antigen was observed at the start site. In these complexes the DNA is likely to take a straight path through the double rings. Biochemical and electron microscopic analysis showed that, as anticipated, unwinding activity correlates with the formation of hexamers. Image analysis of the hexameric structures showed that the molecules do form toroidal rings with a central hole; these molecules possess either 3- or 6-fold symmetries. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the hexamers show density in the central hole. Such “filled” centers have not been observed for other hexameric helicases but we speculate that the protein has several conformational states and that conformational flexibility may indeed be a general feature of this family. pKSO has been described previously (22Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). pSS3, pSS3-LI5C, and pSS3-Δopal are described by Mendoza et al. (16Mendoza R. Gandhi L. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BPV-1 origin containing fragment generated by BamHI andHindIII restriction enzyme digest of pKSO was inserted into the pACYC177 vector linearized by BamHI andHindIII to give rise to pCLO. The 429-base pair BPV-1 origin containing substrate DNA used in the fragment unwinding assay and for DNA induced E1 oligomerization was generated by digesting pKSO with theEcoRI and PvuII restriction endonucleases. The 242-base pair origin containing DNA fragment used in EM linear compaction studies was generated by digesting pKSO withEcoRI and BamHI restriction endonucleases. Both of the duplex fragments were purified from agarose gels. The sequence of the 10-base pair oligomer used for DNA induced E1 oligomerization is 5′-AACAACAATC-3′. The E1 construct used for overexpression in E. coli, pGEX-2TK-E1, was generated by cloning the E1 open reading frame from the pET11-GST-E1 plasmid (25Sedman T. Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2887-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia number 27-4587-01, GenBank accession number U13851). The integrity of the boundaries for the E1 coding sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The BPV-1 E1 protein was purified from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expression vector by immunoaffinity chromatography as described by Yang et al. (22Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The E1 protein purified from E. coli began with transforming XA90 cells with the pGEX-2TK-E1 expression vector and proceeded according to methods described by Sedman et al.(25Sedman T. Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2887-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by C. Sanders. 2C. Sanders, personal communication. In brief, extracts from isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells were prepared, cleared of nucleic acid by a Polymin P (10% w/v) precipitation (0.5% w/v final) centrifuged by a 25,000 ×g spin for 20 min. E1 protein in the supernatants was precipitated by 65% ammonium sulfate at 4° C. The recovered protein was purified by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads and eluted in buffer containing 20 nm glutathione. The GST moiety was cleaved with thrombin and the E1 was further purified by chromatography on an S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). The E1 containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against E1 dialysis buffer (20 mmpKPO4, pH 7.5), 150 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol aliquoted, and stored at −80° C. The unwinding reactions using either covalently closed circular DNA or duplex DNA fragment substrates were performed as described previously (19Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Unwinding reactions using substrates indicated in the text were incubated at 32° C for 1 h. Micrographs of linearized DNA were prepared by adding 6 units of the indicated restriction enzyme and incubating for an additional 20 min. Reaction products were fixed by the addition of glutaraldehyde to 0.6% and purified by filtration through a 0.5-ml Bio-Gel A5-M column (Bio-Rad) and applied to glow-discharged carbon grids coated with 2 mm spermidine. The grids were then rotary shadowed with tungsten. Photographs were taken at × 30,000 with a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV (61Dodson M. Echols H. Wickner S. Alfano C. Mensa-Wilmot K. Gomes B. Lebowitz J. Roberts J.D. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7638-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Micrographs of E1 complexes bound to a BPV-1 origin containing DNA fragment for linear compaction studies were prepared using the same method described above. Measurement of duplex regions was performed by projecting photographic negatives onto a Numonics digitizing tablet. The E1 protein (3 mmconcentration, in 25 mm KPO4, 60 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) was incubated with 18 mm of a 60-mer oligonucleotide for 30 min at 30° C, and then applied to glow-discharged grids and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were recorded under minimal dose conditions (with no prior exposure to the high magnification electron beam prior to recording) at × 30,000 magnification, using a JEOL 1200 EXII microscope. Negatives were scanned with a Leaf 45 microdensitometer, with a sampling interval of 4 Å/pixel. Images of rings were masked into 44 × 44 pixel arrays (corresponding to 176 × 176 Å), band-pass filtered (between 1/160 and 1/12 Å−1), scaled to zero mean density, and the contrast was normalized. After applying a reference-free alignment (44Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), images were ranked by the strength of either the 3- or 6-fold power, as described in Yu et al. (39Yu X. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For the 6-fold ranking, we excluded those images that contained a significant 3-fold power. After sorting based upon rotational symmetry, images were then sorted based upon the strength of the integrated density within a 16-Å radius area at the rotational axis of the ring. The 7 amino acid NH2-terminal tag on the E1 purified from overexertion inE. coli contains a recognition sequence as well as a serine that can be specifically phosphorylated by bovine heart muscle kinase. A typical 30-μl labeling reaction contains 2.5 μg of E1 (1.3 μm final), 10 units of bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma P-2645), and 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP at 6000 Ci/mm in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT. The reaction is incubated at 4° C for 30 min and stopped with the addition of EDTA to 25 mm. E1 was purified away from free 32P and nucleotides by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography (NAP-10 column, Pharmacia number 17-0854-02). Native gel electrophoresis of E1 was performed as indicated in the text. For analysis of cross-linked E1 complexes, the E1 sample was boiled for 5 min in Laemmli SDS loading buffer (pH 8.8) + 130 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then loaded onto polyacrylamide gradient gels containing an acrylamide:bis ratio of 80:1. A stacking phase was not used and electrophoresis was carried out in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS with a final pH of 8.8. Current was held constant at 10 mA. E1 purified from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus was centrifuged in a 15–35% glycerol gradient with 0.1 KCl-HEMG + 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (62Heberlein U. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 331: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For E1 purified from overexpression in E. coli, the protein was centrifuged as above with the following modification: a gradient of 15–37% glycerol in 1 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 was used. BPV-1 replicates bidirectionally in vivo and in cell-free extracts (22Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 34Schvartzman J. Adolph S. Martin-Parras L. Schildkraut C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3078-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Yang L. Botchan M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5903-5911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With purified replication components wherein E1 provided the only helicase activity (36Muller F. Seo Y.-S. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17086-17094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fully replicated circles were obtained. Furthermore, acting on covalent closed circles, E1 is capable of producing a highly unwound DNA (form U) consistent with complete denaturation of the circles (19Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 23Seo Y.S. Muller F. Lusky M. Gibbs E. Kim H.-Y. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was therefore anticipated that E1 as a replicative helicase must be capable of processive unwinding that spreads bidirectionally from the BPV-1 origin region. Electron microscopy and an in vitro unwinding assay were employed to map both the location and extent of unwinding of BPV-1 genomic DNA by E1. Covalently closed circular DNA was relaxed with calf thymus topoisomerase I and then incubated with purified E1, ATP, topoisomerase I, and E. coli SSB protein. For this analysis, we used the plasmid pSS3 that contains an intact BPV-1 genome cloned into pUC18. The samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde, purified by gel filtration, and linearized by restriction endonuclease hydrolysis at a unique site. Representative images are shown in Fig.1, A-D. The lengths of the unwound regions of DNA and total contour lengths were measured to determine both the size and position of the unwound regions with respect to the entire length. A compilation of data is presented in Fig. 1 E. As each of the molecules could be aligned in either of two directions (and one such orientation chosen for each to make the alignment) it was necessary to repeat this analysis with a different unique single cutter. This separate set increases the statistical significance of the conclusions. Such data obtained with eitherAflII or SacI defining the ends (Fig.1 E) show that unwinding initiates at the ori site and that denaturation spreads bidirectionally from that position. These results are compatible with those presented previously by Seoet al. (18Seo Y.-S. Muller F. Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), who showed that E1-dependent formation of form U was dependent upon the integrity of ori. However, our earlier results (19Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) on form U production showed little dependence upon origin sequences, a result that might predict scattered bubble positions. With different preparations of the E1 protein we performedin vitro unwinding assays with various mutant templates. Mutations were engineered into the E1-binding site to determine whether the E1 DNA-binding site contributed quantitatively to the level of form U DNA produced. Two mutants were derived from the plasmid pSS3; LI5C contains a 5-base pair linker insertion between the inverted repeat, and for Δ OPAL the entire palindrome is deleted. The reaction products for each were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to filters, and probed with pUC18. PhosphorImage analysis of these Southern blots was used to determine the amount of form U DNA generated (Fig. 2). The data do show that while all substrates are capable of directing unwinding the wild type ori site is indeed preferred. It therefore seems likely that when a template contains a bona fide ori with E1 sites organized in such a way as to allow for helicase formation, such sites will be utilizedin vitro. We do not understand why such preferences were not detected earlier, but perhaps this specificity is sensitive to monomer E1 concentration and variations in this regard might influence the data. To determine the oligomeric states of E1 we analyzed the sedimentation profiles of the baculovirus-purified E1 incubated in the presence and absence of ATP. Fractions from a glycerol gradient were collected, and the positions of the E1 protein determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal E1 antisera. The protein profiles of the gradients (Fig.3) indicate that E1 purified by single step affinity chromatography sediments in a heterogeneous manner. In addition, it is clear from this analysis that ATP is not sufficient for the oligomerization of E1 monomers. The molecular mass markers suggest that the slowest migrating peak corresponds to monomeric E1 (68 kDa) and the second peak a hexameric form (408 kDa). Fractions at the bottom of the tube likely correspond to aggregates. Glycerol gradient fractions containing the putative hexamer fraction and monomer fractions were analyzed by electron microscopy. The images of the putative hexamer peak showed a typical 6-membered toroidal structure (Fig. 3) bearing striking similarity to the published micrographs of hexameric helicases (8Egelman E.H. Yu X.

J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The monomeric peak showed no such structures (data not shown). Protein preparations from baculovirus vectors showed a mixture of forms, and to study a more homogeneous population and to investigate the relationship between the monomer and hexamer forms in more detail, we purified E1 from E. coli cells using the methods described by Sedman et al. (25Sedman T. Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2887-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indications from spectrophotometric 280/260 absorption ratios for baculovirus E1 preparations were that the yields of hexameric peaks and aggregated material correlated with trace nucleic acid contaminations. We therefore explored the notion that DNA binding might be a factor in oligomerization. The E. coli E1 possesses an amino-terminal sequence which can be phosphorylated to high specific activity in vitro; such modification has no effect upon helicase activity or other biochemical tests described below (data not shown). The purified material sedimented as a homogeneous monomeric fraction (Fig.4 B). Moreover, this protein's sedimentation behavior was not affected by ATP binding.

https://openalex.org/W1536803321,"CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein widely expressed in vertebrate cells, is a bifunctional ectoenzyme catalyzing the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). cADPR is a universal second messenger that releases calcium from intracellular stores. Since cADPR is generated by CD38 at the outer surface of many cells, where it acts intracellularly, increasing attention is paid to addressing this topological paradox. Recently, we demonstrated that CD38 is a catalytically active, unidirectional transmembrane transporter of cADPR, which then reaches its receptor-operated intracellular calcium stores. Moreover, CD38 was reported to undergo a selective and extensive internalization through non clathrin-coated endocytotic vesicles upon incubating CD38(+) cells with either NAD+ or thiol compounds: these endocytotic vesicles can convert cytosolic NAD into cADPR despite an asymmetric unfavorable orientation that makes the active site of CD38 intravesicular. Here we demonstrate that the cADPR-generating activity of the endocytotic vesicles results in remarkable and sustained increases of intracellular free calcium concentration in different cells exposed to either NAD+, or GSH, or N-acetylcysteine. This effect of CD38-internalizing ligands on intracellular calcium levels was found to involve a two-step mechanism: 1) influx of cytosolic NAD+ into the endocytotic vesicles, mediated by a hitherto unrecognized dinucleotide transport system that is saturable, bidirectional, inhibitable by 8-N3-NAD+, and characterized by poor dinucleotide specificity, low affinity, and high efficiency; 2) intravesicular CD38-catalyzed conversion of NAD+ to cADPR, followed by outpumping of the cyclic nucleotide into the cytosol and subsequent release of calcium from thapsigargin-sensitive stores. This unknown intracellular trafficking of NAD+ and cADPR based on two distinctive and specific transmembrane carriers for either nucleotide can affect the intracellular calcium homeostasis in CD38(+) cells."

https://openalex.org/W1542662403,"The Tie gene encodes an endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinase necessary for normal vascular development. The Tie gene promoter targets expression of heterologous genes specifically to endothelial cells in transgenic mice. Here we have characterized the promoter sequences critical for endothelial cell-specific activity in cultured cells and transgenic mice. Progressive deletions and site-directed mutations of the promoter showed that the critical endothelial cell-specific elements are an octamer transcription factor binding site and several Ets binding sites located in two clusters within 300 bp upstream of the major transcription initiation site. Among members of the Ets transcription factor family tested, NERF-2 (a novel transcription factor related to the ets factor ELF-1), which is expressed in endothelial cells, and ETS2 showed the strongest transactivation of the Tie promoter; ETS1 gave lower levels of stimulation and the other Ets factors gave little or no transactivation. Furthermore, the Tie promoter directed the production of high amounts of human growth hormone into the circulation of transgenic mice. The secreted amounts correlated with transgene copy number, being relatively insensitive to the effects of the transgene integration site. These properties suggest that Tie promoter activity is controlled by endothelial cell Ets factors and that it has potential for use in vectors for endothelial cell-specific gene expression.—Iljin, K., Dube, A., Kontusaari, S., Korhonen, J., Lahtinen, I., Oettgen, P., Alitalo, K.

https://openalex.org/W1933321565,"Overexpression of ‘tissue’ transglutaminase (tTG) in the human neuroblastoma cells increases spontaneous apoptosis and renders these cells highly susceptible to death induced by various stimuli. We used immunoprecipitation to identify cellular proteins that interact specifically with tTG in SK-N-BE(2)-derived stable transfectants. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that tTG binding proteins have molecular masses of 110, 50, 22, 14, and 12 kDa. Microsequencing and computer search analyses allowed us to identify these polypeptides as the β-tubulin (50 kDa), the histone H2B (14 kDa), and two GST P1-1-truncated forms (22 and 12 kDa). The specificity of the interaction between tTG and these proteins was confirmed by competing tTG binding with purified enzyme and by detecting tTG in immunoprecipitates obtained using β-tubulin or GST P1-1 mAb's. Here we demonstrate that the GST P1-1 acts as an efficient acyl donor as well as acceptor tTG substrate both in cells and in vitro. The tTG-catalyzed polymerization of GST P1-1 leads to its functional inactivation and is competitively inhibited by GSH. By contrast, the tTG-β-tubulin interaction does not result in the cross-linking of this cytoskeletal protein, which suggests that microtubules act as the anchorage site for tTG and GST P1-1 interaction.—Piredda, L., Farrace, M.

Here we exploit the cyclic growth and regression activity of the murine hair follicle to explore potential nonneuronal functions of neurotrophins in the skin, and analyze the follicular expression and hair growth-modulatory function of BDNF, NT-4, and their high-affinity receptor, TrkB. The cutaneous expression of BDNF and NT-4 mRNA was strikingly hair cycle dependent and peaked during the spontaneous, apoptosis-driven hair follicle regression (catagen). During catagen, BDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity, as well as NT-4-immunoreactivity, were expressed in the regressing hair follicle compartments, whereas TrkB mRNA and immunoreactivity were seen in dermal papilla fibroblasts, epithelial strand, and hair germ. BDNF or NT-4 knockout mice showed significant catagen retardation, whereas BDNF-overexpressing mice displayed acceleration of catagen and significant shortening of hair length. Finally, BDNF and NT-4 accelerated catagen development in murine skin organ culture. Together, our data suggest that BDNF and NT-4 play a previously unrecognized role in skin physiology as agents of hair growth control. Thus, TrkB agonists and antagonists deserve exploration as novel hair growth-modulatory drugs for the management of common hair growth disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1569626229,"In adult mammalian cardiomyocytes, stimulation of muscarinic receptors counterbalances the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in myocardial contractility and heart rate by decreasing the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) (1, 2). This effect is mediated via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent reduction of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (3). Little is known, however, about the nature and origin of this pivotal inhibitory pathway. Using embryonic stem cells as an in vitro model of cardiomyogenesis, we found that muscarinic agonists depress ICa by 58 +/-3% (n=34) in early stage cardiomyocytes lacking functional beta-adrenoceptors. The cholinergic inhibition is mediated by the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP system since it was abolished by application of NOS inhibitors (L-NMA, L-NAME), an inhibitor of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (ODQ), and a selective phosphodiesterase type II antagonist (EHNA). The NO/cGMP-mediated ICa depression was dependent on a reduction of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) levels since application of the catalytic subunit of PKA or of the PKA inhibitor PK) prevented the carbachol effect. In late development stage cells, as reported for ventricular cardiomyocytes (2, 4), muscarinic agonists had no effect on basal ICa but antagonized beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated ICa by 43 +/-4% (n=16). This switch in signaling pathways during development is associated with distinct changes in expression of the two NO-producing isoenzymes, eNOS and iNOS, respectively. These findings indicate a fundamental role for NO as a signaling molecule during early embryonic development and demonstrate a switch in the signaling cascades governing ICa regulation."

Fisher 344 rats were used to test wound healing responses in the orbiting Space Shuttle Endeavour by preflight implantation of polyvinyl acetal sponge disks in which pellets were placed to release either platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or placebo. Control groups on the ground included a matched environment group in similar housing modules and temperature control groups in cages at 22°C and 28°C. After 12 days of implantation and 10 days in orbit, the removed sponges were analyzed for histological and biochemical responses. Growth factor responses were histologically evident after release of PDGF-BB and bFGF in ground controls, whereas only immediate-release bFGF and delayed-release PDGF-BB showed significant responses in microgravity. Biochemical data confirmed that cellularity was increased by both factors in ground sponges; however, this response was significantly blunted in flight sponges (P<0.005, ANOVA), irrespective timing of factor release. Collagen content was 62% lower in sponges from animals with 10 days of microgravity exposure (P<0.01, ANOVA) and further reduced by bFGF.

https://openalex.org/W2095571987,"Ferritin and transferrin receptor expression is post-transcriptionally regulated by a conserved mRNA sequence termed the iron-responsive element (IRE), to which a transacting protein called the iron-regulatory protein (IRP) is bound. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia powerfully enhances IRE/IRP-1 binding in human cell lines. Using the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B as a model, we found that 16 h in a 1% oxygen atmosphere markedly increases IRE/IRP-1 binding as assessed by electromobility shift assay. Hypoxia also decreased cytosolic aconitase activity. The hypoxia-enhanced IRE/IRP-1 binding stabilized the transferrin receptor message, increased the cellular mRNA content by over 10-fold, and doubled surface receptor expression. Simultaneously, hypoxia suppressed ferritin message translation. Hypoxia's effect was most strikingly depicted by the absence of ferritin synthesis in cells challenged with inorganic iron. Our results contrast with previously reported data (Hanson, E. S., and Leibold, E. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 7588–7593) in which a 3% oxygen atmosphere reduced IRE/IRP-1 binding in rat hepatoma cells. We discuss some possible reasons for the differences. In aggregate with other investigations involving responses to hypoxia, iron, or nitric oxide, our data indicate that cellular iron metabolic responses are complex and that IRE/IRP-1 interactions vary between cell lines and perhaps between species. Ferritin and transferrin receptor expression is post-transcriptionally regulated by a conserved mRNA sequence termed the iron-responsive element (IRE), to which a transacting protein called the iron-regulatory protein (IRP) is bound.

Simultaneously, hypoxia suppressed ferritin message translation. Hypoxia's effect was most strikingly depicted by the absence of ferritin synthesis in cells challenged with inorganic iron. Our results contrast with previously reported data (Hanson, E. S., and Leibold, E. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 7588–7593) in which a 3% oxygen atmosphere reduced IRE/IRP-1 binding in rat hepatoma cells. We discuss some possible reasons for the differences. In aggregate with other investigations involving responses to hypoxia, iron, or nitric oxide, our data indicate that cellular iron metabolic responses are complex and that IRE/IRP-1 interactions vary between cell lines and perhaps between species. Iron is a key element in cellular growth and metabolism. The element is part of the active site of many enzymes, often as a component of heme or as part of an iron-sulfur complex (1Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As an enzyme prosthetic group, iron catalyzes redox reactions involving proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. The ability of the element to exist in either of two stable oxidation states (ferric, Fe3+; ferrous, Fe2+) is the key to its enzymatic activity. Unrestrained, however, iron can wreak havoc on cells through the production of reactive intermediates (2Morris C.J. Earl J.R. Trenam C.W. Blake D.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), including the deadly hydroxyl radical (OH·̄). Cellular iron is closely regulated, in part through the actions of the transferrin receptor and ferritin, the proteins of cellular iron uptake and storage, respectively (3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Expression of these two proteins is largely regulated at the post-transcriptional level (4Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). A conserved 28-base sequence termed the iron-responsive element (IRE) 1The abbreviations used are: IRE, iron-responsive element; epo, erythopoietin; IRP, iron-regulatory protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; TfR, transferrin receptor; UTR, untranslated region; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: IRE, iron-responsive element; epo, erythopoietin; IRP, iron-regulatory protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; TfR, transferrin receptor; UTR, untranslated region; bp, base pair(s). exists in the ferritin 5′-UTR, whereas five such elements are located in the transferrin receptor 3′-UTR (5Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The two cytoplasmic iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP-1 and IRP-2) recognize and bind to the IRE (6Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 7Henderson B. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRE/IRP-1 binding in the 5′-UTR blocks message translation. Such binding in the 3′-UTR stabilizes the message against enzymatic degradation (8Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4771-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of IRE/IRP-1 binding is a complex affair (9Rouault T.A. Hentze M.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1988; 241: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Iron modulates IRP-1 binding to IRE elements by forming a 4Fe-4SH cluster within the protein. When the cluster is intact, IRP-1 cannot bind to the IRE and exists free in the cytosol (10Hirling H. Henderson B. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this state, IRP-1 has aconitase activity. In the absence of iron, the 4Fe-4SH cluster collapses, aconitase activity is lost, and IRP-1 acquires IRE binding capacity. Therefore, IRP-1 is a dual function protein, serving alternatively as a cytoplasmic aconitase or as a transacting RNA-binding protein. In contrast to IRP-1, the IRP-2 molecule lacks aconitase activity and is susceptible to proteolytic degradation when it is free in the cytosol (11Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Investigators have described a number of other factors that modify IRE/IRP-1 binding and ferritin synthesis such as H2O2 and nitric oxide (13Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Weis G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic IRP-1 appears to exist in equilibrium between forms that either possess or lack aconitase activity. Ascorbic acid shifts the equilibrium toward aconitase (+) IRP-1 (15Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This creates a thermodynamic “sink” that favors greater IRP-1 release when iron interacts with the IRE/IRP-1 complex. The current work uses the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B to examine the effect of hypoxia on cellular iron metabolism. These cells mimic fetal hepatocytes in many respects and were the first cells shown to produce human erythropoietin in response to hypoxia (16Golberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Their response to hypoxia has been studied extensively, making them an excellent model system. Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1 in Hep3B cells, a universal transcription factor that activates genes needed to adapt to low oxygen tensions (17Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 18Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The expression of HIF-1 (and its DNA binding capacity) increases as the oxygen tension falls, peaking at a 0.5–1% oxygen concentration (19Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that hypoxia promotes powerful IRE/IRP-1 binding in these cells that resists even iron-mediated dissociation. Hypoxia markedly alters the transcription of several genes (17Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), including those encoding erythropoietin (epo) and vascular endothelial growth factor (18Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 19Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol.

The promoters of these genes contain binding sites for HIF-1. Hypoxia changes gene transcription by altering HIF-1 binding (23Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In distinction to these well-established effects of hypoxia, the effect on IRE/IRP-1 interaction is a post-transcriptional phenomenon. Hanson and Leibold (24Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported previously that exposing rat hepatoma cells to a 3% atmosphere decreased IRP-1 binding to the IRE but did not alter IRP-2 binding. We discuss possible reasons for the differences. Human hepatoma Hep3B cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), penicillin/streptomycin, and pyruvate (15Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells at 75% confluence were exposed to hypoxia (1% 02, 5% CO2, and 94% N2) at 37 °C in an Espec triple gas incubator (Tabai-Espec Corp., Osaka, Japan) for different time periods (4 or 16 h) (23Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Control cells were cultured under normoxic conditions (21% 02, 5% CO2, and 74% N2) in a humidified Napco incubator. After hypoxia treatment, the cells were chilled, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline to preserve the hypoxic response, harvested, and used immediately according to the experimental requirement. K562 human erythroleukemia cells were maintained in RPM 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker) and penicillin/streptomycin at a density of 5 × 105cells/ml. Hypoxia treatment was as outlined above. IRP binding to RNA was assessed by electromobility shift assay as described previously (4Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 15Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic cell extracts were prepared from Hep3B or K562 cells grown under conditions of hypoxia or normoxia in the presence or absence of 100 μm desferrioxamine or 10 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate. An excess quantity of [32P]UTP-labeled RNA transcript (from pSPT-fer, a 28-nucleotide fragment encoding the human H-ferritin IRE; a generous gift of Dr. Kühn (25Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar)) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 3 μg of protein of fresh cytoplasmic cell lysate. RNase T1 (1 unit/reaction) and heparin (5 mg/ml) were added sequentially for 10 min each. IRE-IRP-1 complex was analyzed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, as detailed previously (15Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from control or experimentally manipulated cells using a STAT-30 kit from TEL-TES B, Inc. (Friendswood, TX), following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of RNA were separated on an agarose/formaldehyde gel and immobilized to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham, Arlington Height, IL) using a 0.05 N fixation (26Toth I. Rogers J.T. McPhee J.A. Elliott S.M. Abramson S.L. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2846-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The RNA was hybridized with a 600-bppStI fragment of TfR cDNA labeled by the Random primer method according to the supplier's protocol. After hybridization and washing by the method of Church and Gilbert (27Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar), the membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 2 days. The TfR signal was stripped off by boiling the membrane in distilled water for 1 min. The membrane then was reprobed with human l-ferritin cDNA probe (28Constanzo F. Colombo M. Staempfi S. Santoro C. Marone M. Frank R. Delius H. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from Hep3B cells grown under normoxic or hypoxic conditions using a modified version of the protocol of Greenberg and Ziff (29Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 107 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 4 ml of hypotonic solution (5 mNaCl, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mMgCl2, and 1 μl/ml β-mercapthoethanol) for 15 min on ice, followed by 0.1% Triton and 140 mm KCl. The cells were homogenized, and the nuclei were collected after repeated centrifugation. The newly synthesized RNA was labeled with [32P]UTP and hybridized to a nitrocellulose membrane containing the coding region of ferritin L chains (28Constanzo F. Colombo M. Staempfi S. Santoro C. Marone M. Frank R. Delius H. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), TfR (25Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), or epo (22Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). After a 72-h hybridization at room temperature, the membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC/0.2% SDS for 20 min and 0.2× SSC/0.2% SDS for 40 min at 68 °C and exposed to x-ray film for 3 days. Cytosolic aconitase activity was assessed by the consumption of cis-aconitate as measured by the spectrophotometric absorbance at 240 nm (as detailed previously in Ref. 15Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondrial-free lysates from Hep3B cells grown under conditions of hypoxia or normoxia (50 μg) were incubated with 200 μm cis-aconitate in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin at room temperature in a volume of 1 ml. Specific activity (μm substrate converted/mg protein/min) was calculated as described by Emery-Goodman et al. (30Emery-Goodman A. Hirling H. Scarpellino L. Henderson B. Kühn L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of cytosolic ferritin was determined using a Coat-A-Count Ferritin IRMA assay kit whose limit of ferritin detectability is 0.1 ng/ml (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Briefly, 106 cells/assay were harvested, washed, and solubilized in a detergent buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Ferritin was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody to the L subunit and detected with a second antibody labeled with 125I. To assess ferritin biosynthesis, 106 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in methionine-free medium (RPMI 1640 or α-minimum essential medium, without serum) supplemented with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The cells were washed and solubilized in the lysis buffer (above), and the newly synthesized ferritin subunits were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody against ferritin. The ferritin subunits were separated on SDS-phosphate-urea gel and visualized by autoradiography (26Toth I. Rogers J.T. McPhee J.A. Elliott S.M. Abramson S.L. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2846-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were chilled to 4 °C and incubated for 1 h with125I-labeled transferrin at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500 nm (30Emery-Goodman A. Hirling H. Scarpellino L. Henderson B. Kühn L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plates were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in situ in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured. A parallel set of cells was incubated with125I-labeled transferrin along with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled transferrin to assess nonspecific binding. Scatchard analysis provided the number of receptor sites/cell as well as the binding affinity. The total transferrin receptor pool was determined by solubilizing the cells in detergent buffer and removing the insoluble debris by centrifugation. A 150-μl aliquot of cell extract was incubated with 50 μl of 125I-labeled transferrin (0.5–500 nm) for 30 min with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 250 μl of ice-cold 60% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate containing the transferrin/transferrin receptor complex was pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and assessed for radioactivity using a gamma counter (31Schonhorn J.E. Akompong T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3698-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We used the electromobility shift assay to assess IRE/IRP-1 interaction in control Hep3B cells (21% O2) and cells exposed to 1% O2 for 16 h. Fig. 1shows that the baseline IRE/IRP-1 binding (C) in the hypoxic cells exceeds that in the normoxic cells by at least 10-fold. Consistent with a substantial body of previous information, IRE/IRP-1 binding rose dramatically when cells in a 21% O2atmosphere were treated for 16 h with 100 μmdesferrioxamine (D). By contrast, desferrioxamine treatment did not increase IRE/IRP-1 binding in cells in a 1% O2atmosphere. Therefore, chelation of intracellular iron does not further enhance hypoxia-stimulated IRE/IRP-1 binding. This suggests that hypoxia promoted IRE/IRP-1 association to the maximum possible extent. With each electromobility shift assay, a parallel incubation was performed that included 2-mercaptoethanol. This agent promotes maximal IRE/IRP-1 binding when added to the in vivo incubation mixture. As shown in Fig. 1, maximal IRE/IRP binding was equivalent for cells in a 21% O2 or 1% O2 atmosphere. Therefore, hypoxia increases the extent of IRE/IRP-1 binding but does not change the overall IRE/IRP-1 binding capacity of the cells. The expected decrease in IRE/IRP-1 binding that occurred with the addition of iron in the form of ferric ammonium citrate to the normoxic cells was paralleled in the hypoxic cells. Therefore, hypoxia enhances IRE/IRP-1 binding without altering its physiological response to iron. The 16-h period of hypoxia did not affect the viability of Hep3B cells as assessed by trypan blue staining. Hypoxia enhanced IRE/IRP-1 binding in cells exposed to 1% O2 for only 4 h (Fig.2). The increase was only 2-fold over the baseline, suggesting that the metabolic changes that augment IRE/IRP-1 binding develop over time. We also examined the effect of hypoxia on IRE/IRP-1 binding in K562 cells. Fig. 3 shows that 16 h of hypoxia enhanced IRE/IRP-1 binding by only 2-fold (as assessed by densitometric scanning). In contrast, incubating the cells with erythropoietin at a concentration of 50 units/ml boosted IRE/IRP-1 binding by 5-fold, consistent with the observations by other investigators (32Weiss G. Houston T. Kastner S. Jöhrer K. Grünewald B. Brock J. Blood. 1997; 89: 680-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, K562 cells can shift IRE/IRP-1 binding characteristics in response to environmental stimuli. The response of Hep3B cells and K562 cells to hypoxia was qualitatively similar but differed in magnitude. The standard electromobility shift assay separates RNA/protein complexes by charge. The technique does not separate IRE/IRP-1 and IRE/IRP-2 in extracts derived from human hepatoma or erythroleukemia cells (in contrast to murine cells) (32Weiss G. Houston T. Kastner S. Jöhrer K. Grünewald B. Brock J. Blood. 1997; 89: 680-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis indicates that the level of IRP-2 protein is very low in these cell lines (data not shown). Supershift experiments were inconclusive. Cytosolic aconitase activity and RNA binding capacity are mutually exclusive properties of IRP-1. The hypoxia-induced increase in IRE/IRP-1 binding should lessen the amount of free cytosolic IRP-1 protein. IRP-1 is an aconitase enzyme when it is free in the cytosol, but it lacks this activity when it is part of an IRE/IRP-1 complex. On this basis, we predicted that hypoxia would lower cytosolic aconitase activity. K562 cells and Hep3B cells exposed to 1% O2 for 16 h were lysed, and the 100,000 × g supernatant was collected. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was 1.5 unit in the pellet and was undetectable in the supernatant, indicating no contamination by this mitochondrial enzyme. The same should hold for mitochondrial aconitase (15Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, hypoxia markedly decreased cytosolic aconitase activity in both cell lines. The magnitude of the decline produced by hypoxia was similar to that seen with desferrioxamine treatment. The significant decrease in enzyme activity correlates well with the marked increase in the binding of IRP-1 to IREs. Although hypoxia shifts IRP-1 onto IRE-containing transcript, the aconitase that remains in the cytosol still shows iron-dependent regulation in a 1% oxygen atmosphere (Table I; Hep3B cells). Only IRP-1 has aconitase activity. Our electromobility shift assay can not distinguish between IRP-1 and IRP-2. Consequently, we can not assess the effect of hypoxia on IRP-2.Table IThe effect of hypoxia on cytosolic aconitase activityHep3BK56221% O21% O221% O21% O2Control39.7 ± 3.116.0 ± 1.311.8 ± 1.15.9 ± 1.9FAC (10 μg/ml)bFAC, ferric ammonium citrate.46.7 ± 2.121.7 ± 1.917.6 ± 1.7Df (100 μm)cDf, desferrioxamine.13.3 ± 1.36.5 ± 3.26.1 ± 3.1Fresh cytosolic cell extracts (100,000 × gsupernatant, 50 μg of protein) from Hep3B and K562 cells grown under conditions of normoxia or hypoxia (16 h) in the presence or absence of 100 μm desferrioxamine or 10 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate were analyzed for cytosolic aconitase activity as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The extracts were free from mitochondrial contamination, as judged by the lack of cytochromec oxidase activity.

The experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. aValues represent cytosolic aconitase activity (μm substrate consumed/mg protein/min (mean ± S.E.)). IRE/IRP-1 binding stabilizes mRNAs with IREs in the 3′-UTR. Therefore, hypoxia should increase the steady-state level of the transferrin receptor transcript. To test this prediction, mRNA was isolated from Hep3B cells maintained at 1% O2 for 16 h. Fig. 4 shows that hypoxia substantially increases transferrin receptor mRNA levels relative to control as assessed by Northern blot analysis (lane 1 versus lane 4). The magnitude of the increase in transferrin receptor mRNA produced by hypoxia is similar to that produced by desferrioxamine. In contrast to the striking increase in transferrin receptor message produced by 16 h of hypoxia, a 4-h period of oxygen deprivation had little, if any, effect on the level (data not shown). Fig. 4 also shows that 16 h of hypoxia did not affect the level of the ferritin L subunit transcript. Therefore, the hypoxia-induced increase in transferrin receptor message did not reflect a global change in mRNA metabolism. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, hypoxia can induce transcriptional activity of physiologically important genes (for a review, see Ref. 17Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4) showed an increase of greater than 10-fold in the steady-state level of TfR mRNA in Hep3B cells exposed to hypoxia. Nuclear run on assay was performed to determine whether the observed increase was due to enhanced transcription. We predicted that the hypoxia-induced increase in transferrin receptor message represented stabilization of the message due to binding of the IRP-1 to the IREs in the 3′-UTR of the transcripts. Nuclei were isolated from control Hep3B cells or from cells exposed to 1% O2 for 16 h. Hypoxia affected neither the cell viability nor yield of isolated nuclei. Fig.5 shows no effect by hypoxia on the transcription of the transferrin receptor message. In contrast, hypoxia increased the synthesis of erythropoietin message, as expected (16Golberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These data confirm that hypoxia increases TfR mRNA levels in Hep3B cells by stabilizing the message. An increase in IRP binding to the IREs in the 3′-UTR of the transferrin receptor message raises the level of transferrin receptor mRNA and secondarily increases transferrin receptor expression. This phenomenon is seen most strikingly in cells treated with desferrioxamine. Because hypoxia mimics the effect of desferrioxamine on IRE/IRP-1 binding and transferrin receptor mRNA expression in these cells, we predicted that hypoxia would also increase transferrin receptor protein expression. Fig. 6 shows that surface expression of transferrin receptors doubles in Hep3B cells exposed to hypoxia for 16 h (2.5 × 104 versus 4.9 × 104 receptors/cell). Scatchard analysis of the data shows no change in ligand/receptor affinity (Kd = 8.6 nm). Binding studies also show that the total transferrin binding capacity of the cells increased by more than 2-fold (5versus 13.7 ng/106 cells). The increase in transferrin receptor message produced by 16 h of hypoxia is functionally significant in that it substantially raises transferrin receptor surface expression. In contrast, a 4-h period of hypoxia had no effect on transferrin receptor expression (data not shown). A second functional consequence of IRE/IRP-1 binding is impaired translation of messages containing an IRE element in the 5′-UTR. For example, desferrioxamine chelates intracellular iron, increases IRE/IRP-1 binding, and blocks translation of the ferritin message. We predicted that the increase in IRE/IRP binding produced by hypoxia would also block translation of the ferritin message. We therefore assessed ferritin synthesis in control cells and in cells exposed to hypoxia for 16 h. Fig. 7is a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labeled ferritin immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-ferritin antibody. Ferritin synthesis is diminished modestly in the hypoxic cells relative to controls. Iron normally increases ferritin synthesis by dissociating the IRP from the IRE. Fig.7 shows that this occurred in control cells. However, hypoxic cells did not increase ferritin synthesis in response to iron. This indicates that the hypoxia-induced IRE/IRP-1 binding is very tight and resists dissociation in response to iron. Reduced ferritin synthesis in hypoxic cells should reduce the cellular ferritin content. We assessed the ferritin content of control cells and hypoxic cells using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit. Table II shows that the ferritin content of hypoxic cells is about one-third that of the control. Also consistent with the previous ferritin biosynthesis studies, the ferritin cont"

This response is identical to that observed in the SC white matter of rats made cobalamin (Cbl) deficient by total gastrectomy (TG). Immunoblot analysis showed that: 1) the level of the biologically active form of the TNF-alpha protein (17 kDa) is higher in the SC of totally gastrectomized (TGX) rats 2 months after TG, i.e., at the postoperative time when edema is observed; 2) SC levels of TNF-alpha protein (17 kDa) in 2-mo-TGX-, Cbl-treated rats are reduced to control. Repeated i.c.v. microinjections of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) into TGX rats, begun shortly after TG, substantially reduced both intramyelin and interstitial edema in the SC white matter. This study provides the first evidence that the hallmark myelin damage of Cbl-deficient central neuropathy, which is a pure myelinolytic disease, is not caused directly by the withdrawal of the vitamin itself, but reflects enhanced production of the biologically active form of TNF-alpha by SC cells. This study thus supports the view that TGF-beta1 and IL-6 may act as neuroprotective agents in Cbl deficiency central neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W1942602161,"Prostanoids produced via the action of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) appear central to many inflammatory conditions. Here we show in LPS-treated rats, however, that COX-2 induction alone does not greatly increase prostanoid production in vivo. For this, a second, arachidonic acid liberating stimulus is also required. Thus, only after intravenous injection of bradykinin or exogenous arachidonic acid was a marked increase in prostanoid formation seen. There is, therefore, synergy between proinflammatory mediators: both induction of COX-2 protein and an increase in the supply of arachidonic acid are required to greatly enhance prostanoid production. Second, we show that supplying arachidonic acid to increase prostanoid production reduces the effectiveness of both currently used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac) and novel COX-2-selective inhibitors (NS-398, celecoxib) as inhibitors of COX-2 activity. Our data lead to two important conclusions. First, increased prostanoid production in inflammation is a two-component response: increased COX-2 expression and increased arachidonic acid supply. Second, the supply of arachidonic acid to COX-2 determines the effectiveness of NSAIDs. NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors, therefore, will generally be less effective at more inflamed sites, providing a rationale for the very high doses of NSAIDs required in human conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.—Hamilton, L.

https://openalex.org/W1972297910,"Glycosylation of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosphingolipids occurs mainly in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Nucleotide sugars, donors of all the sugars involved in Golgi glycosylation reactions, are synthesized in the cytoplasm and require specialized transporters to be translocated into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. By controlling the supply of sugar nucleotides in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, these transporters directly regulate the glycosylation of macromolecules transiting the Golgi. We have identified and purified the rat liver Golgi membrane UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine transporter. The transporter was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of conventional and dye color chromatography. An ∼63,000-fold purification (6% yield) was achieved starting from crude rat liver Golgi membranes and resulting in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa.

Our results indicate that the primary locus of activation lies in the carboxyl-half of the molecule, although the extent of activation can be influenced by the amino-proximal region, particularly by the Raf-1 zinc finger. We also found that Raf-1 is hyperphosphorylated in mitosis at multiple sites within residues 283–302 and that these hyperphosphorylations are not required for activation. In addition, neither Mek1 nor Mek2 are stably activated in coordination with Raf-1 in nocodazole-arrested cells. Overall, the data suggest that the mechanism(s) responsible for activating Raf-1 during mitosis, and the subsequent downstream effects, are distinct from those involved in growth factor stimulation.

Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Meks), which in turn phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinases known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) (reviewed in Ref. 1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactive Raf-1 is maintained in the cytoplasm in a large macromolecular complex with heat-shock proteins (2Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 14-3-3 proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Regulation of Raf-1 is complex and many proteins appear to participate including Ras, 14-3-3, Src, protein kinase C (PKC), and ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAP kinase) (3Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In addition, lipid cofactors such as phosphatidylserine and ceramide may also be involved (4Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Following growth factor stimulation of cells, activated Ras associates with Raf-1, displacing 14-3-3 from the Raf-1 amino terminus and recruiting Raf-1 to the plasma membrane. Additional incompletely characterized phosphorylation-dependent and -independent steps result in complete activation (3Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The subsequent down-regulation of Raf-1 activity to pre-stimulation levels is temporally associated with phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-259 and Ser-621/624, rebinding of 14-3-3 to the amino terminus of Raf-1, and recycling of Raf-1 to the cytoplasm (3Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Elimination of an amino-proximal region 14-3-3-binding phosphoepitope in Raf-1 (at Ser-259 in mammalian Raf-1) results in Raf-1 activation, whereas mutation of the other 14-3-3-binding site in the carboxyl-proximal region of Raf-1 (at Ser-621) completely eliminates Raf-1 kinase activity (6Morrison D.K.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Src and/or Src family members can regulate Raf-1 activity by tyrosine phosphorylation, When Raf-1 is coexpressed with activated Src in insect cells or Cos cells, it is phosphorylated at Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 and becomes activated (9Fabian J.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, CD4-mediated activation of Raf-1 is dependent on the Src family kinase Lck and is associated with enhanced Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (11Popik W. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, plasma membrane-associated activated Raf-1 has increased tyrosine phosphorylation, and Raf-1 kinase activity is lost when Raf-1 immunoprecipitates are incubated with a tyrosine phosphatase (12Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interferon-, oncostatin M-, and growth hormone-induced activation of Raf-1 may also depend on phosphorylation at Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 by the Jak kinases (13Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Raf-1 can also be activated by coexpression with protein kinase C (PKC) family members in insect and mammalian cells (16Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahdl H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G.

Hummel R. Vahdl H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The major PKC phosphorylation site in Raf-1 is Ser-499, and mutation of either Ser-499 or Ser-259 has been reported to inhibit Raf-1 activation by PKC in vivo (16Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G.

Raf-1 activation by PKC can also be inhibited by mutations that disrupt Ras-Raf-1 interactions (8Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Another Raf-1 activator is CAP kinase, which has been reported to activate Raf-1 by phosphorylation at Thr-268 and Thr-269 (21Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.-H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.-Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These are also the major Raf-1 autophosphorylation sites (6Morrison D.K. Heideker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to activation at G0/G1, Raf-1 is hyperphosphorylated at serine and activated in mitosis in a wide variety of cell types by an unknown mechanism (22Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M.

Roberts T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The hyperphosphorylation reduces Raf-1 electrophoretic mobility, but we do not know how many sites are phosphorylated or if this is causally connected to activation. In Jurkat cells, the Src family kinase Lck binds Raf-1 in a mitosis-specific manner, and Raf-1 is not activated in mitosis in an Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line (25Pathan N.I. Ashendel C.L. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30315-30317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is interesting in light of the well documented activation of Src family kinases in mitosis and the requirement of Src family function for fibroblast entry into mitosis (26Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 26-34Google Scholar, 27Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 by Lck is involved or whether the more ubiquitous Src family members found in fibroblasts participate in Raf-1 mitotic activation in those cells. Thus, there are many known mechanisms that potentially could be involved in the mitotic hyperphosphorylation and activation of Raf-1. We explored these possibilities by mutagenesis and excluded most known direct interactions. In addition, we identified a locus containing multiple hyperphosphorylation sites and showed that the primary mitotic activating event occurs in the carboxyl-half of Raf-1. cDNAs encoding amino-terminal Flag epitope-tagged (WT, R89L, C165S/C168S, S259A, Y340F/Y341F, or S499A) or untagged (T268A/T269A, Y340D/Y341D) Raf-1 proteins (7Michaud N.R.

A 0.45-kilobase pair HindIII fragment containing the Flag epitope was cloned from pcDNA3 Flag-Raf(WT) into pcDNA Raf(T268A/T269A) and pcDNA Raf(Y340D/Y341D) to create pcDNA3 Flag-Raf(T268A/T269A) and pcDNA3 Flag-Raf(Y340D/Y341D). A 2.6-kilobase pair BglII fragment encoding the amino-terminal Flag epitope and Raf-1 amino acid residues 1–569 was cloned from pcDNA3 FLAG-Raf(WT) into pcDNA3 Raf-1-CAAX (kindly provided by Mark Roberson) to generate pcDNA3 Flag-Raf-1-CAAX. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with mutant primers or site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) was used to generate DNA encoding other Raf-1 truncated or point mutated proteins, which were then cloned into pcDNA3. These included amino-terminal Flag epitope-tagged point mutants (R143E/K144E, S338A/S339A, S287A/S289A, S289A/S291A, S294A/S296A/S301A), amino-terminal Flag epitope-tagged internal deletion mutants (Δ282–294, Δ282–303), and carboxyl-terminal Flag epitope-tagged truncation mutants (267–640, 275–640, 292–640, 302–640). In all cases Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for PCR according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Mutations were verified by sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) in the Cornell University Bioresource Center. For Raf-1 kinase assays, Cos-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected using Fugene 6 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions (day 1). On day 2 the cells were passaged 1:2.5. On day 3 mitotic cells were prepared by rinsing monolayers twice with TD buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNa2PO4) and adding 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. After 9 h treated plates were gently rinsed to dislodge mitotic cells that were pelleted, washed, and lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Unsynchronous lysates were prepared from an untreated duplicate plate. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that 80–85% of nocodazole-treated Cos cells harvested in this fashion were in G2 or M. A similar procedure was used to harvest mitotic cells following expression of Raf-1 or coexpression of Raf-1 and Src proteins in 293T cells (31DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.-M. Miller J.H.

For Mek kinase assays, NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. Mitotic cells were prepared by treating cells with 0.4 μg/ml nocodazole for 7 h and gently rinsing the plates to dislodge mitotic cells that were pelleted, washed, and lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer described in Jelinek et al.

Unsynchronous lysates were prepared from untreated duplicate plates. PDGF-stimulated cell lysates were prepared by serum-starving cells for 24 h, adding PDGF (20 ng/ml final) for 5 min, and lysing in RIPA buffer. Serum-starved, unstimulated cells were used as controls. Raf-1 kinase assays were carried out exactly as described previously (22Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol.

Reaction products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were then exposed to a PhosphorImager plate, and the resulting image was captured using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Appropriate membrane segments were probed using a Flag polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (used in Fig. 5 B only) or Raf-1 or Mek1 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, Antibodies R19120 and M17020 respectively), as indicated. Mek activity was assayed as described by Jelinek et al.(32Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M. Mol. Cell.

Reaction products and separate aliquots of the Mek immunoprecipitates (used to measure Mek concentrations) were separately resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blots in Fig. 6 were visualized using goat anti-mouse antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). In all other cases antibodies were detected with electrochemical fluorescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Images were analyzed and processed using ImageQuant 1.1 (Molecular Dynamics) and Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). We and others (22Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J.

Since we planned to test the effects of Raf-1 mutations using amino-terminal Flag epitope-tagged Raf-1 protein (Flag-Raf) transiently expressed in Cos cells, we began by testing wild-type Raf-1 in this system. As anticipated, both the ability of Flag-Raf to phosphorylate KD-Mek1 and to autophosphorylate were increased in mitosis (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and2, panels B and C). The average increase in mitotic Mek kinase activity relative to that seen for Raf-1 from unsynchronized cells in 16 experiments of this type was 11.5÷× 1.1, similar to the 10-fold increase we have reported for stably overexpressed untagged wild-type Raf-1 in NIH 3T3 cells (22Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26742-26745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, as previously observed with untagged Raf-1, multiple electrophoretically retarded isoforms were present in mitotic cells (panel A). To confirm that the phosphorylation of Mek1 was catalyzed by Raf-1 and not by a contaminating kinase activity bound to Raf-1 such as Cdc2 (which phosphorylates Mek on Thr-286 and Thr-292), we probed the kinase assay reaction products with a Mek1 polyclonal antibody that is specific for Mek1 phosphorylated on Ser-218, one of the Raf-1-specific phosphorylation sites (panel D). Raf-1 specific phosphorylation of Mek1 was not detectable in unsynchronized cells (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, antibody binding was increased ∼3-fold for the mitotic sample (lane 2), indicating that Raf-1 itself was responsible for increased phosphorylation. We examined the mechanisms underlying Raf-1 activation in mitosis using an array of Raf-1 mutants known to interfere with phosphorylation of and/or signaling to Raf-1 by Src, Ras, 14-3-3 proteins, protein kinase C (PKC), subcellular relocalization, Raf-1 autophosphorylation, and ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAP kinase) (TableI). Amino-terminal Flag epitope-tagged wild-type (WT) and mutant Raf-1 proteins were transiently expressed and tested in unsynchronized and mitotic Cos cells, and their abilities to phosphorylate KD Mek in an immune complex kinase assay and phosphorylation-induced changes in Raf-1 electrophoretic mobility were compared.Table IDocumented properties of Raf-1 mutantsMutantPredominant subcellular localizationΔBasal activitySrcRas14–3-3PKCRaf-1CAP kinaseUnknown kinaseY340F/Y341FCytoplasm↓XY340D/Y341DCytoplasm⇈XR89LCytoplasmXXC165S/C168SCytoplasm↑XXR143E/K144ECytoplasmXS259ACytoplasm⇈XX?S499ACytoplasmXCAAXPlasma membrane⇈T268A/T269ACytoplasmXXS338A/S339ACytoplasm↓XXXXMutations are listed on the left.

To explore the possible role of Src family kinases in the mitotic activation of Raf-1, we tested Flag-Raf(Y340F/Y341F) and Flag-Raf(Y340D/Y341D) which contain, respectively, loss-of-function (Tyr → Phe) and gain-of-function (Tyr → Asp) mutations at Tyr-340 and Tyr-341, the major Src phosphorylation sites (9Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The activities of these mutants in unsynchronized cells have previously been shown to be decreased and increased, respectively (9Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and both of these mutants are known to be poorly stimulated when coexpressed with activated Src in Cos cells (residual activation is believed to result from a modest effect of Src on Ras activation levels (10Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar)). Flag-Raf(Y340F/Y341F) exhibited reduced kinase activity in unsynchronized cells as anticipated (Fig.2, lane 3; TableII). Furthermore, it was activated to a significantly reduced extent in mitosis (lanes 3 and4; Table II). In contrast, Flag-Raf(Y340D/Y341D) had elevated activity in unsynchronized cells and was activated to an extent similar to Flag-Raf(WT) in mitosis (lanes 5 and6; Table II). The electrophoretic mobility of both mutants was retarded during mitosis, with Flag-Raf(Y340D/Y341D) more retarded than Flag-Raf(WT) (upper panel). We conclude that negative charges at these sites (either caused by mutagenesis or by Src-mediated phosphorylation) act synergistically with the mitotic activator(s) of Raf-1, but that changes in phosphorylation of these sites are not required for mitotic activation of Raf-1. This is consistent with our observations 2A. D. Laird and D. Shalloway, unpublished observations. and other observations (33Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwell G. J. Biol.

We tested a Raf-1 point mutant Flag-Raf (R89L) that is unable to stably associate with Ras (29Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and we found that it behaved similarly to Flag-Raf(WT) both in unsynchronized and mitotic cells (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 5 and6; Table II). The C165S/C168S mutation disrupts the putative Zn2+ coordination site in the Raf-1 zinc finger, thereby inhibiting its stable association with 14-3-3 (and also with Ras) (7Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R.

This mutation completely abolished the Raf-1 mitosis-specific electrophoretic mobility shift (lanes 9 and10).

https://openalex.org/W1587660636,"Treatment of restenosis after angioplasty with octapeptide somatostatin (SST) analogs has met with variable success. These analogs bind with high affinity to only two SST receptor (SSTR) subtypes (2 and 5), display moderate affinity for SSTR3, and low affinity for SSTR1 and 4. To optimize the vasculoprotective effect of SST, we have investigated the pattern of expression of all five SSTRs in rat thoracic aorta in the resting state and at 15 min, 3, 7, and 14 days after balloon endothelial denudation. SSTR1-5 were analyzed as mRNA by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and as protein by immunocytochemistry. All five SSTRs were expressed in rat aorta both as mRNA and protein and displayed a time-dependent, subtype-selective response to endothelial denudation. mRNA for SSTR1 and 2 increased acutely (SSTR1 > SSTR2) on days 3 and 7, coincident with smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, and declined to basal levels by day 14. SSTR3 and 4 displayed a different pattern with a delayed, more gradual increase in mRNA beginning at days 3–7 and continued to increase thereafter. SSTR5 mRNA was constitutively expressed at a low level and showed no change during the 2 wk postinjury period. By immunohistochemistry, SSTR1-5 antigens were localized predominantly in SMC that were present in the media or had migrated into the intima; antigen expression correlated with receptor mRNA expression. Notably, only SSTR1,3,4 were expressed in the intima: SSTR1 and 4 during the proliferative burst and SSTR3 and 4 after proliferation, when SMC migration into the intima continues. These results demonstrate dynamic changes in SSTR1-5 expression after vascular trauma localized to areas of vascular SMC migration and replication. In view of their early and prominent induction, SSTR1 may be the optimal subtype to target for inhibition of myointimal proliferation, and SSTR3 and 4 for migration and remodeling.—Khare, S., Kumar, U., Sasi, R., Puebla, L., Calderon, L., Lemstrom, K., Hayry, P., Patel, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2123624780,"We have identified a novel guanylyl cyclase, named MsGC-I, that is expressed in the nervous system of Manduca sexta. MsGC-I shows highest sequence identity with receptor guanylyl cyclases throughout its catalytic and dimerization domains but does not contain the ligand-binding, transmembrane, or kinase-like domains characteristic of receptor guanylyl cyclases. In addition, MsGC-I contains a C-terminal extension of 149 amino acids that is not present in other receptor guanylyl cyclases. The sequence of MsGC-I contains no regions that show similarity to the regulatory domain of soluble guanylyl cyclases. Thus, MsGC-I appears to represent a member of a new class of guanylyl cyclases. We show that both a transcript and a protein of the sizes predicted from the MsGC-I cDNA are present in the nervous system of Manduca and that MsGC-I is expressed in a small population of neurons within the abdominal ganglia. When expressed in COS-7 cells, MsGC-I appears to exist as a soluble homodimer with high levels of basal guanylyl cyclase activity that is insensitive to stimulation by nitric oxide. Western blot analysis, however, shows that MsGC-I is localized to the particulate fraction of nervous system homogenates, suggesting that it may be membrane-associated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1513446241,"Little is known about the factors influencing the hemoglobin switch in vertebrates during development. Inasmuch as the mammalian conceptus is exposed to changing oxygen tensions in utero, we examined the effect of different oxygen concentrations on β-globin switching. We used an in vitro model of mouse embryogenesis based on the differentiation of blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells to embryoid bodies (EBs). Cultivation of EBs at increasing oxygen concentrations (starting at 1% O2) did not influence the temporal expression pattern of embryonic (βH1) globin compared to the normoxic controls (20% O2). In contrast, when compared to normoxically grown EBs, expression of fetal/adult (βmaj) globin in EBs cultured at varying oxygen concentrations was delayed by about 2 days and persisted throughout differentiation. Quantitation of hemoglobin in EBs using a 2,7-diaminofluorene-based colorimetric assay revealed the appearence of hemoglobin in two waves, an early and a late one. This observation was verified by spectrophotometric analysis of hemoglobin within single EBs. These two waves might reflect the switch of erythropoiesis from yolk sac to fetal liver. Reduced oxygenation is known to activate the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which in turn specifically induces expression of a variety of genes among them erythropoietin (EPO). Although EBs increased EPO expression upon hypoxic exposure, the altered β-globin appearance was not related to EPO levels as determined in EBs overexpressing EPO. Since mRNA from both mouse HIF-1α isoforms was detected in all EBs tested at different differentiation stages, we propose that HIF-1 modulates β-globin expression during development.—Bichet, S., Wenger, R.

https://openalex.org/W1511418459,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuroendocrine mediator in immune tissues that affects many T cell functions through two homologous high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptors, termed VIPR1 and VIPR2. Antigen-stimulated secretion of γ-interferon (IFN-γ) by sperm whale myoglobin-specific Th1 cells of DBA/2 mouse I-Ed-restricted clones, which express VIPR1 and VIPR2, was enhanced by 10−10 M to 10−7 M VIP. Enhancement of IFN-γ secretion reached a mean maximum of fourfold for VIP and threefold for a VIPR2-selective agonist, without any effect of a VIPR1-selective agonist. Secretion of IFN-γ by PMA and ionomycin-stimulated clones of Th1 cells was not altered by VIP. Antigen-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ by T cell receptor-transgenic, influenza hemagglutinin-specific, and cytokine-differentiated mouse lymph node Th1 cells, which also express VIPR1 and VIPR2, was enhanced by 10−10 M to 10−8 M VIP. Enhancement of IFN-γ secretion increased to a maximum of 14-fold for VIP, 14-fold for the VIPR2-selective agonist, and 20-fold for the VIPR1-selective agonist. In contrast to VIP suppression of interleukin production and lack of effect on IFN-γ production by T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody or a mitogenic lectin, generation of IFN-γ by antigen-stimulated T cells is enhanced significantly by physiological concentrations of VIP.—Jabrane-Ferrat, N., Bloom, D., Wu, A., Li, L., Lo, D., Sreedharan, S.

https://openalex.org/W1841730068,"During the effector phase of apoptosis, caspase activation appears to be responsible for the distinctive structural changes of apoptosis and perhaps for some of the changes in function of the doomed cells. There is therefore interest in identifying caspase substrates and the details of the cleavage events. Here we define precisely the event responsible for generation of a stable 90 kDa fragment from the oncosuppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Using synthetic radiolabeled APC peptides as substrate, we demonstrate cleavage by cytosolic extracts from preapoptotic cells. This cleavage was reproduced by recombinant caspase-3 and blocked by a tetrapeptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, which is specific for caspase-3 family members. Inhibitors specific for caspase-1 and -8 however, were less effective in blocking APC cleavage. Mutation of a candidate DNID caspase-3 target site completely abolished cleavage. This cleavage may be of biological importance since the 90 kDa fragment consists of a sequence that is highly conserved in the human, rat, mouse, Xenopus, and Drosophila APC, although wide sequence divergence is observed in Drosophila immediately carboxy-terminal to the DNID site. Furthermore, cleavage at this site separates two significant functional domains: an amino-terminal armadillo repeat and an adjacent series of beta-catenin binding sites. Further circumstantial evidence for the significance of APC-related pathways in apoptosis is provided by the observation that apoptosis also induces cleavage of beta-catenin itself, a protein known to accumulate in cells depleted in functional APC and that appears to link cell-cell signaling to changes in transcription and cell movement."
https://openalex.org/W2112081534,"The generation of oscillations and global Ca2+ waves relies on the spatio-temporal recruitment of elementary Ca2+ signals, such as ‘Ca2+ puffs’. Each elementary signal contributes a small amount of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, progressively promoting neighboring Ca2+ release sites into an excitable state. Previous studies have indicated that increases in frequency or amplitude of such hormone-evoked elementary Ca2+ signals are necessary to initiate Ca2+ wave propagation. In the present study, an electroporation device was used to rapidly and reversibly permeabilize the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and to allow a limited influx of Ca2+. With low field intensities (100–500 V/cm), brief (50–100 µs) electroporation triggered localized Ca2+ signals that resembled hormone-evoked Ca2+ puffs, but not global signals. With such low intensity electroporative pulses, the Ca2+ influx component was usually undetectable, confirming that the electroporation-induced local signals represented Ca2+ puffs arising from the opening of intracellular Ca2+ release channels. Increasing either the frequency at which low-intensity electroporative pulses were applied, or the intensity of a single electroporative pulse (>500 V/cm), resulted in caffeine-sensitive regenerative Ca2+ waves. We suggest that Ca2+ puffs caused by electroporation functionally mimic hormone-evoked elementary events and can activate global Ca2+ signals if they provide a sufficient trigger.—Bobanovic, F., Bootman, M.

https://openalex.org/W2098741056,"Hematopoiesis is viewed as a differentiating system emanating from a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell capable of both self-renewal and differentiation. By identifying and characterizing a novel and highly specific in vitro mitogenic response to the N-acetyl glucosamyl/sialic acid specific, stem cell-binding lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), we demonstrate the existance of a rare (0.1%), plastic adherent precursor in rat bone marrow capable of proliferation (two to seven divisions) in response to WGA. Stimulated cells possess a lineage (lin)low/− immunophenotype and immature blastoid morphology (WGA blasts). A subsequent proliferative response to stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit, is characterized by an initial maturation in immunophenotype and subsequent self-renewal of cells (SCF blasts) without differentiation for at least 50 generations. Although granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin (IL) -6, IL-7, and IL-11 synergize with SCF to increase blast colony formation, cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage CSF or IL-3 are without significant effect. At all time points in culture, however, cells rapidly differentiate to mature neutrophils with dexamethasone or to mainly monocytes/macrophages in the presence of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, characterized by cell morphology and cytochemistry. Removal of SCF during blast maturation, self-renewal, or induction of differentiation phases results in apoptotic cell death. Data indicate a pivotal role for SCF/c-kit interaction during antigenic maturation, self-renewal, and apoptotic protection of these lineage-restricted progenitors during non-CSF-mediated induction of differentiation.

Most eukaryotic proteins occur as glycoproteins. The carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins play important roles not only in modulation of protein properties such as stability and biological activities but also in various molecular recognition processes, including initial reaction in bacterial and viral infections, cell adhesion in inflammation and metastasis, differentiation, development, regulation, and many other intercellular communication events (1Rademacher T.W.

It inhibited T cell proliferation induced by tetanus toxoid as well as T lymphocyte proliferation induced by interleukin 1 (IL-1). They also suggested that the carbohydrate portion of uromodulin played a fundamental role in its inhibitory activity (11Muchmore A.V. Shifrin S. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2547-2553PubMed Google Scholar). That uromodulin is identical to THGP was confirmed by amino acid sequencing (12Pennica D. Kohr W.J. Kuang W.-J. Glaister D. Aggarwal B.B. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1987; 236: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Muchmore and Decker (13Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2541-2546PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that uromodulin inhibits T cell proliferation via binding to IL-1β through its carbohydrate moieties and inactivates a mediator. However, Moonen et al. (14Moonen P. Gaffner R. Wingfield P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 226: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) rejected this explanation, because uromodulin interacted only with the denatured IL-1β adsorbed to the plastic plate but not with the native soluble IL-1β. Therefore, the precise immunosuppressive mechanism of uromodulin has not yet been clarified. We found that the oligosaccharide fraction, obtained by hydrazinolysis of THGP followed by N-acetylation, inhibits the T cell proliferation induced by tetanus toxoid.

An amino-bonded high performance silica gel plate (HPTLC Fertigplatten NH2F254) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). IL-2-dependent mouse T cell line, CTLL cells, was obtained from Dr. Takiguchi (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (ICN Biomedicals Ltd.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Cell Culture Laboratories, Cleveland, OH) and 2 units/ml human rIL-2 (kindly provided by Shionogi Co., Osaka, Japan) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. IL-1β-dependent T cell clone, D10-G4 (17Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 836-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 18Kaye J. Gillis S. Mizel S.B. Shevach E.M. Malek T.R. Dinarello C.A. Lachman L.B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1339-1345PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. Kakiuchi (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 5% Con A supernatant, which was derived from the culture medium of rat splenic cells treated with Con A. Anion-exchange column chromatography was performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Pharmacia Biotech) equipped with a Mono-Q HR5/5 column. Elution was programmed as follows: 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, for 10 min and then 500 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, for 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. Bio-Gel P-2 column chromatography using distilled water was performed to remove the salt or the monosaccharide from oligosaccharide fraction. Descending paper chromatography was performed using a solvent (1-butanol:ethanol:water = 4:1:1, v/v). Affinity chromatography onW. floribunda agglutinin-agarose was performed as follows. The sample dissolved in 100 μl of 10 mmphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, was applied to a W. floribunda agglutinin-agarose column (2 ml) and eluted with 15 ml of the same buffer. Oligosaccharides bound to the column were eluted with 8 ml of the buffer containing 100 mm N-acetylgalactosamine. After elution, the oligosaccharide fraction was freed from N-acetylgalactosamine by passing through a Bio-Gel P-2 column. Mild methanolysis was performed according to the procedure described previously (19Yamashita K. Ueda I. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14144-14147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were incubated with the following enzyme solutions: (i) A. ureafaciens sialidase (200 milliunits) in 50 μl of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0; (ii) jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (4 units) in 50 μl of 0.3 m citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. One drop of toluene was added to the reaction mixtures to inhibit bacterial growth during incubation. After being incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, enzymes were inactivated by heating the reaction mixture in a boiling water bath for 3 min. THGP was isolated from urine of a healthy adult male according to the procedure described previously (20Tamm I. Horsfall F.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1950; 74: 108-114Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The THGP, thus obtained, gave a single band under both reducing and nonreducing conditions stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after being subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). For the inhibitory assay, purified THGP solution was filtered to free from bacteria. Thoroughly dried THGP (50 mg), thus obtained, was subjected to 10 h of hydrazinolysis followed byN-acetylation as described previously (21Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). One-twentieth of the oligosaccharide fraction thus obtained was reduced with NaB3H4 (400 μCi) in 100 μl of 0.05n NaOH at 30 °C for 4 h, and the resulting radioactive oligosaccharide was purified as described previously (21Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). α1AGP, RNase B, porcine thyroglobulin, and fetuin were also subjected to hydrazinolysis followed by N-acetylation according to the procedures described above. One nmol of oligosaccharides in fraction AR was heated in 6 nHCl at 110 °C for 24 h followed by evaporation with methanol to remove HCl. The residue was dissolved in 100 μl of water, and the two-fifths of the solution was applied to HPLC TSKgel IC-Anion-PWXL (4.6 mm inner diameter × 3.5 cm, Tosoh Corp., Tokyo) to detect sulfate ion. Elution was performed with 1.5 mm potassium gluconate, 1.5 mm sodium borate, 5.8 mm boric acid, 4% acetonitrile, 3% 1-butanol, and 0.5% glycerol. The column temperature was maintained at 35 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Tetanus toxoid-induced proliferation of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed by using slight modifications of the previously described methods (22Adler W.H. Takiguchi T. Marsh B. Smith R.T. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 1049-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ml of normal heparinized human blood was diluted with an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium, and placed above 20 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque solution, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at room temperature. Monocyte-enriched population located between upper and lower layers was carefully collected. The cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% autologous plasma by alternate suspension and centrifugation. The viable cells (2 × 105) in 10% autologous plasma were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates with tetanus toxoid and various amounts of each oligosaccharide in a final volume of 200 μl. After incubation for 6 days, the cultures were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 6 h, and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into the cells was determined. The amount of IL-1β in the culture medium was measured at day 3 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for IL-1β (Otsuka Bioassay Research, Tokushima, Japan). The amount of IL-2 in the culture medium was measured at day 4 by counting the [3H]thymidine incorporated into CTLL cells, whose growth is dependent on IL-2. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were incubated with 100 μl of the culture medium of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS at 37 °C for 18 h. The cultures were then pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine overnight, and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was determined as described above. For the quantitation, known amounts of rIL-2 were added to aliquots of the above assay mixture as standards. In each well of a 96-well plate, 2 × 105 of D10-G4 cells/50 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS were incubated with 50 μl of 8 μg/ml Con A (final concentration of 2 μg/ml) and 50 μl of 4 units/ml IL-1β (final concentration of 1 unit/ml). To this mixture, various concentrations of oligosaccharides were added and incubated at 37 °C for another 2 days. The cultures were then pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine overnight, and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was determined as described above. Binding assays of IL-1β to oligosaccharides were performed using a slight modification of the previously described methods (23Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Yamashita K. Kuroki M. Matsuoka T. Kobata A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An amino-bonded high performance silica gel plate (HPTLC Fertigplatten NH2F254) was soaked in NaBH3CN solution and air-dried. Each oligosaccharide (1 nmol) was spotted onto the plate and left at room temperature (20–25 °C) for an appropriate length of time. The plate was washed three times with distilled water for 1 min and then soaked in saturated sodium bicarbonate solution containing 5% acetic anhydride to block the remaining active amino groups on the plate byN-acetylation. The plate was then overlaid with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.15 m NaCl and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. After being washed with PBS, the plate was overlaid with IL-1β solution in 1% BSA/PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. After being washed five times with PBS, the plate was overlaid with rabbit anti-human IL-1β antibodies and incubated at 4 °C for a further 2 h. The plate was then washed with PBS, overlaid with125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (G+M) antibodies, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The plate was then washed with PBS, dried, and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) in the dark at −80 °C for 2–5 days. One or 10 μg of each glycoprotein (THGP and bovine TSH) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and air-dried for several hours. The filter was washed three times with PBS, soaked in 5% BSA/PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. After being washed with PBS, the filter was soaked in IL-1β solution in 1% BSA/PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. After being washed three times with PBS, the filter was soaked in the solution containing rabbit anti-human IL-1β antibodies and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After a further wash with PBS, the filter was soaked in a solution containing biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (G+M) antibodies and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The filter was then washed with PBS, incubated with ABC reagent at room temperature for 30 min, and washed with PBS again. The filter was incubated with a substrate solution (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 0.3% 4-chloro-1-naphthol in methanol, 30% H2O2 aqueous (5:1:0.01, v/v)) at room temperature for an appropriate length of time. SM2, GM2, and sulfatide (1 nmol each) were spotted onto a silica polygram Sil G plate (Nagel, Germany). In order to prevent nonspecific binding, the plate was treated with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone for 1 min and then soaked in PBS containing 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was incubated with IL-1β solution (0.1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 18 h with gentle shaking. After washing three times with PBS, the plate was then incubated with rabbit anti-human IL-1β antibody solution at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS, the plate was incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ig(G+M) antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Bound biotinylated antibody was detected as described above. The oligosaccharide fractions obtained from THGP by hydrazinolysis followed byN-acetylation were added to the culture medium of tetanus toxoid-specific T cell proliferation. The effect of these oligosaccharides on the proliferation reaction is shown in Fig.1. The concentration required for 50% inhibition of tetanus toxoid-induced proliferation was around 10 μm. At this concentration, neither the oligosaccharides liberated from α1AGP nor those from RNase B inhibited tetanus toxoid-induced T cell proliferation (data not shown). In order to characterize the oligosaccharide showing the inhibitory activity, the oligosaccharide mixture obtained from THGP was fractionated. To facilitate detection of the oligosaccharides in further fractionation procedures, a small amount of tritium-labeled oligosaccharide mixture from THGP was added. The oligosaccharide mixture was subjected to anion-exchange column chromatography with a Mono-Q HR5/5 column. As shown in Fig.2 A, oligosaccharides were separated into a neutral fraction (N) that eluted with 5 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.0, and an acidic fraction (A) that eluted with 500 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. When fraction A was exhaustively incubated with A. ureafaciens sialidase, 67% of it was converted to neutral components (named fraction AN), and the remainder (named fraction AR) was resistant to this enzymatic treatment (Fig.2 B). Approximately 80% of oligosaccharides in fraction AR were converted to neutral components (named fraction ARN) by mild methanolysis (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the acidic nature of the majority of the oligosaccharides in fraction AR may be due to the presence of sulfate residues as it was previously reported that sulfate residues are removed from sugar moieties under these conditions (19Yamashita K. Ueda I. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14144-14147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to confirm the presence of sulfate residues in fraction AR, this fraction was treated with 6 nHCl at 110 °C for 24 h followed by anion chromatography using a TSK gel IC-Anion-PWXL column. The sulfate ion in the above reaction mixture was detected as shown in Fig.3. This result indicates that the acidic nature of sialidase-resistant oligosaccharides is due to the sulfate residue. Based on the analytical data, about 3 nmol of sulfate ion was released from 1 nmol of oligosaccharide mixture in fraction AR under these experimental conditions. Remaining acidic oligosaccharides in fraction ARR in Fig. 2 C were converted to the neutral components by heating in 0.1 n CF3COOH at 80 °C for 2 h. However, the acidic nature of oligosaccharides in fraction ARR could not be determined due to the limited amounts of sample. Based on the radioactivities, the molar ratio of oligosaccharides in each fraction was calculated as follows: fraction N (10%), fraction A (90%), fraction AN (60%), fraction AR (30%), fraction ARN (25%), and fraction ARR (5%).Figure 3Detection of sulfate anion by ion chromatography. Detailed procedures are described under “Materials and Methods.” The triangles indicate the elution positions of standard anions. a, chloride anion (3.1 min); b, phosphate anion (6.8 min); c, sulfate anion (8.7 min). Peaks other than sulfate anion were also detected in fraction AR not subjected to acid hydrolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On the other hand, when fraction A was directly subjected to mild methanolysis in order to determine the ratio of oligosaccharides carrying only the sulfate residue, a very small part of the fraction was converted to a neutral oligosaccharide mixture (named fraction AMN), and most of the oligosaccharides remained acidic as indicated by the fraction AMR peak in Fig. 2 D. The molar ratio of the oligosaccharides in the two fractions was calculated on the basis of their radioactivities, fraction AMN (3%) and fraction AMR (87%). These results indicate that 60% of the THGP oligosaccharides contain only sialic acid residues, 3% contain only sulfate residues, and 27% contain both sialic acid and sulfate residues as their acidic components. The inhibitory activity of each oligosaccharide fraction thus obtained on the T cell proliferation was examined, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4. Oligosaccharides in fraction A and fraction AR showed strong inhibitory activity. On the other hand, oligosaccharides in fraction ARN, which was converted to a neutral fraction by mild methanolysis treatment as described above, showed no inhibitory activity. These results indicate that the sulfate residue of oligosaccharides in fraction AR was essential for the expression of inhibitory activities. This interpretation is supported by the fact that fractions ARR, AMN, and AMR showed no inhibitory activity (Fig.4). It is noteworthy that fraction AR showed only slightly more potent inhibitory activity than fraction A, whereas fraction A was separated into bioactive fraction AR and inactive fraction AN after sialidase treatment as described above. The reason for this has not yet been determined, although a possible explanation is that the presence of the sialic acid residues, which is not essential for proliferation-inhibitory activity, on the sugar chains in fraction A may enhance the inhibitory activity of the sulfated oligosaccharides. As compared with other inactive fractions, the neutral fraction N, which was reported to contain only high mannose-type oligosaccharides (24Dall'Olio F. de Kanter F.J.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Serafini-Cessi F. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 178: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Smagula R.M. van Halbeek H. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P. Glycoconj. J. 1990; 7: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), had a slight inhibitory effect on the T cell proliferation at a concentration of ∼100 μm. To clarify the mechanisms of inhibitory activity of oligosaccharides in fraction AR, we changed the time of oligosaccharide addition. When added 24 h or more after the addition of tetanus toxoid, oligosaccharides in the fraction AR showed no inhibitory activity at all (Fig. 5). This result suggests that sulfated oligosaccharides in fraction AR acted at an early stage of antigen-specific T cell proliferation. Therefore, we quantified the amount of IL-1β and IL-2 molecules in the culture medium of tetanus toxoid-activated T cells under the effect of various amounts of fraction AR, since these soluble mediators are known to play important roles at the early stage of antigen-specific T cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of IL-1β in the T cell culture medium increased in parallel with the amount of fraction AR added. In contrast, the amount of IL-2 decreased on increasing the concentration of oligosaccharides. A possible explanation for these interesting results is that fraction AR inhibited the binding of IL-1β to its receptor on the surface of T cells. As a result, the decline of signal transduction induced by IL-1β in T cells would reduce IL-2 production. This inhibition can be induced by binding of the oligosaccharides to either IL-1β molecules or IL-1 receptors. In order to find out whether the oligosaccharides in fraction AR can directly act on the IL-1β molecule or not, we examined the effect of fraction AR on the culture of an IL-1-responsive D10-G4 cell line (17Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 836-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar,18Kaye J. Gillis S. Mizel S.B. Shevach E.M. Malek T.R. Dinarello C.A. Lachman L.B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1339-1345PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, both total oligosaccharides liberated from THGP (W in the figure) and fraction AR inhibited the proliferation of D10-G4 cells. However, oligosaccharides derived from other glycoproteins, α1AGP and RNase B, did not show any effect at all (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the inhibition of antigen-specific T cell proliferation might be due to interaction of the unique oligosaccharides of THGP with IL-1β. We then examined whether IL-1β binds directly to the oligosaccharides of THGP by a thin layer overlay method as described previously (23Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Yamashita K. Kuroki M. Matsuoka T. Kobata A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8 A, IL-1β bound to oligosaccharides in fractions A and AR but not to those in fractions AN, ARN, ARR, AMR, and AMN. These results are consistent with the data that only fractions AR and A could inhibit T cell proliferation (see Fig. 4). IL-1β also did not bind to the oligosaccharide fractions from thyroglobulin and α1AGP, which did not inhibit the T cell proliferation (Fig. 8 A). The radioactivities retained by immobilized oligosaccharides in Fig. 8 A were quantified densitometrically, and the data are shown in Fig. 8 B. The data clearly indicated that IL-1β bound only to the oligosaccharides in fractions A and AR derived from THGP. It must be stressed here that IL-1β very weakly bound to the porcine thyroglobulin oligosaccharides, which included sulfated biantennary sugar chains (26de Waard P. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicate that oligosaccharides with not only sulfate residues but also additional structural features are recognized by the IL-1β molecule. In order to elucidate the structure of the IL-1β ligand, fraction AR was applied to a W. floribunda agglutinin-agarose column, which is known to recognize a peripheral β-linkedN-acetylgalactosamine residue (27Torres B.V. McCrumb D.K. Smith D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and separated into an unbound fraction (fraction I in Fig.9 A) and a bound fraction subsequently eluted with 100 mm N-acetylgalactosamine (fraction II in Fig.9 A). The percent molar ratio of these two fractions was 53 and 47%, respectively. After removing salt andN-acetylgalactosamine by passing through a Bio-Gel P-2 column, both the inhibitory activity on T cell proliferation and the binding ability to IL-1β were examined for the two fractions. As shown in Fig. 10, A andB, both activities resided exclusively in fraction II, and fraction II showed more potent inhibitory activity than fraction AR. Furthermore, removal of terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues from fraction II by jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion (fraction III in Fig.9 B) abolished the binding ability to IL-1β completely (Fig. 9 C). These data indicate that at least two elements, a sulfate residue and a β-N-acetylgalactosamine residue at the nonreducing termini of the oligosaccharides, are necessary for their binding to IL-1β.Figure 10Coexistence of the inhibitory activity and IL-1β binding activity in fraction AR and fraction II obtained by W. floribunda agglutinin column chromatography. A, effect of addition of the oligosaccharides fractionated by the W. floribundaagglutinin-agarose column on tetanus toxoid-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Fractions I and II are the same as in Fig.9 A. B, binding of IL-1β to each oligosaccharide fraction in A. The amount of IL-1β bound to each oligosaccharide fraction was determined by densitometry of the NH2 HPTLC plate as described in Fig. 8. Detailed procedures are described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an attempt to clarify the relationship between the sulfate and N-acetylgalactosamine residues, we examined the binding of IL-1β to TSH because the SO4-4GalNAc group was present in the sugar chains of TSH (28Baenziger J.U. Green E.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When we studied the interaction of THGP and TSH with IL-1β, only THGP could be stained with IL-1β under the experimental conditions used (Fig.11 A). This suggests that IL-1β could not bind the SO4-4GalNAc group. Next, we examined the reactivity of IL-1β with various glycolipids containing sulfate and β-N-acetylgalactosamine residues. As shown in Fig. 11 B, IL-1β did not bind to sulfatide at all. This is consistent with the results that the oligosaccharides of thyroglobulin did not react with IL-1β as shown in Fig. 8, because sulfatide contains only the SO4-3Gal group similar to thyroglobulin (26de Waard P. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yamakawa T. Kiso N. Handa S. Makita A. Yokoyama S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1962; 52: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is quite interesting that IL-1β can bind weakly to SM2 but not to GM2 at all, although SM2 and GM2 have similar peripheral structures: the GalNAcβ1→4(R-3)Galβ1→, in which R is SO4 for SM2 and is sialic acid for GM2 (30Makita A. Yamakawa T. Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 1963; 33: 361-368PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the GalNAcβ1→4(SO4-3)Galβ1→ group could be at least a part of the ligand for IL-1β molecule. Muchmore's group (25Smagula R.M. van Halbeek H. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P. Glycoconj. J. 1990; 7: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Muchmore A.V.

Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 48: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that the glycopeptides containing high mannose type sugar chains derived from THGP inhibited antigen-specific T cell proliferation by 50% in the concentration range 0.2–2 μm. Dall'Olio et al. (7Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Malagolini N. Franceschi C. Serafini-Cessi F.

Conflicting evidence is that the glycopeptides obtained from ovalbumin by Pronase digestion, which should contain a series of high mannose type sugar chains together with a series of hybrid type sugar chains (2Kobata A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 483-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), did not show any inhibitory activity (7Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Malagolini N. Franceschi C. Serafini-Cessi F. Cell Immunol. 1991; 137: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate, however, that oligosaccharides in fraction N, which contains high mannose type sugar chains (24Dall'Olio F. de Kanter F.J.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Serafini-Cessi F. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 178: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Smagula R.M. van Halbeek H. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P. Glycoconj. J. 1990; 7: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), showed very little inhibitory activity even at the concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 4). In contrast, oligosaccharides in fraction AR inhibited T cell proliferation by 50% at the concentration of 2 μm. We propose in this report that the immunosuppressive properties of THGP are expressed by the interaction of its carbohydrate moieties with IL-1β. Our results demonstrate that oligosaccharides in fraction AR inhibited the proliferation of D10-G4 cells, which shows IL-1-dependent growth (17Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 836-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 18Kaye J. Gillis S. Mizel S.B. Shevach E.M. Malek T.R. Dinarello C.A. Lachman L.B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1339-1345PubMed Google Scholar), and that IL-1β interacted specifically with the oligosaccharides in fraction AR immobilized on the NH2 HPTLC plate. By further fractionation of the oligosaccharides in fraction AR, it was found that the oligosaccharides containing β-N-acetylgalactosamine and sulfate residues specifically bind to IL-1β. Two conflicting data were reported relating to our findings. Muchmore and Decker (13Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2541-2546PubMed Google Scholar) reported that theN-linked sugar chains of uromodulin interacted with IL-1, although Moonen et al. (14Moonen P. Gaffner R. Wingfield P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 226: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that THGP did not interact with soluble native cytokines and could only bind to denatured cytokines at low pH. Additionally, Fukushima et al. (32Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Ideo H. Inazu T. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10579-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IL-1β interacted with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. We recently found that IL-1β molecules radiolabeled with 125I by Bolton-Hunter reagent, which reacted with N-terminal amino acid and lysine residues of the peptide portion (33Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar), could no longer bind to THGP oligosaccharides. 2M. Tandai-Hiruma, unpublished results. This result suggests that N-terminal amino acid and/or lysine residues of IL-1β may play a role as the carbohydrate-binding site. In contrast, it was reported that even after the 125I-labeling IL-1β molecules can bind to their receptors on the cell surface (34Dower S.K. Kronheim S.R. March C.J. Conlon P.J. Hopp T.P. Gillis S. Urdal D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Therefore, care must be taken when using an 125I-labeled IL-1β as a probe to investigate the lectin-like activity of IL-1β. The possibility that the inhibitory oligosaccharides bind to tetanus toxoid and consequently inhibit the T cell proliferation will be ruled out because toxoid-independent T cell proliferation induced by combination between phytohemagglutinin-L4 and IL-1β was also inhibited by oligosaccharides in fraction AR (data not shown). THGP has been found to contain more than 150 N-linked sugar chains, and the structures of only 30 oligosaccharides have been determined (35Williams J. Marshall R.D. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 134: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Hård K. van Zadelhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 895-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Among them, two types of terminal sulfated elements were found, 4-O-sulfated GalNAc and 3-O-sulfated Gal (36Hård K. van Zadelhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 895-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). None of these are considered to be the actual ligand of IL-1β from our current study. These results indicate that not only the presence of a sulfate residue and a β-N-acetylgalactosamine residue but also a specific linkage(s) between the two groups is required for the ligand of IL-1β. Based on the reactivity with glycosphingolipids, the GalNAcβ1→4(SO4−-3)Galβ1→ group could be considered as a part of an epitope for binding to the to IL-1β molecule. Therefore, structural determination of the remaining oligosaccharides of THGP, especially sulfated and β-N-acetylgalactosamine-containing N-linked sugar chains, will be required in order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of the IL-1β molecule and the physiological roles of the lectin-like property.
