https://openalex.org/W2900144939,"During early human pregnancy the uterine mucosa transforms into the decidua, into which the fetal placenta implants and where placental trophoblast cells intermingle and communicate with maternal cells. Trophoblast–decidual interactions underlie common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand–receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell–cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the maternal–fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and reproductive success. Transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester deciduas and placentas reveal subsets of perivascular, stromal and natural killer cells in the decidua, with distinct immunomodulatory profiles that regulate the environment necessary for successful placentation."
https://openalex.org/W2900771557,"The use of liquid biopsies for cancer detection and management is rapidly gaining prominence1. Current methods for the detection of circulating tumour DNA involve sequencing somatic mutations using cell-free DNA, but the sensitivity of these methods may be low among patients with early-stage cancer given the limited number of recurrent mutations2–5. By contrast, large-scale epigenetic alterations—which are tissue- and cancer-type specific—are not similarly constrained6 and therefore potentially have greater ability to detect and classify cancers in patients with early-stage disease. Here we develop a sensitive, immunoprecipitation-based protocol to analyse the methylome of small quantities of circulating cell-free DNA, and demonstrate the ability to detect large-scale DNA methylation changes that are enriched for tumour-specific patterns. We also demonstrate robust performance in cancer detection and classification across an extensive collection of plasma samples from several tumour types. This work sets the stage to establish biomarkers for the minimally invasive detection, interception and classification of early-stage cancers based on plasma cell-free DNA methylation patterns. An immunoprecipitation-based protocol is developed to analyse DNA methylation in small quantities of circulating cell-free DNA, and can detect and classify cancers in plasma samples from several tumour types."

https://openalex.org/W2901014197,"Autophagy captures intracellular components and delivers them to lysosomes, where they are degraded and recycled to sustain metabolism and to enable survival during starvation1-5. Acute, whole-body deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in adult mice causes a systemic metabolic defect that manifests as starvation intolerance and gradual loss of white adipose tissue, liver glycogen and muscle mass1. Cancer cells also benefit from autophagy. Deletion of essential autophagy genes impairs the metabolism, proliferation, survival and malignancy of spontaneous tumours in models of autochthonous cancer6,7. Acute, systemic deletion of Atg7 or acute, systemic expression of a dominant-negative ATG4b in mice induces greater regression of KRAS-driven cancers than does tumour-specific autophagy deletion, which suggests that host autophagy promotes tumour growth1,8. Here we show that host-specific deletion of Atg7 impairs the growth of multiple allografted tumours, although not all tumour lines were sensitive to host autophagy status. Loss of autophagy in the host was associated with a reduction in circulating arginine, and the sensitive tumour cell lines were arginine auxotrophs owing to the lack of expression of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase 1. Serum proteomic analysis identified the arginine-degrading enzyme arginase I (ARG1) in the circulation of Atg7-deficient hosts, and in vivo arginine metabolic tracing demonstrated that serum arginine was degraded to ornithine. ARG1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and can be released from hepatocytes into the circulation. Liver-specific deletion of Atg7 produced circulating ARG1, and reduced both serum arginine and tumour growth. Deletion of Atg5 in the host similarly regulated [corrected] circulating arginine and suppressed tumorigenesis, which demonstrates that this phenotype is specific to autophagy function rather than to deletion of Atg7. Dietary supplementation of Atg7-deficient hosts with arginine partially restored levels of circulating arginine and tumour growth. Thus, defective autophagy in the host leads to the release of ARG1 from the liver and the degradation of circulating arginine, which is essential for tumour growth; this identifies a metabolic vulnerability of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2899712726,"There is no consensus on whether climate change has yet affected the statistics of tropical cyclones, owing to their large natural variability and the limited period of consistent observations. In addition, projections of future tropical cyclone activity are uncertain, because they often rely on coarse-resolution climate models that parameterize convection and hence have difficulty in directly representing tropical cyclones. Here we used convection-permitting regional climate model simulations to investigate whether and how recent destructive tropical cyclones would change if these events had occurred in pre-industrial and in future climates. We found that, relative to pre-industrial conditions, climate change so far has enhanced the average and extreme rainfall of hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria, but did not change tropical cyclone wind-speed intensity. In addition, future anthropogenic warming would robustly increase the wind speed and rainfall of 11 of 13 intense tropical cyclones (of 15 events sampled globally). Additional regional climate model simulations suggest that convective parameterization introduces minimal uncertainty into the sign of projected changes in tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall, which allows us to have confidence in projections from global models with parameterized convection and resolution fine enough to include tropical cyclones. Climate model simulations reveal that recent destructive tropical cyclones would have been equally intense in terms of wind speed but would have produced less rainfall if these events had occurred in pre-industrial climates, and in future climates they would have greater wind speeds and rainfall."

https://openalex.org/W2898822282,"Protein misfolding is linked to a wide array of human disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and type II diabetes1,2. Protective cellular protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms have evolved to selectively recognize misfolded proteins and limit their toxic effects3–9, thus contributing to the maintenance of the proteome (proteostasis). Here we examine how molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin–proteasome system cooperate to recognize and promote the clearance of soluble misfolded proteins. Using a panel of PQC substrates with distinct characteristics and localizations, we define distinct chaperone and ubiquitination circuitries that execute quality control in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the cytoplasm, proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins requires tagging with mixed lysine 48 (K48)- and lysine 11 (K11)-linked ubiquitin chains. A distinct combination of E3 ubiquitin ligases and specific chaperones is required to achieve each type of linkage-specific ubiquitination. In the nucleus, however, proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins requires only K48-linked ubiquitin chains, and is thus independent of K11-specific ligases and chaperones. The distinct ubiquitin codes for nuclear and cytoplasmic PQC appear to be linked to the function of the ubiquilin protein Dsk2, which is specifically required to clear nuclear misfolded proteins. Our work defines the principles of cytoplasmic and nuclear PQC as distinct, involving combinatorial recognition by defined sets of cooperating chaperones and E3 ligases. A better understanding of how these organelle-specific PQC requirements implement proteome integrity has implications for our understanding of diseases linked to impaired protein clearance and proteostasis dysfunction. Ubiquitin chains linked to cytoplasmic misfolded proteins are different from those linked to nuclear misfolded proteins, each requiring a distinct combination of molecular chaperones and ubiquitination circuitries."

https://openalex.org/W2898901924,"High-temperature copper oxide superconductors consist of stacked CuO2 planes, with electronic band structures and magnetic excitations that are primarily two-dimensional1,2, but with superconducting coherence that is three-dimensional. This dichotomy highlights the importance of out-of-plane charge dynamics, which has been found to be incoherent in the normal state3,4 within the limited range of momenta accessible by optics. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to explore the charge dynamics across all three dimensions of the Brillouin zone. Polarization analysis of recently discovered collective excitations (modes) in electron-doped copper oxides5–7 reveals their charge origin, that is, without mixing with magnetic components5–7. The excitations disperse along both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, revealing its three-dimensional nature. The periodicity of the out-of-plane dispersion corresponds to the distance between neighbouring CuO2 planes rather than to the crystallographic c-axis lattice constant, suggesting that the interplane Coulomb interaction is responsible for the coherent out-of-plane charge dynamics. The observed properties are hallmarks of the long-sought ‘acoustic plasmon’, which is a branch of distinct charge collective modes predicted for layered systems8–12 and argued to play a substantial part in mediating high-temperature superconductivity10–12. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering on electron-doped copper oxide superconductors reveals a three-dimensional charge collective mode, which has properties suggestive of the long-sought acoustic plasmon."

https://openalex.org/W2900473000,"One application of synthetic biology is the redesign of existing biological systems to acquire new functions. In this context, expanding the chemical code underlying key biosynthetic pathways will lead to the synthesis of compounds with new structures and potentially new biological activities. Terpenoids are a large group of specialized metabolites with numerous applications. Yet, being synthesized from five-carbon units, they are restricted to distinct classes that differ by five carbon atoms (C10, C15, C20, etc.). To expand the diversity of terpenoid structures, we engineered yeast cells to synthesize a noncanonical building block with 11 carbons, and produced 40 C11 terpene scaffolds that can form the basis for an entire terpenoid class. By identifying a single-residue switch that converts C10 plant monoterpene synthases to C11-specific enzymes, we engineered dedicated synthases for C11 terpene production. This approach will enable the systematic expansion of the chemical space accessed by terpenoids. Yeast engineered to produce the six-carbon terpene building block 2-methyl-geranyl diphosphate, coupled with terpene synthases engineered to accept this noncanonical substrate, enables the biosynthesis of a collection of new C11 terpenoid scaffolds."
https://openalex.org/W2795075035,"Alkaline-earth atoms have metastable ‘clock’ states with minute-long optical lifetimes, high-spin nuclei and SU(N)-symmetric interactions, making them powerful platforms for atomic clocks1, quantum information processing2 and quantum simulation3. Few-particle systems of such atoms provide opportunities to observe the emergence of complex many-body phenomena with increasing system size4. Multi-body interactions among particles are emergent phenomena, which cannot be broken down into sums over underlying pairwise interactions. They could potentially be used to create exotic states of quantum matter5,6, but have yet to be explored in ultracold fermions. Here we create arrays of isolated few-body systems in an optical clock based on a three-dimensional lattice of fermionic 87Sr atoms. We use high-resolution clock spectroscopy to directly observe the onset of elastic and inelastic multi-body interactions among atoms. We measure the frequency shifts of the clock transition for varying numbers of atoms per lattice site, from n = 1 to n = 5, and observe nonlinear interaction shifts characteristic of elastic multi-body effects. These measurements, combined with theory, elucidate an emergence of SU(N)-symmetric multi-body interactions, which are unique to fermionic alkaline-earth atoms. To study inelastic multi-body effects, we use these frequency shifts to isolate n-occupied sites in the lattice and measure the corresponding lifetimes of the clock states. This allows us to access the short-range few-body physics without experiencing the systematic effects that are encountered in a bulk gas. The lifetimes that we measure in the isolated few-body systems agree very well with numerical predictions based on a simple model for the interatomic potential, suggesting a universality in ultracold collisions. By connecting these few-body systems through tunnelling, the favourable energy and timescales of the interactions will allow our system to be used for studies of high-spin quantum magnetism7,8 and the Kondo effect3,9. Clock spectroscopy of ultracold strontium atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice is used to observe the onset of multi-body interactions that result from the underlying pairwise interactions between atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2901296535,"Neuromuscular weakness resulting in severe functional impairment is common in critical care survivors. This study aimed to evaluate effects of an early progressive rehabilitation intervention in mechanically ventilated adults at risk.This was a parallel, two-arm, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial with 6-months follow-up that was conducted in a mixed ICU of an academic centre in Switzerland. Previously independent, mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults with expected critical care stay ≥72 hours (n = 115) were randomised to a control group receiving standard physiotherapy including early mobilisation or to an experimental group with early endurance and resistance training combined with mobilisation. Primary endpoints were functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Distance) and functional independence (Functional Independence Measure) at hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints including muscle strength were assessed at critical care discharge. Safety was monitored closely by standard monitoring and predefined adverse events.Physiotherapy started within 48 hours of critical care admission while 97% of participants were still ventilated and 68% on inotropes. Compared to the control group (n = 57), the experimental group (n = 58) received significantly more physiotherapy (sessions: 407 vs 377, p<0.001; time/session: 25min vs 18min, p<0.001) and had less days with sedation (p<0.001). Adverse events were rare (0.6%) and without consequences. There were no significant between-group differences in 6-Minute Walk Distance (experimental 123m (IQR 25-280) vs control 100m (IQR 0-300); p = 0.542) or functional independence (98 (IQR 66-119) vs 98 (IQR 18-115); p = 0.308). Likewise, no differences were found for the secondary outcomes, except a trend towards improved mental health in the experimental group after 6 months (84 (IQR 68-88) vs 70 (IQR 64-76); p = 0.023).Early endurance and resistance training in mechanically ventilated, intensive care patients does not improve functional capacity or independence at hospital discharge compared to early standard physiotherapy but may improve mental health 6-months after critical care discharge.German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS): DRKS00004347, registered on 10 September 2012."
https://openalex.org/W2808177665,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyses the only known de novo pathway for the production of all four deoxyribonucleotides that are required for DNA synthesis1,2. It is essential for all organisms that use DNA as their genetic material and is a current drug target3,4. Since the discovery that iron is required for function in the aerobic, class I RNR found in all eukaryotes and many bacteria, a dinuclear metal site has been viewed as necessary to generate and stabilize the catalytic radical that is essential for RNR activity5–7. Here we describe a group of RNR proteins in Mollicutes—including Mycoplasma pathogens—that possess a metal-independent stable radical residing on a modified tyrosyl residue. Structural, biochemical and spectroscopic characterization reveal a stable 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) radical species that directly supports ribonucleotide reduction in vitro and in vivo. This observation overturns the presumed requirement for a dinuclear metal site in aerobic ribonucleotide reductase. The metal-independent radical requires new mechanisms for radical generation and stabilization, processes that are targeted by RNR inhibitors. It is possible that this RNR variant provides an advantage under metal starvation induced by the immune system. Organisms that encode this type of RNR—some of which are developing resistance to antibiotics—are involved in diseases of the respiratory, urinary and genital tracts. Further characterization of this RNR family and its mechanism of cofactor generation will provide insight into new enzymatic chemistry and be of value in devising strategies to combat the pathogens that utilize it. We propose that this RNR subclass is denoted class Ie. A subclass of ribonucleotide reductase in Mycoplasma pathogens contains a stable radical formed from a modified tyrosine residue, overturning the presumed requirement for a dinuclear metal site in aerobic ribonucleotide reductase."

However, the upstream signaling that mediates autophagy activation in response to ER stress is incompletely understood. In this study, in vivo and in vitro approaches were utilized that include gain- and loss-of-function assays and mouse livers and human cell lines with tunicamycin-induced pharmacological ER stress. We report that calreticulin, a quality control chaperone that binds to misfolded glycoproteins for refolding in the ER, is induced under ER stress. Calreticulin overexpression stimulated the formation of autophagosomes and increased autophagic flux. Interestingly, calreticulin was sufficient for attenuating ER stress in tunicamycin- or thapsigargin-treated HeLa cells, whereas lentivirus-mediated shRNA calreticulin knockdown exacerbated ER stress. Mechanistically, we noted that calreticulin induces autophagy by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3). Confocal microscopy revealed that the colocalization of calreticulin and LC3 at the autophagosome was enhanced under ER stress conditions. Importantly, a conserved LC3-interacting region was necessary for calreticulin-mediated stimulation of autophagy and for reducing ER stress.

However, the signaling pathways that couple ER stress to autophagy are not completely understood. Calreticulin, an ER-localized Ca2+-binding chaperone, is known for its roles in protein folding and quality control.

However, whether and how calreticulin alleviates ER stress via other mechanisms is not understood. Recently, we demonstrated that activation of the UPR and autophagy attenuates hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (2Chen X. Zhang F. Gong Q. Cui A. Zhuo S. Hu Z. Han Y. Gao J. Sun Y. Liu Z.

Here we sought to investigate the mechanisms of ER stress–induced activation of autophagy and its role in alleviating ER stress. These data suggest that ER stress induces expression of calreticulin, calreticulin stimulates the formation of autophagosome and induces autophagic flux, activation of calreticulin is sufficient to attenuate ER stress, and the LIR motif of calreticulin is of key importance in connecting autophagic machinery to inhibit ER stress. These findings provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of ER stress rescue signaling and may potentially become a novel therapeutic target for stress-induced disorders and proteostasis deficiencies. Although it has been well-known that the expression of various chaperones is responsively stimulated to cope with ER stress conditions, evidence of calreticulin stimulation is scarce (34Schardt J.A. Eyholzer M. Timchenko N.A. Mueller B.U. Pabst T. Unfolded protein response suppresses CEBPA by induction of calreticulin in acute myeloid leukaemia.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2010; 14 (19659458): 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To demonstrate whether calreticulin is stimulated by ER stress, we generated an ER stress murine model via intraperitoneal administration of an ER stress inducer, tunicamycin, and determined the hepatic expression of calreticulin. As expected, the livers of tunicamycin-treated mice showed significantly increased levels of GRP78, a representative marker of ER stress, compared with control individuals (Fig. 1A). The protein expression of hepatic calreticulin was increased in tunicamycin-treated mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with these findings, as shown in Fig. 1, C–F, calreticulin was dose-dependently up-regulated in HeLa cells treated with tunicamycin and another ER stress inducer, thapsigargin. Notably, the induction of ER stress by tunicamycin or thapsigargin was evidenced by the induction of GRP78, CHOP, and XBP1. These observations were highly consistent with previous reports (34Schardt J.A. Eyholzer M. Timchenko N.A. Mueller B.U. Pabst T. Unfolded protein response suppresses CEBPA by induction of calreticulin in acute myeloid leukaemia.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2010; 14 (19659458): 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and led us to explore the significance of calreticulin up-regulation in response to ER stress conditions. Given that calreticulin acts as a chaperone to assist protein folding, we hypothesized that calreticulin deficiency may lead to exacerbated ER stress. To confirm this hypothesis, calreticulin-deficient or control HeLa cells were generated using a lentivirus stably expressing calreticulin shRNA (shCRT) or negative control shRNA (shNC). As shown in Fig. 2A, the protein levels of calreticulin were effectively suppressed by shCRT#2 but not by the other shRNA, shCRT#1. Next, cells stably expressing shCRT#2 and shNC were treated with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, and the representative ER stress markers GRP78 and CHOP were measured. Immunoblotting and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to guarantee the efficiency of RNAi in shCRT (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). As expected, shCRT cells showed increased protein levels of GRP78 (Fig. 2, B and E) and increased mRNA levels of GRP78 and CHOP (Fig. 2, D and G), which indicated profound sensitivity to drug-induced ER stress. To further illustrate the function of calreticulin in ER stress, we transiently overexpressed myc-CRT in HeLa cells, treated the cells with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, and then determined the ER stress levels by immunoblotting. In contrast to the results of knockdown experiments, a progressive decrease in GRP78 was observed when the calreticulin expression level was gradually increased (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting a reduction of ER stress. These data support a protective role of calreticulin in response to cellular stress. We next sought to investigate the underlying mechanism of calreticulin ameliorating ER stress. In previous studies, a set of chaperones were revealed to facilitate the degradation of unfolded or misfolded proteins under stress conditions (4Chakrabarti A. Chen A.W. Varner J.D. A review of the mammalian unfolded protein response.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011; 108 (21809331): 2777-279310.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar5Hetz C. Chevet E.

Based on these discoveries, we presumed that calreticulin may be activated in response to ER stress to function similarly. Thus, we focused our study on the relationship between calreticulin and protein degradation machineries. We found that autophagic levels were elevated under the same condition, represented by an increase in the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio (Fig. 4, A and B). Notably, the expression levels of p62 are decreased by CRT under tunicamycin and thapsigargin treatment, which is consistent with the autophagic stimulating effects of CRT. Immunofluorescence imaging manifested more LC3 puncta in the cytoplasm of calreticulin-overexpressing cells, which indicated a growth in autophagosome numbers (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicate that calreticulin promotes autophagic flux in response to ER stress. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4, E and F, knockdown of calreticulin decreased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in HeLa cells treated with doses of tunicamycin or thapsigargin, suggesting that calreticulin is necessary for ER stress–induced autophagy. Together, these data indicate that calreticulin may couples ER stress signals to stimulate autophagy. To gain deep insight into the link between calreticulin and the autophagic degradation pathway, we studied the interaction between calreticulin and autophagic proteins. Strikingly, an evolutionarily conserved LIR, containing the motif W/Y/FXXL/I/V (X represents any residue) and existing in most LC3-interacting proteins (37Birgisdottir Å. B Lamark T. Johansen T. The LIR motif: crucial for selective autophagy.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 (23908376): 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), was identified in human calreticulin protein from amino acids 200 to 204 (Fig. 5A). To verify the interaction of calreticulin with LC3, HEK293T cells were transfected with GST-tagged LC3 and GFP-tagged calreticulin constructs, and then GST pulldown was performed. As shown in Fig. 5B, the subsequent immunoblotting results showed a clear band of GFP-calreticulin, in contrast to the GST vector–expressing control group. To identify the binding site of calreticulin, we mutated the key residues Trp200 and Leu203 into Ala to establish the null mutation of the LIR motif (W200A, L203A) of calreticulin (calreticulin ΔLIR) and subjected the mutant to a GST pulldown test. Strikingly, the calreticulin ΔLIR mutant does not bind GST-tagged LC3 (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate that the LIR motif is essential for the association between calreticulin and LC3. We supposed that the binding capacity of calreticulin with LC3 might be altered under ER stress conditions. Thus, we measured the amount of coimmunoprecipitated calreticulin under treatment with ER stress inducers. To avoid possible influence of alterations of endogenous protein expression under stress conditions, GFP-tagged calreticulin and LC3 were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, and then GST pulldown was performed. Interestingly, the association between calreticulin and LC3 was profoundly increased in a dose response to tunicamycin or thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, an immunofluorescence imaging analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, compared with the control vehicle, treatment with tunicamycin increased the colocalization of calreticulin and LC3 under chloroquine conditions in HeLa cells. Notably, increased numbers of LC3 puncta by tunicamycin were observed. These results indicate that ER stress may increase the association between calreticulin and LC3 via the conserved LIR motif. To further investigate the potential role of calreticulin/LC3 interaction in the regulation of autophagy, we expressed myc-CRT WT or the ΔLIR variant in HeLa cells and treated the cells with tunicamycin or thapsigargin. Autophagic flux assays were performed using chloroquine, a robust inhibitor of lysosomal hydrolases, to accumulate autophagosomal LC3-II. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, in contrast to calreticulin WT–expressing cells, calreticulin-induced expression of LC3-II was largely abrogated in calreticulin ΔLIR variant–expressing cells, suggesting a dramatic decline in autophagic flux. Consistently, calreticulin ΔLIR variant–expressing cells exhibited less GFP-LC3 puncta compared with calreticulin WT–expressing cells under the same treatment in immunofluorescence imaging experiments (Figs. 4C and 6D). These data suggest that the LIR motif is required for calreticulin in the up-regulation of autophagic activity. We next checked the ER stress levels in calreticulin ΔLIR–expressing HeLa cells compared with calreticulin WT–expressing cells under treatment with tunicamycin. The calreticulin ΔLIR–expressing cells presented a slight improvement in GRP78 signals as opposed to the attenuated bands in calreticulin WT–expressing cells (Fig. 6C). These findings indicate destruction of the protective role of calreticulin against ER stress conditions caused by the abolishment of calreticulin/LC3 interaction. Taken together, we propose that up-regulation of autophagy might be the mechanism underlying calreticulin-repressed ER stress. To verify the protective role of autophagy, genetic approaches to activate or inhibit autophagy levels by overexpressing or knocking down the key autophagy components Atg5 or LC3 were performed. As shown in Fig. 7, HeLa cells with higher autophagy levels showed relatively low GRP78 levels compared with control cells, indicating their stronger tolerance of ER stress. This difference was increased under ER stress conditions. In contrast, knockdown of LC3 using shRNA caused induction of GRP78, suggesting increased ER stress. These data support the notion that autophagy activation mediates calreticulin's beneficial effects on alleviation of ER stress. This study demonstrates that calreticulin is a novel ER stress–inducible gene and exerts a negative feedback control system on alleviating ER stress. Mechanistically, calreticulin ameliorates ER stress in an autophagy-dependent manner, and the association between calreticulin and LC3 is critical for calreticulin’s effects on augmentation of autophagy and repression of ER stress. Calreticulin-mediated regulation of autophagy and ER stress may represent a molecular mechanism by which ER stress is sensed to maintain the cellular proteostasis state.

In this respect, eHealth could be of support. This paper aims to describe the implementation of eHealth technologies in integrated care programs for people with multimorbidity in Europe, and to analyse related benefits and barriers according to outcomes from ICARE4EU study and within the more general conceptual framework of the ""10 e's"" in eHealth by Gunther Eysenbach.In 2014, ICARE4EU project identified 101 integrated care programs in 24 European countries. Expert organizations and managers of the programs completed an on-line questionnaire addressing several aspects including the adoption of eHealth. Findings from this questionnaire were analyzed, by linking in particular benefits and barriers of eHealth with the ""10 e's"" by Eysenbach (Efficiency, Enhancing, Evidence-based, Empowerment, Encouragement, Education, Enabling, Extending, Ethics, and Equity).Out of 101 programs, 85 adopted eHealth tools, of which 42 focused explicitly on older people. eHealth could improve care integration/management, quality of care/life and cost-efficiency, whereas inadequate funding represents a major barrier. The ""10 e's"" by Eysenbach seem to show contact points with ICARE4EU findings, in particular when referring to positive aspects of eHealth such as Efficiency and Enhancing quality of care/life, although Empowerment/Education of patients, care Equity and Ethics issues seem crucial in this respect. Encouragement of a new relationship patient-health professional, and Enabling standardized exchange of electronic information, represent further aspects impacting integration/management of care.Aspects of eHealth, which emerged as benefits and barriers impacting integration/management of care, as well as cost-efficiency and quality of care/life, can be identified on the basis of both ICARE4EU findings and the ""10 e's"" in eHealth by Eysenbach. They could represent objectives of new policies for supporting the deployment of eHealth technologies within integrated care across Europe."

To achieve an optimum use in food products, their rapid and precise quantification after encapsulation and storage is required. Hence, a rapid ATR-FTIR method was developed and tested with two encapsulated essential oils (EOs): clove (Syzygium aromaticum) and spearmint (Mentha spicata);. Despite, the complexity of the matrix, this method coupled with univariate or multivariate regression models exhibited high potential for global quantification of the two encapsulated EOs. For clove EO, in relation to the major presence of eugenol and eugenol acetate, an analysis based on a unique band (1514 cm-1) was sufficient to obtain a good prediction with RMSEP value of 0.0173 g of EO per g of matrix. For spearmint oil which is characterized by numerous terpenoid compound, three bands (799, 885, and 1680–1676 cm-1) were suitable for a good prediction with RMSEP value of 0.0133. ATR-FTIR method was compared with a reference gas chromatography FID quantitative method in an EO release experiment and its efficiency was evaluated through modeling by the Avrami equation. Beside time saving, the ATR-FTIR method was also capable of monitoring the EO profile. This method could be easily adapted as a routine analysis in the EOs industry as quality control."

The acyl chain of FakB2(18:1) is completely buried in the protein interior with only the carboxyl group exposed at the protein surface.

S. aureus has two FakB proteins: FakB1 that binds saturated FA and FakB2 that is specific for monounsaturated FA (2Parsons J.B. Broussard T.C. Bose J.L. Rosch J.W. Jackson P. Subramanian C. Rock C.O.

Other bacteria have between one and four FakB homologs, but the physiological roles of multiple FA-binding proteins and the structural basis for acyl chain selectivity remain open questions. Here, we report the structures of S. aureus FakB1 bound to four different straight and branched-chain saturated FA produced by the bacterium. FakB1 and FakB2 have acyl chain binding tunnels with distinctly different shapes that account for the acyl chain selectivity of the two proteins, but the protein surfaces are conserved. This allows the two FakBs to not only interact with FakA, but also with the two downstream enzymes that utilize FakB(FA∼P) as substrates in bacterial lipid metabolism (PlsX and PlsY). Cellular thermal shift experiments performed with growing S. aureus suggest that FakB1 normally has a bound FA, whereas FakB2 does not. These data lead to a model where FakB1 functions in cellular lipid homeostasis in the absence of exogenous FA, whereas the key function of FakB2 is to activate environmental 18:1Δ9, an abundant host FA that S. aureus does not produce but is incorporated into membrane phospholipids by the FA kinase pathway. A single FakB1-FA species for crystallization trials was obtained by exchanging 16:0 into purified FakB1 and removing excess FA by gel-filtration chromatography (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J.

The C-terminal domain contains a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by two α-helices on one side and three on the other side (Fig. 1A). The structures of FakB1(16:0) and the previously determined FakB2(18:1) superimpose very well (Fig. 1A).

An exposed flexible loop adjacent to the FA carboxyl group was not visible in the FakB2(18:1) structure (residues 174–183), but this loop in FakB1 (16:0) (residues 176–187) is resolved in one of the two monomers of the asymmetric unit (monomer A) (Fig. 1A, Loop). This loop is adjacent to Arg-205 and may also be involved in the interaction with FakA, although its primary sequence is not conserved when compared with the FakB2 loop.Table 1Data collection statistics for FakB1–fatty acid complexesFatty acids14:0a15:016:0a17:0PDB codes5WOO6ALW5UTO6B9IData collection BeamlineSER-CAT 22-IDSER-CAT 22-BMSER-CAT 22-IDSER-CAT 22-BM Temperature (K)100100100100 Wavelength (Å)1.00001.00001.00001.0000 Space groupP1P1P1P1Unit cell parameters (Å) a, b, c33.39, 54.45, 84.9133.35, 54.53, 84.4233.19, 54.29, 84.4032.99, 54.17, 83.90 α, β, γ104.89, 90.21, 107.76105.13, 90.00, 107.81105.18, 90.02, 107.50104.71, 90.00, 107.73 Resolution range (Å)81.73–1.7881.18–1.6348.83–1.8380.87–1.93 Rmerge0.086 (0.676)0.184 (0.906)0.067 (0.641)0.135 (0.629) Rp.i.m.0.051 (0.395)0.106 (0.524)0.046 (0.443)0.080 (0.592) No. of observations194,540 (11,418)263,005 (13,084)141,973 (8479)150,843 (5254) No. of unique reflections50,586 (2913)66,112 (3294)46,256 (2815)39,271 (2578) Multiplicity3.8 (3.9)4.0 (4.0)3.1 (3.0)3.8 (2.0) Mean I/σ(I)9.8 (2.0)8.6 (2.0)12.3 (1.9)10.1 (1.9) Mean (I) half-set correlation0.996 (0.736)0.985 (0.662)0.998 (0.694)0.992 (0.487) Completeness (%)96.2 (95.9)97.2 (95.2)97.1 (95.3)97.9 (96.4) Wilson B-factor (Å−2)19.687.7615.2116.73Model quality Rwork/Rfree value (%)15.1/20.015.4/19.615.8/19.116.6/20.6Root mean square deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.0060.0100.0030.003 Bond angles (°)0.8010.9610.5400.550 Coordinates error (ML, Å)0.170.180.190.21 Protein residues575569575561Average B-factor (Å−2) All atoms27.5416.4625.9522.63 Protein atoms25.6513.5824.6221.43 Fatty acid atoms24.1524.2315.6830.86 Solvent atoms40.9731.2436.1132.79Ramachandran plot Favored (%)98.5998.2297.3698.92 Allowed (%)1.231.421.761.08 Outliers (%)0.180.360.880.00 Clashscore6.296.213.422.64 Open table in a new tab An overlay of the FakB1(16:0) and FakB2(18:1) structures centered on the FA carboxyl group reveals that the carboxyl-binding sites are essentially identical (Fig. 1B). The carboxyl group is held firmly in place by a hydrogen bond network consisting of a serine on one side and a threonine–histidine pair on the other side. The four FakB1 residues, Thr-62, Ser-95, His-270, and Arg-173, correspond to Thr-61, Ser-93, His-266, and Arg-170 in FakB2. Arg-170 is essential for catalysis in FakB2 (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol.

Arg-173 mediates the same interaction with the bound FA in FakB1. As noted for FakB2, the location of Arg-173 suggests that it is ideally positioned to interact with the dianionic FA∼P product bound to FakB1 and/or to participate in the phosphotransfer reaction (Fig. 1C). Arg-173 is connected to a network of three water molecules that hovers above the carboxyl group (Fig. 1C), and one can envision that the phosphate oxygens would displace these water molecules in a phosphorylated FakB1(16:0-PO4) intermediate. Multiple saturated straight and branched-chain FA are found in S. aureus phospholipids, which suggests that the FakB1 hydrophobic acyl chain binding tunnel should be flexible enough to accommodate this spectrum of FA. The structures of FakB1 in complex with 14:0, a15:0, and a17:0 FA were obtained by exchanging the indicated FA into FakB1, and re-purifying the protein complexes by gel-filtration chromatography to remove unbound FA and detergent prior to crystallization (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (26774272): 6292-630310.1074/jbc.M115.706820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The electron densities of all four of the FA in the FakB1 structures are illustrated in Fig. 2A. The FakB1 tunnel is a slightly curved space that expands and contracts to accommodate the different FA chain lengths. This movement arises at the terminus of the FakB1 FA binding tunnel through the re-positioning of the Ile-233 side chain that functions like a “swinging gate” that undergoes a hinge-like motion to either increase or decrease the length of the FA-binding channel (Fig. 2, B and C). This movement of Ile-233 allows the tunnel to easily accommodate the two additional carbons in the FakB1(16:0) structure compared with the FakB1(14:0) structure. Branched-chain anteiso-FA (a15:0 and a17:0) are major constituents of S. aureus phospholipids, and they are exclusively the S stereoisomer (11Hauff S. Rilfors L. Hottinger G. Vetter W. Structure and absolute configuration of an unsaturated anteiso fatty acid from Bacillus megaterium.J. Chromatogr. A. 2010; 1217 (20117788): 1683-168710.1016/j.chroma.2010.01.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When a racemic mixture (S and R) of a15:0 was exchanged into FakB1 prior to crystallization, both stereoisomers were represented in the electron density map, although there was a preference for the S isomer (60% S and 40% R). In contrast, only the S isomer was observed in the FakB1 tunnel when the experiment was performed using racemic a17:0. Thus, the additional carbon atoms in a17:0 clearly impose a stricter chain-length and stereospecificity within the FakB1 tunnel. These data show that the binding tunnel in FakB1 is structurally tuned to accommodate the major straight and branched-chain FA produced by S. aureus. There are many FakB structures in the PDB database, but not all are refined with FA in the acyl-chain binding tunnel. This is due in part to the structures being determined prior to the discovery that they are FA-binding proteins in the FA kinase system and that FakBs may bind multiple FA. If care is not taken to exchange a single FA into the pocket, the electron density will reflect the mixture of FA structures that were picked up by the protein during the protein expression. Purified FakBs must have a ligand bound in the pocket to stabilize the protein and allow it to be manipulated in vitro. We examined and re-refined two deposited FakB structures, from Ruminococcus gnavus (old PDB code 3JR7) and Eubacterium eligens (old PDB code 3FDJ), to determine whether there is a FA present and to establish its identity (Table 2). Both structures have PEG modeled in the tunnel. Both structures indeed have a bound FA that makes similar interactions to those described above for the S. aureus FakBs. R. gnavus FakB (new PDB code 5V85) was successfully refined with cis-vaccenic acid (18:1Δ11), a major monounsaturated FA of E. coli, and E. eligens was refined with a saturated FA, 17:0 (new PDB code 5UXY). These analyses suggest that all the deposited FakB structures will turn out to have a FA, or a mixture of FA, bound in their tunnels.Table 2Re-analysis of two PDB entries to identify bound fatty acidFatty acids17:018:1Δ11PDB codes5UXY (corrected 3FDJ)5V85 (corrected 3JR7)Data collection Temperature (K)100100 Wavelength (Å)0.97942–0.979290.9794 Space groupP 41 21 2P 31 2 1Unit cell parameters (Å) a, b, c57.45, 57.45, 186.5696.90, 96.90, 159.92 α, β, γ90.00, 90.00, 90.0090.00, 90.00, 120.00 Resolution range (Å)48.91–1.8083.92–2.00 Rmerge0.132 (0.804)(0.352) No. of unique reflections30,039 (1990)58,785 (4131) Multiplicity7.7 (7.8) Mean I/σ(I)19.9 (2.0)17.9 (2.1) Mean (I) half-set correlation CC(1/2)NANA Completeness (%)99.5 (97.2)99.4 (99.5) Wilson B-factor (Å−2)18.7122.26Model quality Rwork/Rfree value (%)15.3/19.616.5/19.8 Root mean square deviations0.017 / 1.4030.003/0.533 Bond lengths (Å)0.180.19 Bond angles (°)1.350.54 Coordinates error (maximum likelihood, Å)0.180.19 Protein residues276557Average B-factor (Å2) All atoms24.2130.45 Protein atoms21.9028.75 Fatty acid atoms27.8738.84 Solvent atoms37.1441.79Ramachandran plot Favored (%)98.5497.81 Allowed (%)1.462.19 Outliers (%)0.000.00 Clashscore3.214.09 Open table in a new tab Despite the similarities in the overall structures of FakB1 and FakB2, the two proteins clearly possess different internal organizations that create FA binding tunnels with distinctly different shapes (Fig. 2, D and E). The most significant difference is that, whereas the FakB1 tunnel is slightly curved, the FakB2(18:1Δ9) tunnel has a sharp turn at the 9-carbon of the bound FA to accommodate the kink in the acyl chain that is present due to the 9-cis conformation of the double bond. This significant difference is accomplished by amino acid alterations at key locations within the proteins' hydrophobic cores to create these specific tunnel shapes. Most notably, the FakB1 residues Phe-193, Ile-198, and Phe-263 occupy the region where the hydrocarbon chain following the cis double bond is found in the FakB2 tunnel, whereas FakB2 residues Gly-273, Val-275, and Leu-155 occupy the space where the distal end of the saturated FA tunnel in FakB1 is located. Ile-198 of FakB1 sits under the FA in Fig. 2D at the position where the kink in the tunnel occurs in FakB2. Whereas the kinked 18:1Δ9 chain cannot fit within the slightly curved hydrophobic tunnel of FakB1, the flexible 16:0 chain should be able to fit into the kinked FakB2 tunnel. We have been unable to isolate FakB proteins without a bound FA. The FA remains bound unless there is a compatible FA present in phospholipid vesicles or detergent micelles with which it can exchange (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol.

FakB that lacks a FA is unstable in vitro and readily precipitates from solution. The importance of the interactions between the protein and the FA carboxyl are critical for the thermal stability of FakB2 (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol.

The deletion of one hydrogen bond in the FakB2(S93A) mutant lowers the denaturation temperature from 50 to 33 °C (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol.

For example, FakB2 expression in Escherichia coli with 18:1 in the medium results in high levels of protein expression and the recovery of 100% soluble FakB2(18:1). The same experiment in the absence of 18:1 in the medium achieved the same level of protein expression, but it only results in 50% recovery of soluble FakB2 that contained 18:1 obtained from the E. coli host (data not shown). However, in vivo, FA-free FakB proteins must exist because FakB(FA∼P) is used as an acyl donor for at least two downstream enzymes. To confirm this, we first determined whether PlsY utilizes FA∼P from FakB2(FA∼P) (Fig. 3A). Assays containing FakA, FakB2(18:1), [14C]glycerol-phosphate, and membranes derived from S. aureus strain PDJ39 (ΔplsX) containing PlsY resulted in the rapid formation of LPA. The formation of LPA was saturable, suggesting that the transfer of FA∼P occurred by FakB2 binding to PlsY (Fig. 3B). Although these data are consistent with FA∼P bound to FakB2 being directly transferred to PlsY, one cannot completely rule out that the FA∼P bound to FakB2 was first deposited in the membrane where it subsequently encountered the acyltransferase. To rule out this possibility, we next examined the transfer of FA∼P bound to FakB2 to a soluble protein partner, PlsX. We exchanged [14C]18:1 onto FakB2 and then isolated the FakB2([14C]18:1) complex by gel-filtration chromatography to remove unbound [14C]18:1. Assays with PlsX and ACP led to the complete conversion of the 18:1∼P from FakB2 to acyl-ACP (Fig. 3C). Gel-filtration chromatography was also used to demonstrate that all the FakB2([14C]18:1) was transferred to [14C]18:1-ACP in a FakA-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). FakA, PlsX, and ACP are all soluble proteins, and there was no detergent in the assay. These data mean that FA-free FakB2 must be a product of the reaction and that FA∼P bound to FakB is removed from the protein through its interaction with downstream metabolic enzymes leaving FA-free FakB. We developed a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to investigate whether FakB contains a bound FA in vivo. Ligand binding typically stabilizes proteins to thermal denaturation, and the CETSA technique is commonly used in drug discovery to monitor drug-target engagement inside cells (12Martinez Molina D. Jafari R. Ignatushchenko M. Seki T. Larsson E.A. Dan C. Sreekumar L. Cao Y. Nordlund P.

If FakB has a bound FA, it will be more stable to thermal denaturation than in the absence of FA (7Broussard T.C. Miller D.J. Jackson P. Nourse A. White S.W. Rock C.O. Biochemical roles for conserved residues in the bacterial fatty acid binding protein family.J. Biol.

These in vivo experiments required the generation of antibodies that specifically detect either FakB1 or FakB2. We generated polyclonal rabbit antibodies and purified the IgG fraction by affinity chromatography on FakB1- or FakB2-Sepharose. These affinity-purified antibodies only signaled the protein of interest in immunoblots of whole S. aureus extracts (Fig. 4). Anti-FakB1 did not cross-react with FakB2 (Fig. 4A), and anti-FakB2 did not cross-react with FakB1 (Fig. 4B). We began by analyzing FakB2 because this FA-binding protein prefers 18:1, a FA that is abundant in mammalian hosts but is not produced by S. aureus. The addition of 18:1 to the culture medium resulted in a significant stabilization of FakB2 to thermal denaturation (Fig. 5A). The results from three independent replicates showed that there was a shift of 6.2 °C in the stability of FakB2 following exposure to 18:1. These data indicate that a significant proportion of FakB2 does not contain a bound FA unless 18:1 was provided in the medium. We next performed the reverse experiment. Cells were first grown with oleate, and a sample was obtained. Then, the 18:1 was removed from the medium; the cells were grown for 1 h to deplete the cellular 18:1 by incorporation into phospholipid, and the second sample was harvested. The FakB2 population was stabilized to heat denaturation in the presence of 18:1 and returned to its"

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of MNM in eastern Ethiopia using an adapted sub-Saharan Africa MNM tool and compare its applicability with the original WHO MNM tool.We applied the sub-Saharan Africa and WHO MNM criteria to 1054 women admitted with potentially life-threatening conditions (including 28 deaths) in Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital and Jugel Hospital between January 2016 and April 2017. Discharge records were examined to identify deaths or women who developed MNM according to the sub-Saharan or WHO criteria. We calculated and compared MNM and severe maternal outcome ratios. Mortality index (ratio of maternal deaths to SMO) was calculated as indicator of quality of care.The sub-Saharan Africa criteria identified 594 cases of MNM and all the 28 deaths while the WHO criteria identified 128 cases of MNM and 26 deaths. There were 7404 livebirths during the same period. This gives MNM ratios of 80 versus 17 per 1000 live births for the adapted and original WHO criteria. Mortality index was 4.5% and 16.9% in the adapted and WHO criteria respectively. The major difference between the two criteria can be attributed to eclampsia, sepsis and differences in the threshold for transfusion of blood.The sub-Saharan Africa criteria identified all the MNM cases identified by the WHO criteria and all the maternal deaths. Applying the WHO criteria alone will cause under reporting of MNM cases (including maternal deaths) in this low-resource setting. The mortality index of 4.5% among women who fulfilled the adapted MNM criteria justifies labeling these women as having 'life-threatening conditions'."
https://openalex.org/W2901953846,"Complement binding activity of donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) has been suggested as a new tool to stratify immunologic risk in kidney transplantation (KT). The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical implication of C1q/C3d binding activity of de novo DSA (dnDSA) in KT recipients.A total of 161 pretransplant DSA-negative recipients were monitored for dnDSA at the time of biopsy. C1q/C3d binding activities of dnDSA were assessed using C1qScreen assay (One lambda, USA) and Lifecodes C3d detection assay (Immucor, USA), respectively. Clinical outcomes including biopsy-proven antibody mediated rejection (AMR), C4d detection and post-biopsy graft survival were investigated.De-novo DSAs were detected in fifty-four (33.5%) patients (HLA class I only, n = 19; class II only, n = 29; both class I and II, n = 6). Of them, complement binding activities were detected in 26 (48.1%) patients, including 17 C1q+ and 24 C3d+ patients. Both C1q and C3d positivity were associated with increased mean fluorescence intensity values of dnDSA. Complement binding activity of dnDSA enhanced the incidence of AMR (25.0% in C1q-C3d-, 36.4% in C1q+/C3d- or C1q-/C3d+, and 60.0% in C1q+/C3d+ patients) (P <0.001). The incidence of AMR was not different between patients with C1q+ and those with C3d+ dnDSA (64.7%, 11/17 versus 45.8%, 11/24, P = 0.238). In comparison between C1q and C3d assay according to HLA specificity, C1q+ HLA class I ± II dnDSA was the best predictor for AMR (odds ratio: 27.2). C1q+/C3d+ dnDSA was associated with more C4d deposition in allograft tissue and inferior post-biopsy graft survival. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different between C1q+ and C3d+ dnDSA-positive patients.Detection of complement binding activity using both C1q and C3d assays can be a further prognostic marker for predicting AMR and allograft outcome in dnDSA+ kidney transplant patients."
https://openalex.org/W2901021818,"As current treatment of tuberculosis is burdensomely long, provoking non-adherence and drug resistance, effective short-course treatments are needed. Using the output-driven parabolic response surface (PRS) platform, we have identified drug regimens that treat tuberculosis more rapidly in mice than the current Standard Regimen used in humans. We show that PRS Regimen III, comprising clofazimine, SQ109, bedaquiline and pyrazinamide, rapidly sterilizes the lung both in conventionally studied BALB/c mice and in C3HeB/FeJ mice, highly susceptible mice that develop massive necrotic granulomatous lung lesions akin to those in humans, achieving relapse-free cure in only 4 weeks (p<0.0001 versus Standard Regimen). In contrast, the Standard Regimen required 16 weeks to attain lung culture negative status and 20 weeks to achieve relapse-free cure. Thus, PRS Regimen III dramatically cuts by ~80% the time to relapse-free cure in mouse tuberculosis models. PRS Regimen III, with three nonstandard drugs, can potentially treat both drug-sensitive and most drug-resistant tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2900605974,"Rapid expression of critical stress response factors is a key survival strategy for diseased or stressed cells. During cell stress, translation is inhibited, and a pre-existing pool of cytoplasmic mRNA–protein complexes reversibly assembles into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Gle1 is a conserved modulator of RNA-dependent DEAD-box proteins required for mRNA export, translation, and stress responses. Proper Gle1 function is critical as reflected by some human diseases such as developmental and neurodegenerative disorders and some cancers linked to gle1 mutations. However, the mechanism by which Gle1 controls SG formation is incompletely understood. Here, we show that human Gle1 is regulated by phosphorylation during heat shock stress. In HeLa cells, stress-induced Gle1 hyperphosphorylation was dynamic, primarily in the cytoplasmic pool, and followed changes in translation factors. MS analysis identified 14 phosphorylation sites in the Gle1A isoform, six of which clustered in an intrinsically disordered, low-complexity N-terminal region flanking the coil-coiled self-association domain. Of note, two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated the Gle1A N-terminal domain, priming it for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). A phosphomimetic gle1A6D variant (in which six putative Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites were substituted with Asp) perturbed self-association and inhibited DEAD-box helicase 3 (X-linked) (DDX3) ATPase activity. Expression of alanine-substituted, phosphodeficient GFP-gle1A6A promoted SG assembly, whereas GFP-gle1A6D enhanced SG disassembly. We propose that MAPKs and GSK3 phosphorylate Gle1A and thereby coordinate SG dynamics by altering DDX3 function.

https://openalex.org/W2900921321,"Island biotas have disproportionately influenced the history and development of evolutionary biology, but understanding their genesis and evolution across geological timescales has been hindered by a poor fossil record. Here we augment the insular Eocene (~43 Ma) mammalian fauna known from the Pontide terrane of central Anatolia by describing two new metatherian taxa (stem marsupials) from the Lülük Member of the Uzunçarşıdere Formation in the Orhaniye Basin. Geological and paleontological data indicate that the Pontide terrane was an island on the northern margin of Neotethys during the middle Eocene. Reflecting its geodynamic context in a region of active tectonic convergence, the Eocene Pontide terrane hosted a unique combination of Laurasian and Gondwanan mammals, including an anachronistic radiation of pleuraspidotheriids (archaic ungulates) that went extinct on the European mainland ~13 Ma earlier. Most of the mammalian clades occupying the Pontide terrane colonized it by dispersal across marine barriers rather than being stranded there through vicariance. Endemic radiations of pleuraspidotheriid ungulates and polydolopimorphian metatherians on the Pontide terrane reveal that in situ diversification was an important factor contributing to faunal assembly and evolution. The insular fauna that arose on the Pontide terrane is highly analogous to that of modern Sulawesi, which evolved under strikingly similar geological conditions. Illustrating the ephemeral nature of insular biotas across macroevolutionary timescales, the demise of the Pontide fauna coincided with paleogeographic changes enabling more cosmopolitan taxa to reach it for the first time. The high level of endemism shown by the mammalian fauna of the Uzunçarşıdere Formation eliminates the Pontide terrane as a potential early Eocene dispersal corridor between western Europe and India."
https://openalex.org/W2900982276,"Crab species are economically and ecologically important in coastal ecosystems, and their spatial distributions are pivotal for conservation and fisheries management. This study was focused on modelling the spatial distributions of three Portunidae crabs (Charybdis bimaculata, Charybdis japonica, and Portunus trituberculatus) in Haizhou Bay, China. We applied three analytical approaches (Generalized additive model (GAM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN)) to spring and fall bottom trawl survey data (2011, 2013-2016) to develop and compare species distribution models (SDMs). Model predictability was evaluated using cross-validation based on the observed species distribution. Results showed that sea bottom temperature (SBT), sea bottom salinity (SBS), and sediment type were the most important factors affecting crab distributions. The relative importance of candidate variables was not consistent among species, season, or model. In general, we found ANNs to have less stability than both RFs and GAMs. GAMs overall yielded the least complex response curve structure. C. japonica was more pronounced in southwestern portion of Haizhou Bay, and C. bimaculata tended to stay in offshore areas. P. trituberculatus was the least region-specific and exhibited substantial annual variations in abundance. The comparison of multiple SDMs was informative to understand species responses to environmental factors and predict species distributions. This study contributes to better understanding the environmental niches of crabs and demonstrates best practices for the application of SDMs for management and conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W2900494832,"The effectiveness of clove oil and cautery disbudding on horn growth was evaluated in goat kids. The study used 243 Saanen doe kids (4±1 days old; mean±SD) on two goat farms that were disbudded with either (i) clove oil injection (CLOVE), (ii) a cautery iron and bud removed (BUDOFF), or (iii) a cautery iron with bud left intact (BUDON). Each kid received a different treatment per bud, which were balanced between buds (left/right) and randomly allocated. A trained observer monitored bud growth following treatment for 3 months recording either: N: no growth, H: normal horn, S: abnormal horn (scur), or SC: soft, fibrous lump (scorn). After the final observation, buds were assessed for the probability of detecting (i) success (no growth), (ii) scurs, (iii) horns or (iv) scorns [with 95% CI]. The probability of success for BUDOFF (0.77 [0.63, 0.87]) was higher than for BUDON (0.20 [0.11, 0.34]) and CLOVE (0.09 [0.04, 0.18]; P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, the probability of success for BUDON was higher than for CLOVE (P ≤ 0.05). The probability of scurs was higher for CLOVE (0.72 [0.63, 0.80]) than BUDOFF (0.25 [0.17, 0.34]) and BUDON (0.30 [0.21, 0.39]; P ≤ 0.05). There was no difference in the probability of scurs for BUDOFF and BUDON (P > 0.05). The probability of horns was higher for CLOVE (0.21 [0.15, 0.29]) than BUDON (0.02 [0.01, 0.06]; P ≤ 0.05); horns were not observed for BUDOFF. The probability of scorns for BUDON, the only treatment that led to scorns, was 0.41 (0.25, 0.60). These results suggest that BUDOFF was more effective at preventing growth than CLOVE and BUDON and appears the most effective method, of the methods tested, for disbudding kids. Future research should explore other alternatives to cautery disbudding that may be both efficacious and cause less pain."
https://openalex.org/W2901538190,"In response to genotoxic stress, the tumor suppressor protein p73 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Despite extensive studies on p73-mediated apoptosis, little is known about the cytoplasmic apoptotic function of p73. Here, using H1299 lung cancer cells and diverse biochemical approaches, including colony formation, DNA fragmentation, GST pulldown, and apoptosis assays along with NMR spectroscopy, we show that p73 induces transcription-independent apoptosis via its transactivation domain (TAD) through a mitochondrial pathway and that this apoptosis is mediated by the interaction between p73-TAD and the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL or BCL2L1). This binding disrupted an interaction between Bcl-XL and the pro-apoptotic protein BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid). In particular, we found that a 16-mer p73-TAD peptide motif (p73-TAD16) mediates transcription-independent apoptosis, accompanied by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, by interacting with Bcl-XL. Interestingly, the structure of the Bcl-XL–p73-TAD16 peptide complex revealed a novel mechanism of Bcl-XL recognition by p73-TAD. We observed that the α-helical p73-TAD16 peptide binds to a noncanonical site in Bcl-XL, comprising the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains in an orientation opposite to those of pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides. Taken together, our results indicate that the cytoplasmic apoptotic function of p73 is mediated through a noncanonical mode of Bcl-XL recognition. This finding sheds light on a critical transcription-independent, p73-mediated mechanism for apoptosis induction, which has potential implications for anticancer therapy.

The MUC1-ED desialylation unmasks both cryptic binding sites for Pa and a protease recognition site, permitting its proteolytic release as a hyperadhesive decoy receptor for Pa. We found here that intranasal administration of Pa strain K (PAK) to BALB/c mice increases MUC1-ED shedding into the bronchoalveolar compartment. MUC1-ED levels increased as early as 12 h, peaked at 24–48 h with a 7.8-fold increase, and decreased by 72 h. The a-type flagellin–expressing PAK strain and the b-type flagellin–expressing PAO1 strain stimulated comparable levels of MUC1-ED shedding. A flagellin-deficient PAK mutant provoked dramatically reduced MUC1-ED shedding compared with the WT strain, and purified flagellin recapitulated the WT effect. In lung tissues, Pa increased association of NEU1 and protective protein/cathepsin A with MUC1-ED in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays and stimulated MUC1-ED desialylation. NEU1-selective sialidase inhibition protected against Pa-induced MUC1-ED desialylation and shedding. In Pa-challenged mice, MUC1-ED–enriched bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inhibited flagellin binding and Pa adhesion to human airway epithelia by up to 44% and flagellin-driven motility by >30%.

https://openalex.org/W2901900381,"Disruption of circadian rhythms has been implicated in an increased risk for cancer development. The Period2 (Per2) gene encodes one of the major components of the mammalian circadian clock, which plays a key role in controlling the circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior. PER2 has also been reported to suppress the malignant transformation of cells, but its role in the regulation of cancer susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs remains unclear. In this study, we found that oncogene-transformed embryonic fibroblasts prepared from Per2-mutant (Per2m/m) mice, which are susceptible to both spontaneous and radiation-induced tumorigenesis, were resistant against common chemotherapeutic drugs and that this resistance is associated with up-regulation of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 3a1 (Aldh3a1) gene. Co-expression of the oncogenes H-rasV12 and SV40 large T-antigen induced malignant transformation of both WT and Per2m/m cells, but the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agents methotrexate, gemcitabine, etoposide, vincristine, and oxaliplatin were significantly alleviated in the oncogene-transformed Per2m/m cells. Although introduction of the two oncogenes increased the expression of Aldh3a1 in both WT and Per2m/m cells, the ALDH3A1 protein levels in the Per2m/m cells were ∼7-fold higher than in WT cells. The elevated ALDH3A1 levels in the oncogene-transformed Per2m/m cells were sufficient to prevent chemotherapeutic drug–induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Consequently, shRNA-mediated suppression of Aldh3a1 expression relieved the chemoresistance of the Per2m/m cells.

https://openalex.org/W2900852388,"Background Although a wide range of genetic influences on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels have been reported, sex differences in the genetic influences have not been well described. Methods We assessed TSH and fT4 levels in 2,250 subjects without thyroid peroxidase antibody, with data obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) conducted from 2013 to 2015. Using variance decomposition methods, the variation of TSH and fT4 levels was divided into genetic and environmental components common to both sexes, and to males and females separately. The genetic correlation between TSH and fT4 levels was also assessed in both sexes, and in males and females separately. Results Narrow-sense heritability for TSH and fT4 were 54% and 56%, respectively. Sex-specific heritability for TSH levels was significantly higher in females than in males (75% and 41%, respectively; p = 0.037). Heritability for fT4 levels was not significantly different between males and females (62% and 52%, respectively; p = 0.335). TSH and fT4 levels showed a negative genetic correlation in females (ρg = -0.347, p = 0.040) after regressing out the influences of environmental covariates, but this correlation was not present in males (ρg = -0.160, p = 0.391). Conclusions The genetic influences on individual TSH levels were more prominent in females than in males. In addition, female-specific pleiotropy between TSH and fT4 might be a clue that this stronger genetic influences in females would mainly affect thyroid function per se, rather than other TSH-related factors that do not primarily trigger the negative feedback loop between TSH and fT4."

It is often argued that this effect on attention has evolutionary functions related to mating. Although plausible, such perspectives have been challenged by recent behavioral and eye-tracking studies, which have shown that the effect on attention is moderated by various sex- and goal-related variables such as sexual orientation. In the present study, we examined how relationship status and sociosexual orientation moderate the link between attractiveness and visual attention. We hypothesized that attractiveness leads to longer looks and that being single as well as being more sociosexually unrestricted, enhances the effect of attractiveness. Using an eye-tracking free-viewing paradigm, we tested 150 heterosexual men and women looking at images of urban real-world scenes depicting two people differing in facial attractiveness. Participants additionally provided attractiveness ratings of all stimuli. We analyzed the correlations between how long faces were looked at and participants' ratings of attractiveness and found that more attractive faces-especially of the other sex-were looked at longer. We also found that more sociosexually unrestricted participants who were single had the highest attractiveness-attention correlation. Our results show that evolutionary predictions cannot fully explain the attractiveness-attention correlation; perceiver characteristics and motives moderate this relationship."

Certain individuals with eating disorders also experiment their disorder as an addiction. The objective was to identify typologies of patients presenting with various behavioral addictions or eating disorders according to their evolution within the framework of care, and to specify the factors associated with the differential clinical trajectories.We included 302 patients presenting with problem gambling, sexual addiction, compulsive buying, excessive videogame use or eating disorders. The patients completed a multiaxial assessment through a face-to-face structured interview and self-administered questionnaires, including sociodemographic and addiction-related characteristics, psychiatric and addictive comorbidities and several psychological characteristics. The assessment was performed at inclusion and then repeated after 6 and 12 months. The statistical analysis included a combination of growth mixture models and latent class analysis.We identified five classes of patients with different profiles related to their trajectories during a one-year period of specialized care: ""complex patients"", ""patients with impulsive psychological functioning"", ""patients with cooperative psychological functioning"", ""patients with immature psychological functioning,"" and ""patients with resilient psychological functioning"".The typology obtained brings interesting findings to propose patient-centered care strategies adapted to these disorders. Because the typology was independent from the type of disorder, it supports the general concept of behavioral addictions, and the similarities between eating disorders and behavioral addictions. The relevance of this model should be further examined in future studies."

B. mori wing cuticle protein gene 4 (BmWCP4) is an essential gene for wing disc development expressed specifically during pupation.

Bioinformatics analysis predicted seven potential Forkhead box (Fox) cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the BmWCP4 promoter region, and we found that Fox CRE6 contributes to suppression of BmWCP4 expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and DNA pull-down assays revealed that BmFoxA suppressed activity at the BmWCP4 promoter by specifically binding to the Fox CRE6. The expression level of BmFoxA in the wing discs was higher during the larval stage than at the pupal stage. In contrast, expression of another transcription factor, BmSAGE, increased over the course of development.

Therefore, screening of patients with severe osteoarthritis of the hip could identify patients with HFE hemochromatosis.In this prospective cross-sectional study, 940 patients aged <70 years with end-stage osteoarthritis of the hip undergoing elective joint replacement surgery were screened for HFE hemochromatosis and compared to age- and sex-matched controls.No greater prevalence of C282Y homozygosity mutation or elevated serum ferritin or transferrin saturation levels was found in the study cohort with severe osteoarthritis of the hip than in controls from the general population.Our screening approach could not identify an increased prevalence of HFE gene mutations and iron overload in younger patients with severe osteoarthritis of the hip."
https://openalex.org/W2901792931,"Acoustic standing waves can precisely focus flowing particles or cells into tightly positioned streams for interrogation or downstream separations. The efficiency of an acoustic standing wave device is dependent upon operating at a resonance frequency. Small changes in a system’s temperature and sample salinity can shift the device’s resonance condition, leading to poor focusing. Practical implementation of an acoustic standing wave system requires an automated resonance control system to adjust the standing wave frequency in response to environmental changes. Here we have developed a rigorous approach for quantifying the optimal acoustic focusing frequency at any given environmental condition. We have demonstrated our approach across a wide range of temperature and salinity conditions to provide a robust characterization of how the optimal acoustic focusing resonance frequency shifts across these conditions. To generalize these results, two microfluidic bulk acoustic standing wave systems (a steel capillary and an etched silicon wafer) were examined. Models of these temperature and salinity effects suggest that it is the speed of sound within the liquid sample that dominates the resonance frequency shift. Using these results, a simple reference table can be generated to predict the optimal resonance condition as a function of temperature and salinity. Additionally, we show that there is a local impedance minimum associated with the optimal system resonance. The integration of the environmental results for coarse frequency tuning followed by a local impedance characterization for fine frequency adjustments, yields a highly accurate method of resonance control. Such an approach works across a wide range of environmental conditions, is easy to automate, and could have a significant impact across a wide range of microfluidic acoustic standing wave systems."
https://openalex.org/W2901847000,"Growing evidence has accumulated in recent years showing that movement behaviors have important implications for health in children, especially for cardiovascular health, whose risk factors could track from childhood to adulthood. However, these findings are mixed and inconsistent in children. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between different movement behaviors (sedentary behavior, physical activity and sleep duration) and cardiometabolic risk in schoolchildren. The study shows cross-sectional results of baseline measurement from 146 Spanish schoolchildren, aged 8-to-11 years old, participating in the MOVI-2 study. Movement behaviors were determined using accelerometry combined with self-reported sleep time. Cardiometabolic risk was assessed using a validated metabolic syndrome index. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher levels of vigorous physical activity (OR = 0.110, p = 0.004) and sleeping more than 9 hours (OR = 0.269, p = 0.015) could be protective factors against metabolic syndrome risk in children. ANCOVA analysis showed associations between vigorous physical activity and waist circumference (p < 0.001), and sleep time with insulin resistance (p = 0.017) and lipid profile (p = 0.035). No association was observed between light and moderate physical activity, sedentary behavior and metabolic syndrome (index and components). No statistically significant differences were found for blood pressure and any of the movement behaviors. Our data suggest that both the amount of vigorous physical activity accumulated and sleep duration are independently associated with higher cardiometabolic risk in children."
https://openalex.org/W2901851848,"At sufficient dose, intramuscular injection of Botulinum toxin A causes muscle wasting that is physiologically consistent with surgical denervation and other types of neuromuscular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to clarify early molecular and micro-RNA alterations in skeletal muscle following Botulinum toxin A-induced muscle paralysis. Quadriceps were analyzed for changes in expression of micro- and messenger RNA and protein levels after a single injection of 0.4, 2 or 4U Botulinum toxin A (/100g body weight). After injection with 2.0U Botulinum toxin A, quadriceps exhibited significant reduction in muscle weight and increased levels of ubiquitin ligase proteins at 7, 14 and 28 days. Muscle miR-1 and miR-133a/b levels were decreased at these time points, whereas a dose-responsive increase in miR-206 expression at day 14 was observed. Expression of the miR-133a/b target genes RhoA, Tgfb1 and Ctfg, and the miR-1/206 target genes Igf-1 and Hdac4, were upregulated at 28 days after Botulinum toxin A injection. Increased levels of Hdac4 protein were observed after injection, consistent with anticipated expression changes in direct and indirect Hdac4 target genes, such as Myog. Our results suggest Botulinum toxin A-induced denervation of muscle shares molecular characteristics with surgical denervation and other types of neuromuscular dysfunction, and implicates miR-133/Tgf-β1/Ctfg and miR-1/Hdac4/Myog signaling during the resultant muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2901465132,"The cool virulent Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 (r3b2) strains cause destructive brown rot of potato. They are quarantined pathogens in Europe and Canada and select agent pathogens in the United States. We previously identified r3b2 (sequevars 1 and 2)-unique fragments that clustered into 32 regions in the genome of R. solanacearum. In this study, we targeted five of those regions for mutagenesis in order to determine whether they are involved in cool temperature-related biological functions for diagnostic purpose. Knockout mutants of four regions produced no changes to the biology of the r3b2 strain UW551. The mutation of region 13, which is 3,407 bp in size, resulted in significantly reduced twitching motility, attachment to the roots of tomato seedlings, and virulence under cool temperature conditions (18-24°C), although no significant difference was found under warm temperature conditions (24-30°C) as compared to the wild type strain. As a result, we designed primer pair Rs-CV-F and Rs-CV-R to target the region 13 for specific detection of r3b2 strains of R. solanacearum. Our assay specifically detected all the 34 r3b2 strains and none of the 56 non-r3b2 strains of R. solanacearum, nor any other five plant- or soil-associated bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, X. citri, and R. pickettii. Unexpectedly, in silico analysis predicted that a recently deposited non-sequevar 1 or 2 Brazilian R. solanacearum strain RS489 would be recognized by our assay and by previously published r3b2-specific assays, although the cool-virulent status of this strain is unclear. Our PCR assay is the first to target a DNA region associated with cool-virulence that makes r3b2 strains highly regulated pathogens for specific detection of this important group of R. solanacearum."

https://openalex.org/W2901110292,"B cell activating factor/a proliferation-inducing ligand (BAFF/APRIL) are members of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) α family of ligands, which are essential for B cell survival, development, and modulation of the immune system. To examine the association of circulating levels of BAFF and APRIL with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL), we measured the systemic levels of APRIL and BAFF in individuals with PTB, TBL, latent tuberculosis (LTB) and healthy controls (HC). Further, we also examined the pre and post-treatment plasma levels of above-mentioned parameters in PTB and TBL individuals upon completion of anti-TB chemotherapy. Next, the association of these cytokines either with extent of disease, disease severity, bacterial burden in PTB and lymph node culture grade or the lymph node size in TBL was also assessed. Finally, ROC analysis was performed to examine the discrimination capacity of APRIL and BAFF between PTB or TBL with LTB. Our study revealed significantly diminished plasma levels of APRIL in PTB and higher plasma levels of BAFF in both PTB and TBL individuals compared to LTB and HC. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in APRIL levels in TBL and significantly decreased plasma levels of BAFF in both PTB and TBL after the completion of successful anti-TB treatment. There was no statistically positive relationship between BAFF and APRIL levels and the extent of disease, disease severity and bacterial burden in PTB. In TBL, there was a significant correlation between APRIL (but not BAFF) levels with lymph node culture grades. In contrast, APRIL in PTB and BAFF in TBL were able to clearly discriminate from LTB in ROC analysis. In summary, our results showed altered levels of BAFF/APRIL and their modulation upon chemotherapy, suggesting that these cytokines might be involved in the immune-modulation of TB infection."
https://openalex.org/W2901897753,"Differential item functioning (DIF) is of the utmost importance in order to corroborate the generalized validity of test scores in different groups. DIF indicates that an item does not function equally in different groups such as age, gender or cultural ones. Our objective was to contrast the generalized validity of the Emotion Knowledge (EK) test scores in a heterogeneous Argentinian sample composed of 100 females and 100 males (age range: 18–65). Data from the original validation sample (200 Spanish participants, half of them males) were conjointly analyzed (total n = 400). Results of the Rasch Model (RM) analysis indicated that both fit to the RM and reliability (ISR = .97, PSR = .80) were adequate. Item logit measures ranged from -3.89 to 3.68, and person logit measures ranged from -1.12 to 5.09, with a mean value of 2.36. DIF was tested for gender, age, educational level and country, with a few item contrasts found to be statistically significant. Even though small significant differences in EK scores were associated with educational level (d = .25) and country (d = -.25), they became non-significant after removing the seven country-related DIF affected items. We can conclude that there is enough evidence for the generalized validity of EK test scores in Argentina. Given that recent theories of human emotion consider conceptual knowledge supported by language as constitutive of emotions, the EK test can be used in academic or applied settings where individual differences in emotional competence might be relevant."
