https://openalex.org/W2525665487,"Live fluorescent imaging of murine hippocampal slices shows that NMDAR-dependent glutamate signalling leads to postsynaptic BDNF release, with associated signalling of its receptor, TrkB, on the same dendritic spine, suggesting autocrine BDNF signalling. Secreted messenger molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known to participate in various forms of neuronal plasticity, such as long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and associated changes in dendritic spine morphology, but the exact sites of BDNF release and action remain poorly defined. Two papers from Ryohei Yasuda's lab, published in this issue of Nature, tackle this question. Stephen Harward et al. use live fluorescent imaging of murine hippocampal slices to show that NMDAR-dependent glutamate signalling leads to postsynaptic BDNF release, with associated signalling of its receptor, TrkB, on the same dendritic spine, suggesting autocrine BDNF signalling. In the second study Nathan Hedrick et al. find that the three small GTPases Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 are differentially involved in structural long-term potentiation of rodent dendritic spines, simultaneously ensuring signal specificity while also priming the system for plasticity. Taken together these results suggest molecular mechanisms for both signal specificity at single spines and synaptic cross-talk, a unique biochemical computation involved in neuronal plasticity and learning. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are crucial for many forms of neuronal plasticity1,2,3,4,5,6, including structural long-term potentiation (sLTP)7,8, which is a correlate of an animal’s learning7,9,10,11,12. However, it is unknown whether BDNF release and TrkB activation occur during sLTP, and if so, when and where. Here, using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensor for TrkB and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy13,14,15,16, we monitor TrkB activity in single dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured murine hippocampal slices. In response to sLTP induction9,14,15,16, we find fast (onset < 1 min) and sustained (>20 min) activation of TrkB in the stimulated spine that depends on NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) and CaMKII signalling and on postsynaptically synthesized BDNF. We confirm the presence of postsynaptic BDNF using electron microscopy to localize endogenous BDNF to dendrites and spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Consistent with these findings, we also show rapid, glutamate-uncaging-evoked, time-locked BDNF release from single dendritic spines using BDNF fused to superecliptic pHluorin17,18,19. We demonstrate that this postsynaptic BDNF–TrkB signalling pathway is necessary for both structural and functional LTP20. Together, these findings reveal a spine-autonomous, autocrine signalling mechanism involving NMDAR–CaMKII-dependent BDNF release from stimulated dendritic spines and subsequent TrkB activation on these same spines that is crucial for structural and functional plasticity."

Here we carried out CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-wide screens and identified the members of the Wnt receptor frizzled family (FZDs) as TcdB receptors. TcdB binds to the conserved Wnt-binding site known as the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), with the highest affinity towards FZD1, 2 and 7. TcdB competes with Wnt for binding to FZDs, and its binding blocks Wnt signalling. FZD1/2/7 triple-knockout cells are highly resistant to TcdB, and recombinant FZD2-CRD prevented TcdB binding to the colonic epithelium. Colonic organoids cultured from FZD7-knockout mice, combined with knockdown of FZD1 and 2, showed increased resistance to TcdB. The colonic epithelium in FZD7-knockout mice was less susceptible to TcdB-induced tissue damage in vivo. These findings establish FZDs as physiologically relevant receptors for TcdB in the colonic epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2526922682,"The Rho GTPase proteins Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 have a central role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, thereby exerting control over the structural and functional plasticity of spines and, ultimately, learning and memory. Although previous work has shown that precise spatiotemporal coordination of these GTPases is crucial for some forms of cell morphogenesis, the nature of such coordination during structural spine plasticity is unclear. Here we describe a three-molecule model of structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) of murine dendritic spines, implicating the localized, coincident activation of Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 as a causal signal of sLTP. This model posits that complete tripartite signal overlap in spines confers sLTP, but that partial overlap primes spines for structural plasticity. By monitoring the spatiotemporal activation patterns of these GTPases during sLTP, we find that such spatiotemporal signal complementation simultaneously explains three integral features of plasticity: the facilitation of plasticity by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the postsynaptic source of which activates Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA; heterosynaptic facilitation of sLTP, which is conveyed by diffusive Rac1 and RhoA activity; and input specificity, which is afforded by spine-restricted Cdc42 activity. Thus, we present a form of biochemical computation in dendrites involving the controlled complementation of three molecules that simultaneously ensures signal specificity and primes the system for plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2526506448,"The common participation of oncogenic KRAS proteins in many of the most lethal human cancers, together with the ease of detecting somatic KRAS mutant alleles in patient samples, has spurred persistent and intensive efforts to develop drugs that inhibit KRAS activity. However, advances have been hindered by the pervasive inter- and intra-lineage diversity in the targetable mechanisms that underlie KRAS-driven cancers, limited pharmacological accessibility of many candidate synthetic-lethal interactions and the swift emergence of unanticipated resistance mechanisms to otherwise effective targeted therapies. Here we demonstrate the acute and specific cell-autonomous addiction of KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer cells to receptor-dependent nuclear export. A multi-genomic, data-driven approach, utilizing 106 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, was used to interrogate 4,725 biological processes with 39,760 short interfering RNA pools for those selectively required for the survival of KRAS-mutant cells that harbour a broad spectrum of phenotypic variation. Nuclear transport machinery was the sole process-level discriminator of statistical significance. Chemical perturbation of the nuclear export receptor XPO1 (also known as CRM1), with a clinically available drug, revealed a robust synthetic-lethal interaction with native or engineered oncogenic KRAS both in vitro and in vivo. The primary mechanism underpinning XPO1 inhibitor sensitivity was intolerance to the accumulation of nuclear IκBα (also known as NFKBIA), with consequent inhibition of NFκB transcription factor activity. Intrinsic resistance associated with concurrent FSTL5 mutations was detected and determined to be a consequence of YAP1 activation via a previously unappreciated FSTL5-Hippo pathway regulatory axis. This occurs in approximately 17% of KRAS-mutant lung cancers, and can be overcome with the co-administration of a YAP1-TEAD inhibitor. These findings indicate that clinically available XPO1 inhibitors are a promising therapeutic strategy for a considerable cohort of patients with lung cancer when coupled to genomics-guided patient selection and observation."
https://openalex.org/W2527484912,"Uncertainties in the response of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations contribute to the large spread in projections of future climate change. Climate-carbon cycle models generally agree that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will enhance terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the magnitude of this CO2 fertilization effect varies from a 20 per cent to a 60 per cent increase in GPP for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in model studies. Here we demonstrate emergent constraints on large-scale CO2 fertilization using observed changes in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle that are thought to be the result of increasing terrestrial GPP. Our comparison of atmospheric CO2 measurements from Point Barrow in Alaska and Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii with historical simulations of the latest climate-carbon cycle models demonstrates that the increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle at both measurement sites is consistent with increasing annual mean GPP, driven in part by climate warming, but with differences in CO2 fertilization controlling the spread among the model trends. As a result, the relationship between the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle and the magnitude of CO2 fertilization of GPP is almost linear across the entire ensemble of models. When combined with the observed trends in the seasonal CO2 amplitude, these relationships lead to consistent emergent constraints on the CO2 fertilization of GPP. Overall, we estimate a GPP increase of 37 ± 9 per cent for high-latitude ecosystems and 32 ± 9 per cent for extratropical ecosystems under a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the basis of the Point Barrow and Cape Kumukahi records, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2527387762,"Resonance ionization spectroscopy of nobelium (atomic number 102) reveals its ground-state transition and an upper limit for its ionization potential, paving the way to characterizing even heavier elements via optical spectroscopy. Characterizing the heaviest elements in the periodic table is a gruelling task because they are radioactive, exist only for split seconds at a time and need to be artificially produced in sufficient quantities by complicated procedures. The heaviest element that has been characterized by optical spectroscopy is fermium, which has an atomic number of 100. Mustapha Laatiaoui et al. extend the methods used for fermium to perform optical spectroscopy on nobelium (atomic number 102). Through laser resonance ionization spectroscopy, they identify the ground-state transition of the atom and manage to investigate highly excited states called Rydberg states. This allows them to determine an upper limit for the atomic ionization potential of nobelium. This study opens the door to the characterization of even heavier elements such as lawrencium using optical spectroscopy. Optical spectroscopy of a primordial isotope has traditionally formed the basis for understanding the atomic structure of an element. Such studies have been conducted for most elements1 and theoretical modelling can be performed to high precision2,3, taking into account relativistic effects that scale approximately as the square of the atomic number. However, for the transfermium elements (those with atomic numbers greater than 100), the atomic structure is experimentally unknown. These radioactive elements are produced in nuclear fusion reactions at rates of only a few atoms per second at most and must be studied immediately following their production4, which has so far precluded their optical spectroscopy. Here we report laser resonance ionization spectroscopy of nobelium (No; atomic number 102) in single-atom-at-a-time quantities, in which we identify the ground-state transition 1S0 1P1. By combining this result with data from an observed Rydberg series, we obtain an upper limit for the ionization potential of nobelium. These accurate results from direct laser excitations of outer-shell electrons cannot be achieved using state-of-the-art relativistic many-body calculations5,6,7,8 that include quantum electrodynamic effects, owing to large uncertainties in the modelled transition energies of the complex systems under consideration. Our work opens the door to high-precision measurements of various atomic and nuclear properties of elements heavier than nobelium, and motivates future theoretical work."
https://openalex.org/W2524686610,"BinAB is a naturally occurring paracrystalline larvicide distributed worldwide to combat the devastating diseases borne by mosquitoes. These crystals are composed of homologous molecules, BinA and BinB, which play distinct roles in the multi-step intoxication process, transforming from harmless, robust crystals, to soluble protoxin heterodimers, to internalized mature toxin, and finally to toxic oligomeric pores. The small size of the crystals—50 unit cells per edge, on average—has impeded structural characterization by conventional means. Here we report the structure of Lysinibacillus sphaericus BinAB solved de novo by serial-femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser. The structure reveals tyrosine- and carboxylate-mediated contacts acting as pH switches to release soluble protoxin in the alkaline larval midgut. An enormous heterodimeric interface appears to be responsible for anchoring BinA to receptor-bound BinB for co-internalization. Remarkably, this interface is largely composed of propeptides, suggesting that proteolytic maturation would trigger dissociation of the heterodimer and progression to pore formation. The structure of the bacterial toxin BinAB, which is used to combat mosquito-borne diseases, reveals pH-sensitive switches and carbohydrate-binding modules that may contribute to the larvicidal function of the toxin. Mosquitoes continue to be the insects most injurious to human health, because they act as a vector for several infectious diseases including malaria, dengue fever, West Nile encephalitis, and Zika virus. The Lysinibacillus sphaericus binary toxin BinAB is distributed worldwide to combat mosquito-borne diseases, because these proteins are toxic to their targets, but harmless to humans and other animals. These authors used serial-femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser source to solve the structure of BinAB crystals. The structure reveals four pH-sensitive switches that facilitate crystal dissolution in the larval midgut as well as three carbohydrate-binding modules in BinA that may assist in directing heterodimers to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2524545167,"Background & Aim We performed lipid analyses at the early period of therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C who underwent interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment, and we attempted to identify the factors that contributed to a rapid increase in the patients’ serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 100 consecutive patients with HCV infection treated at the National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center: 24 patients underwent daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) combination therapy (DCV/ASV) for 24 weeks, and the other 76 patients underwent ledipasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy (LDV/SOF) for 12 weeks. ΔLDL-C was defined as the changed in LDL-C level at 28 days from the start of therapy. To determine whether ΔLDL-C was associated with several kinds of factors including viral kinetics, we performed a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Results The LDL-C levels in patients treated with LDV/SOF were markedly and significantly elevated (87.45 to 122.5 mg/dl; p<10−10) compared to those in the DCV/ASV-treated patients (80.15 to 87.8 mg/dl; p = 0.0056). The median levels of ΔLDL-C in the LDV/SOF and DCV/ASV groups were 33.2 and 13.1, respectively. LDV/SOF combination therapy as an IFN-free regimen (p<0.001) and ΔHCV core antigen (0–1 day drop) (p<0.044) were identified as independent factors that were closely related to the ΔLDL-C. Conclusions A rapid increase in the serum LDL-C concentration during the IFN-free treatment of hepatitis C was associated with the type of HCV therapy and a decline of HCV core protein."
https://openalex.org/W2526058058,"Attenuating the lipolysis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster by modulation of the COP1–Arf1 signalling complex induced necrosis in stem cells and led to their engulfment by differentiated cells. In an effort to establish the molecular mechanism behind the resistance of cancer stem cells to chemotherapy, Steven Hou and colleagues turned to Drosophila melanogaster. They find that the lipolysis pathway protects stem cells from chemotherapy-induced necrosis. Attenuating the lipolysis pathway by modulation of COPI–Arf1 signalling complex led to engulfment of dying stem cells by differentiated cells. The authors also present evidence that the same survival pathway may be active in human cancer cell lines with stem cell characteristics. This work implies that quiescent stem or cancer stem cells may depend on lipid reserves for energy, and that agents that block lipolysis might therefore be of therapeutic use. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may be responsible for tumour dormancy, relapse and the eventual death of most cancer patients1. In addition, these cells are usually resistant to cytotoxic conditions. However, very little is known about the biology behind this resistance to therapeutics. Here we investigated stem-cell death in the digestive system of adult Drosophila melanogaster. We found that knockdown of the coat protein complex I (COPI)–Arf79F (also known as Arf1) complex selectively killed normal and transformed stem cells through necrosis, by attenuating the lipolysis pathway, but spared differentiated cells. The dying stem cells were engulfed by neighbouring differentiated cells through a draper–myoblast city–Rac1–basket (also known as JNK)-dependent autophagy pathway. Furthermore, Arf1 inhibitors reduced CSCs in human cancer cell lines. Thus, normal or cancer stem cells may rely primarily on lipid reserves for energy, in such a way that blocking lipolysis starves them to death. This finding may lead to new therapies that could help to eliminate CSCs in human cancers."

The hypothesis of this study was that active Aβ1-42 phagocytosis by macrophages prevents brain amyloidosis and thus maintains cognition. We studied the effects of self-supplementation with a drink with ω-3s, antioxidants, and resveratrol on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, macrophage M1M2 phenotype [the ratio of inflammatory cluster of differentiation (CD)54+CD80 and proresolution markers CD163+CD206], and Aβ1-42 phagocytosis in patients initially diagnosed as having MCI or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). At baseline, the median MMSE score in patients in both the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε3/ε3 and ApoE ε3/ε4 groups was 26.0 and macrophage Aβ1-42 phagocytosis was defective. The MMSE rate of change increased in the ApoE ε3/ε3 group a median 2.2 points per year (P = 0.015 compared to 0) but did not change in the ApoE ε3/ε4 group (P = 0.014 between groups). In the ApoE ε3/ε3 group, all patients remained cognitively stable or improved; in the ApoE ε3/ε4 group, 1 recovered from dementia, but 3 lapsed into dementia. The macrophage phenotype polarized in patients bearing ApoE ε3/ε3 to an intermediate (green zone) M1-M2 type at the rate of 0.226 U/yr, whereas in patients bearing ApoE ε3/ε4, polarization was negative (P = 0.08 between groups). The baseline M1M2 type in the extreme M1 (red zone) or M2 (white zone) was unfavorable for cognitive outcome. Aβ1-42 phagocytosis increased in both ApoE groups (P = 0.03 in each groups). In vitro, the lipidic mediator resolvin D1 (RvD1) down regulated the M1 type in patients with ApoE ε3/ε3 but in some patients with ε3/ε4, paradoxically up-regulated the M1 type. Antioxidant/ω-3/resveratrol supplementation was associated with favorable immune and cognitive responses in ApoE ε3/ε3 and individual patients bearing ApoE ε3/ε4, and brings into personalized clinical practice the immune benefits expected from ω-3 mediators called resolvins. The validity of this study is limited by its small size and uncontrolled design.-Famenini, S., Rigali, E. A., Olivera-Perez, H. M., Dang, J., Chang, M T., Halder, R., Rao, R.

https://openalex.org/W2525184662,"Perilipin-2 (PLIN2) is a constitutively associated cytoplasmic lipid droplet coat protein that has been implicated in fatty liver formation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Mice with or without whole-body deletion of perilipin-2 (Plin2-null) were fed either Western or control diets for 30 weeks. Perilipin-2 deletion prevents obesity and insulin resistance in Western diet-fed mice and dramatically reduces hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels in mice fed Western or control diets. Gene and protein expression studies reveal that PLIN2 deletion suppressed SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 target genes involved in de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways in livers of mice on either diet. GC-MS lipidomics demonstrate that this reduction correlated with profound alterations in the hepatic lipidome with significant reductions in both desaturation and elongation of hepatic neutral lipid species. To examine the possibility that lipidomic actions of PLIN2 deletion contribute to suppression of SREBP activation, we isolated endoplasmic reticulum membrane fractions from long-term Western diet-fed wild type (WT) and Plin2-null mice. Lipidomic analyses reveal that endoplasmic reticulum membranes from Plin2-null mice are markedly enriched in ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which others have shown inhibit SREBP activation and de novo lipogenesis. Our results identify PLIN2 as a determinant of global changes in the hepatic lipidome and suggest the hypothesis that these actions contribute to SREBP-regulated de novo lipogenesis involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

NAFLD caused by obesity has been linked to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and liver cancer (2.Vanni E. Bugianesi E. Kotronen A. De Minicis S. Yki-Järvinen H. Svegliati-Baroni G.

Harrison S.A. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma: fertile soil.Semin. Liver Dis. 2012; 32: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). NAFLD begins with subtle accumulation of neutral lipids in the liver, and if not reversed through dietary or lifestyle changes the condition can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and subsequent cirrhosis of the liver (5.Anstee Q.M. Targher G. Day C.P. Progression of NAFLD to diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease or cirrhosis.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Therefore, reducing or preventing hepatic neutral lipid accumulation is an area of significant therapeutic interest (6.Musso G. Cassader M. Rosina F. Gambino R.

Nonetheless, despite intense study over many decades, the specific mechanisms regulating hepatic lipid accumulation have remained confusing and elusive (7.Choi S.S. Diehl A.M. Hepatic triglyceride synthesis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2008; 19: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Recently, the lipid droplet coat proteins perilipins (PLINs) have emerged as physiologic regulators of lipid accumulation in many tissues, including liver (8.Ducharme N.A. Bickel P.E. Lipid droplets in lipogenesis and lipolysis.Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus far, five perilipin family members have been identified (PLIN1 through PLIN5), with family members exhibiting differential tissue expression under both physiologic and pathophysiologic states (9.Sztalryd C.

Perilipin-2 (PLIN2) is a constitutively associated cytoplasmic lipid droplet (CLD) coat protein that is expressed in many organs, including the liver. Under high fat diet-induced NAFLD, PLIN2 is the predominant lipid droplet coat protein in hepatocytes in humans and rodents (10.Liu X. Xue R. Ji L. Zhang X. Wu J. Gu J. Zhou M. Chen S.

Therefore, PLIN2 has become a potentially valuable therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of NAFLD development (12.Imai Y. Boyle S. Varela G.M. Caron E. Yin X. Dhir R. Dhir R. Graham M.J. Ahima R.S. Effects of perilipin 2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment on hepatic lipid metabolism and gene expression.Physiol. Genomics. 2012; 44: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We previously generated mice with whole-body knock-out of PLIN2 (Plin2-null) (13.McManaman J.L. Bales E.S. Orlicky D.J.

Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 1346-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These animals are resistant to obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, and liver steatosis (NAFLD) when raised on a high fat diet. In this study, we sought to probe how loss of PLIN2 alters hepatic lipid accumulation and metabolism at the molecular level. Using Plin2-null mice on Western (WD) or control (CD) diets for 30 weeks, we show that loss of Plin2 prevents diet-induced steatosis largely by impairing activation of the SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 pathways through effects on membrane lipid composition. We also show that PLIN2 deletion impairs activation of SREBP-dependent lipogenic pathways in mice fed control diets low in fat, carbohydrate, and cholesterol. Although we had expected a reduction in total neutral lipid on WD, the alteration in the global hepatic lipidome was unexpected. The findings of this study further our understanding of the role of PLIN2 in diet-induced fatty liver formation and provide evidence of its function in coordinating content and composition of biologically active cellular lipids in the liver. Wild type and Plin2-null mice were fed an obesity-promoting Western diet (WD), containing elevated levels of saturated fat, sucrose, and cholesterol, or a low fat CD, which had 75% less fat, 65% less sucrose, and no added cholesterol, ad libitum for 30 weeks. Consistent with previous studies of long-term high fat-fed mice (13.McManaman J.L. Bales E.S. Orlicky D.J. Jackman M. MacLean P.S. Cain S. Crunk A.E. Mansur A. Graham C.E. Bowman T.A. Greenberg A.S.

Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 1346-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we found that WD-fed Plin2-null mice are protected from marked obesity produced by WD feeding of WT mice. The effects of feeding WT or Plin2-null mice WD or CD on weight gain, body composition, energy intake, and serum glucose regulation are shown in Fig. 1. Body weights of WD-fed WT mice doubled over 30 weeks, whereas body weights of CD-fed WT mice increased by 43% (Fig. 1A), and body weights of Western and control diet-fed Plin2-null animals increased by 16 and 31%, respectively. The rate of weight gain of WD-fed WT mice was significantly greater than that of CD-fed WT mice or of Western or control diet-fed Plin2-null mice (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA). In addition, the rate of weight gain of CD-fed WT mice was significantly greater than that of Plin2-null mice fed WD or CD (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). Increased weight gains in WD-fed WT mice corresponded to modestly elevated energy intakes compared with the other groups (p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA). Differences in energy intake were not detected between WD- and CD-fed Plin2-null mice or between CD-fed WT mice and either WD- or CD-fed Plin2-null mice (Fig. 1B). Quantitative magnetic imaging analyses of mice after 30 weeks on WD or CD showed that body weight differences among WT and Plin2-null animals reflected differences in fat mass quantities (Fig. 1C). The average fat mass quantity of WD-fed WT mice was more than twice that of CD-fed animals and 4–5-fold greater than WD- and CD-fed Plin2-null mice, respectively (p < 0.001; two-way ANOVA). In addition, the average fat mass quantity of CD-fed WT mice was significantly greater than that of WD- or CD-fed Plin2-null mice (p < 0.05; two-way ANOVA). We did not detect significant differences in average fat-free (lean) mass quantities between WD- and CD-fed WT and Plin2-null mice (Fig. 1C). WD-induced obesity is associated with glucose utilization abnormalities linked to insulin resistance (14.Manrique C. DeMarco V.G. Aroor A.R. Mugerfeld I. Garro M. Habibi J. Hayden M.R. Sowers J.R. Obesity and insulin resistance induce early development of diastolic dysfunction in young female mice fed a Western diet.Endocrinology. 2013; 154: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether protection from obesity by PLIN2 deletion in WD-fed mice also confers protection against abnormalities in glucose utilization, we determined serum glucose responses to intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose injection in WT and Plin2-null mice fed WD or CD (Fig. 1D). Serum glucose levels in WD-fed WT mice remain significantly elevated 90 min after i.p. glucose injection but return to normal by 30 min in CD-fed WT mice. Serum glucose curves in WD- or CD-fed Plin2-null mice were similar to that of CD-fed WT mice, which demonstrates that protective effects of Plin2 deletion on WD-induced obesity are associated with protection against impaired glucose utilization, possibly through improved insulin sensitivity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that fasting serum-free fatty acid (FFA) levels, a measure of insulin inhibition of adipose lipolysis (15.Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Adipocyte dysfunctions linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 16.Ruan H. Lodish H.F. Insulin resistance in adipose tissue: direct and indirect effects of tumor necrosis factor-α.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), were 25% (p = 0.0403) lower in WD-fed Plin2-null mice compared with WT mice fed this diet (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results agree with previous conclusions that PLIN2-deletion protects against insulin resistance associated with diet or genetically induced obesity (13.McManaman J.L. Bales E.S. Orlicky D.J. Jackman M. MacLean P.S. Cain S. Crunk A.E. Mansur A. Graham C.E. Bowman T.A. Greenberg A.S.

Interestingly, we also observed a 25% reduction (p = 0.0056) in fasting serum FFA for Plin2-null mice fed the control diet. As such, the reduction in fasting FFA associated with loss of PLIN2 appears to be independent of diet or effects on obesity, although direct effects on adipose properties remain possible (19.Takahashi Y. Shinoda A. Kamada H. Shimizu M. Inoue J. Sato R. Perilipin2 plays a positive role in adipocytes during lipolysis by escaping proteasomal degradation.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 20975Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We next examined whether Plin2-null mice were protected from WD-induced hepatic steatosis. As expected, WD-fed WT livers show striking histologically detectable steatosis in all lobular zones characterized by a mixture of both micro- and macro-steatosis (Fig. 2A). In contrast, histologically detectable steatosis was not observed in livers of WD-fed Plin2-null mice or in livers of CD-fed WT or Plin2-null animals. Additionally, we detected an ∼2-fold increase in relative liver weights of WD-fed WT mice compared with CD-fed WT mice or Western or control diet-fed Plin2-null mice (Fig. 2B). To confirm the differences in lipid accumulation between WT and Plin2-null mice biochemically, we performed quantitative GC-MS of fatty acid methyl esters derived from neutral lipids in liver samples from WD and CD mice. In agreement with the histologic evidence, hepatic neutral lipid levels were greatly elevated in livers of WD-fed WT mice over those of WD Plin2-null animals or CD-fed WT or Plin2-null mice (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the cholesterol content in the neutral lipid fraction of WD-fed WT mice was markedly elevated in WD-fed Plin2-null mice or in CD-fed WT or Plin2-null mice (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, we also observed that total hepatic neutral lipid and cholesterol levels in livers of CD-fed WT mice were significantly elevated over those of CD-fed Plin2-null mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D). Because murine livers also express PLIN3 and PLIN5 (20.Carr R.M. Ahima R.S. Pathophysiology of lipid droplet proteins in liver diseases.Exp. Cell Res. 2016; 340: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21.Langhi C. Marquart T.J. Allen R.M. Baldán A. Perilipin-5 is regulated by statins and controls triglyceride contents in the hepatocyte.J. Hepatol. 2014; 61: 358-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether loss of PLIN2 altered their expression. We first examined Plin2, Plin3, and Plin5 gene expression in both WT and Plin2-null mice fed WD or CD for 30 weeks. As established previously (13.McManaman J.L. Bales E.S. Orlicky D.J. Jackman M. MacLean P.S. Cain S. Crunk A.E. Mansur A. Graham C.E. Bowman T.A. Greenberg A.S. Perilipin-2-null mice are protected against diet-induced obesity, adipose inflammation, and fatty liver disease.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 1346-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Plin2 gene expression is not detected in livers of Plin2-null mice (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, we found that Plin2 transcripts were up-regulated ∼1.3-fold in WT mice fed WD, although this difference was not significant. Importantly, we did not observe up-regulation of Plin3 gene expression in Plin2-null mice on either diet, nor did we observe up-regulation of Plin3 in WT mice fed WD compared with CD. On WD, we observed significantly lower Plin3 gene expression in Plin2-null mice. Although Plin3 gene expression is trending down in Plin2-null mice on CD, this difference was not significant. We observed a similar pattern of Plin5 expression. Plin5 is slightly up-regulated in WT livers on WD compared with CD, but we did not observe a significant difference in Plin5 gene expression on control diet. To confirm the gene expression studies, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis of PLIN2, PLIN3, and PLIN5 in livers of WD or CD-fed WT and Plin2-null mice (Fig. 2F). Again, PLIN2 was not detected by immunofluorescence in liver sections of Plin2-null mice on either diet, further validating its deletion. In livers of WD-fed WT mice, strong PLIN2 staining was detected primarily on large CLD present in hepatocytes, whereas in livers of CD-fed WT mice PLIN2 was detected on small hepatocyte CLD and on CLD in stellate cells (Fig. 2F). We did not detect PLIN5 staining in livers of WD-fed WT mice. In livers of WD- and CD-fed WT mice, PLIN3 but not PLIN5, immunostaining was observed on CLD in stellate cells as indicated by arrows (Fig. 2F). In livers of Plin2-null animals, PLIN3 and PLIN5 were detected on CLD in hepatocytes, and Plin3 was detected on CLD in stellate cells. These data demonstrate that both PLIN3 and PLIN5 are expressed by hepatocytes and localize to CLD in the absence of PLIN2. However, neither protein is capable of compensating for PLIN2 loss in mediating hepatocyte steatotic responses to WD feeding. Because we observed improved glucose tolerance in Plin2-null mice on long-term WD, we suspected that induction of de novo lipogenic genes might be suppressed in Plin2-null mice. In the liver, insulin has been shown to induce SREBP1-c and activate lipogenic target gene expression. De novo lipogenesis is a major pathway in development of NAFLD both in humans and rodents fed long-term high fat, high carbohydrate diets. Additionally, reduction of hepatic Plin2 gene expression through the use of anti-Plin2 oligonucleotides in mouse models fed a long-term high fat diet has shown that de novo lipogenic gene expression is reduced (17.Varela G.M. Antwi D.A. Dhir R. Yin X. Singhal N.S. Graham M.J. Crooke R.M. Ahima R.S. Inhibition of ADRP prevents diet-induced insulin resistance.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G621-G628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the improved glucose tolerance and previous gene expression studies in Plin2 antisense oligonucleotide mice, we suspected that SREBP-1 target genes would be reduced in Plin2-null animals. We first determined relative transcript levels of the Srebp transcription factors themselves. In livers of WD-fed mice, we found that PLIN2 deletion resulted in a 65% reduction in Srebp-1a (p = 0.0014), a 75% reduction in Srebp-1c (p = 0.0005), and a 50% reduction in Srebp-2 (p = 0.0048) mRNA (Fig. 3A). We then demonstrated drastic and statistically significant reductions in transcript levels of the entire suite of SREBP-1C target genes, including Scd1, Fasn, Acc1, Elovl5, Elovl6, Fads1, and Fads2. In most cases, PLIN2 deletion reduced SREBP-1c target gene mRNA levels by 80–90% compared with WT mice (Fig. 3B). Because Fasn and Acc1 are also targets of ChREBP, we determined the expression level of this transcription factor. We did not observe statistically significant differences in Chrebp mRNA levels in livers of WD-fed WT and Plin2-null mice (Fig. 3A). In addition to suppression of SREBP-1 target gene expression, we also determined expression levels of SREBP-2 target genes. Srebp-2 has been shown to be the primary physiologic regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis (22.Madison B.B. SREBP2: A master regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 333-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because we observed significant reduction of hepatic cholesterol in Plin2-null mice, we suspected that SREBP-2 might be altered as well. Gene expression of this transcription factor was reduced 50% in Plin2-null mice on WD compared with WT mice (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we observed 80% reductions in the transcript levels of SREBP-2 target genes, Hmgcs1 and Ldlr, in Plin2-null mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B) (23.Tao R. Xiong X. DePinho R.A. Deng C.X. Dong X.C. Hepatic SREBP-2 and cholesterol biosynthesis are regulated by FoxO3 and Sirt6.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 2745-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because FXR and LXR are involved in Srebp gene transcription, we determined their gene expression responses as well. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in Fxr or Lxr gene expression. Finally, we checked both PPARγ and PPARα target gene expression. Pparγ itself is reduced 80% in Plin2-null mice on WD, and its target gene Cd36 is reduced 95%. Additionally, we observed Pparα and Cpt1a to be down 50% in the Plin2-null. This was surprising but is similar to what has been observed with anti-Plin2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment (17.Varela G.M. Antwi D.A. Dhir R. Yin X. Singhal N.S. Graham M.J. Crooke R.M. Ahima R.S. Inhibition of ADRP prevents diet-induced insulin resistance.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G621-G628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In light of the reduction in hepatic neutral lipids and cholesterol associated with Plin2 loss in CD-fed mice, we hypothesized that Srebp target genes would be also reduced in livers of CD-fed Plin2-null mice. Both Srebp-1a and Srebp-1c mRNAs are reduced in Plin2-null livers, with the reduction in Srebp-1c being highly significant (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3E). Srebp-2 mRNA is trending downward in Plin2-null livers on CD, but this difference was not significant. Chrebp, Fxr, Lxr, Pparα, Pparγ, and Pgc1α were not statistically different between WT and Plin2-null livers on control CD. Among the entire suite of SREBP-1 target genes, we observe trending decreases of all genes, including Scd1, Fasn, Acc1, Elovl5, Elovl6, Fads1, and Fads2 (Fig. 3F). However, these decreases were not significant at the mRNA level. Among SREBP-2 targets, we observed a trending decrease for Ldlr but not for Hmgcs1. Interestingly, we did observe a significant 50% decrease in Cd36 mRNA. These data suggest that PLIN2 may contribute to the regulation of lipid metabolism genes even in the absence of obesity, when physiologic levels of lipid are present within the hepatocyte. Because Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target proteins do not always correlate with mRNA expression, we performed extensive Western blotting analysis of SREBP target enzymes (Fig. 3, C and D). As expected, we observed remarkable decreases in SREBP-1 target protein quantities in liver extracts of WD-fed Plin2-null mice compared with levels in extracts of WT mice fed the WD. On WD, FASN levels were reduced in livers of Plin2-null mice by 75% (p = 0.0016) compared with WT levels, and ElOVL6 protein levels were reduced by a similar amount (p = 0.0019). Consistent with gene expression studies, we observed an astonishing 98% decrease (p = 0.0054) in levels of SCD1 in liver extracts of Plin2-null mice, with this enzyme being barely detectable by Western blotting. In Plin2-null mice on WD, total ACC levels are reduced 90% (p = 0.0003), whereas phospho/total ACC is increased by almost 1.5-fold (p = 0.0019). Because we observed this increase in phospho/total ACC, we also examined phospho/total AMPKα. Phospho/total AMPKα is increased by 70% in Plin2-null animals on WD (p = 0.0495). In addition, we quantified ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) protein levels because it is also a validated SREBP-1 target and an important link between carbohydrate metabolism and lipid biosynthesis (24.Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. SREBPs: activators of the complete program of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 25.Chypre M. Zaidi N. Smans K. ATP-citrate lyase: a mini-review.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 422: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found total ACLY levels to be decreased 65% in Plin2-null mice on WD (p = 0.0024), although the phospho/total ACLY levels were not significantly different between the two genotypes. Finally, we checked protein expression levels of HMGCS1, a well validated target protein of SREBP-2 (23.Tao R. Xiong X. DePinho R.A. Deng C.X. Dong X.C. Hepatic SREBP-2 and cholesterol biosynthesis are regulated by FoxO3 and Sirt6.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 2745-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and observed a 38% decrease in this enzyme in Plin2-null animals on WD compared with WD-fed WT mice (p = 0.0254). Because we found such great differences in SREBP target gene expression on WD, we also checked both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 target proteins via Western blotting for CD-fed animals (Fig. 3, G and H). As noted, we observed downward trends for most of these target genes, but the decreases were significant only for Srebp-1C itself and Cd36. To our surprise, protein levels of most SREBP-1 target proteins were significantly reduced in liver extracts of CD-fed Plin2-null mice compared with CD-fed WT mice. FASN was found to be reduced 50% (p = 0.0034), and SCD1 was decreased 75% (p = 0.0436). Although gene expression predicted we might observe a decrease in ELOVL6, this was not the case as there was no difference in the levels of this enzyme between the genotypes. A 65% reduction of total ACC was observed in Plin2-null animals on CD (p = 0.0425), whereas no difference was observed between the genotypes for phospho/total ACC. Accordingly, we did not observe any statistical difference in phospho/total AMPKα on this diet. Interestingly, we also observed a 50% reduction in total ACLY for Plin2-null on CD (p = 0.0369) as well as a slight decrease in phospho/total Acly (p = 0.0499) for animals lacking PLIN2. As expected, based on Srebp-2 gene expression on CD, we did not observe any difference in levels of HMGCS1 on this diet. Because we observed significant changes in SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 target gene and protein expression, we suspected that loss of PLIN2 was preventing induction of de novo lipogenesis in Plin2-null mice on long-term WD as well as the CD. To better define the effects of PLIN2 deletion on this process at the physiologic level, we quantified lipid species in livers of WT and Plin2-null mice fed WD or CD for 30 weeks. Using a GC-MS lipidomics approach, we found that Plin2-null animals experience less desaturation and elongation of neutral lipid species on both diets. We first looked for evidence of steroyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity in neutral lipid profiles. We noticed a marked decrease in palmitoleic acid (C16:1) as a percentage of total neutral lipid in Plin2-null mice on both diets, with this particular species being reduced 31% on WD and 45% on CD compared with WT animals (Fig. 4A). Palmitoleic acid is one of the major products of SCD1 (and SCD2) activity and, like oleic acid, is formed by introducing n-9 desaturation in palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) (26.Ntambi J.M.

Experiments were performed in (I) a controlled-environment: B455,R638,R665,FR731(control); B455,R*638,R665,FR731; B455,R638,R*665,FR731; R638; R665 (B–blue, R- red, FR–far-red light). PPFD was set from 231 during growth, upto 300 μmol m-2 s-1 during 3-day treatment changing R638 or R665 PPFD level; in (II) greenhouse (November): high-pressure sodium lamps (HPS) (control—300 μmol m−2s−1); and HPS + 638 (HPS generated 90 and red LEDs—210 μmol m−2s−1). In general, under supplemental or increased red 638 nm light, amounts of tested antioxidants were greater in basil, whereas sole 665 nm or sole 638 nm is more favourable for parsley. Increased or supplemental red light significantly increased contents of phenolics, α-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and DPPH• but suppressed accumulation of lutein and β-carotene in basil, whereas an increase of β-carotene and DPPH• was observed in parsley. Hereby, the photoresponse of antioxidant compounds suggests that photoprotective mechanism is stimulated by both light-dose-dependent and wavelength-dependent reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2527008720,"Pulmonary inflammation and bacterial colonization are central to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Defects in macrophage phagocytosis of both bacteria and apoptotic cells contribute to the COPD phenotype. Small molecule inhibitors with anti-inflammatory activity against p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Rho kinase (ROCK) are being investigated as novel therapeutics in COPD. Concerns exist, however, about off-target effects. We investigated the effect of p38 MAPK inhibitors (VX745 and SCIO469), specific inhibitors of PI3K α (NVS-P13K-2), δ (NVS-P13K-3) or γ (NVS-P13K-5) and a ROCK inhibitor PF4950834 on macrophage phagocytosis, early intracellular killing of bacteria and efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) or monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from COPD patients (GOLD stage II/III) enrolled from a well characterized clinical cohort (MRC COPD-MAP consortium) or from healthy ex-smoker controls were studied. Both COPD AM and MDM exhibited lower levels of bacterial phagocytosis (using Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae) and efferocytosis than healthy controls. None of the inhibitors altered bacterial internalization or early intracellular bacterial killing in AM or MDM. Conversely PF4950834, but not other inhibitors, enhanced efferocytosis in COPD AM and MDM. These results suggest none of these inhibitors are likely to exacerbate phagocytosis-related defects in COPD, while confirming ROCK inhibitors can enhance efferocytosis in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2524353194,"Human leptospirosis is a zoonotic and potentially fatal disease that has increasingly been reported in both developing and developed countries, including France. However, our understanding of the basic aspects of the epidemiology of this disease, including the source of Leptospira serogroup Australis infections in humans and domestic animals, remains incomplete. We investigated the genetic diversity of Leptospira in 28 species of wildlife other than rats using variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and multispacer sequence typing (MST). The DNA of pathogenic Leptospira was detected in the kidney tissues of 201 individuals out of 3,738 tested individuals. A wide diversity, including 50 VNTR profiles and 8 MST profiles, was observed. Hedgehogs and mustelid species had the highest risk of being infected (logistic regression, OR = 66.8, CI95% = 30.9–144 and OR = 16.7, CI95% = 8.7–31.8, respectively). Almost all genetic profiles obtained from the hedgehogs were related to Leptospira interrogans Australis, suggesting the latter as a host-adapted bacterium, whereas mustelid species were infected by various genotypes, suggesting their interaction with Leptospira was different. By providing an inventory of the circulating strains of Leptospira and by pointing to hedgehogs as a potential reservoir of L. interrogans Australis, our study advances current knowledge on Leptospira animal carriers, and this information could serve to enhance epidemiological investigations in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2524459993,"The enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) or complex IV (EC 1.9.3.1) is a large transmembrane protein complex that serves as the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of eukaryotic mitochondria. CcO promotes the switch from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and has been associated with increased self-renewal characteristics in gliomas. Increased CcO activity in tumors has been associated with tumor progression after chemotherapy failure, and patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme and high tumor CcO activity have worse clinical outcomes than those with low tumor CcO activity. Therefore, CcO is an attractive target for cancer therapy. We report here the characterization of a CcO inhibitor (ADDA 5) that was identified using a high throughput screening paradigm. ADDA 5 demonstrated specificity for CcO, with no inhibition of other mitochondrial complexes or other relevant enzymes, and biochemical characterization showed that this compound is a non-competitive inhibitor of cytochrome c. When tested in cellular assays, ADDA 5 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of chemosensitive and chemoresistant glioma cells but did not display toxicity against non-cancer cells. Furthermore, treatment with ADDA 5 led to significant inhibition of tumor growth in flank xenograft mouse models. Importantly, ADDA 5 inhibited CcO activity and blocked cell proliferation and neurosphere formation in cultures of glioma stem cells, the cells implicated in tumor recurrence and resistance to therapy in patients with glioblastoma.

Although the chemotherapeutic regimen is commonly used as part of the treatment against GBM and can be advantageous for short periods of time, chemotherapy is eventually impaired by the development of chemoresistance. This phenomenon represents the most challenging problem in the successful treatment of cancer and is the main reason for chemotherapy failure. Increased levels of CcO activity have been associated with the acquisition of chemoresistance to TMZ in malignant gliomas (9.Oliva C.R. Markert T. Gillespie G.Y. Griguer C.E.

We recently demonstrated that high CcO activity within the tumor occurs in a significant subset of patients with high grade gliomas and is an independent predictor of poor outcome (14.Griguer C.E.

Herein, we describe a biochemical absorbance-based high throughput screen (HTS) to identify small molecule inhibitors of CcO. These compounds could serve as tools to investigate the role of CcO in cancer cells and may have direct therapeutic application for treatment of glioblastomas. A biochemical absorbance-based HTS was developed to identify small molecule inhibitors of CcO in mitochondrial extracts. The CcO assay is a modification of a procedure previously reported (10.Oliva C.R. Moellering D.R. Gillespie G.Y. Griguer C.E.

A schematic outlining the reaction is displayed in Fig. 1A. The measured signal is proportional to the amount of cyt c remaining after the CcO reaction, so compared with the DMSO control CcO inhibitors produce high signals. CcO activity in mitochondrial extracts was stable at room temperature for 4 h. The optimal mitochondrial extract concentration and the optimal reaction rate were determined in 5-μl reaction volumes in 1536-well plates, with the mitochondrial extract concentration adjusted to provide a linear reaction rate at 550 nm for 4 min. Reproducibility of the full reaction rate for CcO was evaluated by assaying several full 1536-well plates spread out over 4 h. At the optimal mitochondrial extract concentration, reaction rates with R2 values of 0.998 indicated good linearity during the defined assay time (Fig. 1B). The developed assay was found to be linear with respect to both time and the concentration of mitochondrial extracts. Analysis by absorbance also confirmed the batch-to-batch variability was non-significant (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the statistical parameter Z′, which defines a measure of the quality of the HTS (17.Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar), produced a value of 0.62 (Fig. 1D). Specifically, Z′ describes the window between high and low controls by which we can determine our lead “hits”; a well defined hit window is indicated by a value of >0.5 (17.Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the average activities of each well in all plates screened did not indicate plate well positional trends. In all, 134,855 compounds were initially screened at 10 μg/ml or 30 μm using mitochondrial extracts from TMZ-resistant U251 glioma cells (UTMZ cells). Those compounds that had a cutoff value of >21% inhibition of CcO (1059 compounds) were selected for a 10-point concentration response analysis and a cytotoxicity determination. The discriminatory power of the primary screen was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with representative compounds (Fig. 1E) (18.Eng J. Receiver operating characteristic analysis: utility, reality, covariates, and the future.Acad. Radiol. 2013; 20: 795-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). True positives were defined as any compound yielding a well behaved, saturating sigmoidal curve in the dose-response assay. ROC analyses indicated excellent discriminatory power with a fitted ROC area under the curve of 0.984 and an empiric ROC area under the curve of 0.978. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the screen were 93.2%, 90.7%, and 96.5%, respectively. The most promising 163 inhibitors were selected for further analysis on the basis of potency, curve filter, and Hill number. To identify CcO inhibitors selectively toxic to glioma cells, we performed a secondary screen in a cellular environment using a three cell line-based series of assays. The assay has been automated and validated for HTS, and hits from the primary screen were screened to assess reliability and reproducibility of this assay. To assess selectivity of the identified primary hit compounds, a dose-response study with TMZ-resistant UTMZ glioma cells (10.Oliva C.R. Moellering D.R. Gillespie G.Y. Griguer C.E. Acquisition of chemoresistance in gliomas is associated with increased mitochondrial coupling and decreased ROS production.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e24665Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11.Oliva C.R.

Chem. 2010; 285: 39759-39767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the LL-47 fibroblast cell line was conducted, and EC50 values for inhibition of proliferation were determined based on the dose-response curve of 0.039 to 20 μg/ml concentrations of each hit compound. In addition to these two assays, compounds were evaluated in U251 glioma cells to identify compounds effective against the parental, drug-sensitive glioma line, and compounds were evaluated in UTMZ cells in the presence of a sub-lethal dose of TMZ to identify compounds that may work synergistically with TMZ in resistant cells. For all assays, cells were incubated with individual compounds at 37 °C for 72 h, and we determined the number of viable cells in culture using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. We calculated the EC50 value (concentration required to inhibit 50% of the CellTiter-Glo signal) for each compound in each cell line and thereby identified 20 compounds that were toxic to glioma cells but non-toxic for human fibroblasts (supplemental Table S1). Because the spectrophotometric assay of CcO activity measures the accumulation of oxidized cyt c at 550 nm, cyt c reducing agents will give the same results as CcO inhibitors and can thus produce false positive hits. Therefore, we developed and implemented a follow-up assay in which cyt c was incubated with the candidate CcO-inhibiting compounds in the absence of purified CcO or mitochondrial extracts to distinguish compounds that directly reduce cyt c from those that are likely to be true CcO inhibitors. The visible absorption spectra of cyt c was measured with or without the individual addition of the 20 compounds identified by the primary and secondary HTS screenings. Whereas oxidized cyt c produces only one peak at 530 nm, a new band at 550 nm indicating reduced cyt c was observed upon sodium ascorbate treatment (Fig. 2A, positive control). The intensity of the response was dose-dependent, with saturation at 40 μm ascorbate (Fig. 2B). Subsequent validation experiments using the same experimental procedure used for ascorbate suggested that 9 of the 20 drugs identified in the initial screening did not reduce cyt c in the absence of CcO and are thus likely to be true CcO inhibitors (Fig. 2C). We finally prioritized the compounds for further studies by filtering out compounds with an IC50 for CcO inhibition >40 μg/ml. To address the specificity of the remaining hit molecules, we tested the compounds for inhibitory activity against all mitochondrial complex activities. Each of the molecules was tested for the effects on complexes I, II-III, CcO, and complex V of the ETC at the IC50 value established by the primary HTS. One compound was identified as an specific inhibitor of CcO and selected for further analysis: ADDA 5, 1-[2-(1-adamantyl)ethoxy]-3-(3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-isoquinolinyl)-2-propanol hydrochloride] (Fig. 3A). Because ADDA 5 was identified using mitochondrial extracts, we assessed the possibility that the resulting CcO inhibition was a consequence of an indirect effect due to binding to other mitochondrial component(s) by evaluating the effect of ADDA 5 on purified CcO. ADDA 5 was tested against CcO purified from bovine heart (Fig. 3, B and C) and CcO purified from human glioma cells (Fig. 3, D and E). By SDS-PAGE, the purified enzymes gave multiple bands of apparent molecular mass ranging from 12 to 55 kDa. MS-based analysis of each band confirmed the identity of each CcO subunit (Fig. 3, B and D). ADDA 5 inhibited purified CcO from both species, but CcO from human glioma was the most sensitive, with an IC50 of 18.93 ± 0.04 μm, whereas CcO from bovine heart was inhibited with an IC50 of 31.82 ± 2.89 μm. To further define the specificity of ADDA 5, we next determined whether this compound also inhibits xanthine oxidase (XO), catalase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), or glutathione reductase (GR). All these enzymes were suitable controls because they are involved in metabolism and protection against oxidative stress, are found in nearly all mammalian tissues, and are commonly up-regulated in cancer cells. These enzymes were insensitive to ADDA 5 (Fig. 4, A–F), suggesting that ADDA 5 selectively inhibits CcO. We next investigated the kinetic mechanism of ADDA 5 inhibition of CcO. ADDA 5 lowered the Vmax but not the Km for cyt c. Fig. 5A shows the representative Michaelis-Menten graph, and Fig. 5B shows representative Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots indicating a non-competitive inhibition of cyt c, with a 50% decrease in Vmax at 14 μm ADDA 5. According to the Dixon graphical method, the dissociation constant (Ki) for a CcO-ADDA 5 complex is 16.73 ± 0.20 μm (Fig. 5C). Because the maximal CcO inhibition reached a plateau at 60% of the Vmax, we evaluated whether ADDA 5 is a complete or partial CcO inhibitor. Plotting experimental data as v/(v0 − v) versus the reciprocal of the inhibitor concentration at different substrate concentrations, where v and v0 represent the velocity in the presence and absence of the inhibitor, respectively, with a given concentration of the substrate, partial inhibition results in straight lines that converge on the abscissa at a point away from the origin, whereas complete inhibition results in lines that go through the origin (19.Williams Jr., J.N.

Chem. 1981; 256: 10319-10328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5D, ADDA 5 is a partial non-competitive CcO inhibitor, indicating that binding of ADDA 5 to CcO slows but does not completely prevent catalysis. Here, we investigated the cellular bioenergetic response to ADDA 5, specifically the oxygen consumption rates of the chemoresistant UTMZ glioma cells by high resolution respirometry. Cells were allowed to establish a stable baseline, and then CcO inhibitors were injected into the sample chamber. Injection of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin caused a substantial decrease in oxygen flux (rate of respiration) in control cells that was significantly suppressed by ADDA 5 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). To determine the maximal respiratory capacity, the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP was injected into the sample chamber, causing an increase in oxygen flux relative to baseline. However, the maximal oxygen consumption after FCCP injection was significantly decreased in the presence of ADDA 5, indicating a loss of reserve capacity. Finally, injection of antimycin A/rotenone significantly inhibited respiration in all groups, with a greater effect on the control DMSO-treated cells. Fig. 6B shows representative values of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, with glutamate and malate as substrates, obtained for respiration states 3 and 4 and for uncoupled respiration in the presence of FCCP. ADDA 5-treated cells had significantly lower state 3 and higher state 4 oxygen consumption rates (2.10 ± 0.11 and 0.80 ± 0.15 nmol O2/s/mg of protein, respectively) than control-treated cells (3.77 ± 0.33 and 0.18 ± 0.01 nmol O2/s/mg protein, respectively; p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, colony-forming assays in UTMZ cells (9.Oliva C.R. Markert T. Gillespie G.Y. Griguer C.E.

In contrast, DMSO-treated UTMZ cells efficiently formed colonies, reflecting their transformed phenotype (Fig. 6C). Having established that CcO inhibition has an effect on glioma cell proliferation, we evaluated the ability of ADDA 5 to inhibit the growth of UTMZ cells in the flanks of nude mice. Before conducting these efficacy studies, we established an acute toxicity profile, administering ADDA 5 to mice via a dose escalation protocol. Healthy nude mice were exposed daily for 1 week to incrementally increase doses of ADDA 5 up to 80 mg/kg, and weight loss and animal behavior were monitored. Acute treatment with ADDA 5 did not induce detectable toxicity in mice. The mice were followed up for 6 months, and no toxic effects were observed. UTMZ cells were transplanted into mice at 6 weeks of age, and after 12 days the mice were treated intraperitoneally with ADDA 5 (8 mg/kg) or DMSO-saline as a control. Tumor volume was measured once each week, starting at day 28 when tumors became visible. At 43 days, animals reached the end point and were killed, and the final tumor volume of both groups was determined (Fig. 6D). The tumor size and tumor volume of ADDA 5-treated tumors were significantly smaller than those of the control-treated tumors (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively). These data indicate that inhibition of CcO with ADDA 5 halts the growth of chemoresistant glioma tumors in vivo. To further understand the structure-activity relationship of ADDA 5, twelve structural analogs were tested for the ability to inhibit CcO activity (Table 1). Analogs in the active series contain a dihydroisoquinoline core substituted at the primary alcohol with various lipophilic groups. The most active compounds (compounds 9, 12, and ADDA 5) consist of cyclized lipophilic groups such as adamantyl (compound 12 and ADDA 5) and bicycloheptane (compound 9). Compound 10, which contains a methyl and isopropyl group in the 2 and 5 position, respectively, of the cyclohexyl ring is active, but compound 11, which has the same substitutions but in the 3 and 5 position, respectively, is inactive. Compound 6, containing a 2-methyl cyclopropyl group, was weakly active, whereas compounds 5 and 7 were inactive; compound 8 was also only weakly active, further establishing the importance of lipophilicity to activity.TABLE 1Structure-activity relationship for analogs of ADDA 5 Open table in a new tab To further explore the selectivity of these inhibitors, we tested the effect of the analogs on CcO activity and cell toxicity in our chemoresistant cellular model. Under the experimental conditions tested, ADDA 5 and compound 9 specifically inhibited both CcO activity (Fig. 7A) and the growth of UTMZ cells (Fig. 7B), whereas compound 1 was inactive, suggesting that the growth inhibitory effect is dependent on inhibition of CcO activity. We next investigated the effect of selected compounds on mitochondrial extracts from glioma stem cells (GSCs) derived from Jx22 human tissue. ADDA 5 and compound 9 each inhibited the activity of CcO from Jx22-derived GSCs, whereas compound 1 did not (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, histochemical analysis of Jx22-derived GSCs treated with ADDA 5 or compound 9 revealed a significant reduction in staining for CcO activity compared with that in vehicle-treated GSCs (Fig. 8B), indicating inhibition of CcO and reduced mitochondrial respiration after treatment. No differences were detected between compound 1 and vehicle-treated GSCs, confirming that compound 1 is inactive against CcO (Fig. 8, A and B). To quantify the histochemical data, we analyzed the absorbance of images of treated and untreated GSCs. After subtracting the background, the average absorbance (± S.D.) of images of untreated cells was 2.5 (± 0.14), 3.5 (± 0.2), and 1.1 (± 0.06) times greater than that of images of ADDA 5-, compound 9-, and compound 1-treated cells, respectively. These results confirm that"
https://openalex.org/W2523845756,"Dynamic alterations of the extracellular matrix in response to injury directly modulate inflammation and consequently the promotion and resolution of disease. During inflammation, hyaluronan (HA) is increased at sites of inflammation where it may be covalently modified with the heavy chains (HC) of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor. Deposition of this unique, pathological form of HA (HC-HA) leads to the formation of cable-like structures that promote adhesion of leukocytes. Naive mononuclear leukocytes bind specifically to inflammation-associated HA matrices but do not adhere to HA constitutively expressed under homeostatic conditions. In this study, we have directly investigated a role for the blood-coagulation protease thrombin in regulating the adhesion of monocytic cells to smooth muscle cells producing an inflammatory matrix. Our data demonstrate that the proteolytic activity of thrombin negatively regulates the adhesion of monocytes to an inflammatory HC-HA complex. This effect is independent of protease-activated receptor activation but requires proteolytic activity toward a novel substrate. Components of HC-HA complexes were predicted to contain conserved thrombin-susceptible cleavage sites based on sequence analysis, and heavy chain 1 (HC1) was confirmed to be a substrate of thrombin. Thrombin treatment is sufficient to cleave HC1 associated with either cell-surface HA or serum inter-α-trypsin inhibitor. Furthermore, thrombin treatment of the inflammatory matrix leads to dissolution of HC-HA cable structures and abolishes leukocyte adhesion. These data establish a novel mechanism whereby thrombin cleavage of HC1 regulates the adhesive properties of an inflammatory HA matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2525185519,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) catalyzes vascular bioactivation of the antianginal drug nitroglycerin (GTN), resulting in activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-mediated vasodilation. We have previously shown that a minor reaction of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioconversion, accounting for about 5% of the main clearance-based turnover yielding inorganic nitrite, results in direct NO formation and concluded that this minor pathway could provide the link between vascular GTN metabolism and activation of sGC. However, lack of detectable NO at therapeutically relevant GTN concentrations (≤1 μm) in vascular tissue called into question the biological significance of NO formation by purified ALDH2. We addressed this issue and used a novel, highly sensitive genetically encoded fluorescent NO probe (geNOp) to visualize intracellular NO formation at low GTN concentrations (≤1 μm) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) expressing an ALDH2 mutant that reduces GTN to NO but lacks clearance-based GTN denitration activity. NO formation was compared with GTN-induced activation of sGC. The addition of 1 μm GTN to VSMC expressing either wild-type or C301S/C303S ALDH2 resulted in pronounced intracellular NO elevation, with maximal concentrations of 7 and 17 nm, respectively. Formation of GTN-derived NO correlated well with activation of purified sGC in VSMC lysates and cGMP accumulation in intact porcine aortic endothelial cells infected with wild-type or mutant ALDH2. Formation of NO and cGMP accumulation were inhibited by ALDH inhibitors chloral hydrate and daidzin. The present study demonstrates that ALDH2-catalyzed NO formation is necessary and sufficient for GTN bioactivation in VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W2524429218,"Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) catalyze the NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids and are important for metabolism and detoxification. Although the ALDH superfamily fold is well established, some ALDHs contain an uncharacterized domain of unknown function (DUF) near the C terminus of the polypeptide chain. Herein, we report the first structure of a protein containing the ALDH superfamily DUF. Proline utilization A from Sinorhizobium meliloti (SmPutA) is a 1233-residue bifunctional enzyme that contains the DUF in addition to proline dehydrogenase and l-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalytic modules. Structures of SmPutA with a proline analog bound to the proline dehydrogenase site and NAD+ bound to the ALDH site were determined in two space groups at 1.7–1.9 A resolution. The DUF consists of a Rossmann dinucleotide-binding fold fused to a three-stranded β-flap. The Rossmann domain resembles the classic ALDH superfamily NAD+-binding domain, whereas the flap is strikingly similar to the ALDH superfamily dimerization domain. Paradoxically, neither structural element performs its implied function. Electron density maps show that NAD+ does not bind to the DUF Rossmann fold, and small-angle X-ray scattering reveals a novel dimer that has never been seen in the ALDH superfamily. The structure suggests that the DUF is an adapter domain that stabilizes the aldehyde substrate binding loop and seals the substrate-channeling tunnel via tertiary structural interactions that mimic the quaternary structural interactions found in non-DUF PutAs. Kinetic data for SmPutA indicate a substrate-channeling mechanism, in agreement with previous studies of other PutAs."
https://openalex.org/W2527663580,"Purpose High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as a time-efficient format of exercise to reduce the chronic disease burden associated with sedentary behaviour. Changes in oxygen utilisation at the local tissue level during an acute session of HIIT could be the primary stimulus for the health benefits associated with this format of exercise. The recovery periods of HIIT effect the physiological responses that occur during the session. It was hypothesised that in sedentary individuals, local and systemic oxygen utilisation would be higher during HIIT interspersed with active recovery periods, when compared to passive recovery periods. Methods Twelve sedentary males (mean ± SD; age 23 ± 3 yr) completed three conditions on a cycle ergometer: 1) HIIT with passive recovery periods between four bouts (HIITPASS) 2) HIIT with active recovery periods between four bouts (HIITACT) 3) HIITACT with four HIIT bouts replaced with passive periods (REC). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius (GN) muscles and the pre-frontal cortex (FH), oxygen consumption (VO2), power output and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously during the three conditions. Results There was a significant increase in HHb at VL during bouts 2 (p = 0.017), 3 (p = 0.035) and 4 (p = 0.035) in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS. Mean power output was significantly lower in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS (p < 0.001). There was a significant main effect for site in both HIITPASS (p = 0.029) and HIITACT (p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in VO2 and HR between HIITPASS and HIITACT. Conclusions The increase in HHb at VL and the lower mean power output during HIITACT could indicate that a higher level of deoxygenation contributes to decreased mechanical power in sedentary participants. The significant differences in HHb between sites indicates the specificity of oxygen utilisation."
https://openalex.org/W2524617669,"An understanding of the habitat selection patterns by wild herbivores is critical for adaptive management, particularly towards ecosystem management and wildlife conservation in semi arid savanna ecosystems. We tested the following predictions: (i) surface water availability, habitat quality and human presence have a strong influence on the spatial distribution of wild herbivores in the dry season, (ii) habitat suitability for large herbivores would be higher compared to medium-sized herbivores in the dry season, and (iii) spatial extent of suitable habitats for wild herbivores will be different between years, i.e., 2006 and 2010, in Matetsi Safari Area, Zimbabwe. MaxEnt modeling was done to determine the habitat suitability of large herbivores and medium-sized herbivores. MaxEnt modeling of habitat suitability for large herbivores using the environmental variables was successful for the selected species in 2006 and 2010, except for elephant (Loxodonta africana) for the year 2010. Overall, large herbivores probability of occurrence was mostly influenced by distance from rivers. Distance from roads influenced much of the variability in the probability of occurrence of medium-sized herbivores. The overall predicted area for large and medium-sized herbivores was not different. Large herbivores may not necessarily utilize larger habitat patches over medium-sized herbivores due to the habitat homogenizing effect of water provisioning. Effect of surface water availability, proximity to riverine ecosystems and roads on habitat suitability of large and medium-sized herbivores in the dry season was highly variable thus could change from one year to another. We recommend adaptive management initiatives aimed at ensuring dynamic water supply in protected areas through temporal closure and or opening of water points to promote heterogeneity of wildlife habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2524906547,"Metagenomics has opened up a vast pool of genes for putative, yet uncharacterized, enzymes. It widens our knowledge on the enzyme diversity world and discloses new families for which a clear classification is still needed, as is exemplified by glycoside hydrolase family-3 (GH3) proteins. Herein, we describe a GH3 enzyme (GlyA1) from resident microbial communities in strained ruminal fluid. The enzyme is a β-glucosidase/β-xylosidase that also shows β-galactosidase, β-fucosidase, α-arabinofuranosidase, and α-arabinopyranosidase activities. Short cello- and xylo-oligosaccharides, sophorose and gentibiose, are among the preferred substrates, with the large polysaccharide lichenan also being hydrolyzed by GlyA1. The determination of the crystal structure of the enzyme in combination with deletion and site-directed mutagenesis allowed identification of its unusual domain composition and the active site architecture. Complexes of GlyA1 with glucose, galactose, and xylose allowed picturing the catalytic pocket and illustrated the molecular basis of the substrate specificity. A hydrophobic platform defined by residues Trp-711 and Trp-106, located in a highly mobile loop, appears able to allocate differently β-linked bioses. GlyA1 includes an additional C-terminal domain previously unobserved in GH3 members, but crystallization of the full-length enzyme was unsuccessful. Therefore, small angle x-ray experiments have been performed to investigate the molecular flexibility and overall putative shape. This study provided evidence that GlyA1 defines a new subfamily of GH3 proteins with a novel permuted domain topology. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this topology is associated with microbes inhabiting the digestive tracts of ruminants and other animals, feeding on chemically diverse plant polymeric materials."
https://openalex.org/W2524637589,"Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have considerably advanced our understanding of human traits and diseases. With the increasing availability of whole genome sequences (WGS) for pathogens, it is important to establish whether GWAS of viral genomes could reveal important biological insights. Here we perform the first proof of concept viral GWAS examining drug resistance (DR), a phenotype with well understood genetics. Method We performed a GWAS of DR in a sample of 343 HIV subtype C patients failing 1st line antiretroviral treatment in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The majority and minority variants within each sequence were called using PILON, and GWAS was performed within PLINK. HIV WGS from patients failing on different antiretroviral treatments were compared to sequences derived from individuals naïve to the respective treatment. Results GWAS methodology was validated by identifying five associations on a genetic level that led to amino acid changes known to cause DR. Further, we highlighted the ability of GWAS to identify epistatic effects, identifying two replicable variants within amino acid 68 of the reverse transcriptase protein previously described as potential fitness compensatory mutations. A possible additional DR variant within amino acid 91 of the matrix region of the Gag protein was associated with tenofovir failure, highlighting GWAS’s ability to identify variants outside classical candidate genes. Our results also suggest a polygenic component to DR. Conclusions These results validate the applicability of GWAS to HIV WGS data even in relative small samples, and emphasise how high throughput sequencing can provide novel and clinically relevant insights. Further they suggested that for viruses like HIV, population structure was only minor concern compared to that seen in bacteria or parasite GWAS. Given the small genome length and reduced burden for multiple testing, this makes HIV an ideal candidate for GWAS."
https://openalex.org/W2526335555,"The study of population differentiation in the context of ecological speciation is commonly assessed using populations with obvious discreteness. Fewer studies have examined diversifying populations with occasional adaptive variation and minor reproductive isolation, so factors impeding or facilitating the progress of early stage differentiation are less understood. We detected non-random genetic structuring in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) inhabiting a large, pristine, postglacial lake (Mistassini Lake, Canada), with up to five discernible genetic clusters having distinctions in body shape, size, colouration and head shape. However, genetic differentiation was low (FST = 0.017) and genetic clustering was largely incongruent between several population- and individual-based clustering approaches. Genotype- and phenotype-environment associations with spatial habitat, depth and fish community structure (competitors and prey) were either inconsistent or weak. Striking morphological variation was often more continuous within than among defined genetic clusters. Low genetic differentiation was a consequence of relatively high contemporary gene flow despite large effective population sizes, not migration-drift disequilibrium. Our results suggest a highly plastic propensity for occupying multiple habitat niches in lake trout and a low cost of morphological plasticity, which may constrain the speed and extent of adaptive divergence. We discuss how factors relating to niche conservatism in this species may also influence how plasticity affects adaptive divergence, even where ample ecological opportunity apparently exists."
https://openalex.org/W2525527370,"Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. To date, few studies have been conducted on the altered expression of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) in women with PCOS. The present study was performed to examine the role of the serum miRNA as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PCOS and its relationship with metabolic and reproductive traits. Methods A cross-sectional comparison was made in 21 women with PCOS and age- and body mass index (BMI)- matched 21 healthy women in an academic center laboratory between December 2008 and October 2010. We selected miRNAs that were more than 1.5-fold up-regulated or less than 0.67-fold down-regulated in women with PCOS compared with controls using the SurePrint G3 Human miRNA Microarray. Subsequently, we validated the relative expression of the miRNAs using TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. Results Serum miRNA-4522, miRNA-324-3p, and miRNA-6767-5p were down-regulated in women with PCOS compared with controls in the microarray analysis. Among these miRNAs, serum miRNA-6767-5p was validated (fold change in women with PCOS/controls = 0.39, P-value<0.05) by RT-qPCR. The miRNA-6767-5p was negatively associated with fasting glucose (β = -0.370) and positively associated with the number of menses per year (β = 0.383) after adjustment for age and BMI (Ps<0.05). Genes targeted by miRNA-6767-5p were involved in the cell cycle and the immune system. Conclusions Serum miRNA-6767-5p may be a novel candidate as a molecular biomarker in the diagnosis of PCOS and may participate in the development of the metabolic and reproductive traits of PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W2526958190,"Because ethanol consumption is commonly associated with a high cholesterol diet, we examined whether combined consumption of ethanol and high cholesterol increases liver injury and fibrosis.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing: 1) 35% of calories from corn oil (CTR), 2) CTR plus 0.5% (w/v) cholesterol (Chol), 3) CTR plus ethanol (27% of calories) (EtOH), or 4) EtOH+Chol for 3 months.In mice fed Chol or EtOH alone, ALT increased to ~160 U/L, moderate hepatic steatosis occurred, and leukocyte infiltration, necrosis, and apoptosis increased modestly, but no observable fibrosis developed. By contrast in mice fed EtOH+Chol, ALT increased to ~270 U/L, steatosis was more extensive and mostly macrovesicular, and expression of proinflammatory molecules (HMGB-1, TLR4, TNFα, ICAM-1) and leukocyte infiltration increased substantially. Necrosis and apoptosis also increased. Trichrome staining and second harmonic generation microscopy revealed hepatic fibrosis. Fibrosis was mostly sinusoidal and/or perivenular, but in some mice bridging fibrosis occurred. Expression of smooth muscle α-actin and TGF-β1 increased slightly by Chol, moderately by EtOH, and markedly by EtOH+Chol. TGF-β pseudoreceptor BAMBI increased slightly by Chol, remained unchanged by EtOH and decreased by EtOH+Chol. MicroRNA-33a, which enhances TGF-β fibrotic effects, and phospho-Smad2/3, the down-stream signal of TGF-β, also increased more greatly by EtOH+Chol than Chol or EtOH. Metalloproteinase-2 and -9 were decreased only by EtOH+Chol.High dietary cholesterol and chronic ethanol consumption synergistically increase liver injury, inflammation, and profibrotic responses and suppress antifibrotic responses, leading to severe steatohepatitis and early fibrosis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2523801412,"Bedside inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound has been proposed as a non-invasive measure of volume status. We compared ultrasound measurements of the caval index (CI) and physician gestalt to predict blood pressure response in patients requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation.This was a prospective study of adult emergency department patients requiring fluid resuscitation. A structured data sheet was used to record serial vital signs and the treating clinician's impression of patient volume status and cause of hypotension. Bedside ultrasound CI measurements were performed at baseline and after each 500mL of fluid. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to characterize the relationship between CI and Physician gestalt, and the change in mean arterial pressure (MAP).We enrolled 364 patients, 52% male, mean age 36 years. Indications for fluid resuscitation were haemorrhage (54%), dehydration (30%), and sepsis (17%). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found optimal CI cut-off values of 45%, 52% and 53% to predict a MAP rise of 5, 8 and 10 mmHg per litre of fluid, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CI of 50% for predicting a 10mmHg increase in MAP per litre were 88% (95%CI 81-93%) and 73% (95%CI 67-79%), respectively, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.85 (0.81-0.89). The sensitivity and specificity of physician gestalt estimate of volume depletion severity were 68% (95%CI 60-75%) and 86% (95%CI 80-90%), respectively, AUC = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.87). Those with a baseline CI ≥ 50% (51% of patients) had a 2.8-fold greater fluid responsiveness than those with a baseline CI<50% (p<0.0001).Ultrasound measurement of the CI can predict blood pressure response among patients requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and may be useful in early identification of patients who will benefit most from volume resuscitation, and those who will likely require other interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2524852542,"Isolation of Mycoplasma genitalium from clinical specimens remains difficult and few strains are available for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We describe the antimicrobial susceptibility of M. genitalium strains grown in Vero cell culture with first- and second- line antibiotics, using a modified cell-culture-based method. Macrolide- and -fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were detected by sequencing of the 23S and parC genes, respectively. Seven strains were examined, including three new, genetically distinct M. genitalium strains isolated from endocervical and urethral swab specimens from Cuban patients together with four reference strains isolated from specimens collected from men in Denmark, Sweden and Australia. Azithromycin was the most active drug against two of the Cuban M. genitalium strains with MICs values of 0.008 mg/liter, however, one strain was macrolide resistant with an MIC of >8 mg/liter, and the A2059G resistant genotype. Ciprofloxacin was the least active antimicrobial drug and moxifloxacin was the most active fluoroquinolone against the new clinical strains, although an MIC of 1 mg/l was found for two strains. However, no relevant parC mutations were detected. MICs for tetracyclines were 0.5-4 mg/liter. Although the number of Cuban strains was low, the results suggest that a single-dose azithromycin treatment could be ineffective, and that a second-line treatment with moxifloxacin, should become an option in Cuba. To our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation and antibiotic susceptibility testing of M. genitalium strains from the Latin-American region, and the first detection of macrolide resistance in such strains."
https://openalex.org/W2464976450,"Experiments of cell migration and chemotaxis assays have been classically performed in the so-called Boyden Chambers. A recent technology, xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analysis, is now allowing to monitor the cell migration in real time. This technology measures impedance changes caused by the gradual increase of electrode surface occupation by cells during the course of time and provide a Cell Index which is proportional to cellular morphology, spreading, ruffling and adhesion quality as well as cell number. In this paper we propose a macroscopic mathematical model, based on advection-reaction-diffusion partial differential equations, describing the cell migration assay using the real-time technology. We carried out numerical simulations to compare simulated model dynamics with data of observed biological experiments on three different cell lines and in two experimental settings: absence of chemotactic signals (basal migration) and presence of a chemoattractant. Overall we conclude that our minimal mathematical model is able to describe the phenomenon in the real time scale and numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental evidences."
https://openalex.org/W2525143321,"Alpha-lipoic acid (aLA) is a strong antioxidant commonly used for treating diabetic polyneuropathy. Previously, we demonstrated the neurorestorative effects of aLA after cerebral ischemia in rats. However, its effects on patients with stroke remain unknown. We investigated whether patients treated with aLA have better functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and reperfusion therapy than patients not receiving aLA.In this retrospective study of 172 prospectively registered patients with diabetes and AIS treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), we investigated the relationship between aLA use and functional outcome both after 3 months and after 1 year. The functional outcomes included occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), early neurological deterioration (END), and early clinical improvement (ECI). Favorable outcomes were defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 0-2.Of the 172 patients with AIS and diabetes, 47 (27.3%) used aLA. In the entire cohort, favorable outcomes occurred at significantly higher rates both at 3 months and at 1 year in those treated with aLA. The risks for END and HT were lower and the occurrence of ECI was higher in patients treated with aLA. In multivariable analysis, aLA use was associated with favorable outcomes both at 3 months and at 1 year. Age, HT, and increased National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were negative predictors of a favorable outcome.The use of aLA in patients with AIS and diabetes who are treated with tPA is associated with favorable outcomes. These results indicate that aLA could be a useful intervention for the treatment of AIS after reperfusion therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2525523047,"Lameness and lesions to the skin and claws of sows in group housing are commonly occurring indicators of reduced welfare. Typically, these problems are more common in group housing than in individual housing systems. Group management type (dynamic versus static) and stage of gestation influence the behavior of the animals, which in turn influences the occurrence of these problems. The present study compared prevalence, incidence and mean scores of lameness and skin and claw lesions in static versus dynamic group housed sows at different stages of gestation during three consecutive reproductive cycles. A total of 10 Belgian sow herds were monitored; 5 in which dynamic groups and 5 in which static groups were utilized. All sows were visually assessed for lameness and skin lesions three times per cycle and the claws of the hind limbs were assessed once per cycle. Lameness and claw lesions were assessed using visual analogue scales. Static groups, in comparison with dynamic groups, demonstrated lower lameness scores (P<0.05) and decreased skin lesion prevalence (24.9 vs. 47.3%, P<0.05) at the end of gestation. There was no difference between treatment group regarding claw lesion prevalence with 75.5% of sows demonstrating claw lesions regardless of group management. Prevalences of lameness (22.4 vs. 8.9%, P<0.05) and skin lesions (46.6 vs. 4.4%, P<0.05) were highest during the group-housed phase compared to the individually housed phases. Although the prevalence of lameness and skin lesions did not differ three days after grouping versus at the end of the group-housing phase, their incidence peaked during the first three days after moving from the insemination stalls to the group. In conclusion, the first three days after grouping was the most risky period for lameness incidence, but there was no significant difference between static or dynamic group management."
https://openalex.org/W2526052123,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise (AE) in reducing bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice of a Th2-dominant immune background (BALB/c).BALB/c mice were distributed into: sedentary, control (CON), Exercise-only (EX), sedentary, bleomycin-treated (BLEO) and bleomycin-treated+exercised (BLEO+EX); (n = 8/group). Following treadmill adaptation, 15 days following a single, oro-tracheal administration of bleomycin (1.5U/kg), AE was performed 5 days/week, 60min/day for 4 weeks at moderate intensity (60% of maximum velocity reached during a physical test) and assessed for pulmonary inflammation and remodeling, and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).At 45 days post injury, compared to BLEO, BLEO+EX demonstrated reduced collagen deposition in the airways (p<0.001) and also in the lung parenchyma (p<0.001). In BAL, a decreased number of total leukocytes (p<0.01), eosinophils (p<0.001), lymphocytes (p<0.01), macrophages (p<0.01), and neutrophils (p<0.01), as well as reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (CXCL-1; p<0.01), (IL-1β; p<0.001), (IL-5; p<0.01), (IL-6; p<0.001), (IL-13; p<0.01) and pro-fibrotic growth factor IGF-1 (p<0.001) were observed. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased (p<0.001).AE attenuated bleomycin-induced collagen deposition, inflammation and cytokines accumulation in the lungs of mice with a predominately Th2-background suggesting that therapeutic AE (15-44 days post injury) attenuates the pro-inflammatory, Th2 immune response and fibrosis in the bleomycin model."

Trajectories of birds flying towards each other in a tunnel were recorded using high speed video cameras. Analysis and modelling of the data suggest two simple strategies for collision avoidance: (a) each bird veers to its right and (b) each bird changes its altitude relative to the other bird according to a preset preference. Both strategies suggest simple rules by which collisions can be avoided in head-on encounters by two agents, be they animals or machines. The findings are potentially applicable to the design of guidance algorithms for automated collision avoidance on aircraft."
https://openalex.org/W2526379475,"In lek mating systems, males aggregate and defend arenas where they display for females; females select and mate with a male and then solely raise their offspring. Generally, female visits and copulations increase and reproductive variance in male mating success declines with lek size. Here we investigate how male display effort changes across a gradient in lek size. We expect male display effort, an energetically expensive activity, will increase with lek size and male rank due to changes in breeding opportunities and competition among males. We test the interaction of male rank and lek size on display effort using the white-bearded manakin, Manacus manacus (Aves: Pipridae), a well-studied species with a wide geographic distribution in the new world tropics. We used mini-video recorders to simultaneously capture female visits and display behaviors of 41 males distributed over 10 leks. We found that overall display effort increased disproportionately with lek size due to males of both high and low ranks increasing their display effort at larger leks. Our results suggest that increased breeding opportunities and intrasexual competition at larger leks result in males of different ranks investing similarly in increased display effort in order to attract females."
https://openalex.org/W2525582001,"The bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC) is a member of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (Deg/ENaC) family of ion channels. It is mainly found in bile duct epithelial cells, the intestinal tract, and the cerebellum and is activated by alterations of its membrane environment. Bile acids, one class of putative physiological activators, exert their effect by changing membrane properties, leading to an opening of the channel. The physiological function of BASIC, however, is unknown. Deg/ENaC channels are characterized by a trimeric subunit composition. Each subunit is composed of two transmembrane segments, which are linked by a large extracellular domain. The termini of the channels protrude into the cytosol. Many Deg/ENaC channels contain regulatory domains and sequence motifs within their cytosolic domains. In this study, we show that BASIC contains an amphiphilic α-helical structure within its N-terminal domain. This α-helix binds to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane and stabilizes a closed state. Truncation of this domain renders the channel hyperactive. Collectively, we identify a cytoplasmic domain, unique to BASIC, that controls channel activity via membrane interaction."

However, how δ participates in both up-regulation and down-regulation of genes in vivo remains unclear.

In addition, few reports suggested that the protein was required for virulence in certain bacteria (14.Seepersaud R. Needham R.H. Kim C.S. Jones A.L.

Lack of the δ subunit of RNA polymerase increases virulence related traits of Streptococcus mutans.PloS One. 2011; 6: e20075Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This finding was further supported by the transcriptome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus strains with and without δ, which showed that the protein was involved in down-regulation of the genes that encode virulence factors as well as in up-regulation of certain genes (17.Xue X. Li J. Wang W. Sztajer H. Wagner-Döbler I.

Immun. 2014; 82: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our recent observation that δ functions as a transcriptional activator could explain the mechanism of up-regulation of genes (11.Prajapati R.K. Sengupta S. Rudra P. Mukhopadhyay J. Bacillus subtilis δ factor functions as a transcriptional regulator by facilitating the open complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 1064-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, how the same protein could function in down-regulation of genes remains unknown. Based on the fact that δ binds to A-rich sequence, we predicted that δ may function as a transcriptional repressor for a promoter on which the binding sites of δ and RNAP overlap. We found that spo0B of B. subtilis, the gene involved in sporulation of the bacteria, contains a promoter with a putative δ binding site at the −35 element (19.Bouvier J. Stragier P. Bonamy C. Szulmajster J. Nucleotide sequence of the spo0B gene of Bacillus subtilis and regulation of its expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7012-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20.Sonenshein A.L. Control of sporulation initiation in Bacillus subtilis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Using in vitro biochemical assays, we show that δ represses transcription from the spo0B promoter by inhibiting the open complex formation. The mRNA level of the spo0B gene is significantly elevated in a δ knock-out strain. Thus, transcriptional repression by δ suggests the mechanism of down-regulation of genes by δ. The spo0B promoter of B. subtilis contains an A-rich sequence at the −35 element of its promoter (19.Bouvier J. Stragier P. Bonamy C. Szulmajster J. Nucleotide sequence of the spo0B gene of Bacillus subtilis and regulation of its expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7012-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the promoter does not contain a consensus −35 element, but contains an extended −10-like element (Fig. 1A). Because δ exhibits affinity to the A-rich sequence, we examined the effect of δ on this promoter. We prepared a linear double-stranded (ds)DNA fragment (−105/+57) containing the spo0B promoter and performed in vitro transcription assays on this DNA fragment in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of δ. Two sets of in vitro transcription assays were performed. First, we incubated the promoter fragment with δ to allow binding of the protein to DNA prior to addition of RNAP (Fig. 1B). The result showed that δ inhibits transcription from the spo0B promoter with an approximate IC50 of 53 ± 10 nm. In the second assay, RNAP was first incubated with the promoter fragment to form an open complex and then added with δ before transcription initiation. To our surprise, we also observed a significant extent of inhibition by δ in the in vitro transcription assay (Fig. 1C). Thus, δ inhibits transcription from the spo0B promoter regardless of the order of addition of the protein on the DNA-RNAP complex. The result further suggests that the open complex formation at this promoter is not stable enough and could be easily destabilized by δ. To further test the interaction of δ with the spo0B promoter in vivo, we employed a recombinant reporter assay as used previously (11.Prajapati R.K. Sengupta S. Rudra P. Mukhopadhyay J. Bacillus subtilis δ factor functions as a transcriptional regulator by facilitating the open complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 1064-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The assay involved a three plasmid expression system in Escherichia coli: one plasmid for expression of RNAP core (pNG219 (21.Yang X. Lewis P.J. Overproduction and purification of recombinant Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase.Protein Exp. Purif. 2008; 59: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), one for expression of σA and δ (pYcACDuet-rpoD-rpoE), and the third for expression of mCherry, which was controlled by the spo0B promoter. All three plasmids were transformed in E. coli B834 (DE3) and the cells were grown at 16 °C for 16 h after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. To rule out the possible interference by E. coli (Ec) RNAP on the mCherry expression, we performed control assays by omitting BsRNAP expressing plasmid, pNG219. The assays were carried out with and without δ (Fig. 1D). The levels of mCherry expression by BsRNAP holo in the presence of δ was normalized to 1. mCherry fluorescence from the control assay with E. coli harboring only pFPVmCherry-spo0B was very small and was considered as the background fluorescence. On the other hand, expression of the BsRNAP core or δ in the control assays increased mCherry expression marginally compared with the background. In contrast, expression of BsRNAP holo resulted in at least a 4-fold increase in the mCherry expression level from the spo0B promoter. The presence of δ decreased mCherry expression from the spo0B promoter to a level comparable with the controls. Thus, the result indicated a repression of the spo0B promoter by δ. Although, the levels of expression of mCherry, and the extent of repression of the spo0B promoter by δ in our reporter assay in E. coli could be different if being performed in B. subtilis, our results unequivocally confirm the in vivo interaction of δ with the spo0B promoter. To test whether the A-rich sequence around the −35 element of the spo0B promoter is responsible for the δ-mediated inhibition of transcription, we, first, generated a spo0B promoter derivative (spo0B mut1) by mutating the AA nucleotide at −34, −35 positions of the template strand by T and C, respectively (Fig. 2A). When a in vitro transcription assay was performed with this promoter derivative, we observed a significant enhancement of transcript yield in the presence of δ, instead of a loss of inhibition of transcription (Fig. 2B). To find out the possible explanation of this result, we noticed that the spo0B promoter fragment contains an additional A-rich sequence upstream of the −35 element (sequence from −44 to −48). Previously, we had shown that δ activates transcription from a promoter when it binds to the A-rich DNA immediately upstream of the −35 element (11.Prajapati R.K. Sengupta S. Rudra P. Mukhopadhyay J. Bacillus subtilis δ factor functions as a transcriptional regulator by facilitating the open complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 1064-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that this sequence element might be responsible for the δ-mediated increase in the transcript yield on the spo0B mutant derivative. This prediction was subsequently verified by generating another spo0B promoter derivative (spo0B mut2) in which the −45, −46, and −47 nucleotides of the non-template strand of the spo0B mut1 was replaced by three C nucleotides (Fig. 2A). The in vitro transcription assay with this promoter derivative showed no or little change in the transcript yield by δ (Fig. 2C). Similarly, when the spo0B mut2 promoter was used in the in vivo reporter assay, no significant change of the mCherry expression was observed in the presence of δ (Fig. 2D). Because the results of both in vitro transcription assay and in vivo reporter assay indicated that the A-rich sequence is required for δ-mediated transcription inhibition, we tested the ability of δ to bind the A-rich sequence by fluorescence anisotropy assay. We used the same spo0B DNA fragment (−105/+57) used for the transcription assay. For control, we used a DNA fragment of the spo0B promoter in which the putative A-rich binding sites for δ were altered by site-directed mutagenesis (spo0B mut2, sequence shown in Fig. 2A). When fluorescence anisotropy assays were performed with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled δ, we observed that the protein bound to the spo0B DNA fragments with a dissociation constant of 37 ± 3 nm (Fig. 2E), but not to the spo0B mut2 that did not contain any putative site for δ (Fig. 2F). Thus, the result confirms that the A-rich sequence around the −35 element is required for binding of δ. Because δ binds to the A-rich sequence near the −35 element of the spo0B promoter, a site that overlaps with the RNAP binding region, it is likely that δ inhibits RNAP-promoter complex formation. This was confirmed by EMSA of the RNAP-DNA complex formed in the presence of δ. For detection of the RNAP-DNA complex, we labeled the spo0B promoter DNA fragment (−105/+30) with γ-32P at the 5′ end of the template strand. The upper band in the EMSA that corresponds to the RNAP-promoter complex decreased with the increasing amount of δ (Fig. 3A). Thus, the result clearly indicates that δ prevents the binding of RNAP to the spo0B promoter DNA, hence, subsequently prevents the RNAP-DNA complex formation on this promoter. When the A-rich sequence at the −35 region was mutated to abolish the δ binding to the spo0B promoter (spo0B mut1), the protein is unable to prevent RNAP-DNA complex formation (Fig. 3B). The spo0B promoter contains an extended −10 element. The −35 region includes a stretch of T nucleotides instead of the consensus sequence. In a normal promoter, σ region 2.4 interacts with the −10 element and σ region 4.2 interacts with the −35 element to form an RNAP-promoter complex (22.Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester-Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Structure of the bacterial RNA polymerase promoter specificity σ subunit.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In contrast, for the promoter that contains an extended −10 element, the interaction between σ region 4.2 and −35 element is not required for the RNAP-promoter complex formation. In the extended −10 promoter, the σ region 4.2, although not clearly known, is possibly located near the −35 element. Because the spo0B promoter contains a −35 element that includes a binding site for δ, we speculated that the binding of δ might involve a steric clash with σ region 4.2 that occludes the binding of RNAP to the promoter. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a σA derivative that lacks region 4.2 (σAΔ4.2) (Fig. 4A) and assessed the effect of δ in transcription by the RNAP derivative containing σAΔ4.2. The result showed that removal of σ region 4.2 did not affect the ability of the σ derivative to initiate transcription from the spo0B promoter (Fig. 4B, lane 1), however, δ-mediated inhibition of transcription at the promoter was abrogated. Only a small extent of inhibition was observed at very high concentrations of δ (Fig. 4B). When the assay was performed with the spo0B mut2, an increase in the transcription yield was observed due to the effect of δ bound at the A-rich sequence upstream of the −35 element (Fig. 4C). The result suggests that upon removal of σ region 4.2, the RNAP derivative is able to form an RNAP-DNA complex even when the −35 element is occupied by δ. This was verified by EMSA with the RNAP derivative, which showed that δ-mediated inhibition of RNAP-DNA complex formation on the spo0B promoter was forfeited (Fig. 4D). The simplest interpretation of the result is that removal of σ region 4.2 creates enough space to accommodate δ without disturbing the RNAP-promoter complex. Thus, both RNAP and δ simultaneously bind to the promoter without affecting the open complex formation, and subsequent transcription initiation. Our in vitro results clearly indicate that δ inhibits transcription from the spo0B promoter. To verify the in vivo effect of δ on the expression of the spo0B gene, we monitored the mRNA expression level of the same gene in wild-type and δ knock-out strains. As a control, the mRNA levels of the rpoA (the gene for α subunit of RNAP), a housekeeping gene, was monitored for both the strains. Real time PCR data of the cDNA generated from the mRNA pool showed that the level of expression of spo0B is ∼1.7-fold less in the wild-type strain than in δ knock-out strain (Fig. 5). The result suggests that δ down-regulates the spo0B gene in vivo. Previously we showed that δ acts as a transcriptional activator of certain genes. At these promoters, δ binds to DNA immediately upstream of the −35 element at an A-rich sequence and enhances the rate of open complex formation (11.Prajapati R.K. Sengupta S. Rudra P. Mukhopadhyay J. Bacillus subtilis δ factor functions as a transcriptional regulator by facilitating the open complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 1064-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that δ also functions as a transcriptional repressor on the spo0B promoter. In this promoter, δ binds to the A-rich sequence located at the −35 element and inhibits the open complex formation. Thus, the protein could act both as a transcriptional activator and repressor depending on the location of its binding site. This finding is consistent with the previous observation that δ is involved in both up-regulation and down-regulation of several genes in bacteria (17.Xue X. Li J. Wang W. Sztajer H. Wagner-Döbler I.

Ibarra J.A. Paoletti J. Carroll R.K. Shaw L.N. The δ subunit of RNA polymerase guides promoter selectivity and virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.Infect. Immun. 2014; 82: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). spo0B, the promoter used in this study, does not contain any −35 element, instead contains a binding site for δ at the −35 element and has an extended −10-like promoter sequence (19.Bouvier J. Stragier P. Bonamy C. Szulmajster J. Nucleotide sequence of the spo0B gene of Bacillus subtilis and regulation of its expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 7012-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the RNAP-DNA complex at the extended −10 promoter, σ region 4.2 does not interact with the −35 element. When this σ region 4.2 is omitted from the initiation factor, both the RNAP derivative and δ could simultaneously occupy the promoter region. As a result δ fails to prevent the binding of the RNAP derivative to the promoter and thereby, is unable to inhibit transcription. On the other hand, the presence of σ region 4.2, although is not required for the promoter recognition, induces a steric clash with δ preventing the binding of RNAP at the spo0B promoter. Our studies with the mutant spo0B promoter derivatives further confirm the role of δ binding at the −35 element in inhibiting the RNAP-promoter interaction and transcription. It is important to note that δ is able to inhibit transcription from this promoter even when added after the formation of the open complex. This observation suggests that the RNAP-DNA interaction at this promoter is not very stable. Similar to the spo0B promoter, we found δ-mediated repression of transcription both in vitro and in vivo on four other promoters, e.g. xynA (23.Garcia-Vallvé S. Palau J. Romeu A. Horizontal gene transfer in glycosyl hydrolases inferred from codon usage in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), purT (24.Saxild H.H. Jacobsen J.H. Nygaard P. Functional analysis of the Bacillus subtilis purT gene encoding formate-dependent glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase.Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), cydA (25.Winstedt L. Yoshida K. Fujita Y. von Wachenfeldt C. Cytochrome bd biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: characterization of the cydABCD operon.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6571-6580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and glpD (26.Holmberg C. Rutberg B. Expression of the gene encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by antitermination.Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2891-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Notably, all of these four promoters contain an extended −10-like promoter element and putative δ binding site(s) around the ill-defined −35 element. However, when we tried to examine the effect of δ on sinIR (27.Shafikhani S.H. Mandic-Mulec I. Strauch M.A. Smith I. Leighton T. Postexponential regulation of sin operon expression in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) which contains an A-rich sequence within the promoter region, the protein was unable to inhibit transcription (supplemental Fig. S2). The sinIR promoter contains a −35 element that partially resembles the consensus sequence. Thus, the interactions between the −35 element and σ region 4.2 could occur at this promoter. Although further investigation is required, it is likely that the RNAP-DNA interaction on the sinIR promoter is too strong to be destabilized by δ. We conclude that not all the promoters that contain an A-rich binding site for δ within the promoter region would be inhibited by δ. Our observation that δ inhibits transcription from the spo0B promoter in vitro is consistent with the in vivo result. The level of mRNA of the spo0B gene was reduced by 2-fold in the wild-type strain than in δ-knock-out strain suggesting a down-regulation of the spo0B gene by δ. Although the spo0B gene is involved in controlling several genes that are responsible for sporulation, and the gene is down-regulated by δ, there is no significant effect of δ on the sporulation efficiency (see previous observations in Refs. 10.López de Saro F.J. Yoshikawa N. Helmann J.D. Expression, abundance, and RNA polymerase binding properties of the δ factor of Bacillus subtilis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15953-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 13.Gao H. Aronson A.I. The δ subunit of RNA polymerase functions in sporulation.Curr. Microbiol. 2004; 48: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 4R. Prajapati and J. Mukhopadhyay, unpublished data. Interestingly, few other genes involved in sporulation, e.g. spo0A, spo0E, and spo0F (20.Sonenshein A.L. Control of sporulation initiation in Bacillus subtilis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28.Grossman A.D. Genetic networks controlling the initiation of sporulation and the development of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), were transcriptionally activated by δ.4 Therefore, we speculate that the effect of repression of spo0B is revoked by activation of the other genes involved in sporulation and could be one of the possible reasons why the effect of δ in sporulation is not apparent. However, when δ was overexpressed in the δ-knock-out strain, the sporulation efficiency was increased by several fold4 compared with the wild-type strain. Thus, at a normal level δ does not have any effect on sporulation, however, at an elevated level δ could function by a different mechanism to increase the sporulation efficiency. Further studies are required to unravel the precise role of δ in sporulation. Overall, in this study, we report a novel function of δ of B. subtilis as a transcriptional repressor of the spo0B gene. The mechanism of transcription repression has been demonstrated using biochemical and biophysical assays in which the protein binds to the spo0B promoter at a site that overlaps with the −35 element of the promoter and induces a steric clash with σ region 4.2 to inhibit the RNAP-promoter complex formation and transcription from this promoter. We further demonstrate that δ down-regulates the spo0B gene in vivo. Therefore, our result indicates the possible mechanism of down-regulation of the genes in vivo by δ. For purification of B. subtilis (Bs) RNAP core, E. coli B834 (DE3) cells were transformed with respective plasmids pNG540 and pNG545 (21.Yang X. Lewis P.J.

For purification of δ, pAcYcDuet-rpoE was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and grown in 2× YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl/liter) supplemented with 35 μg ml−1 of chloramphenicol. For the expression of σA, E. coli C43 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET28a-rpoD and grown in 2× YT medium supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 of kanamycin.

Transcription was initiated with NTP (final concentrations: 250 μm ATP, GTP, and UTP, and 25 μm [α-32P]CTP (0.2 μCi)) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of FLB dye (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% xylene cyanol), resolved in 8 or 12% urea-PAGE (30.Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar) and scanned by storage phosphor scanner (Typhoon trio+, GE Healthcare). The single-cysteine derivative of δ (Cys at residue 51) was generated, purified, and labeled with TMR-6-maleimide as described in Prajapati et al. (11.Prajapati R.K. Sengupta S. Rudra P.

The labeling efficiency is 98%, and activity of the labeled protein was confirmed by in vitro transcription assay. 20 nm TMR-labeled δ in 60 μl of transcription buffer was titrated with increasing concentrations of DNA at 37 °C and fluorescence intensity and anisotropy values were measured (λex = 540 nm, λem = 580 nm) using a PTI Fluorescence Master QM400 system fitted with automatic polarizers. Normalized fluorescence anisotropy increments (ΔA/A0, where A and A0 are the anisotropy value of δ bound to DNA and free protein, respectively, and ΔA = A − A0) were plotted against titer concentration of DNA using the Sigmaplot software (Systat software Inc.). The dissociation constants (Kd) of the bindings for DNA were determined by fitting the data to single parameter sigmoidal functions. The reverse primer for spo0B DNA fragment was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's protocol. The promoter DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the above 32P-labeled primer and an unlabeled forward. The amplified DNA was purified using 2% agarose gel. RNAP holoenzyme was formed by incubating BsRNAP core and σA or its derivative as indicated in the transcription assay. Two sets of EMSA were performed. In the first set, 200 nm RNAP holo samples were incubated with 25 nm 32P-labeled DNA in 10 μl of transcription buffer at 37 °C for 20 min and then δ was added and further incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, challenged by 400 nm unlabeled DNA before resolving on 5% PAGE in 0.5× TBE buffer. In the second set, δ was mixed with DNA in 1× transcription buffer at 25 °C for 15 min before addition of RNAP holo. The gels were scanned by phosphorimaging (Typhoon trio+, GE Healthcare). EMSA with promoter DNA derivatives spo0B mut1 (containing mutation at −34, −35) and using σA or σAΔ4.2 were performed as above after labeling the DNA fragment with [γ-32P]ATP.

The plasmids pAcYcDuet-rpoD and pAcYcDuet-rpoD-rpoE were used for expression of σA and both σA and δ, respectively. The spo0B promoter fragment (−105 to +12) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (isolated from Bs168) using oligo primers (Table 1) and cloned pFPVmCherry using KpnI-BamHI. E. coli B834 (DE3) was transformed with: (i) pFPVmCherry-spo0B alone; (ii) pFPVmCherry-spo0B + pAcYcDuet-rpoE (for expression of δ); (iii) pFPVmCherry-spo0B + pNG219 (for expression of BsRNAP core); (iv) pFPVmCherry-spo0B + pNG219 + pAcYcDuet-rpoD (for expression of BsRNAP holo); and (v) pFPVmCherry-spo0B+ pNG219+pAcYcDuet-rpoD-rpoE (for expression of BsRNAP holo + δ). The cells were grown in 50 ml of LB medium supplement with appropriate antibiotics (100 μg ml−1 of ampicillin, 35 μg ml−1 of chloramphenicol, whenever required) at 37 °C up to 0.5 OD, added with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and were grown further for 16 h at 16 °C. Cells from each set were diluted to obtain equal OD and their fluorescence intensities were measured at 610 nm with excitation at 592 nm. An identical assay was performed with the pFPVmCherry-spo0Bmut2 promoter. The spo0B promoter in pFPVmCherry was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using primers (Table 1) to generate the pFPVmCherry-spo0Bmut2. The B. subtilis strains Bs168 and HB6010 (a kind gift from Prof. John D. Helmann, Cornell University (10.López de Saro F.J. Yoshikawa N. Helmann J.D. Expression, abundance, and RNA polymerase binding properties of the δ factor of Bacillus subtilis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15953-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), were grown separately at 37 °C in 1× LB medium until OD 1.5 (600 nm), 5-ml cultures were harvested by centrifugation. The total RNA was isolated using RNA extracting kit (Pure LinkTM RNA Mini Kit, Life Technologies). On column DNase I treatment was performed to avoid any DNA contaminant. The RNA concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 5 μg of total RNA from each sample was used for cDNA synthesis using Super Reverse Transcriptase MuL V Kit (BioBharti LifeScience Pvt. Ltd.). qPCR analysis was performed with KAPA SYBR® FAST qPCR kit (KAPA BIOSYSTEMS) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The partial sequence of rpoA was used as an internal control. The PCR amplification used 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s on 7500 fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem). The difference in cycle number (ΔCt) for a specific fluorescence threshold was calculated between the cDNA of spo0B and rpoA. The relative abundances of spo0B RNA from the two strains were estimated using the formula EΔCt, where E is the primer efficiency and was estimated as ∼2. Each set of real-time PCR was repeated 3 times with independent RNA samples and the relative amount of spo0B RNA were determined from the average of the data. The amount of RNA from the wild-type strain was normalized to 1. J. M. and R. S. conceived and designed the experiments; R. K P. performed the experiments; R. K. P. and J.

https://openalex.org/W2527249824,"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) is a major risk factor for stroke but remains often unobserved. To predict the presence of pAF, we developed model scores based on echocardiographic and other clinical parameters from routine cardiac assessment. The scores can be easily implemented to clinical practice and might improve the early detection of pAF. In total, 47 echocardiographic and other clinical parameters were collected from 1000 patients with sinus rhythm (SR; n = 728), pAF (n = 161) and cAF (n = 111). We developed logistic models for classifying between pAF and SR that were reduced to the most predictive parameters. To facilitate clinical implementation, linear scores were derived. To study the pathophysiological progression to cAF, we analogously developed models for cAF prediction. For classification between pAF and SR, amongst 12 selected model parameters, the most predictive variables were tissue Doppler imaging velocity during atrial contraction (TDI, A’), left atrial diameter, age and aortic root diameter. Models for classifying between pAF and SR or between cAF and SR showed areas under the ROC curves of 0.80 or 0.93, which resembles classifiers with high discriminative power. The novel risk scores were suitable to predict the presence of pAF based on variables readily available from routine cardiac assessment. Modelling helped to quantitatively characterize the pathophysiologic transition from SR via pAF to cAF. Applying the scores may improve the early detection of pAF and might be used as decision aid for initiating preventive interventions to reduce AF-associated complications."

The regulation of this signalling pathway is of outstanding relevance for proper development of the vertebrate and invertebrate embryo. Axin2 provides a negative-feedback-loop in the canonical Wnt-pathway, being a target gene and a negative regulator. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the expression pattern in the development of the chicken embryo. By performing in-situ hybridization on chicken embryos from stage HH 04+ to HH 32 we detected a temporally and spatially restricted dynamic expression of Axin2. In particular, data about the expression of Axin2 mRNA in early embryogenesis, somites, neural tube, limbs, kidney and eyes was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2527144329,"Engineering heterologous nucleoside kinases inside E. coli is a difficult process due to the integral role nucleosides play in cell division and transcription. Nucleoside analogs are used in many kinase screens that depend on cellular metabolization of the analogs. However, metabolic activation of these analogs can be toxic through disruptions of DNA replication and transcription because of the analogs' structural similarities to native nucleosides. Furthermore, the activity of engineered kinases can be masked by endogenous kinases in the cytoplasm, which leads to more difficulties in assessing target activity. A positive selection method that can discern a heterologous kinases' enzymatic activity without significantly influencing the cell's normal metabolic systems would be beneficial. We have developed a means to select for a nucleoside kinase's activity by transporting the kinase to the periplasmic space of an E. coli strain that has its PhoA alkaline phosphatase knocked out. Our proof-of-principle studies demonstrate that the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) can be transported to the periplasmic space in functional form by attaching a tat-signal sequence to the N-terminus of the protein. HSV-TK phosphorylates the toxic nucleoside analog 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), and this charged, monophosphate form of AZT cannot cross the inner membrane. The translocation of HSV-TK provides significant resistance to AZT when compared to bacteria lacking a periplasmic HSV-TK. However, resistance decreased dramatically above 40 μg/ml AZT. We propose that this threshold can be used to select for higher activity variants of HSV-TK and other nucleoside kinases in a manner that overcomes the efficiency and localization issues of previous selection schemes. Furthermore, our selection strategy should be a general strategy to select or evaluate nucleoside kinases that phosphorylate nucleosides such as prodrugs that would otherwise be toxic to E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2524206496,"Biolog Phenotype Microarray (PM) is a technology allowing simultaneous screening of the metabolic behaviour of bacteria under a large number of different conditions. Bacteria may often undergo several cycles of metabolic activity during a Biolog experiment. We introduce a novel algorithm to identify these metabolic cycles in PM experimental data, thus increasing the potential of PM technology in microbiology. Our method is based on a statistical decomposition of the time-series measurements into a set of growth models. We show that the method is robust to measurement noise and captures accurately the biologically relevant signals from the data. Our implementation is made freely available as a part of an R package for PM data analysis and can be found at www.helsinki.fi/bsg/software/Biolog_Decomposition."
https://openalex.org/W2524239572,"Core service units have become an organisational hallmark in many research institutions world wide. Such service cores provide complex state-of-the-art technologies and expertise to the research community. Typically, a user delivers material or raw data to a core. The core defines work packages for ensuing analysis and returns results back to the user. This core activity can be quite complex and time consuming and usually does not communicate itself to the outside. Naturally, the user is highly interested to follow the progress of a project once handed over to the core unit. This generates a time-intensive direct communication activity back and forth. A more effective, convenient and less disruptive way to track the status of a given project by the researcher, but also by core managers, appears highly desirable. Hence, we developed a lightweight and readily implementable web application that allows efficient progress tracking of core unit projects.The web application TraqBio allows for the convenient tracking of projects. Following project set-up by the core, the user receives an e-mail containing links for tracking the project status. Examples are provided for three common core units, namely genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics units. TraqBio is a secure lightweight web application that can be either used in a standalone setup or incorporated into an existing web server infrastructure. Being accessible not only from classical desktop computers but also from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, TraqBio offers easy integration into every day work."
