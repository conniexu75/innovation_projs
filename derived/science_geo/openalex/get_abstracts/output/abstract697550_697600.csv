However, the molecular signatures that distinguish between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant cell states are unknown. We developed methods for the high-throughput isolation and transcriptome profiling of single somas with NFTs from the human AD brain, quantified the susceptibility of 20 neocortical subtypes for NFT formation and death, and identified both shared and cell-type-specific signatures. NFT-bearing neurons shared a marked upregulation of synaptic transmission-related genes, including a core set of 63 genes enriched for synaptic vesicle cycling. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction were highly cell-type dependent. Apoptosis was only modestly enriched, and the susceptibilities of NFT-bearing and NFT-free neurons for death were highly similar. Our analysis suggests that NFTs represent cell-type-specific responses to stress and synaptic dysfunction. We provide a resource for biomarker discovery and the investigation of tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

We investigated the role and clinical significance of P. micra in colorectal tumorigenesis. The abundance of P. micra was examined in 309 fecal samples and 165 colon biopsy tissues of CRC patients and healthy subjects. P. micra was significantly enriched in fecal samples from 128 CRC patients compared to 181 healthy subjects (P < 0.0001); and in colon tissue biopsies from 52 CRC patients compared to 61 healthy subjects (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that P. micra is an independent risk factor of poor survival in CRC patients (Hazard Ratio: 1.93). P. micra strain was isolated from feces of a CRC patient. Apcmin/+ mice gavaged with P. micra showed significantly higher tumor burden and tumor load (both P < 0.01). Consistently, gavage of P. micra significantly promoted colonocyte proliferation in conventional mice, which was further confirmed by germ-free mice. P. micra colonization up-regulated genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, angiogenesis and invasiveness/metastasis; and enhanced Th17 cells infiltration and expression of Th17 cells-secreted cytokines (Il-17, Il-22, and Il-23) in the colon of Apcmin/+, conventional and germ-free mice. P. micra-conditioned medium significantly promoted the differentiation of CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells (IL-17+CD4+ phenotype) and enhanced the oncogenic Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, P. micra promoted colorectal tumorigenesis in mice by inducing colonocyte proliferation and altering Th17 immune response. P. micra may act as a prognostic biomarker for poor survival of CRC patients."

https://openalex.org/W4288069110,"Abstract Archaea synthesize isoprenoid-based ether-linked membrane lipids, which enable them to withstand extreme environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, high salinity, and low or high pH values 1–5 . In some archaea, such as Methanocaldococcus jannaschii , these lipids are further modified by forming carbon–carbon bonds between the termini of two lipid tails within one glycerophospholipid to generate the macrocyclic archaeol or forming two carbon–carbon bonds between the termini of two lipid tails from two glycerophospholipids to generate the macrocycle glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) 1,2 . GDGT contains two 40-carbon lipid chains (biphytanyl chains) that span both leaflets of the membrane, providing enhanced stability to extreme conditions. How these specialized lipids are formed has puzzled scientists for decades. The reaction necessitates the coupling of two completely inert sp 3 -hybridized carbon centres, which, to our knowledge, has not been observed in nature. Here we show that the gene product of mj0619 from M. jannaschii , which encodes a radical S -adenosylmethionine enzyme, is responsible for biphytanyl chain formation during synthesis of both the macrocyclic archaeol and GDGT membrane lipids 6 . Structures of the enzyme show the presence of four metallocofactors: three [Fe 4 S 4 ] clusters and one mononuclear rubredoxin-like iron ion. In vitro mechanistic studies show that Csp 3 –Csp 3 bond formation takes place on fully saturated archaeal lipid substrates and involves an intermediate bond between the substrate carbon and a sulfur of one of the [Fe 4 S 4 ] clusters. Our results not only establish the biosynthetic route for tetraether formation but also improve the use of GDGT in GDGT-based paleoclimatology indices 7–10 ."
https://openalex.org/W4287448803,"Non-allelic recombination between homologous repetitive elements contributes to evolution and human genetic disorders. Here, we combine short- and long-DNA read sequencing of repeat elements with a new bioinformatics pipeline to show that somatic recombination of Alu and L1 elements is widespread in the human genome. Our analysis uncovers tissue-specific non-allelic homologous recombination hallmarks; moreover, we find that centromeres and cancer-associated genes are enriched for retroelements that may act as recombination hotspots. We compare recombination profiles in human-induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated neurons and find that the neuron-specific recombination of repeat elements accompanies chromatin changes during cell-fate determination. Finally, we report that somatic recombination profiles are altered in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a link between retroelement recombination and genomic instability in neurodegeneration. This work highlights a significant contribution of the somatic recombination of repeat elements to genomic diversity in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W4288039039,"Across three experiments (N = 302), we explored whether people cognitively elaborate humanoid robots as human- or object-like. In doing so, we relied on the inversion paradigm, which is an experimental procedure extensively used by cognitive research to investigate the elaboration of social (vs. non-social) stimuli. Overall, mixed-model analyses revealed that full-bodies of humanoid robots were subjected to the inversion effect (body-inversion effect) and, thus, followed a configural processing similar to that activated for human beings. Such a pattern of finding emerged regardless of the similarity of the considered humanoid robots to human beings. That is, it occurred when considering bodies of humanoid robots with medium (Experiment 1), high and low (Experiment 2) levels of human likeness. Instead, Experiment 3 revealed that only faces of humanoid robots with high (vs. low) levels of human likeness were subjected to the inversion effects and, thus, cognitively anthropomorphized. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for robotic and psychological research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4288035251,"Insecticide resistance threatens the effectiveness of malaria vector control, calling for an urgent need to design suitable resistance management strategies. Here, we established the resistance profiling of an Ugandan Anopheles gambiae population to insecticides using WHO procedures and assessed the potential restoration of susceptibility in the hybrid line Mayuge/KISUMU in an insecticide-free environment for eighteen (18) generations.This An gambiae population exhibited a very high intensity of resistance to permethrin, deltamethrin, and alphacypermethrin with a consistent loss of efficacy of all long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) tested including PBO-based and new generation nets Interceptor G2 (IG2) and Royal guard. Molecular analysis revealed a fixation of the L1014S-kdr mutation together with the overexpression of some P450 metabolic genes (CYP6Z1, CYP9K1, CYP6P1, 3 & 4) besides the cuticular resistance-related genes (CYP4G16) and sensorial appendage proteins (SAP1, SAP2, and SAP3) but no GSTe2 overexpression. In the absence of selection pressure, the mortality rate after exposure to insecticides increased significantly over generations, and restoration of susceptibility was observed for most of the insecticides in less than 10 generations. Accordingly, a significant reduction in the frequency of KdrE was observed after 13 generations coupled with reduced expression of most metabolic resistance genes.The results of this study show that the high intensity of pyrethroid resistance observed in An gambiae from Uganda associated with the loss of efficacy of LLINs could compromise vector control efforts. The study also highlights that an early rotation of insecticides could help manage resistance to insecticides by restoring the susceptibility. However, the persistence of Kdr mutation together with overexpression of some metabolic genes after many generations in the absence of selection pressure indicates the potential implication of modifiers alleviating the cost of resistance which needs to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4288038565,"Granzyme K (GzmK) is a tryptic member of the granzyme family of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases produced by cells of the immune system. Previous studies have indicated that GzmK activates protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) enhancing activation of monocytes and wound healing in endothelial cells. Here, we show using peptides and full length proteins that GzmK and, to a lesser extent the related protease GzmA, are capable of activating PAR1 and PAR2. These cleavage events occur at the canonical arginine P1 residue and involve exosite interactions between protease and receptor. Despite cleaving PAR2 at the same point as trypsin, GzmK does not induce a classical Ca 2+ flux but instead activates a distinct signalling cascade, involving recruitment of β-arrestin and phosphorylation of ERK. In epithelial A549 cells, PAR2 activation by GzmK results in the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These data suggest that during an immune response GzmK acts as a pro-inflammatory regulator, rather than as a cytotoxin."

This cross-sectional study, carried out in the North West region of Cameroon, sought to determine the prevalence of bovine mastitis, coliforms associated with bovine mastitis, risk factors for infection and the antibiotic resistance pattern of coliform bacterial isolates.A total of 1608 udder quarters were sampled from 411 cows using a questionnaire, clinical examination, California Mastitis Test and milk culture. Primary isolation of coliform bacteria was done on MacConkey agar while identification of coliforms employed Gram-staining and biochemical testing. Each coliform bacterial isolate was challenged with 11 antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.The prevalence of mastitis was 53.0% (218/411) and 33.1% (532/1608) at the cow- and quarter-levels respectively. Overall, 21.9% (90/411) cows and 8.2% (132/1608) udder quarters showed coliform mastitis. Escherichia coli was isolated in 7.0% of mastitis milk, and other coliforms isolated were Enterobacter cloacae (12.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.4%), Enterobacter sakazakii (1.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.8%), Citrobacter freudii (0.4%), Serratia ficaria (0.4%) and Serratia liquefaciens (0.2%). Lactation stage, breed, history of mastitis and moist/muddy faeces contaminated environment were significantly associated (P-value < 0.05) with coliform mastitis. Coliform isolates (99.0%; 203/205) were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested. Amoxicillin had the highest resistance (88.8%) while norfloxacin had the least resistance (3.4%). Multidrug resistance was exhibited by 52.7% (108/205) of the isolates in a proportion of 27.8% Enterobacter cloacae, 10.7% E. coli, 6.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.9% Enterobacter sakazakii, 2.0% Klebsiella oxytoca, 1.0% Citrobacter freundii, 1.0% Serratia ficaria, 0.5% Serratia liquefaciens and 0.5% Serratia odorifera.Results indicate a need to educate these dairy farmers about mastitis (particularly subclinical), proper hygiene methods in milking and the public health implications of consuming contaminated raw milk."
https://openalex.org/W4288041031,"Modern nautilids ( Nautilus and Allonautilus ) have often been studied by paleontologists to better understand the anatomy and ecology of fossil relatives. Because direct observations of these animals are difficult, the analysis of light stable isotopes (C, O) preserved in their shells has been employed to reveal their habitat and life history. We aim to (1) reconstruct the habitat depth of Nautilus macromphalus and (2) decipher the fraction of metabolic carbon in its shell by analyzing oxygen and carbon isotopes (δ 18 O, δ 13 C) in the septa of two specimens in combination with analyses of water samples from the area. Additionally, we investigate whether morphological changes during ontogeny are reflected in the isotopic values of the shells. Results reveal that the patterns of change of δ 18 O and δ 13 C in the septa of N . macromphalus pre- and post-hatching are consistent with previous studies. Values of δ 18 O water range from 0.7 to 1.4‰ (VSMOW), with a maximum value coincident with a salinity maximum at ~150 m. We use the temperature and δ 18 O water profiles to calculate equilibrium values of δ 18 O aragonite with depth. Comparing these values with the measured δ 18 O of the septa shows that the habitat depth of N . macromphalus is ~140 m pre-hatching and ~370 m post-hatching. Using δ 13 C of shell carbonate and published data on metabolic carbon, the fraction of metabolic carbon is reconstructed as ~21% and 14% pre- and post-hatching, respectively. The reconstructed depth pre-hatching is slightly shallower than in N . pompilius from the Philippines and Fiji, but the post-hatching depth is similar. However, it is important to emphasize that these estimates represent average over time and space because nautilus is a mobile animal. Lastly, the changes in morphological parameters and the changes in δ 13 C and δ 18 O during ontogeny do not coincide except at hatching and at the onset of maturity."
https://openalex.org/W4288041768,"This manuscript presents an inventory of the carbonate system from the main water masses comprising the marine current system on Brazil's northeast coast (South Atlantic Ocean). For this purpose, four transects were conducted with an approximate length of 357 km (each one) through the platform and continental slope of the Sergipe-Alagoas sedimentary basin. Water samples were then collected in vertical profiles measuring from 5 to 1,799 meters depth, totaling 34 stations. Total alkalinity, calcium, and total boron were obtained analytically from these samples and by relationships with salinity. Speciation and concentration of the carbonate system were obtained by means of thermodynamic modeling. The results revealed that the empirical models used to calculate the concentrations of TA, calcium and total boron showed relevant variation when compared to the analytical values (TA: 5.0-6.5%; Ca: 0.4-4.8%; BT: 7.0-18.9%). However, the speciation and concentration of the carbonate system (CA, DIC, [Formula: see text], CO2(aq), ΩCalc, and ΩArag) obtained from the empirical values of TA, calcium and total boron did not differ significantly from those obtained analytically (0.0-6.1%). On the other hand, the parameters of pH, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], CO2(aq), ρCO2, ΩCalc, and ΩArag varied significantly within the different water masses (p < 0.05). This study supports and encourages acidification monitoring projects in the South Atlantic Ocean, based on modeling the carbonate system parameters generated in real-time."

According to this aim, the study used two efficiency methods: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Free Disposal Hull (FDH). A total of 29 tourism centres were selected to conduct the DEA and FDH methods. These efficiency methods (DEA-FDH) used inputs and outputs variables to estimate the efficiency of the tourism centres. The selected inputs were the length of the shoreline (km), area (ha), tourism investments (million EGP), quality of coral reefs, numbers of hotels, and tourism accommodation capacity. While the outputs were employees’ number and tourists’ number. The results indicate that, generally, the tourism centres in the Southern Red Sea region of Egypt showed high-efficiency scores, which reflects their good preparedness to implement the various coastal tourism development strategies from the blue economy perspective. The tourism centres in the Safaga-Quseir tourism sector were the most efficient ones, regardless of the efficiency models used. While the tourist centres representing the Ras Banas tourism sector were the least efficient centres in the whole sample (29 tourism centres)."
https://openalex.org/W4287982105,"Plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1) is a bidirectional ion transporter to operate in Ca2+ entry or exit modes, and TRPC1 is Ca2+-permeable channel. Both NCX1 and TRPC1 play critical roles in maintaining cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) homeostasis in mammalian cells. Although either TRPC1 channel or Ca2+ entry mode of NCX1 is implicated in some tumorigenesis, it has not been explored if a coordination of NCX1 and TRPC1 involves in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated human gastric cancer (GC). Here we found the protein expression of NCX1 was significantly enhanced in human GC specimens, which correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in GC patients. TRPC1 and NCX1 were parallelly enhanced, co-localized and bound in human GC cells. By a functional coupling, TRPC1 drives NCX1 to the Ca2+ entry mode, raising [Ca2+]cyt in GC cells. Moreover, CaCl2, H. pylori and their virulence factors all enhanced expressions and activities of NCX1 and TRPC1, and evoked aberrant Ca2+ entry to promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells through AKT/β-catenin pathway. Tumor growth and metastasis also depended on the enhanced expression of NCX1 in subcutaneously xenografted GC mouse model. Overall, our findings indicate that TRPC1/NCX1 coupling may promote H. pylori-associated GC through the Ca2+/AKT/β-catenin pathway. Since the Ca2+ exit mode and the Ca2+ entry mode of NCX1 play different roles under mostly physiological and pathological conditions respectively, targeting TRPC1/NCX1 coupling could be a novel strategy for selectively blocking Ca2+ entry mode to potentially treat digestive cancer with less side effect."
https://openalex.org/W4288039236,"Background Sensory perception is a temporal phenomenon highly present in food evaluation. Over the last decades, several sensory analysis methods have been developed to determine how our processing of the stimuli changes during tasting. These methods differ in several parameters: how attributes are characterized (intensity, dominance or applicability), the number of attributes evaluated, the moment of sample characterization (simultaneously with the tasting in continuous or discrete time, retrospectively), the required panel (trained subjects or consumers), etc. At the moment, there is no systematic review encompassing the full scope of this topic. This article presents the protocol for conducting a scoping review on multi-attribute temporal descriptive methods in sensory analysis in food science. Methods The protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. The research question was ""how have multi-attribute temporal descriptive methods been implemented, used and compared in sensory analysis?"". The eligibility criteria were defined using the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study design) framework. This protocol details how the articles of the final review will be retrieved, selected and analyzed. The search will be based on the querying of two academic research databases (Scopus and Web of Science). The main topics reported in research involving sensory analyses methods will be identified and summarized in a data extraction form. This form (detailed in the protocol) will be used to report pertinent information regarding the objectives of the review. It could also be reused as a guideline for carrying out and reporting results of future research in a more standardized way. A quality appraisal process was derived from literature. It will be applied on the included articles of the review, and could also be re-used to ensure that future publications meet higher quality levels. Finally, for the sake of transparency, the limitations of the protocol are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4288052134,"Attention mechanism, which is a means of determining which part of the forced data is emphasized, has attracted attention in various fields of deep learning in recent years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the attention branch network (ABN) for implant classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The data consisted of 10191 dental implant images from 13 implant brands that cropped the site, including dental implants as pretreatment, from digital panoramic radiographs of patients who underwent surgery at Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital between 2005 and 2021. ResNet 18, 50, and 152 were evaluated as CNN models that were compared with and without the ABN. We used accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve as performance metrics. We also performed statistical and effect size evaluations of the 30-time performance metrics of the simple CNNs and the ABN model. ResNet18 with ABN significantly improved the dental implant classification performance for all the performance metrics. Effect sizes were equivalent to ""Huge"" for all performance metrics. In contrast, the classification performance of ResNet50 and 152 deteriorated by adding the attention mechanism. ResNet18 showed considerably high compatibility with the ABN model in dental implant classification (AUC = 0.9993) despite the small number of parameters. The limitation of this study is that only ResNet was verified as a CNN; further studies are required for other CNN models."

https://openalex.org/W4288035914,"The demand for high level of safety and superior quality in agricultural products is of prime concern. The introduction of new technologies for supporting crop management allows the efficiency and quality of production to be improved and, at the same time, reduces the environmental impact. Common strategies to disease control are mainly oriented on spraying pesticides uniformly over cropping areas at different times during the growth cycle. Even though these methodologies can be effective, they present a negative impact in ecological and economic terms, introducing new pests and elevating resistance of the pathogens. Therefore, consideration for new automatic and accurate along with inexpensive and efficient techniques for the detection and severity estimation of pathogenic diseases before proper control measures can be suggested is of great realistic significance and may reduce the likelihood of an infection spreading. In this work, we present a novel system-theoretic approach for leaf image-based automatic quantitative assessment of pathogenic disease severity regardless of disease type. The proposed method is based on a highly efficient and noise-rejecting positive non-linear dynamical system that recursively transforms the leaf image until only the symptomatic disease patterns are left. The proposed system does not require any training to automatically discover the discriminative features. The experimental setup allowed to assess the system ability to generalise symptoms detection beyond any previously seen conditions achieving excellent results. The main advantage of the approach relies in the robustness when dealing with low-resolution and noisy images. Indeed, an essential issue related to digital image processing is to effectively reduce noise from an image whilst keeping its features intact. The impact of noise is effectively reduced and does not affect the final result allowing the proposed system to ensure a high accuracy and reliability."
https://openalex.org/W4288037895,"Understanding the ecological niche of some fishes is complicated by their frequent use of a broad range of food resources and habitats across space and time. Little is known about Broad Whitefish ( Coregonus nasus ) ecological niches in Arctic landscapes even though they are an important subsistence species for Alaska’s Indigenous communities. We investigated the foraging ecology and habitat use of Broad Whitefish via stable isotope analyses of muscle and liver tissue and otoliths from mature fish migrating in the Colville River within Arctic Alaska. The range of δ 13 C (-31.8– -21.9‰) and δ 15 N (6.6–13.1‰) across tissue types and among individuals overlapped with isotope values previously observed in Arctic lakes and rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine habitat. The large range of δ 18 O (4.5–10.9‰) and δD (-237.6– -158.9‰) suggests fish utilized a broad spectrum of habitats across elevational and latitudinal gradients. Cluster analysis of muscle δ 13 Cˈ, δ 15 N, δ 18 O, and δD indicated that Broad Whitefish occupied four different foraging niches that relied on marine and land-based (i.e., freshwater and terrestrial) food sources to varying degrees. Most individuals had isotopic signatures representative of coastal freshwater habitat (Group 3; 25%) or coastal lagoon and delta habitat (Group 1; 57%), while individuals that mainly utilized inland freshwater (Group 4; 4%) and nearshore marine habitats (Group 2; 14%) represented smaller proportions. Otolith microchemistry confirmed that individuals with more enriched muscle tissue δ 13 Cˈ, δD, and δ 18 O tended to use marine habitats, while individuals that mainly used freshwater habitats had values that were less enriched. The isotopic niches identified here represent important foraging habitats utilized by Broad Whitefish. To preserve access to these diverse habitats it will be important to limit barriers along nearshore areas and reduce impacts like roads and climate change on natural flow regimes. Maintaining these diverse connected habitats will facilitate long-term population stability, buffering populations from future environmental and anthropogenic perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W4288039478,"Despite a direct ban on charging interest, interest-based benchmarks are used as a pricing reference by a majority of Islamic banks, due in part to the absence of stable and widely- published alternatives. Benchmarking interest rate exposes Islamic banks to the problems of conventional banks, particularly the interest rate risk. Against this backdrop, the present study empirically examines the dynamic linkage between the interest rate volatility and the financing of Islamic banks. The empirical analysis is carried using evidence from the Islamic banking industry of Pakistan during the time period 2006–2020. The multivariate Johansen and Jusiles Co-integration test and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) are used as the baseline econometric models. Moreover, the DCC-GARCH model is employed for robustness and ensuring the consistency of results. The results indicate that a significant long-term and short-term relationship exists between the interest rate volatility and the financing of Islamic banking industry providing significant evidence for co-movements and convergence. These findings suggest that paradoxical as it may seem, the financing of Islamic banks operating within a dual banking system is subject to interest rate risk, mainly due to benchmarking interest rate, which in-turn makes Islamic banks vulnerable to the rate of return risk and withdrawal risk. Moreover, corporate financing, in particular, is more vulnerable to interest rate risk."

Mixed effects models with moving day averages from day 0 to day 28 were used to study the associations between solar activity (sunspot number (SSN), interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)), geomagnetic activity (planetary K index (Kp index), and various inflammatory and endothelial markers. Biomarkers included intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen. After adjusting for demographic and meteorological variables, we observed significant positive associations between sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 concentrations and solar and geomagnetic activity parameters: IMF, SSN, and Kp. Additionally, a negative association was observed between fibrinogen and Kp index and a positive association was observed for CRP and SSN. These results demonstrate that solar and geomagnetic activity might be upregulating endothelial activation and inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W4288035410,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently spreading globally. To overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, preclinical evaluations of vaccines and therapeutics using K18-hACE2 and CAG-hACE2 transgenic mice are ongoing. However, a comparative study on SARS-CoV-2 infection between K18-hACE2 and CAG-hACE2 mice has not been published. In this study, we compared the susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection between two strains of transgenic mice, which were generated in FVB background mice. K18-hACE2 mice exhibited severe weight loss with definitive lethality, but CAG-hACE2 mice survived; and differences were observed in the lung, spleen, cerebrum, cerebellum, and small intestine. A higher viral titer was detected in the lungs, cerebrums, and cerebellums of K18-hACE2 mice than in the lungs of CAG-hACE2 mice. Severe pneumonia was observed in histopathological findings in K18-hACE2, and mild pneumonia was observed in CAG-hACE2. Atrophy of the splenic white pulp and reduction of spleen weight was observed, and hyperplasia of goblet cells with villi atrophy of the small intestine was observed in K18-hACE2 mice compared to CAG-hACE2 mice. These results indicate that K18-hACE2 mice are relatively susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that CAG-hACE2 mice are resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Based on these lineage-specific sensitivities, we suggest that K18-hACE2 mouse is suitable for highly susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2, and CAG-hACE2 mouse is suitable for mild susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4288036042,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known for its outstanding ability to produce ethanol in industry. Underlying the dynamics of gene expression in S. cerevisiae in response to fermentation could provide informative results, required for the establishment of any ethanol production improvement program. Thus, representing a new approach, this study was conducted to identify the discriminative genes between improved and repressed ethanol production as well as clarifying the molecular responses to this process through mining the transcriptomic data. The significant differential expression probe sets were extracted from available microarray datasets related to yeast fermentation performance. To identify the most effective probe sets contributing to discriminate ethanol content, 11 machine learning algorithms from RapidMiner were employed. Further analysis including pathway enrichment and regulatory analysis were performed on discriminative probe sets. Besides, the decision tree models were constructed, the performance of each model was evaluated and the roots were identified. Based on the results, 171 probe sets were identified by at least 5 attribute weighting algorithms (AWAs) and 17 roots were recognized with 100% performance Some of the top ranked presets were found to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and ethanol fermentation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmap clustering validated the top-ranked selective probe sets. In addition, the top-ranked genes were validated based on GSE78759 and GSE5185 dataset. From all discriminative probe sets, OLI1 and CYC3 were identified as the roots with the best performance, demonstrated by the most weighting algorithms and linked to top two significant enriched pathways including porphyrin biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. ADH5 and PDA1 were also recognized as differential top-ranked genes that contribute to ethanol production. According to the regulatory clustering analysis, Tup1 has a significant effect on the top-ranked target genes CYC3 and ADH5 genes. This study provides a basic understanding of the S. cerevisiae cell molecular mechanism and responses to two different medium conditions (Mg2+ and Cu2+) during the fermentation process."
https://openalex.org/W4288038402,"Background Oropouche fever is an infectious disease caused by the Oropouche virus (OROV). The diagnosis and prediction of the clinical picture continue to be a great challenge for clinicians who manage patients with acute febrile syndrome. Several symptoms have been associated with OROV virus infection in patients with febrile syndrome; however, to date, there is no clinical prediction rule, which is a fundamental tool to help the approach of this infectious disease. Objective To assess the performance of a prediction model based solely on signs and symptoms to diagnose Oropouche virus infection in patients with acute febrile syndrome. Materials and methods Validation study, which included 923 patients with acute febrile syndrome registered in the Epidemiological Surveillance database of three arbovirus endemic areas in Peru. Results A total of 97 patients (19%) were positive for OROV infection in the development group and 23.6% in the validation group. The area under the curve was 0.65 and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR + and LR- were 78.2%, 35.1%, 27.6%, 83.6%, 1.20 and 0.62, respectively. Conclusions The development of a clinical prediction model for the diagnosis of Oropouche based solely on signs and symptoms does not work well. This may be due to the fact that the symptoms are nonspecific and related to other arbovirus infections, which confuse and make it difficult to predict the diagnosis, especially in endemic areas of co-infection of these diseases. For this reason, epidemiological surveillance of OROV in various settings using laboratory tests such as PCR is important."
https://openalex.org/W4288038733,"Introduction Lumbar puncture is among the investigations used to identify various neurological conditions, including some that can cause cardiac arrest (CA). However, CA per se may alter cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics. Few studies have investigated CSF findings after CA. In this descriptive work, we assessed the frequency and risk factors of abnormal CSF findings after CA and the contribution of CSF analysis to the etiological diagnosis. Materials and methods We retrospectively studied data from prospectively established databases of consecutive patients who were admitted to two French ICUs in 2007–2016 with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after CA and who underwent lumbar puncture as an etiological investigation. Results Of 1984 patients with sustained ROSC, 55 (2.7%) underwent lumbar puncture and were included. Lumbar puncture identified a neurological cause of CA in 2/55 (3.6%) patients. Nonspecific CSF abnormalities were noted in 37/53 (69.8%) patients. By multivariate analysis, postresuscitation shock was positively associated with CSF abnormalities (OR, 6.92; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.62–37.26; P = 0.013). A no-flow time above 6 minutes (OR, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.03–1.11; P = 0.076) and a respiratory cause of CA (OR, 2.91; 95%CI, 0.53–23.15; P = 0.24) were not statistically associated with CSF abnormalities. Nonspecific CSF abnormalities were not significantly associated with poor outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category ≥3; P = 0.06). Conclusions Lumbar puncture, although infrequently performed, may contribute to the etiological diagnosis of CA, albeit rarely. Nonspecific CSF abnormalities seem common after CA, notably with postresuscitation shock, and may be related to blood-brain barrier disruption. These findings may help to interpret CSF findings after CA. Further studies are warranted to assess our results."

For central vascular catheter-associated infections without catheter removal, over 90% clinicians recommended at least 10 days antibiotics, except for infections caused by coagulase negative staphylococci (79%). Recommendations for at least 10 days antibiotics were less common with catheter removal. In multivariable linear regression analyses, lack of source control was significantly associated with longer treatment durations (+5.2 days [95% CI: 4.4-6.1 days] for intra-abdominal infections and +4.1 days [95% CI: 3.8-4.4 days] for central vascular catheter-associated infections). Most clinicians (73-95%, depending on the source of bloodstream infection) would be willing to enrol patients into a trial of shorter versus longer antibiotic treatment duration.The majority of clinicians currently recommend at least 10 days of antibiotics for most scenarios of bloodstream infections in critically ill children. There is practice heterogeneity in self-reported treatment duration recommendations among clinicians. Treatment durations were similar across different infectious syndromes. Under appropriate clinical conditions, most clinicians would be willing to enrol patients into a trial of shorter versus longer treatment for common syndromes associated with bloodstream infections."
https://openalex.org/W4288040734,"Our perception of the body's metric is influenced by bias according to the axis, called the systematic metric bias in body representation. Systematic metric bias was first reported as Weber's illusion and observed in several parts of the body in various patterns. However, the systematic metric bias was not observed with a fake hand under the influence of the body ownership illusion during the line length judgment task. The lack of metric bias observed during the line length judgment task with a fake hand implies that the tactile modality occupies a relatively less dominant position than perception occurring through the real body. The change in weight between visual and tactile modalities during the body ownership illusion has not been adequately investigated yet, despite being a factor that influences the perception through body ownership illusion. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether the dominance of vision over tactile modality is prominent, regardless of the task type. To investigate whether visual dominance persists during the process of inducing body ownership illusion regardless of task type, we introduced spatial visuotactile incongruence (2 cm, 3 cm) in the longitudinal and transverse axes during the visuotactile localization tasks and measured the intensity of the body ownership illusion using a questionnaire. The results indicated that participants perceived smaller visuotactile incongruence when the discrepancy occurred in the transverse axis rather than in the longitudinal axis. The anisotropy in the tolerance of visuotactile incongruence implies the persistence of metric biases in body representation. The results suggest the need for further research regarding the factors influencing the weight of visual and tactile modalities."
https://openalex.org/W4288041523,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 in Ethiopia was attributed to joint effects of multiple factors such as low adherence to face mask-wearing, failure to comply with social distancing measures, many people attending religious worship activities and holiday events, extensive protests, country election rallies during the pandemic, and the war between the federal government and Tigray Region. This study built a system dynamics model to capture COVID-19 characteristics, major social events, stringencies of containment measures, and vaccination dynamics. This system dynamics model served as a framework for understanding the issues and gaps in the containment measures against COVID-19 in the past period (16 scenarios) and the spread dynamics of the infectious disease over the next year under a combination of different interventions (264 scenarios). In the counterfactual analysis, we found that keeping high mask-wearing adherence since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ethiopia could have significantly reduced the infection under the condition of low vaccination level or unavailability of the vaccine supply. Reducing or canceling major social events could achieve a better outcome than imposing constraints on people’s routine life activities. The trend analysis found that increasing mask-wearing adherence and enforcing more stringent social distancing were two major measures that can significantly reduce possible infections. Higher mask-wearing adherence had more significant impacts than enforcing social distancing measures in our settings. As the vaccination rate increases, reduced efficacy could cause more infections than shortened immunological periods. Offsetting effects of multiple interventions (strengthening one or more interventions while loosening others) could be applied when the levels or stringencies of one or more interventions need to be adjusted for catering to particular needs (e.g., less stringent social distancing measures to reboot the economy or cushion insufficient resources in some areas)."
https://openalex.org/W4288042191,"Background The age of first sexual debut among youth continues to attract interest as it marks the start of their exposure to a variety of sexual and reproductive health problems. Parental monitoring (PM) and school connectedness (SC) has been found to have an effect on this problem. Despite this fact, there is a dearth of literature on implications of PM and SC on age at first sexual debut in Ethiopia. Therefore, this paper examined the influences of PM and SC age at first sexual debut among female youth. Methods A retrospective follow-up study was conducted on 470 randomly selected female youth in Bedele town, Oromia regional state, southwest Ethiopia from February 1 to March 30, 2021. The age at first sexual debut was asked in full years for respondents who ever engaged in sexual debut at a time of data collection. Data were entered using Epi-Data version 4.6 and analyzed using Stata version 14. All variables at P-values less than 0.2 in bivariable analysis were exported to multivariable analysis. Multivariable Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) regression analyses using Weibull distribution were used to examine the association of age at first sexual debut with PM and SC at 5% level of significance. Results Overall, 132(28.1%) youths were begun sexual activities of which 79.54% was an early (vaginal penetrative sex before 18 years old). The incidence rate was 15.58/1000 PY with 95% CI of [13.14, 18.47]. The result shows that, female youth start first sexual debut as early as 10 year and mean age was 16.89±2.82. Only 27.97% of those who began sexual debut used contraception during first sex. Multivariable Weibull AFT regression analyses adjusted for different variables showed that high PM (Adjusted Time Ratio (ATR) 1.13: 95%CI; [1.04, 1.21]) and good SC (ATR: 1.14: 95% CI; [1.06, 1.22] significantly delays the age at first sexual debut. Conclusions Overall, four out of every five premarital sexual activities were early sexual debuts. High PM and high SC significantly decrease early sexual debut by delaying the age of sexual initiation. Therefore, family and school involvement focused on PM and SC of the youth is recommended as an important mechanism for preventing youths’ risky sexual behaviour, including early sexual debut."
https://openalex.org/W4288051852,"Psychiatric service dogs are an emerging complementary intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Initial evidence suggests that partnership with a service dog may be related to less PTSD symptom severity. However, it remains unclear how or why this might occur. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal investigation of 82 post-9/11 military members or veterans and their PTSD service dogs to (1) evaluate service dog characteristics as potential predictors of efficacy, (2) assess dog and human characteristics as potential predictors of veteran-dog bond, and (3) explore potential mechanisms for mental health outcomes. Aim 1 results demonstrated that most service dog characteristics did not predict veterans' mental health outcomes, but lower service dog excitability was associated with less PTSD symptom severity at follow-up. Aim 2 results showed that closer dog-veteran relationships were associated with less excitable dog temperament. Aim 3 results indicated that worse mental health at follow-up was associated with greater use of the specifically trained PTSD service dog task to initiate a social greeting (""make a friend""), whereas better mental health was related to less use of dominance-based training methods, lower perceived emotional/logistical costs of service dog partnership, and closer veteran-dog relationships. More frequent use of the trained service dog task to signal when someone approaches from behind (cover/watch back) was associated with greater anxiety, but less PTSD symptom severity. Overall, veterans spent an average of 82% of their time with service dogs (assessed via Bluetooth proximity between dog collar and veteran smartphone), and most frequently asked their service dogs to perform the trained task for calming their anxiety (calm/comfort anxiety). The present study provides subjective and objective metrics of the heterogeneity among veteran-service dog dyads while also suggesting which of the assessed metrics might be potential mechanisms involved in the intervention."

With the continuous intensification of human activities, soil undergoes increasingly serious disturbance. Under the influence of global change and human activities, the variability of heavy metals in soil is worthy of further discussion. Taking Lujiaowan and Juhuatai Scenic Spot on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountain as the research area, this study investigated the concentrations of Pb, As, Zn, Cu and Mn in the soil and analyzed their distribution and pollution levels. Meanwhile, the main sources of soil heavy metals were explored using autocorrelation analysis and principal component analysis. Results showed that the order of the average concentration of heavy metals in the study area was as follows: Mn&gt; Zn&gt; Cu&gt; Pb&gt; As. None of them exceeded the national soil environmental quality level II standard, and the average concentrations of Zn, Cu, and As exceeded the background value of Xinjiang soil, reaching a light pollution level. In addition, the distribution of heavy metals in soil displayed a regular trend, and a positive correlation was found between disturbance intensity and heavy metal concentration. The geoaccumulation index also showed that the five heavy metals in the study area had lower pollution degree compared with the background value in Xinjiang. The order of potential ecological risk was As &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Zn &gt; Mn."
https://openalex.org/W4288067603,"Why have some nonviolent revolutions succeeded even with modest participation numbers, while others have failed despite massive mobilization? We develop an agent-based model that predicts the outcomes of three well-known activism strategies. The first rapidly recruits a wide number of activists, which overwhelms the opponent's support network and encourages large-scale defections. In the second, activists who have already mobilized remain committed to success and inspire other civilians to protest even when they are unable to protest themselves. In the third strategy, campaigns focus their energy and influence directly on the regime's pillars of support. We find that this third strategy outperforms the others in generating defections, even when the size of the campaign is small. When activists have information about pillars' levels of loyalty to the regime, they can target persuasion on the pillars most likely to defect. Importantly, for small or medium-sized movements, the strategy of focusing on pillars-especially the least loyal pillars-is more likely to yield success than relying on rapid mobilization and numerical advantage alone."

In this comment we discuss how definitions and methodological factors can impact prevalence rates. We consider a number of possible reasons for the discrepancy between the surveys, and conclude that it is most likely a method artefact. Stevelink et al.’s survey reported the prevalence of recent-onset DSM-IV PTSD only, whereas the Police Care UK survey reported the total ICD-11 PTSD and Complex PTSD prevalence, regardless of when in the person’s career the traumatic events occurred. Analysing the Police Care UK data using Stevelink et al.’s procedures produced practically identical prevalence rates, suggesting that the discrepancy was apparent rather than real."

Bile duct ligation is the mostly used experimental model in rodents to explore special aspects of occlusive cholestasis. We aimed to clarify if rats or mice are suitable for the same or different aspects in cholestasis research. Methods We induced biliary occlusion by ligation and transection of the common bile duct (tBDT) in rats and mice (each n = 25). Recovery from surgical stress was assessed by daily scoring (stress score, body weight). At five different time points (days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 after tBDT) we investigated hepatic morphometric and architectural alterations (Haematoxylin-Eosin staining, Elastica van Gieson staining) and the proliferative activities of parenchyma cells (Bromodeoxyuridine staining); as well as established systemic markers for liver synthesis, hepatocellular damage and renal dysfunction. Results We found substantial differences regarding survival (rats: 100%, 25/25 vs. mice 92%, 22/25, p = 0.07) and body weight gain (p&lt;0.05 at postoperative days 14 and 28 (POD)). Rats showed a faster and progressive hepatobiliary remodelling than mice (p&lt;0.05 at POD 7+14+28), resulting in: i) stronger relative loss of hepatocellular mass (rats by 31% vs. mice by 15% until POD 28; p&lt;0.05 at POD 7+14+28); ii) rapidly progressing liver fibrosis (p&lt;0.05 at POD 14); iii) a faster and stronger proliferative response of parenchyma cells (hepatocytes: p&lt;0.05 at POD 1+14+18; cholangiocytes: p&lt;0.05 at POD 1+3+7+28); and iv) only tiny bile infarcts compared to mice (p&lt;0.05 at POD 1+3+7+14). Both species showed comparable elevated markers of hepatocellular damage and serum bilirubin. Conclusion The key difference between rats and mice are the severity and dynamics of histological alterations, possibly accounting for their different susceptibilities for (septic) complications with low survival (mice)."
https://openalex.org/W4288038640,"Defendants can deny they have agency, and thus responsibility, for a crime by using a defense of mental impairment. We argue that although this strategy may help defendants evade blame, it may carry longer-term social costs, as lay people's perceptions of a person's agency might determine some of the moral rights they grant them. Three randomized between-group experiments (N = 1601) used online vignettes to examine lay perceptions of a hypothetical defendant using a defense of mental impairment (versus a guilty plea). We find that using a defense of mental impairment significantly reduces responsibility, blame, and punitiveness relative to a guilty plea, and these judgments are mediated by perceptions of reduced moral agency. However, after serving their respective sentences, those using the defense are sometimes conferred fewer rights, as reduced agency corresponds to an increase in perceived dangerousness. Our findings were found to be robust across different types of mental impairment, offences/sentences, and using both manipulated and measured agency. The findings have implications for defendants claiming reduced agency through legal defenses, as well as for the broader study of moral rights and mind perception."
https://openalex.org/W4288038985,"Background Gaps in the provision of guideline-adherent prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services and maternal retention in care contribute to nearly 8000 Kenyan infants becoming infected with HIV annually. Interventions that routinize evidence-based PMTCT service delivery and foster consistent patient engagement are essential to eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The HITSystem 2.1 is an eHealth intervention that aims to improve retention in PMTCT services and viral load monitoring, using electronic alerts to providers and SMS to patients. This study will evaluate the impact, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of HITSystem 2.1. Method This cluster randomized trial will be conducted at 12 study hospital (6 intervention, 6 control). Pregnant women living with HIV who have initiated PMTCT care ≤36 weeks gestation are eligible. Women enrolled at control hospitals will receive standard-of-care PMTCT services. Women enrolled at intervention hospitals will receive standard-of-care PMTCT services plus enhanced HITSystem 2.1 tracking. Mixed logistic regression models will compare the arms on two primary outcomes: (1) completed guideline-adherence PMTCT services and (2) viral suppression at both delivery and 6 months postpartum. We will assess associations between provider and patient characteristics (disclosure status, partner status, depression, partner support), PMTCT knowledge, and motivation with retention outcomes. Using the RE-AIM model, we will also assess implementation factors to guide sustainable scale-up. Finally, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. Discussion This study will provide insights regarding the development and adaptation of eHealth strategies to meet the global goal of eliminating new HIV infections in children and optimizing maternal health through PMTCT services. If efficacious, implementation and cost-effectiveness data gathered in this study will guide scale-up across Kenyan health facilities.

https://openalex.org/W4288039698,"The assessment of Visible Foliar Symptoms (VFS) is commonly adopted by forest monitoring programs to evaluate ozone impact on vegetation. The occurrence of ozone VFS may differ among individuals of the same species at the same site, and within leaves of the same individual. The aim of this study was to identify site and plant characteristics as well as functional leaf traits associated with the occurrence and severity of VFS in Viburnum lantana (an ozone-sensitive species) and at the scale of an individual site. V . lantana plants growing at one site of the ViburNeT monitoring network (Trentino, North Italy) experiencing high ozone levels were surveyed in relation to 1) sun exposure, 2) shading effect from neighbor vegetation, 3) plant height and 4) presence and severity of VFS. Leaves from three different sections of each plant were subjected to a phenotypic characterization of leaf area, dry weight, specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll content (Chl SPAD ), percentage of VFS, and adaxial and abaxial trichome density (Tr). We showed that plants at high irradiation levels had significantly lower SLA (p&lt;0.05), higher Tr (p&lt;0.01) and greater Chl SPAD (p&lt;0.01) when compared to shaded and/or west- and north-exposed plants, thus indicating a strong influence of site-specific characteristics on leaf trait plasticity. Similar differences were observed for taller vs. shorter plants and apical vs. basal branches (p&lt;0.05). Ozone-induced VFS at leaf level were associated with lower SLA (p&lt;0.001) and higher Tr in the abaxial leaf surface (p&lt;0.05). Both leaf traits showed significant differences also within the south and east exposed plant category, thus suggesting the increase in leaf thickness and Tr as a potential adaptive strategy under multiple stress conditions. Our results provide evidence of a strong relationship between VFS, leaf traits and site-specific variables, offering new insights for interpreting data on the impact of ozone on vegetation."

A total of 12 eyes of 12 patients aged ≥45 years having the characteristic findings of central serous chorioretinopathy but not presenting any exudative changes were included in this study. Choroidal vascular hyper permeability (CVH) was identified by indocyanine green angiography, and the presence or absence of CNV was evaluated by optical coherence tomography angiography. RS at 68 points was examined by microperimetry. The average RS corresponding to within and outside CVH was compared. The association between the difference in RS and the presence or absence of CNV was also analyzed. CNV was detected in six eyes (50%). In eyes without CNV, the RS within CVH was similar compared with that outside CVH. However, in eyes with CNV, the RS within CVH was significantly decreased compared with that outside CVH. Multiple regression analysis revealed the presence of CNV as an independent factor associated with RS. In eyes with pachychoroid diseases, RS decreased within the CVH area under the coexistence of nonexudative CNV."

Methods Using claims data taken from the 1997–2013 Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), we identified 60,756 newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients during the period 2003–2013 from all beneficiaries. We then randomly selected 243,024 women without breast cancer matching (1:4) for age and the year of the index date during 1997–2013 from a one million representative population acting as the control group. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between periodontitis (ICD-9-CM codes 523.3–4) and the risk of breast cancer, shown as an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjustments for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and level of urbanization. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, CCI and level of urbanization. Results The mean ± standard deviation age was 53 ± 14 years. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of female breast cancer was found to be associated with a history of periodontitis (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10–1.14). Such an association was significantly different between patients aged &lt; 65 years (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06–1.11) and patients aged ≥ 65 years (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.18–1.28; p for interaction &lt;0.001), as well as between patients where the CCI = 0 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.15–1.20) and patients with CCI &gt; 0 (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96–1.03; p for interaction &lt;0.001). The highest level of urbanization was also associated with the risk of breast cancer. Conclusions This population-based nested case-control study demonstrated that periodontitis was significantly associated with the risk of female breast cancer and such an association was modified by both age and comorbidities."

However, there is little interprofessional education for students of medical technology and radiological science involved in biophysical function diagnosis. In the present study, we developed a case-based interprofessional learning tool for using biophysical information for diagnosis. The study examined the effects of a collaborative exercise workshop for healthcare professional students using the tool. Participants were 234 students from three healthcare professions (medical technology, radiological science, and physical therapy). They completed the Japanese version of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale before and after the workshops. The workshops incorporated digital materials that allowed students to examine the test results of a virtual patient, answer questions, and discuss their diagnoses and prognoses. For analysis, a two-way analysis of variance was performed on the total score on the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale of the three departments, and the effectiveness of the workshop for the three departments was compared. Statistical analyses showed no interaction between time and department (p = 0.283). After the workshop, students from all three departments showed significant improvements in total scores on the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (p &lt; 0.01) with medium to large effect sizes ( r = 0.33–0.52). In the comparison between departments, there was a significant difference in the awareness levels of only medical technology and radiological science students before the workshop (p = 0.015). This study conducted case-based learning workshops with students from three departments, in which a patient’s biophysical information was conveyed between occupational practices. The workshops improved the awareness of interprofessional education in students from all departments and revealed that interprofessional education is important for healthcare professions involved in biophysical function diagnosis."

Evidence suggests the healthy, ventilated lung may beneficially re-condition pro-inflammatory neutrophils. However, evidence in humans is lacking, due to a paucity of good models. CPB with simultaneous central venous and bilateral pulmonary vein sampling provides an opportunity to model effects of one-lung ventilation. The study's primary objectives were to establish a model of intra-operative, bilateral pulmonary vein sampling and to determine whether neutrophil function differed after passing through inflated or deflated lungs.Seventeen patients having ""on pump"" coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with one-lung ventilation (in two cohorts with tidal volume 2ml kg-1 and FiO2 0.21, or tidal volume 4 ml kg-1 and FiO2 0.5 respectively) were recruited. Cohort 1 consisted of 9 patients (7 male, median age 62.0 years) and Cohort 2 consisted of 8 male patients (median age 65.5 years). Recruitment was via prospective screening of scheduled elective and non-elective CABG procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass. Each patient had five blood samples taken-central venous blood pre-operatively; central venous blood pre-CPB; central venous blood post-CPB; pulmonary venous blood draining the ventilated lung post-CPB; and pulmonary venous blood draining the deflated lung post-CPB. Neutrophil phagocytosis and priming status were quantified. Plasma cytokines were measured.Phagocytosis and priming were not significantly different in neutrophils returning from the ventilated lung as compared to the non-ventilated lung. Plasma IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were significantly elevated by CPB.The intra-operative, bilateral pulmonary vein sampling model provides unique opportunities to assess biological effects of interventions to one lung, with the other lung acting as an internal control. Single-lung ventilation during CPB had no significant effects on neutrophil function."
https://openalex.org/W4288041283,"People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are often dealing with a range of issues that make life more difficult because of the limited emotional, spiritual, psychological, social, physical and clinical support which consequently lead to poor physical health and quality of life. The holistic care of individuals infected with HIV/AIDS involves promoting psychological and physiological well-being as well as fostering socio-cultural relationships and supporting the fulfillment of spiritual aspirations. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study among HIV-infected patients receiving a holistic approach of care model from January 2015 to December 2018 in Kampala district, Uganda. The study involved adult individuals aged 18 and above from whom demographics and other information were obtained. All eligible participants were selected using stratified random sampling from the parishes and systematic random sampling to select study participants. We investigated the clinical profile and the factors associated with viral load suppression among HIV-infected patients receiving a holistic approach of care model in Kampala District. The data was analyzed using STATA version 13. 0. Results: A total of 910 patients were enrolled. 676 (74.3%) were female; 453 (49.8%) were between 18 and 39 years. 324 (35.6%) were either overweight or obese. 769 (84.5%) had viral load beyond detectable limits, 904 (99.3%) were adhering to HIV treatment. 867(95.3%) were virally suppressed. The age group 40-59 years (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 2.85, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.36-5.97, P = 0.005) and good adherence (aOR = 12.9, 95%CI:1.86-81.07, P = 0.009) were significantly associated with viral load suppression. Conclusion: The holistic care model supports patients in all facets of their lives, resulting into improved treatment outcomes. Our findings show that age and adherence are linked to viral load suppression among HIV-infected adults receiving a holistic approach of care model."
https://openalex.org/W4288041524,"The aim of this study was to evaluate factors influencing the performance of Hucul horses and to develop a prediction model, based on artificial neural (AI) networks for predict horses' classification, relying on their performance value assessment during the annual Hucul championships. The Feedforward multilayer artificial neural networks, learned using supervised methods and implemented in Matlab programming environment were applied. Artificial neural networks with one and two hidden layers with different numbers of neurons equipped with a tangensoidal transition function, learned using the Levenberg-Marqiuardt method, were applied for the analysis. Although results showed that 7-year-old horses had the highest number of wins, the 11-year-old horses were observed to have had the best results when accessed relative to the total number of horses for a given year. Although horses from the Hroby line had the most starts in 2009-2019, those of the Goral line had the most wins. While predicting the horses' efficiency for the first 6 positions during the utility championship, the neural network consisting of 12 neurons in hidden layer performed the best, obtaining 69,65% efficiency. The highest horse efficiency classification was obtained for the four-layered network with 12 and 8 neurons in the hidden layers. An 81.3% efficiency was obtained while evaluating the correctness of the prediction for horses occupying positions 1 to 3. The use of AI seems to be indispensable in assessing the performance value of Hucul horses. It is necessary to determine the relation between horses' traits and their utility value by means of trait selection methods, accompanied with expert advice. It is also advisable to conduct research using deep neural networks."

It has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. However, several case reports have reported conflicting effects of dupilumab on alopecia.This study aimed to examine dupilumab-related hair disorders using the large real-world database, VigiBase.All individual case safety reports associated with dupilumab in the Uppsala Monitoring Center VigiBase until December 29, 2019, were analyzed. Hair disorder-related terms were defined in High Level Terms with ""alopecias,"" ""pilar disorders NEC (not elsewhere classified),"" and ""hypertrichoses,"" using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Hierarchy. Hair disorder reports associated with dupilumab and other biologics that inhibit the Th2 axis (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab) were analyzed to determine their association with hair disorders. Disproportionality analysis was performed based on the proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio, and information components.Among the 20,548 total dupilumab adverse event (AE) reports, hair disorders were reported in 462 dupilumab cases (2.2%), most of which reported hair loss, and only eight cases reported an increase in hair growth. The paradoxical trend in hair loss and growth after dupilumab use was confirmed using a disproportionality analysis. Among the other investigated biologics on Th2 immunity, only omalizumab was associated with hair loss. Additionally, hair disorders after dupilumab treatment were more frequently reported in women than in men. The proportion of hair disorder cases was high in Europe, accounting for 20.8% of hair disorder reports, whereas only 9.7% of all dupilumab-related AEs were reported in Europe. In conclusion, our analysis using a large real-world database confirmed that dupilumab is associated with hair disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4288051914,"A key part of native forest management in designated wood production areas is identifying locations which must be exempt from logging. Forest laws, government regulations, and codes of practice specify where logging is and is not permitted. Assessing compliance with these regulations is critical but can be expensive and time consuming, especially if it entails field measurements. In some cases, spatial data products may help reduce the costs and increase the transparency of assessing compliance. However, different spatial products can vary in their accuracy and resolution, leading to uncertainty in forest management. We present the results of a detailed case study investigating the compliance of logging operations with laws preventing cutting on slopes exceeding 30°. We focused on two designated water catchments in the Australian State of Victoria which supply water to the city of Melbourne. We compared slopes that had been logged on steep terrain using spatial data based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from LiDAR, a 1 arc second DEM derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with a resolution of 10m. While our analyses revealed differences in slope measurements among the different spatial products, all three datasets (and the on-site slope measurements) estimated the occurrence of widespread logging of forests on slopes &gt;30° in both water catchments. We found the lowest resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM underestimated the steepness of slopes, whilst the DTM was variable in its estimates. As expected, the LiDAR generated slope calculations provided the best fit with on-site measurements. Our study demonstrates the value of spatial data products in assessing compliance with logging laws and codes of practice. We suggest that LiDAR DEMs, and DTMs also can be useful in proactive forest planning and management by helping better identify which areas should be exempt from cutting before logging operations commence."
https://openalex.org/W4288067895,"To consider trends and disparities in end-of-life health in the US.I use data from the National Health Interview Survey, linked to death records through 2015, for respondents who died at ages 65+ to compare the prevalence of three health outcomes in the last six years of life across time, sex, age, race, and educational attainment. Self-rated health (SRH) is available for respondents interviewed in years 1987-2014, while information on activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is available for the period 1997-2014.By the end of the study period, individuals reported two fewer months of fair/poor health at the end of life than those dying in earlier years. In contrast, time lived with at least one activity limitation at the end of life generally remained comparable. Compared to men, women on average reported an additional year of living with an IADL limitation before death, and an additional eight months with an ADL limitation. Despite sex differences in disability, both sexes reported similar periods of fair/poor SRH before death. Similarly, while individuals who lived to older ages experienced a longer disabled period before death than individuals who died at younger ages, all age groups were equally likely to report fair/poor SRH. Black adults and adults with less formal schooling also spent more time with an end-of-life disability. For men, these racial and socioeconomic disparities lessened as death approached. For women, inequalities persisted until death.These findings suggest that despite increasing life expectancy, the period of poor health and disability prior to death has not recently been extended. Black women and women with less than a high school degree, require extended support at the end of life."
