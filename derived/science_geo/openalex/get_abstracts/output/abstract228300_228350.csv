Many of the early problems that hindered the clinical applications of particulate DDS have been overcome, with several DDS formulations of anticancer and antifungal drugs now approved for clinical use. Furthermore, there is considerable interest in exploiting the advantages of DDS for in vivo delivery of new drugs derived from proteomics or genomics research and for their use in ligand-targeted therapeutics."

We synthesized pure copper samples with a high density of nanoscale growth twins. They showed a tensile strength about 10 times higher than that of conventional coarse-grained copper, while retaining an electrical conductivity comparable to that of pure copper. The ultrahigh strength originates from the effective blockage of dislocation motion by numerous coherent twin boundaries that possess an extremely low electrical resistivity, which is not the case for other types of grain boundaries."

Species richness declines as a linear function of the rate of inorganic nitrogen deposition, with a reduction of one species per 4-m2 quadrat for every 2.5 kg Nha-1 year-1 of chronic nitrogen deposition. Species adapted to infertile conditions are systematically reduced at high nitrogen deposition. At the mean chronic nitrogen deposition rate of central Europe (17 kg Nha-1 year-1), there is a 23% species reduction compared with grasslands receiving the lowest levels of nitrogen deposition."

Relatively little is known about the critical brain structures for, and the relative time course of, establishing the meaning and truth of linguistic expressions. We present electroencephalogram data that show the rapid parallel integration of both semantic and world knowledge during the interpretation of a sentence. Data from functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the left inferior prefrontal cortex is involved in the integration of both meaning and world knowledge. Finally, oscillatory brain responses indicate that the brain keeps a record of what makes a sentence hard to interpret."
https://openalex.org/W2128492772,"We report the incrementally staged design, synthesis, characterization, and operation of a molecular machine that behaves like a nanoscale elevator. The operation of this device, which is made of a platformlike component interlocked with a trifurcated riglike component and is only 3.5 nanometers by 2.5 nanometers in size, relies on the integration of several structural and functional molecular subunits. This molecular elevator is considerably more complex and better organized than previously reported artificial molecular machines. It exhibits a clear-cut on-off reversible behavior, and it could develop forces up to around 200 piconewtons."

https://openalex.org/W2109958697,"Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that insulin resistance, a proximal cause of Type II diabetes [a non-insulin dependent form of diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)], is associated with an increased relative risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we examined the role of dietary conditions leading to NIDDM-like insulin resistance on amyloidosis in Tg2576 mice, which model AD-like neuropathology. We found that diet-induced insulin resistance promoted amyloidogenic beta-amyloid (Abeta) Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptide generation in the brain that corresponded with increased gamma-secretase activities and decreased insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) activities. Moreover, increased Abeta production also coincided with increased AD-type amyloid plaque burden in the brain and impaired performance in a spatial water maze task. Further exploration of the apparent interrelationship of insulin resistance to brain amyloidosis revealed a functional decrease in insulin receptor (IR)-mediated signal transduction in the brain, as suggested by decreased IR beta-subunit (IRbeta) Y1162/1163 autophosphorylation and reduced phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase/pS473-AKT/Protein kinase (PK)-B in these same brain regions. This latter finding is of particular interest given the known inhibitory role of AKT/PKB on glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3alpha activity, which has previously been shown to promote Abeta peptide generation. Most interestingly, we found that decreased pS21-GSK-3alpha and pS9-GSK-3beta phosphorylation, which is an index of GSK activation, positively correlated with the generation of brain C-terminal fragment (CTF)-gamma cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein, an index of gamma-secretase activity, in the brain of insulin-resistant relative to normoglycemic Tg2576 mice. Our study is consistent with the hypothesis that insulin resistance may be an underlying mechanism responsible for the observed increased relative risk for AD neuropathology, and presents the first evidence to suggest that IR signaling can influence Abeta production in the brain."

The drought affected almost two-thirds of the country and parts of Mexico and Canada and was infamous for the numerous dust storms that occurred in the southern Great Plains. In this study, we present model results that indicate that the drought was caused by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures during that decade and that interactions between the atmosphere and the land surface increased its severity. We also contrast the 1930s drought with other North American droughts of the 20th century."

https://openalex.org/W2044136163,"The majority of disulfide-linked cytosolic proteins are thought to be enzymes that transiently form disulfide bonds while catalyzing oxidation-reduction (redox) processes. Recent evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species can act as signaling molecules by promoting the formation of disulfide bonds within or between select redox-sensitive proteins. However, few studies have attempted to examine global changes in disulfide bond formation following reactive oxygen species exposure. Here we isolate and identify disulfide-bonded proteins (DSBP) in a mammalian neuronal cell line (HT22) exposed to various oxidative insults by sequential nonreducing/reducing two-dimensional SDS-PAGE combined with mass spectrometry. By using this strategy, several known cytosolic DSBP, such as peroxiredoxins, thioredoxin reductase, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, and ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase, were identified. Unexpectedly, a large number of previously unknown DSBP were also found, including those involved in molecular chaperoning, translation, glycolysis, cytoskeletal structure, cell growth, and signal transduction. Treatment of cells with a wide range of hydrogen peroxide concentrations either promoted or inhibited disulfide bonding of select DSBP in a concentration-dependent manner. Decreasing the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione also promoted select disulfide bond formation within proteins from cytoplasmic extracts. In addition, an epitope-tagged version of the molecular chaperone HSP70 forms mixed disulfides with both Î²4-spectrin and adenomatous polyposis coli protein in the cytosol. Our findings indicate that disulfide bond formation within families of cytoplasmic proteins is dependent on the nature of the oxidative insult and may provide a common mechanism used to control multiple physiological processes.

It is frequently argued that ROS cause relatively nonspecific damage to vital cellular components such as lipids, DNA, and proteins. However, emerging evidence indicates that ROS can cause specific protein modifications that may lead to a change in the activity or function of the oxidized protein (1Maher P. Schubert D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1287-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7426) Google Scholar). Several major forms of oxidative modifications can occur on amino acid residue side chains including carbonylation, nitrosylation, and oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide (3Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Protein sulfhydryls can be oxidized to protein disulfides and sulfenic acids as well as more highly oxidized states such as the sulfinic and sulfonic acid forms of protein cysteines (4Thomas J.A. Mallis R.J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Under non-stressed conditions, disulfide bond formation occurs primarily in the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells (5Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The sulfhydryl groups in the vast majority of protein cysteine residues (Cys-SH) have a pKa >8.0 and, in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm, remain protonated at physiological pH. Thus, cytoplasmic proteins, in general, do not contain disulfide bonds (6Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, certain redox-sensitive proteins possess cysteine residues that exist as thiolate anions at neutral pH due to a lowering of their pKa values by charge interactions with neighboring amino acid residues and are therefore more vulnerable to oxidation (6Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Many redox-sensitive proteins form transient disulfide bonds while catalyzing the reduction of thiol groups (6Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). There are two major thiol-reducing systems in the cytoplasm. The first system makes use of the abundant cysteine-containing tripeptide glutathione (GSH) to reduce disulfide bonds via a thiol-disulfide interchange catalyzed by glutaredoxin (7Mannervik B. Axelsson K. Sundewall A.C. Holmgren A. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the second system, the reduced form of thioredoxin (TRX) binds to substrate proteins containing a disulfide bond, and a dithioldisulfide exchange reaction occurs in which the active site cysteine residues of TRX are oxidized, whereas the cysteine residues in the substrate protein are reduced (8Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). During severe oxidative stress both systems can be overwhelmed or inactivated, leaving cytosolic cysteine residues susceptible to oxidation. Recently, a number of studies in bacteria and yeast have shown that oxidative stress-induced disulfide bond formation appears to be the main mechanism to adjust the protein activity of the transcription factors OxyR and YAP1 and the molecular chaperone HSP33 (reviewed in Ref. 9Linke K. Jakob U. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Reversible oxidation of redox-sensitive proteins has also been shown to regulate signal transduction and gene expression in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 10Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kwon J. Science's STKE. 2000; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/53/pe1PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a relatively mild oxidant implicated in both oxidative stress and cell signaling, can oxidize cysteine sulfhydryl groups to a cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) or disulfide bonds (4Thomas J.A. Mallis R.J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The active site cysteine residue of protein-tyrosine phosphatases has been shown to be reversibly oxidized to a sulfenic acid by H2O2 (11Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 509-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, tumor necrosis factor-Î±-induced signaling generates ROS that promote the oxidation of the active site residues of TRX. Oxidation of TRX results in its dissociation from apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and the subsequent activation of ASK1 (13Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in intracellular ROS as a result of exposure to environmental stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, radiation, and chemical agents, can lead to oxidation of cysteine residues within cytoplasmic redox-sensitive proteins, such as kinases and phosphatases, ultimately affecting signal transduction processes. However, the actual number and type of redox-sensitive proteins that undergo reversible cysteine oxidation is, for the most part, unknown. Relatively few methods exist for examining disulfide bond formation within cells. A technique termed diagonal SDS-PAGE was originally used to analyze intermolecular disulfide bonds artificially generated between ribosomal proteins in Escherichia coli (14Sommer A. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3946-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In diagonal SDS-PAGE, oxidized proteins are separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions and in the second dimension under reducing conditions. This technique has successfully been adapted to monitor mixed disulfide bond formation during the folding of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (15Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). By using a well characterized neuronal cell model of oxidative stress, we isolated and identified cytosolic DSBP based on a modified diagonal two-dimensional PAGE method and mass spectrometry. We show here that protein disulfide bond formation readily occurs within the cytoplasm of unstressed as well as oxidant-stressed cells and that disulfide bond formation is dependent on the type of oxidant exposure. These redox-sensitive proteins, previously not known to form disulfide bonds, participate in numerous cellular processes including translation, molecular chaperoning, glycolysis, cell growth, cytoskeletal structure, antioxidant activity, and signal transduction, suggesting that disulfide bond formation may have a regulatory role in these processes. Cell Lines and Oxidant ExposureâHT22 cells (17Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at no greater than 50% confluence. For oxidant exposure studies, 2.5 Ã 105 cells were seeded per 100-mm dish and the following day either exposed to 5 mm glutamate for 8 h, 1 mm diamide for 5 min, or 10 mm H2O2 for 5 min. In some studies cells were exposed to either 10, 150, or 400 Î¼m H2O2 for 10 min. Glutathione MeasurementâCells were washed twice with PBS, harvested in 1% sulfosalicylic acid, and centrifuged at 16,000 Ã g for 10 min. Glutathione and protein assays were performed on the supernatant and pellet, respectively. Total glutathione was measured by a standard recycling assay based on the reduction of 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid in the presence of glutathione reductase and NADPH (18Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). GSSG was separately measured after derivatization of GSH with 2-vinylpyridine. Prot-SSG levels were measured after sonicating and rinsing the protein pellets in 1% sulfosalicylic acid and then resuspending the pellet in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The solution was then treated for 45 min at 41 Â°C with 0.25% sodium borohydride at neutral pH to reduce the disulfide linkage. Excess borohydride was decomposed by acidification, and the liberated GSH was measured as described above. Cytosolic Fractionation and Protein PrecipitationâFollowing exposure to various oxidative stimuli, â¼5 Ã 106 HT22 cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in ice-cold PBS with 40 mm iodoacetamide (IA) for 5 min to prevent thiol-disulfide exchange and inhibit post-lysis oxidation of free cysteines. By using a modified differential detergent fractionation technique (19Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 53-66PubMed Google Scholar), cells were scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of digitonin extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.015% (w/v) digitonin, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) + 40 mm IA, followed by rocking on ice for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 480 Ã g, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a new tube, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). The precipitated proteins were resolubilized in 100 Î¼l of solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) + 40 mm IA. For membrane/organelle and nuclear fractionation, post-digitonin-extracted pellets were further processed by using the differential detergent fractionation technique (19Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 53-66PubMed Google Scholar). Redox Two-dimensional PAGEâAn equal volume of SDS sample buffer, free of reducing agents, was added to resolubilized cytosolic extracts. Gels (10% acrylamide, 1.0 mm thickness) were prepared according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and protein samples (120 Î¼g) were subjected to electrophoresis in the first dimension for 5 h at constant current (25 mA) using a Hoefer SE 600 gel apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). After electrophoresis, the gel lanes containing the separated proteins were cut and immersed in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT for 20 min at room temperature. Following a brief wash with SDS running buffer, the gel slices were further immersed in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm IA for 10 min. Each gel strip was then applied horizontally to another gel (10% acrylamide, 1.5 mm thickness), and electrophoresis was performed in the second dimension for 14 h at constant current (10 mA/gel). Gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid for 20 min and either silver-stained according to the method of Schevchenko et al. (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) or stained with GelCode Blue according to the manufacturer (Pierce). Identification of Redox-sensitive ProteinsâGel spots from redox two-dimensional gels were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were analyzed by either liquid chromatographyelectrospray tandem MS (MS/MS) or matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS (MALDI-TOF). For MS/MS analysis, peptides were initially separated using a microbore high pressure liquid chromatography system (Surveyor, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), and the eluent from the high pressure liquid chromatography column was eluted directly into the electrospray ionization source of a ThermoFinnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) as described previously (22Andon N.L. Hollingworth S. Koller A. Greenland A.J. Yates III, J.R. Haynes P.A. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). MS/MS data were analyzed using the SEQUEST algorithm, and positive sequence identifications were based on established criteria such as a cross-correlation factor (Xcorr) greater than 2.5, a Î cross-correlation factor (ÎXcorr) greater than 0.1, and a minimum of one tryptic peptide terminus. All matched peptides were confirmed by visual examination of the spectra. All spectra were searched against a composite data base containing the latest version of the non-redundant protein data base Swiss-Prot. For MALDI-TOF analysis, aliquots of digest samples (0.5 Î¼l) were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (saturated solution of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid and 30% acetonitrile) on the target plate. MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired using a Voyager DESTR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The machine employs a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and was run in positive ion reflector mode with an ion extraction delay. Monoisotopic peptide masses were determined after internal calibration and searched against the NCBInr mouse protein data base using the Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco) program with a mass tolerance of 25 ppm. Immunoblot AnalysisâFractionated cytosolic, membrane/organelle, and nuclear extracts (15 Î¼g) were resolved using 4â12% nonreducing SDS-PAGE (NOVEX, Carlsbad, CA), electroblotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blocked with 1% milk, 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Blots were hybridized with antibodies against PRX-1, NDPK-B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), HSC70, HSP70, protein disulfide isomerase (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), actin, Î±-tubulin (Sigma), and FLAG (Eastman Kodak) overnight and, following washing, were further hybridized with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Detection was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Induction of Disulfide Bonding by GSSGâCytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above except IA was not added during harvesting or lysis. Extracts (250 Î¼g) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of different ratios of GSH and GSSG. The total concentration of GSH equivalents was maintained at 5 mm in the incubation mixture. Following incubation, lysates were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized, and analyzed by redox two-dimensional SDS-PAGE as described above. Labeling of DSBP with Biotin-conjugated IodoacetamideâProteins were first separated by nonreducing gel electrophoresis and then the gel lanes were cut and immersed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm DTT. Following in-gel reduction for 20 min, gel slices were washed three times in Tris/EDTA buffer and incubated with 50 Î¼mN-(biotinyl)-Nâ²-(iodoacetyl)ethylenediamine (Molecular Probes) in 25 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm EDTA for 20 min at room temperature. Gel slices were applied horizontally to another gel, and electrophoresis was performed as described above followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detection using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science). Construction of Epitope-tagged HSP70 VectorâHuman HSP70 cDNA was amplified by PCR by using the primer sets 5â²-GGCGGATCCACCATGGCCAAAGCCGCGGCAGTC-3â² and 5â²-TGCGGTCGACCTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCATCTACCTCCTCAATGGTGGG-3â² and pH 2.3/HSP70 (kindly provided by Richard I. Morimoto, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) as a template. BamHI and SalI/FLAG sequences were incorporated into the 5â² and 3â² primers, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI, inserted into a BamHI/SalI-cut pRevTRE vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and sequenced to verify the fidelity of the PCR and ensure that the FLAG sequence was incorporated. The resulting vector (HSP70-FLAG) was transfected into HT22 cells expressing the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator. Expression of HSP70-FLAG was induced by the addition of 2 Î¼g/ml doxycycline for 24 h. ImmunoprecipitationâCytosolic extracts were prepared as described above and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Acid-precipitated proteins were resolubilized in 100 Î¼l of MNT buffer (20 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm IA) containing 1% SDS. After adjusting the volume to 1 ml with MNT buffer, 20 Î¼l of agarose-coupled M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was added and incubated at 4 Â°C overnight. After three washes with MNT buffer, the immunocomplexes were competitively eluted by the addition of 100 Î¼l of FLAG peptide (400 Î¼g/ml). Elution fractions were analyzed by both immunoblotting and redox two-dimensional SDS-PAGE as described above. H2O2 and Diamide Induce Protein Mixed Disulfides with GlutathioneâWe examined the effect of a variety of oxidative conditions on protein disulfide bond formation using the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. This cell line has been used extensively to examine oxidative stress-induced cell death (23Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 24Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Chambers D. Davis J. Schubert D. Maher P. Free Radic. Biol.

Somia N. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Non-receptor mediated oxidative glutamate toxicity is initiated by high concentrations of extracellular glutamate that prevents cystine uptake into cells, which in turn depletes both intracellular cysteine and GSH, and leads to a dramatic increase in ROS and ultimately cell death (23Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 24Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Chambers D. Davis J. Schubert D. Maher P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This form of oxidative stress-induced programmed cell death is called oxytosis (27Tan S. Schubert D. Maher P. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HT22 cells are highly sensitive to extracellular glutamate, H2O2, and agents that deplete GSH (23Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 24Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Chambers D. Davis J. Schubert D. Maher P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). H2O2 is a diffusible mild oxidant that readily promotes the conversion of sulfhydryl groups into disulfides and other oxidized species (10Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kwon J. Science's STKE. 2000; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/53/pe1PubMed Google Scholar). Diamide is an oxidizing agent that easily penetrates cell membranes and rapidly reacts with low molecular weight thiols (such as GSH) and promotes intracellular protein disulfide cross-linking (28Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, cysteine residues within cytoplasmic proteins are maintained in a reduced state due to the high concentration of GSH (2â10 mm) and the high ratio (100â400:1) between GSH and GSH disulfide (GSSG) (29Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). During oxidative stress the levels of GSH decrease, GSSG levels increase, and mixed disulfides form between GSH and redox-sensitive proteins (a process termed glutathionylation), all of which are theorized to promote protein disulfide bond formation (29Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We therefore examined levels of GSH, GSSG, and Prot-SSG in oxidant-treated HT22 cells to verify that the oxidants used would promote disulfide bond formation. As expected, glutamate treatment caused a massive decrease in GSH levels (Fig. 1A). Although H2O2 treatment had little effect on GSH levels, GSSG levels were increased over 3-fold compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, diamide treatment caused a modest decrease in GSH levels and essentially had no effect on GSSG levels. However, the ratio of GSH/GSSG was 230, 21.3, 78, and 163.2 in control, glutamate-, H2O2-, and diamide-treated cells, respectively, indicating that all three treatments promoted oxidation to varying degrees. Most interesting, both H2O2 and diamide treatments caused between a 14- and 19-fold increase in Prot-SSG levels (Fig. 1C). Isolation of Disulfide-linked Proteins in Oxidatively Challenged HT22 Cells by Nonreducing/Reducing Two-dimensional SDS-PAGEâFollowing oxidant treatment, cytoplasmic extracts from HT22 cells were isolated using a modified differential detergent fractionation technique (19Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 53-66PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the cytoplasmic fractions were not contaminated with proteins from either the membrane/organelle or nuclear fractions, we performed immunoblot analysis with antibodies that recognize endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear specific proteins. Essentially no contamination with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (protein-disulfide isomerase) or the nucleus (cAMP-response element-binding protein) was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2A). To isolate proteins that form either intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds, we sequentially resolved cytosolic proteins by non-reducing followed by reducing SDS-PAGE (redox two-dimensional SDS-PAGE). The resulting silver-stained gels reveal a prominent diagonal line of proteins (Fig. 2B). This line represents the majority of proteins within the cytosol that does not form disulfide bonds. However, proteins that form intermolecular disulfide bonds exhibit a slower electrophoretic mobility under non-reducing conditions in the first dimension and therefore appear as spots to the right of the diagonal line following reducing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Spots that appear to the left of the diagonal line represent proteins that exhibit a faster electrophoretic mobility under non-reducing conditions due to intramolecular disulfide bonding. In order to verify that acrylamide did not artificially induce disulfide bonding, cytosolic protein extracts were treated with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in both the first and second dimension. As expected, the presence of reducing agents in both dimensions resulted in a clear diagonal line with essentially no spots in the off-diagonal zone (Fig. 2F). We treated HT22 cells with concentrations of glutamate, H2O2, and diamide that elicit an oxidative response but lead to less than 10% cell death within the time frame of the experiment. Under non-stressed conditions, numerous DSBP were apparent (Fig. 2B). Exposure to either glutamate, H2O2, or diamide resulted in increased levels of existing DSBP and the appearance of new DSBP that were not apparent in the non-stressed control cells (Fig. 2, CâE). Identification of DSBPs by Mass SpectrometryâProtein spots that exhibited reproducible migration following redox two-dimensional SDS-PAGE were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and identified by either matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) or by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). A representative redox two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel of cells treated with diamide, which contains all the DSBP spots identified, is presented along with the corresponding spot numbers in Fig. 3. Analysis of the DSBP identified revealed that most of the proteins could be classified into the following eight functional categories: molecular chaperones, protein translation, glycolysis, cytoskeletal, cell growth, antioxidant, signal transduction, and others. Table I summarizes the DSBP identified and their corresponding spot identification number on Fig. 3. Some proteins, such as HSC70, HSP70, and HSP90, formed more than one intermolecular disulfide bond and therefore appeared as several spots to the right of the diagonal line (Fig. 3B). The translation elongation factor, EF-1-Î±-1, formed both intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds and thus appeared as several spots to the left and right of the diagonal line, respectively (Fig. 3A). In some cases, such as spots 1, 5, and 11, multiple proteins were identified per spot (Table I) due to similar migration patterns in the non-reducing first dimension.Table ISummary of DSBP identified and method of identificationProteinSpot no.NCBI no.Molecular massID methodMALDI-TOFMS/MSkDaMolecular chaperonesCalreticulin9P1421160++GRP785P2002978+HSC706-8P0810973++HSP706-8P1787970++HSP90-Î±2, 3P0790186++HSP90-Î²2, 3P1149984++TCP-1 Î±11P1198361+TCP-1 Î²14P8031458+TCP-1 Î´13P8031558+TCP-1 Ïµ11P"
https://openalex.org/W1990122501,"Macrophages are pivotal constituents of the innate immune system, vital for recognition and elimination of microbial pathogens. Macrophages use Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns--including bacterial cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid, and viral nucleic acids, such as double-stranded (ds)RNA--and in turn activate effector functions, including anti-apoptotic signalling pathways. Certain pathogens, however, such as Salmonella spp., Shigellae spp. and Yersiniae spp., use specialized virulence factors to overcome these protective responses and induce macrophage apoptosis. We found that the anthrax bacterium, Bacillus anthracis, selectively induces apoptosis of activated macrophages through its lethal toxin, which prevents activation of the anti-apoptotic p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. We now demonstrate that macrophage apoptosis by three different bacterial pathogens depends on activation of TLR4. Dissection of anti- and pro-apoptotic signalling events triggered by TLR4 identified the dsRNA responsive protein kinase PKR as a critical mediator of pathogen-induced macrophage apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic actions of PKR are mediated both through inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of interferon response factor 3."

It is thought that the combinatorial association between distinct alpha and beta subunits determines whether Kv channels function as non-inactivating delayed rectifiers or as rapidly inactivating A-type channels. We show that membrane lipids can convert A-type channels into delayed rectifiers and vice versa. Phosphoinositides remove N-type inactivation from A-type channels by immobilizing the inactivation domains. Conversely, arachidonic acid and its amide anandamide endow delayed rectifiers with rapid voltage-dependent inactivation. The bidirectional control of Kv channel gating by lipids may provide a mechanism for the dynamic regulation of electrical signaling in the nervous system."

IntroductionA critical regulatory step in insulin signal transduction is the dephosphorylation of signaling molecules by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; LAR, leukocyte antigen-related phosphatase; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin-receptor substrate; WAT, white adipose tissue; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; MIRKO, muscle-specific insulin receptor-deficient; BAT, brown adipose tissue; PI, phosphoinositide; PKC, protein kinase C. which participate in terminating insulin signaling. Several PTPs have been implicated in negatively regulating insulin signal transduction, including protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and the leukocyte antigen-related (LAR) phosphatase (1Goldstein B.J.

Dube N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1050-1059Google Scholar). Both LAR and PTP1B are expressed in insulin-responsive tissues such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue and in brain (1Goldstein B.J. Li P.M. Ding W. Ahmad F. Zhang W.R. Vitam. Horm. 1998; 54: 67-96Google Scholar, 2Goldstein B.J. Ahmad F. Ding W. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 91-99Google Scholar, 3Cheng A. Dube N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J.

Whereas LAR and PTP1B are both implicated as insulin receptor (IR) and possibly insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) phosphatases (3Cheng A. Dube N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1050-1059Google Scholar, 5Calera M.R. Vallega G. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6308-6312Google Scholar, 6Goldstein B.J. Bittner-Kowalczyk A. White M.F. Harbeck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4283-4289Google Scholar), multiple PTPs may be required to terminate insulin signaling in different tissues, by acting at discrete subcellular locations, or by targeting distinct tyrosines on the same substrate. In some studies, LAR and PTP1B expression and activity are increased in muscle and adipose tissue of humans and rodents in insulin-resistant states such as obesity (2Goldstein B.J. Ahmad F. Ding W.

Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 709-712Google Scholar). The phenotype of LAR-deficient (LAR-/-) mice is complex. They have low insulin and glucose levels, and decreased basal hepatic glucose production, consistent with a possible role of LAR as a negative regulator of insulin signaling (40Ren J.M. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Sweet L.J. Cline G. Shulman G.I. Livingston J.N. Goldstein B.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 493-497Google Scholar). However, LAR-/-mice are also smaller in size and are insulin-resistant in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, possibly due to the effects of counter-regulatory hormones (40Ren J.M. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Sweet L.J. Cline G. Shulman G.I. Livingston J.N. Goldstein B.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 493-497Google Scholar). Nevertheless, transgenic overexpression of LAR in muscle impairs insulin signaling and glucose uptake specifically in muscle and causes whole body insulin resistance (41Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Pani M.A. Boss O. Klaman L.D. Kamatkar S. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5187-5192Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that LAR can negatively regulate insulin signaling and that elevated expression of LAR might contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in vivo.To determine whether the endogenous overexpression of PTP1B observed in muscle of obese insulin-resistant rodents and humans also contributes to their insulin resistance, we generated mice overexpressing human PTP1B specifically in skeletal muscle. PTP1B-overexpressing mice have decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport into muscle and whole body insulin resistance, similar to LAR-overexpressing mice (41Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Pani M.A. Boss O. Klaman L.D. Kamatkar S. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5187-5192Google Scholar). Because endogenous overexpression of both LAR and PTP1B occurs in skeletal muscle of obese insulin-resistant rodents and humans, we generated compound muscle-specific LAR- and PTP1B-overexpressing mice to determine whether LAR and PTP1B overexpression additively impair insulin action. Our results reveal that overexpression of LAR and PTP1B does not additively impair insulin action, suggesting that these phosphatases have overlapping actions in causing insulin resistance in muscle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransgenic MiceâThe 3.5-kb EcoRI fragment of the human PTP1B cDNA (42Chernoff J. Schievella A.R. Jost C.A. Erikson R.L. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2735-2739Google Scholar) was inserted into an EcoRI site of p3300MCK-CAT (43Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Google Scholar) (gift of S. Hauschka) downstream of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter/enhancer start site, and upstream of the SV40 intron and polyadenylation sequences (Fig. 1A). Transgenic MCK-hPTP1B mice were generated by insertion of the NotI-KpnI fragment of the resultant plasmid into the pronuclei of fertilized zygotes from FVB mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing human LAR in muscle (MCK-hLAR) have been previously described (41Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Pani M.A. Boss O. Klaman L.D. Kamatkar S. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5187-5192Google Scholar). Both MCK-hLAR mice and MCK-hPTP1B mice are heterozygous for their respective transgenes and were interbred to generate MCK-hLAR/PTP1B mice. Muscle-specific insulin receptor-deficient (MIRKO) mice (gift of C. R. Kahn) have been previously described (44Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Google Scholar). Mice were housed at 22 Â°C with a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed a standard diet (either Purina Autoclavable Rodent Diet 5010 or 5020) ad libitum. All studies were approved by the Harvard Medical School Center for Animal Resources and Comparative Medicine and/or Yale Animal Use and Care Committee and were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.PCR Genotyping of Transgenic MiceâDNA was extracted from mouse toes by proteinase K digestion (45Kogan S.C. Doherty M. Gitschier J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 317: 985-990Google Scholar). Human LAR was amplified by PCR using primers hLARpf (5â²-CGGGGTGAAGAAGCAAAGAC-3â²) and hLARpr (5â²-CCCTGCCCCATCATCAAACTC-3â²), which are specific for exon 2. Human PTP1B was amplified by PCR using primers hPTP1Bpf (5â²-GTTCGAGCAGATCGACAAGTC-3â²) and hPTP1Bpr (5â²-TTCTCCATCACTCTGTTGAGC-3â²). Primers specific for exon 2 of the cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte-associated 4 gene (5â²-TGGTGTTGGCTAGCAGCCATG-3â² and 5â²-TGGGATGGTGAGGTTCACTC-3â²) were used as amplification controls. PCR reaction conditions are available upon request from J. Zabolotny.Measurement of Human and Murine PTP1B Protein in Transgenic MiceâLiver, heart, interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), perigonadal WAT, and hindlimb muscle were dissected from mice and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 min with a Polytron, incubated at 4 Â°C for 40-60 min with rotation, and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 Ã g. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with antibodies generated against human (23Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y.B. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Google Scholar) or murine PTP1B (26Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y.B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Google Scholar). PTP1B was quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics/Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and normalized for cross-reactivity of the anti-human PTP1B antibody for murine PTP1B (6:1, human:murine) and anti-murine PTP1B antibody for human PTP1B (10:1, murine:human). The relative cross-reactivity was determined by immunoblotting hemagglutinin-tagged human and murine PTP1B expressed in COS cells (data not shown, but see Ref. 23Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y.B. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Google Scholar).Measurement of Human and Murine PTP1B Activity in Transgenic MiceâTo determine the total amount of PTP1B activity in muscle of MCK-hPTP1B mice, human and murine PTP1B activity against poly-Glu-Tyr was measured in PTP1B immunoprecipitates of WT and MCK-hPTP1B hindlimb skeletal muscle. Murine PTP1B was immunoprecipitated from muscle lysates with polyclonal anti-PTP1B antibodies (26Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y.B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Google Scholar), and human PTP1B was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal PTP1B antibody FG6 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). To determine the specificity of anti-murine PTP1B antibodies for murine PTP1B, PTP1B activity in anti-murine PTP1B immunoprecipitates of WT and MCK-hPTP1B mouse muscle was compared with that of PTP1B-/-mouse muscle and human muscle lysates. To determine the cross-reactivity of anti-human PTP1B antibodies for murine PTP1B, PTP1B activity in anti-human PTP1B immunoprecipitates of MCK-hPTP1B muscle lysates was compared with that of WT and PTP1B-/-muscle lysates.Measurement of Total LAR Protein in Transgenic MiceâProtein (1 mg) from muscle lysates of WT, MCK-hLAR, MCK-hPTP1B, and MCK-hLAR/PTP1B mice was incubated with wheat germ-agarose overnight, washed three times with lysis buffer, and then bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and subjected to anti-LAR immunoblotting as described previously (41Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Pani M.A. Boss O. Klaman L.D. Kamatkar S. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5187-5192Google Scholar).Tyrosyl Phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2âFasted (15-18 h) mice were injected intravenously by tail vein with 10 milliunits of insulin/g of body weight (Humulin, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis IN) then sacrificed 3 min later, and hindlimb muscle and liver were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscle lysates were prepared as described above, and 0.5-1 mg of protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY99 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, or 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 polyclonal antisera (3 Î¼l; gifts from M. White, Joslin Diabetes Center). Immunocomplexes of polyclonal antibodies were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and immunocomplexes of monoclonal antibodies were collected on a mix of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immune complexes were washed three times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) with 2 mm Na3VO4, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated for 5 min at 95 Â°C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) and visualized using chemiluminescence. With this protocol, the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 is â¥95% and IRS-2 is â¥90% (data not shown).Muscle lysates were immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies against the IR Î² subunit (gift of C. R. Kahn, Joslin Diabetes Center), phosphotyrosines 972, 1158, or 1162-1163 of IR (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), IRS-1 and IRS-2 (gifts of M. White, Joslin Diabetes Center) (46Withers D.J.

Blenis, Harvard Medical School) following the manufacturer's directions or standard techniques. Phosphorylation of specific IR tyrosines and total ERK1/2 were visualized with fluorescent secondary antibodies and quantified with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), following the manufacturer's instructions. For all other experiments, proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics/Amersham Biosciences).PI 3â²-Kinase, PKCÎ»/Î¶, and Akt Activity AssaysâTissue lysates (250-1000 Î¼g of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitations with 3 Î¼l of IRS-1 or IRS-2 polyclonal antibodies (1:100 dilution, gift of M. White, Joslin Diabetes Center) or 2 Î¼g of monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for PI 3â²-kinase assays. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-(Sigma) or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed, and PI 3-kinase activity was measured as reported previously (47Kim Y.B. Zhu J.S. Zierath J.R. Shen H.Q. Baron A.D. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Google Scholar). For Akt activity measurements, muscle lysates (500 Î¼g of protein) were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 Â°C with 3 Î¼g of polyclonal Akt antibodies that recognize Akt1 and Akt2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were washed, and Akt activity was determined as previously described (47Kim Y.B. Zhu J.S. Zierath J.R. Shen H.Q. Baron A.D. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Google Scholar). For measurement of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms Î» and Î¶ activity, muscle lysates (250 Î¼g of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 Â°C with 2 Î¼g of a polyclonal anti-PKC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) recognizing both PKCÎ» and PKCÎ¶, coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immune pellets were washed, and PKC Î»/Î¶ activity was determined as previously described (48Kim Y.B. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32915-32922Google Scholar).Measurement of Glucose, Insulin, and Free Fatty Acid LevelsâBlood was extracted from the tail veins of fed or overnight fasted (16-18 h) mice. For hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase reaction using a Beckman glucose analyzer II (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). For all other studies, blood glucose levels were measured using a One Touch II glucometer (Life-scan Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, CA). For hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, plasma insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). For all other experiments, serum insulin levels were determined with a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL) using mouse insulin standards.Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic ClampsâHyperinsulinemic-euglycemic (103 Â± 9 mg/dl) clamp studies were performed as described previously (41Zabolotny J.M.

Hepatic glucose production and muscle 2-deoxyglucose uptake, glycolysis and glycogen synthesis were measured as described (41Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Pani M.A. Boss O. Klaman L.D.

Statistical significance was tested with unpaired Student's t tests or analysis of variance.RESULTSGeneration of Muscle-specific Human PTP1B (MCK-hPTP1B)-overexpressing MiceâTo determine if endogenous PTP1B overexpression, as observed in muscle of insulin-resistant humans and rodents (7Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1175-1184Google Scholar, 8Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E932-E940Google Scholar, 9Ahmad F. Azevedo J.L. Cortright R. Dohm G.L. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 449-458Google Scholar), could cause insulin resistance, we generated mice that overexpress human PTP1B selectively in muscle (Fig. 1, A-E). PTP1B overexpression in skeletal muscle was 1.8-fold over WT as determined by immunoblotting and PTP1B activity assay (Fig. 1E). Overexpression of human PTP1B did not alter the level of murine PTP1B protein or murine PTP1B activity (Fig. 1E). The level of transgenic PTP1B overexpression observed in MCK-hPTP1B mice is similar to that observed in skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant humans and rodents (7Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1175-1184Google Scholar, 8Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E932-E940Google Scholar, 9Ahmad F. Azevedo J.L. Cortright R. Dohm G.L. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin.

No overexpression of PTP1B was detected in brown adipose tissue (BAT), white adipose tissue (WAT), heart, or liver (Fig. 1D).Transgenic Overexpression of PTP1B in Muscle Causes Whole Body Insulin Resistance Similar to LAR OverexpressionâWe previously showed that muscle-specific human LAR-overexpressing (MCK-hLAR) mice have decreased whole body glucose disposal rates and muscle glucose uptake, indicating that overexpression of LAR in muscle causes insulin resistance (41Zabolotny J.M.

However, neither its physiological substrate(s) nor its mechanism of action in RTK signaling has been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that Sprouty (Spry) is a possible target of Shp2. Spry acts as a conserved inhibitor of RTK signaling, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Spry is indispensable for its inhibitory activity. Shp2 was able to dephosphorylate fibroblast growth factor receptor-induced phosphotyrosines on Spry both in vivo and in vitro. Shp2-mediated dephosphorylation of Spry resulted in dissociation of Spry from Grb2. Furthermore, Shp2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of Spry on FGF-induced neurite outgrowth and MAP kinase activation. These findings suggest that Shp2 acts as a positive regulator in RTK signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating Spry.

Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling regulates a wide variety of biological processes in response to extracellular signals, including cellular growth, differentiation and metabolism (1Pawson T.

Precise control of MAP kinase activation is critical for such cellular responses, and several molecules have been identified that serve to regulate the activation of MAP kinase either positively or negatively. Shp2 is a widely expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) that seems to play a positive role in the activation of MAP kinase in response to growth factors (8Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T.

In response to growth factor stimulation, Shp2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to Grb2, where it seems to act as an adaptor protein to recruit the Grb2-Sos complex to the plasma membrane. This, in turn, leads to Ras activation (6Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 9Noguchi T. Matozaki T.

However, several studies have shown that mutation of Shp2 in the putative Grb2 binding site did not interfere with the function of Shp2 in mediating MAP kinase activation (12Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 18O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, several lines of evidence indicate that the phosphatase catalytic activity of Shp2 is required for MAP kinase activation by FGF and other growth factors (12Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, two critical tasks are identifying the substrate for Shp2 and determining how dephosphorylation contributes to the activation of MAP kinase. Recently, it has been reported that a major binding protein of Shp2 is the multi-site docking protein Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder 1) and that this association is required for MAP kinase activation by several growth factors (19Holgado-Madruga M.

More recently, it has been reported that the primary function of Gab1 association with Shp2 is to target the PTPase activity of the latter to the membrane (26Cunnick J.M. Meng S. Ren Y. Desponts C. Wang H.-G. Djeu J.Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9498-9504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the substrate of Shp2 PTPase as yet remains unclear. Recently, we have found that Sprouty (Spry), which is a conserved inhibitor of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to growth factors. This tyrosine phosphorylation is required for Spry inhibitor activity (27Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Bio. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Spry binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2 in response to FGF stimulation and thereby inhibits the recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to FRS2 or Shp2, effectively suppressing Ras-MAP kinase signaling (27Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Bio. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because Shp2 acts immediately proximal to activated receptors, and its PTPase activity is required for MAP kinase activation by FGF, we hypothesized that Spry is a possible target of Shp2. In this study, we show that Shp2 can inactivate Spry by dephosphorylation and thereby prolong the activation of MAP kinase in response to FGF. This result suggests that Spry may be a target of Shp2 in Ras-MAP kinase signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest that the inhibitor activity of Spry is rapidly and reversibly controlled at the post-translational level, thus representing a novel type of negative feedback mechanism in receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction. Construction of the Constitutively Active and Catalytically Inactive Mutants of Shp2âIn the constitutively active and catalytically inactive mutants of Shp2 (E76A and C459S), Glu-76 and Cys-459 were replaced by Ala and Ser, respectively. These mutants were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis. Cell Cultures and TransfectionâC2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.35% glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. These cells were split on 35-mm or 60-mm dishes at 2 Ã 105 or 5 Ã 105 cells per dish, respectively. After 19 h, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol, respectively. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and ImmunoblottingâAntibodies were purchased from the following sources: anti-phospho-ERK from New England Biolabs, anti-Grb2 and anti-Myc from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-phospho-Tyr from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-HA from Babco. Cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and 10% glycerol. Cell lysates (20 Î¼l/lane) were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant Shp2âFor bacterial expression, the open reading frame of Shp2 (WT, E76A, or C459S, respectively) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). Escherichia coli cells transformed with pGEX-Shp2 WT, E76A, or C459S were grown overnight to saturation in 10 ml of LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown in 3 liters of LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin at 37 Â°C to reach A600 = 0.6. One hour after the temperature shift to 25 Â°C, isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cells were cultured for 12 h. Purification of glutathione S-transferase-Shp2 WT, E76A, or C459S was performed by the method described previously (29Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Luciferase AssayâCells were treated for 15â24 h with or without 25 ng/ml bFGF, and the luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured by using a luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. Relative luciferase activities were normalized by co-expressed Î²-galactosidase activities. Neurite OutgrowthâPC12 cells possessing one or more neurites of a length of more than 1.5-fold the diameter of the cell body were scored as positive. More than 200 cells were scored in each point and the averages from three independent experiments are shown. Shp2 Promotes Tyrosine Dephosphorylation of Spry in VivoâTo test the hypothesis that Spry is a possible target of Shp2, we first determined the effect of Shp2 on tyrosine phosphorylation of mouse Spry2 (mSpry2). As Shp2 is normally inactive because of auto-inhibition by its N-terminal SH2 domain (30Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), we used a constitutively active mutant of Shp2 (Shp2 E76A), in which Glu-76 was replaced by Ala. C2C12 cells were co-transfected with FGFR, Myc-mSpry2, and increasing amounts of wild-type HA-Shp2 (Shp2 WT) or HA-Shp2 E76A. After 24h, the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-pTyr antibody to detect tyrosine phosphorylation levels in the mSpry2 protein. As reported previously (27Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Bio. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), mSpry2 was tyrosine phosphorylated in an FGFR-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Co-expression of Shp2 WT resulted in reduced FGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of mSpry2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). Co-expression of Shp2 E76A also decreased the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation on mSpry2 drastically (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Next, we tested the effect of Shp2 on Xenopus Spry1 (xSpry1). Similarly to mSpry2, expression of FGFR induced tyrosine phosphorylation on xSpry1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Co-expression of Shp2 WT resulted in reduced FGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of xSpry1 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, co-expression of Shp2 E76A decreased the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation on xSpry1 efficiently (lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these results suggest that Shp2 promotes the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine in Spry1/2 in vivo. Shp2 Dephosphorylates Spry in VitroâWe examined whether Shp2 dephosphorylates Spry directly in vitro. C2C12 cells were co-transfected with Myc-xSpry1 and FGFR. Myc-xSpry1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and incubated with purified recombinant Shp2 WT, Shp2 E76A, or catalytically inactive Shp2 C459S as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, Shp2 E76A, but not Shp2 WT or Shp2 C459S, dephosphorylated xSpry1 tyrosine in a time-dependent manner. This tyrosine dephosphorylation could be inhibited in the presence of sodium vanadate, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases. Essentially identical results were obtained with mSpry2 (data not shown). These results suggest that Spry is a possible direct target for Shp2. Shp2 Induces Dissociation of Spry from Grb2âWe have previously shown that Spry binds to Grb2 in response to FGF stimulation, resulting in the inhibition of Grb2-Sos complex recruitment to FRS2 or Shp2, upstream signaling molecules in the FGF signaling pathway (27Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Bio. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). As the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated Spry to Grb2 is a critical step in the inhibition of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway by Spry, we examined the effect of Shp2 on the association between Spry and Grb2. C2C12 cells were co-transfected with the indicated combinations of Myc-mSpry2, Shp2 WT, Shp2 E76A, and FGFR and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to the immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody to detect associated mSpry2. As shown in Fig. 3A, whereas co-expression of Shp2 WT had little effect on the binding of mSpry2 to Grb2 in response to FGFR, Shp2 E76A caused a dose-dependent decrease in the FGFR-induced association between mSpry2 and Grb2. The association between xSpry1 and Grb2 was also decreased by expression of Shp2 E76A (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Shp2 induces dissociation of Spry from Grb2 following their association in response to FGFR signaling. Shp2 Suppresses the Inhibition of FGF Signaling by SpryâWe examined the ability of Shp2 to suppress Spry-mediated inhibition of FGF signaling, using a reporter assay that measures the transcription activity of Elk1, a nuclear target of ERK MAP kinase (31Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 32Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were transfected with Gal4-Elk1 and Gal4-E1b-luciferase reporter. After the activation of ERK, the chimeric Gal4-Elk1 transcription factor is phosphorylated and thereby activated. This factor binds to the Gal4 upstream activating sequence, resulting in the induction of luciferase expression (32Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). ERK activation can occur downstream of the FGF signaling pathway. Treatment of cells with FGF resulted in induction of the reporter (Fig. 4). However, expression of xSpry1 or mSpry2 inhibited induction by FGF. Spry-mediated inhibition of FGF signaling was partially relieved by co-expression of Shp2 E76A but not by Shp2 WT. Taken together, these results suggest that Shp2 acts as a positive regulator in the FGF signaling pathway by dephosphorylating and inactivating the inhibitor Spry. Shp2 and Spry Function Together to Control the Duration of MAP Kinase ActivationâBecause Spry controls the duration of MAP kinase activation in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (27Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Bio. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Shp2 on the kinetics of MAP kinase activation in response to FGF stimulation. In C2C12 cells, activation of MAP kinase was detected at 5 min and was maximal at 10 min after FGF stimulation. After this, the activation of MAP kinase decreased gradually (Fig. 5, A and B). When xSpry1 was expressed in cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of xSpry1 peaked at 15 min after FGF treatment, and the activity of MAP kinase consequently decreased at 15â30 min after treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). Co-expression of Shp2 E76A caused a drastic decrease in FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation levels in xSpry1. As a result, activation of MAP kinase persisted for as long as that seen in the absence of xSpry1 expression (Fig. 5, A and B). Expression of catalytically inactive Shp2 C459S failed to block the inhibitory activity of xSpry1 on MAP kinase activation, and indeed was seen to potentiate it slightly (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, Shp2 is able to counteract the inhibitory effect of xSpry1 on MAP kinase activation. In PC12 cells, FGF treatment induces neurite outgrowth by means of the activation of MAP kinase (6Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of Shp2 and xSpry1 on neurite outgrowth in response to FGF stimulation (Fig. 6). As observed previously, expression of xSpry1 blocked neurite outgrowth induced by FGF stimulation in PC12 cells. Co-expression of Shp2 E76A, but not of Shp2 C459S, reversed the inhibitory effect of xSpry1 on neurite outgrowth in response to FGF stimulation. These results are consistent with those obtained above with respect to the effects of Shp2 and xSpry1 on FGF-mediated MAP kinase activation. The present studies suggest a mechanism underlying the requirement of Shp2 PTPase activity in MAP kinase activation. Recently, it was reported that the recruitment of Shp2 PTPase to the membrane is required for its stimulation of MAP kinase activation (26Cunnick J.M. Meng S. Ren Y. Desponts C. Wang H.-G. Djeu J.Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9498-9504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In response to growth factor stimulation, Spry translocates to the plasma membrane, where it binds to Grb2 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, resulting in the inhibition of the recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to FRS2 or Shp2. Thus, Shp2 has a positive role in MAP kinase activation by dephosphorylating Spry at the plasma membrane and inactivating the inhibitory activity of Spry. These findings also suggest that the co-operation between Shp2 and Spry controls the duration of MAP kinase activation, which is crucial to determining cell fate. We thank M. Kusakabe, T. Harada, and S. Nishimoto for their technical assistance and helpful discussion."

https://openalex.org/W2130804465,"Hypertension is frequently associated with the development of renal vascular and glomerular fibrosis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation participates in the development of renal fibrosis and to test if blockade of EGFR activation would have therapeutic effects. Experiments were performed during nitric oxide (NO) deficiency-induced hypertension in rats (L-NAME model). After 4 weeks of L-NAME treatment, animals developed hypertension associated to deterioration of renal structure and function. Over the same period, EGFR was activated twofold within glomeruli. This activation was accompanied by increased activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p42/p44 pathway and exaggerated collagen I expression. Gefitinib, an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, given concomitantly with L-NAME, normalized MAPK activation and collagen I expression and prevented the decline of renal function and the development of fibrosis. Since endothelin mediates the L-NAME-induced fibrogenesis, the endothelin-EGFR interaction was tested in transgenic mice expressing luciferase under the control of collagen I-alpha2 promoter: In renal cortex of these animals, the endothelin-induced collagen I gene activity was inhibited by an EGFR-phosphorylation inhibitor. These results provide the first evidence that EGFR activation plays an important role in the progression of renal vascular and glomerular fibrosis."

The absence of GGA motifs in RsmY mutants resulted in reduced abundance of these transcripts and in a shorter half-life (â¤6 min as compared with 27 min for wild type RsmY).

https://openalex.org/W2157313515,"It is clear that pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, including basal hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin release in response to glucose, is a key determinant of disease progression in type 2 diabetes, but the underlying molecular defects are not known. In diabetes, the expression and function of ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channels are reduced. The present studies were undertaken to define the subcellular location and role of RyR in the control of stimulated and basal insulin release from human pancreatic beta cells. Using confocal microscopy, we observed RyR immunoreactivity in a vesicular pattern. RyRs did not colocalize with insulin secretory granules but partially colocalized with endosomes. Direct activation with nanomolar concentrations of ryanodine evoked increases in cytosolic Ca2+ that were coupled to transient insulin release. Insulin release stimulated by 1 nM ryanodine was sensitive to BAPTA-AM preincubation but independent of thapsigargin-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pools. Blocking RyRs with micromolar concentrations of ryanodine led to BAPTA-resistant insulin release that was not associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, which implicated alterations in luminal Ca2+. However, neither Ca2+ signals nor insulin release stimulated by glucose was blocked by 10-50 microM ryanodine, which suggests that the CD38/cyclic ADP-ribose/RyR pathway is not a primary mechanism of glucose action in nontransformed beta cells. We provide the first evidence that RyRs directly control insulin secretion in primary beta cells. Unexpectedly, stimulation of insulin secretion by ryanodine occurs independently of glucose and by two mechanisms, including a novel cytosolic Ca2+-independent mechanism likely involving changes in Ca2+ within the lumens of non-ER organelles, such as endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1983374059,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is proteolytically processed to release a C-terminal domain that signals to the nucleus to regulate transcription of responsive genes. The APP C terminus binds to a number of phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain proteins and one of these, Fe65, stimulates APP nuclear signaling. Fe65 is an adaptor protein that contains a number of protein-protein interaction domains. These include two PTB domains, the second of which binds APP, and a WW domain that binds proline-rich ligands. One ligand for the Fe65WW domain is the tyrosine kinase c-Abl. Here, we show that active c-Abl stimulates APP/Fe65-mediated gene transcription and that this effect is mediated by phosphorylation of Fe65 on tyrosine 547 within its second PTB domain. The homologous tyrosine within the motif Tyr-(Leu/Met)-Gly is conserved in a variety of PTB domains, and this suggests that PTB tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in other proteins. As such, PTB domain phosphorylation may represent a novel mechanism for regulating the function of this class of protein."
https://openalex.org/W2071015951,"It has been well documented that protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in regulation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity. Although PKC regulation of PLD1 activity has been studied extensively, the role of PKC in PLD2 regulation remains to be established. In the present study it was demonstrated that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced PLD2 activation in COS-7 cells. PLD2 was also phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues after PMA treatment. PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 and bisindolylmaleimide I inhibited both PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation and activation.

Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PA is an important âsecond messengerâ in several physiological processes (2Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PA can be further metabolized to diacylglycerol by PA phosphohydrolase or to lysophosphatidic acid by phospholipase A2. Diacylglycerol is a well known activator of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas lysophosphatidic acid mediates many important physiological functions via its G protein-coupled receptors (3Takuwa Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, PLD influences many important intracellular events via producing these downstream products. PLD activity is regulated by many stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other molecules involved in extracellular communication (1Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLD is thought to play an important role in secretion, membrane trafficking, cytoskeleton reorganization, and apoptosis (1Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Although the regulation of PLD1 by PKC is universally accepted, it is controversial on whether or not PLD2 is also regulated by PKC. The initial report showed that PLD2 was largely refractory to PKC activation in vitro and in vivo (11Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). However, recent reports demonstrate that PMA can activate PLD2 in vivo, suggesting the possible regulation of PLD2 activity by PKC (19Siddiqi A.R. Srajer G.E. Leslie C.C. Biochim. Biophys.

A protein-protein interaction rather than phosphorylation has been proposed as the main mechanism for PKCÎ± to activate PLD1 (26Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2348-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Compared with PLD1, only one group has explored the phosphorylation of PLD2 by PKC and its effect on activity (22Han J.M. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Lee S.D. Kim Y. Jung Y.W. Lee S. Cho W. Ohba M. Kuroki T.

This group reported that PKCÎ´ is involved in PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation and activation in PC12 cells (22Han J.M. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Lee S.D. Kim Y. Jung Y.W. Lee S. Cho W. Ohba M. Kuroki T.

Kanaho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of phosphorylation in the activation of PLD2 by PKC requires further work.We report in the present study that PMA induces PLD2 activation via the involvement of PKCÎ± and that PLD2 becomes phosphorylated on both Ser and Thr residues. In addition, we demonstrate PKCÎ± and PLD2 interact in vivo and that the phosphorylation is not required for the activation of PLD2. Evidence is presented that phosphorylation more likely contributes to deactivation of PLD2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsâ4Î²-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, bovine serum albumin, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma.

Human recombinant PKCÎ± was from Panvera.Cell Culture and TransfectionâCOS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in humidified 10% CO2. Six-well plates were seeded with 2 Ã 105 cells per well, and 10-cm dishes were seeded with 8 Ã 105 cells and transfected with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions.In Vivo PLD AssayâAfter a 6-h transfection with FuGENE 6, COS-7 cells in 6-well plates were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 1 Î¼Ci/ml [3H]myristic acid). After overnight starvation, PLD activity was assayed as described (28Xie Z. Kim H.K. Exton J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated in 0.3% 1-butanol and then treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and stopped with methanol. Lipids were extracted, and the PtdBut product was resolved by thin layer chromatography. Bands co-migrating with a PtdBut standard were scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting.Subcellular FractionationâCOS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were harvested after transfection with PLD2 constructs and starved overnight as described above. After treatment with the appropriate reagents the cells were washed and harvested with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 500 Î¼l of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). After two bursts (10 s) of sonication, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 Ã g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 120,000 Ã g for 45 min at 4 Â°C to separate the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. The particulate fraction was washed twice with the lysis buffer and resuspended in the same buffer by passing through a 27-gauge needle until the pellet was resuspended.In Vitro PLD AssayâThe PLD activity was measured by the formation of [3H]PtdBut in vitro as described previously (28Xie Z. Kim H.K. Exton J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) with modifications. The composition of phospholipid vesicles (11.5 Î¼m PC, 2 Î¼m phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and 97.75 Î¼m phosphatidylethanolamine) was optimized for PLD2 activity. [Palmitoyl-3H]PC (0.5 Î¼Ci/reaction) was used with 1-butanol (0.3%) as substrate. Where applicable, 100 Î¼m ATP, 200 ng of PKCÎ± (PanVera), or 500 nm PMA was also included in the reaction system. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 Â°C for 30 min and stopped with chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:98:2, v/v). The lipids were extracted from the organic phase and resolved by thin-layer chromatography. Bands co-migrating with a PtdBut standard were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting.Western BlottingâProtein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). The blots were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (1 mg/ml) (1:5000) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).Immunoprecipitationâ COS-7 cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were transfected and starved as described above. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in 600 Î¼l of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KC1, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1.2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors mixture. The cell suspension was then sonicated for 2 Ã 5 s, and the resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 120,000 Ã g for 30 min to remove the detergent-insoluble fraction. The supernatant was then precleared by mixing it with 1 Î¼g of affinity-purified mouse IgG and 20 Î¼l of 1:1 slurry of protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The mixture was then spun, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 Î¼l of anti-Xpress mouse antibody (1 mg/ml) and 20 Î¼l of protein G-agarose beads overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.In Vitro Phosphorylation of PLD2 by PKCÎ±âImmunoprecipitated PLD2 from PLD2-overexpressing COS-7 cells was washed with phosphorylation buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) four times and resuspended in the phosphorylation buffer. Aliquots of beads containing immunoprecipitated PLD2 were then mixed with 0.12 mm ATP, 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, 100 ng of PKCÎ±, and 100 nm PMA. The mixture was incubated at 30 Â°C for 30 min and then electrophoresed through an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was exposed to a photographic film for autoradiography.RESULTSPMA Activates PLD2 ActivityâAs seen in Fig. 1, the transphosphatidylation product of PLD action, PtdBut, increased as early as 1 min after PMA treatment of COS-7 cells and accumulated in a time-dependent manner. PtdBut levels reached a maximum at around 15 min after PMA treatment. The data indicated that PLD2 was rapidly activated by PMA and that the activity of PLD2 (formation of PtdBut) dropped to the basal level after 15 min, indicating a short-duration response. The data demonstrated that PLD2, like PLD1, is also activated by PMA when overexpressed in COS-7 cells.PKC Mediates PMA-induced PLD2 ActivationâBecause it is well established that PMA activates conventional and novel PKC isozymes, we used PKC inhibitors to explore the involvement of PKC in the PLD2 activation. Fig. 2 shows the effects of the PKC inhibitors on both basal and PMA-stimulated PLD activity in vector- and PLD2-transfected COS-7 cells. As a control, the effects of the PKC inhibitors on PLD1 activity were also examined. General PKC inhibitors such as Ro-31-8220 and bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis) showed strong inhibition of PMA-induced activation of control (vector) PLD activity and of PLD1 and PLD2 activity (Fig. 2). 2In the absence of PMA, Ro-31-8220 induced some activation of PLD1 and PLD2. This probably relates to its ability to activate PKCÎ± as shown by the membrane translocation of this PKC isozyme (data not shown). However, the conventional PKC inhibitor GoÌ 6976 showed much less inhibition of PMA-induced PLD1 and PLD2 activation. Rottlerin, a PKCÎ´-specific PKC inhibitor, showed marked inhibition of the basal activity of both PLD1 and PLD2 but no inhibition of the effect of PMA itself. These data indicate that PKC is involved in PMA-induced activation of both PLD1 and PLD2.Fig. 2Effect of PKC inhibitors on basal or PMA-stimulated PLD activity in vector-, PLD1-, or PLD2-transfected COS-7 cells. Vector, rPLD1, or rPLD2 was overexpressed in COS-7 cells. Cells were preincubated with 5 Î¼m Ro-31-8220, 5 Î¼m Bis, 0.5 Î¼m GoÌ 6976, 15 Î¼m rottlerin, or vehicle (Me2SO) for 20 min, respectively. Then the cells were treated with vehicle or 100 nm PMA for 30 min in the presence of 0.3% 1-butanol. PLD activity was measured as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Mean Â± S.E. values from at least five experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PLD2 Undergoes Serine and Threonine Phosphorylation after PMA TreatmentâThe possible Ser/Thr phosphorylation of PLD2 after PMA treatment was examined using anti-phospho-Ser and anti-phospho-Thr antibodies. As indicated in Fig. 3A, PLD2 was basally phosphorylated on Thr but not on Ser residues. Upon PMA treatment, PLD2 became phosphorylated on Ser and Thr in a time-dependent manner. However, the phosphorylation on Ser became detectable only after 5 min of PMA treatment. The increase of phosphorylation was further demonstrated by the slower migration of PLD2 on the gel upon PMA treatment for longer times, as indicated by the Western blotting with Xpress antibodies in Fig. 3A.Fig. 3PMA induces PLD2 phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues. COS-7 cells were transfected with rPLD2 and then treated with 100 nm PMA for the indicated times (Fig. 3A) or pretreated with PKC inhibitors (5 Î¼m Ro-31-8220, 5 Î¼m Bis, 0.5 Î¼m GoÌ 6976, and 15 Î¼m rottlerin, respectively) for 20 min before being treated with or without 100 nm PMA for another 20 min (Fig. 3B). Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blotting (IB) were conducted as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. p-, phospho-.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, the effect of the PKC inhibitors on PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation was determined. As indicated in Fig. 3B, Ro-31-8220 and Bis completely inhibited the phosphorylation induced on both residues by treatment with PMA. GoÌ 6976 also showed a significant inhibition, whereas rottlerin had no effect at all. These data demonstrate that PKC, possibly the conventional isoforms rather than PKCÎ´, are involved in the phosphorylation of PLD2 induced by PMA.PKCÎ± Mediates PMA-induced PLD2 PhosphorylationâTo obtain further information about which PKC isoform mediates the phosphorylation, the expression of different PKC isoforms in COS-7 cells was examined by Western blotting. Fig. 4A shows that PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´, PKCÏµ, PKCÎ¹, and PKCÎ¶ were detected, whereas PKCÎ², PKCÎ³, PKCÎ·, and PKCÎ¸ were not even though the antibodies were shown to be effective (data not shown). Among the isoforms, PKCÎ± showed a complete translocation from cytosol to membrane fractions after PMA treatment. In sharp contrast to PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´ and PKCÏµ were located mainly in the membrane fraction and showed little or no translocation when stimulated. These data imply that PKCÎ± is more likely than other PKC isoforms to be involved in PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation.Fig. 4PKCÎ± is responsible for the phosphorylation.A, COS-7 cells were treated with or without 100 nm PMA for 15 min, and subcellular fractionation was conducted as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ to obtain the membrane (M) and cytosol (C) fractions. Total lysate was also prepared. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting with antibodies to specific PKC isoforms. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with PLD2 alone or co-transfected with PLD2 plus increasing quantities of cDNAs for PKCÎ± or PKCÎ´ as indicated. After starving overnight, the cells were treated with or without 100 nm PMA as indicated for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blotting (IB) were conducted as described under âExperimental Procedures.â p-, phospho-. C, COS-7 cells were transfected with Xpress vector, Xpress-tagged PLD1, or Xpress-tagged PLD2. Then the Xpress immunoprecipitates were collected, and the in vitro phosphorylation assays were conducted as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Upper panel, radioactivity exposure. Lower panel, protein levels determined by Western blotting. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further explore this issue, PKCÎ± or PKCÎ´ was overexpressed together with PLD2 in COS-7 cells, and PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation was examined. As shown in Fig. 4B, co-expression of PKCÎ± greatly enhanced PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation on both Ser and Thr residues. In contrast, co-expression of PKCÎ´ had minimal effect. The lower panel of Fig. 4B shows that PKCÎ± and PKCÎ´ were well expressed. The data provide further support that PKCÎ±, rather than PKCÎ´, is involved in PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation. To test if PKCÎ± can directly phosphorylate PLD2, in vitro phosphorylation of PLD2 by PKCÎ± was conducted. As shown in Fig. 4C, both PLD1 and PLD2 were phosphorylated by PKCÎ± in the presence of PMA, although the phosphorylation of PLD1 was greater.Phosphorylation Is Not Required for PLD2 Activation by PKCÎ±âThe requirement of phosphorylation for PLD2 activation by PMA is next explored. First, the dose response of PMA on PLD2 phosphorylation was compared with that for PMA on PLD2 activation. Fig. 5A shows that PMA induced PLD2 phosphorylation by a dose-dependent manner. The phosphorylation was detectable at a PMA concentration of 2.5 nm and higher. Fig. 5B shows the dose dependence for PMA activation of PLD2. In contrast to the phosphorylation pattern, activation was evident at PMA concentrations as low as 0.5 nm and was maximal at 5 nm. The difference between these two patterns indicates that activation of PLD2 is not dependent on its phosphorylation.Fig. 5The dose responses of PMA on PLD2 phosphorylation and activation.A, PLD2-transfected COS-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of PMA for 15 min as indicated. The phosphorylation status of PLD2 was determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.â IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, Western blotting. p-, phospho-. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with vector or PLD2 and the in vivo PLD activity after treatment with different concentrations of PMA for 15 min was determined as described. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further confirm that phosphorylation is not required for PKCÎ±-mediated PLD2 activation, a kinase-dead mutant of PKCÎ± (KN-PKCÎ±) was tested for its effect on the activation of PLD2. As shown in Fig. 6A, wild type PKCÎ± enhanced PLD2 activity when co-transfected with PLD2 in COS-7 cells. Surprisingly, the kinase-dead PKCÎ± mutant displayed an even stronger stimulation than wild type PKCÎ± on basal and PLD2 activity. As a control, PKCÎ´ and PKCÏµ were also co-expressed with PLD2 and showed no significant stimulation, showing the specificity for PKCÎ± activation of PLD2. Fig. 6B confirms that, although wild type PKCÎ± enhanced both basal and PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation, the kinase-dead mutant was unable to phosphorylate PLD2. Fig. 6C further shows that in contrast to wild type, kinase-dead PKCÎ± does not exhibit autophosphorylation after PMA tr"
https://openalex.org/W2034769702,"APS (adapter protein with Pleckstrin homology and Src homology 2 domains) is recruited by the autophosphorylated insulin receptor and is essential for Glut4 translocation. Although both APS and CAP (c-Cbl-associated protein) interact with c-Cbl during insulin signaling, the relative importance of each protein in recruiting c-Cbl has not been clear. We performed a side-by-side comparison by ectopic expression of APS or Src homology 2-BÎ± (SH2-BÎ±) and CAP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In cells co-expressing insulin receptor and CAP, without APS, no association of the insulin receptor and CAP could be detected and no insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Cbl was observed. Insulin-stimulated Cbl phosphorylation was reconstituted when APS was co-expressed with insulin receptor, with or without CAP. APS or SH2-BÎ± and CAP interacted in the basal state, and in the case of APS this interaction was mediated by the C terminus of APS. Insulin stimulation resulted in the dissociation of APS and CAP. Similarly, insulin stimulation also resulted in the dissociation of SH2-BÎ± and CAP in CHO cells. CAP was localized to the membrane in the presence of APS. Insulin stimulation resulted in the re-localization of CAP to the cytosol only when APS was co-expressed. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the mouse APS gene abolished the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Taken together, these results indicate that APS plays a central role in recruiting both CAP and c-Cbl to the insulin receptor after insulin stimulation and is necessary and sufficient for the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Cbl, whereas SH2-BÎ± may provide an alternative pathway for the recruitment of CAP.

Insulin increases glucose transport into target tissues by promoting the exocytosis of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (1Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has emerged that there are two pathways required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport, namely an insulin receptor substrate/PI 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PH, pleckstrin homology; SH, Src homology; APS, adapter protein with a PH and SH2 domain; CAP, c-Cbl associated protein (ponsin); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PH, pleckstrin homology; SH, Src homology; APS, adapter protein with a PH and SH2 domain; CAP, c-Cbl associated protein (ponsin); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3-kinase pathway and a PI 3-kinase independent pathway involving the c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP) and the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl (2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although c-Cbl was thought to be recruited by CAP, it has also emerged that APS (adapter protein with a PH and SH2 domain), a member of a larger adapter protein family, can also recruit c-Cbl following insulin-stimulation (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Following the binding of insulin, the insulin receptor undergoes autophosphorylation in the activation loop of the kinase domain. This provides docking sites for the binding of several proteins, including SH2-B and the APS adapter protein (5Kotani K. Wilden P. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Kotani K. Wilden P. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Moodie S.A. Alleman-Sposeto J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Trans. 2001; 29: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The resulting recruitment of the APS adapter protein to the kinase domain allows it to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr-618 (7Moodie S.A. Alleman-Sposeto J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11186-11193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Tyr-618 then allows APS to bind to the variant SH2 domain of c-Cbl (8Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is followed by the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl on tyrosines 700 and 774, resulting in phosphorylated c-Cbl binding to the SH2 domain of Crk (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is also thought that the adapter protein CAP could facilitate interaction with the insulin receptor, because CAP was also identified as a c-Cbl binding protein using c-Cbl as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and was shown to interact with the insulin receptor in intact cells (10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CAP contains an N-terminal region homologous to Sorbin (Sorbin homology/SOHO domain) and three SH3 domains in the C terminus (10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CAP is constitutively bound to a proline-rich region in Cbl through its C-terminal SH3 domain (11Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of new splice variants of CAP have been described (12Zhang M. Kimura A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 18-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Cbl, the CAP/Cbl complex migrates to the caveolin-rich lipid rafts, a movement facilitated by the interaction of the CAP SOHO domain with flotillin, a protein in lipid rafts (13Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This allows the Crk/C3G complex to be recruited to this microdomain, where C3G activates the small G protein TC10 (14Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The activation of TC10 occurs independently of PI 3-kinase and is crucial for insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation (2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Since APS and CAP both interact with c-Cbl (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the relative individual importance and the temporal sequence of these proteins in recruiting c-Cbl has not been clear. In this study, we sought to determine whether both proteins were required to recruit c-Cbl to the insulin receptor or whether they were mutually exclusive. We addressed this question by co-expression of APS and CAP in cells that do not express these proteins and by silencing of the mouse APS gene. Here we provide evidence that APS is the key protein recruiting both CAP and c-Cbl to the receptor and that insulin regulates the association of CAP with APS by promoting its dissociation. Furthermore, we also find that SH2-BÎ± interacts constitutively with CAP and dissociates following insulin stimulation. MaterialsâAnti-FLAG M2-horseradish peroxidase antibody and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-CAP, anti-GLUT4, anti-actin, anti-insulin receptor, and anti-Cbl antibodies specific for c-Cbl (C-15) and Cbl-b (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-PhosphoCbl 774 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology/NEB. siRNA duplexes (Smartpool) targeting human c-Cbl and Cbl-b were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents and CHO.T cells and CHO.T APS cells were as described previously (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged mouse CAP1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Alan Saltiel (University of Michigan) and subcloned into pIRES puro (Clontech). CHO.T cells, CHO.T-APS, and CHO.T-SH2-B cells were transfected with FLAG-CAP using FuGENE 6. 48 h later, puromycin was added to the medium, and the cells were left for 10 days. Surviving clones were isolated by limiting dilution, and expression of CAP was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. Deletions of the rat APS were generated by restriction enzyme digestion. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. Subcellular FractionationâSerum-starved cells were stimulated with insulin as indicated in the legends to Figs. 3 and 5, 6, 7, and the cells were lysed as described previously (15Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lysis buffer was added, and the cells were scraped and placed on ice for 10 min. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was then used for whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitation.Fig. 5Insulin stimulates the redistribution of CAP only in the presence of APS. CHO.T-CAP cells and CHO.T-APS-CAP cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with insulin. The cells were then fixed, and CAP or APS were visualized by staining with anti-FLAG antibody and anti-Myc 9E10, respectively, followed by secondary antibody as described (red for FLAG and green for Myc). The antibodies were then visualized by confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Redistribution of CAP from the insoluble fraction in response to insulin. CHO.T-CAP cells and CHO.T-APS cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with insulin. The cells were then lysed, and the whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies or anti-vinculin to compare protein loading. The pellet from the initial 10,000 Ã g centrifugation was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then subjected to Western blotting.

A, CHO.T-APS-CAP cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with insulin. APS was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibodies, and then the immunoprecipates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase to detect bound CAP. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-Myc antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence. B, CHO.T-SH2-BÎ±-CAP cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with insulin. CAP was immunoprecipitated using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and then the immunoprecipates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody to detect bound SH2B (upper panel). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with antiFLAG M2 antibody (lower panel) and visualized by chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The remaining pellet was resuspended in 100 Î¼l of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), vortexed, placed on ice, and sonicated for 15 s. The sonicated lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatants were mixed with 70 Î¼l of 2Ã Laemmli buffer and heated for 5 min at 100 Â°C. This detergent-insoluble fraction is referred to as the pellet in the Fig. 6 legend. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal MicroscopyâThe protocol for immunofluorescent staining was as described (16Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on 19-mm coverslips for 48 h and, at semiconfluence, they were serum-starved or stimulated with insulin. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS to remove the medium. Immediately thereafter, 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS was added, followed by 20 min of incubation at room temperature. Then, the paraformaldehyde was aspirated, PBS was added for 10 min, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following a brief wash with PBS, the samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and PBS at room temperature for 15 min, and primary antibodies (rabbit anti-APS or goat anti-CAP) were added in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were washed three times over a 5-min period with PBS at room temperature, and secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-APS Alexa-Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (green) and/or goat anti-CAP Alexa-Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat IgG 2 mg/ml (red)) were added in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After the secondary antibody incubation, the cells were washed three times over a 5-min period with PBS at room temperature, mounted into glass slides using 50% glycerol, and processed for viewing using an inverted Zeiss Axiophot microscope attached to a laser illumination unit. Assays for Glucose Uptake and GLUT4 TranslocationâThe insulin-stimulated uptake of glucose was measured by the uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose as described (17Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Plasma membrane lawns for the analysis of GLUT4 translocation were prepared as described (17Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and probed using goat polyclonal GLUT4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Alexa-Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat IgG prior to visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Yeast Two-hybrid AnalysisâFor yeast two-hybrid analysis, we used the LexA system as described previously (6Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Kotani K. Wilden P. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IR was expressed as a fusion to LexA. The mouse CAP cDNA was subcloned into the vector GADT7 (Clontech). Transient Transfection and ImmunoprecipitationsâWild type and mutant APS constructs were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody coupled to agarose in the case of APS or the anti-FLAG antibody coupled to agarose. Gene Silencing of the Mouse APS GeneâGene silencing was performed using the pSuperRetro plasmid purchased from Oligoengine, Seattle, WA. In brief, a duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to the mouse APS gene was subcloned into pSuperRetro that had been digested with BglII and HindIII. As a control, a scrambled duplex oligonucleotide, in which the corresponding sequence (5â²-ACGTCGTAGCACACTACG-3â²) replaced those of APS, was synthesized and subcloned as described above. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into Phoenix packaging cells using FuGENE 6, and 48 h after transfection the cell culture medium was filtered with a 0.2 m filter and used to infect 3T3-L1 fibroblasts after the addition of 4 mg/ml polybrene. Infected cells were selected with puromycin (10 mg/ml), and clones were isolated by limiting dilution and then differentiated and screened for the expression of APS. Transient knockdowns using synthetic siRNA for human c-Cbl and Cbl-b (Smartpool siRNA, Dharmacon, Inc) at a concentration of 100 nm were performed as described (18Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) in a cultured human adipocyte cell line (19Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Moller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The sequences for the siRNA used are as follows: c-Cbl (5â²-GGAGACACATTTCGGATTA; 5â²-GATCTGACCTGCAATGATT-3â²; 5â²-GACAATCCCTCACAATAAA-3â²; 5â²-CCAGAAAGCTTTGGTCATT-3â²); and Cbl-b (5â²-GACCATACCTCATAACAAG-3â²; 5â²-TGAAAGACCTCCACCAATC-3â²; 5â²-GATGAAGGCTCCAGGTGTT-3â²; 5â²-TATCAGCATTTACGACTTA-3â²). Peptide SynthesisâThe biotinylated APS phosphopeptide was synthesized by the Biopolymer Unit at the University of Nottingham Medical School by John Keyte and purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. Analysis of the Interaction between CAP and the Insulin ReceptorâSince CAP has been reported to interact with the insulin receptor, we wanted to determine the molecular basis for this interaction and define the domains that interacted by using the yeast two-hybrid system as described previously. We expressed the insulin receptor as a fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain, and CAP was fused to the GAL4 activation domain and tested in parallel with APS (Fig. 1). As has been observed previously (6Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Kotani K. Wilden P. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Moodie S.A. Alleman-Sposeto J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11186-11193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a robust interaction between the insulin receptor and APS was seen. We tested the interaction of CAP and different mutants of the insulin receptor, including a kinase-dead mutant, because CAP is thought to bind constitutively to the insulin receptor in the absence of activation. We could not detect binding of CAP to phosphorylated kinase-active, kinase-inactive, or phosphorylation-defective mutants of the insulin receptor. The expression and correct nuclear localization of these proteins was verified previously by using immunoblotting as described (6Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Kotani K. Wilden P. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interaction of CAP with the C Terminus of APSâNext, we transiently transfected wild type APS and mutant forms of APS into CHO.T cells that expressed FLAG-tagged CAP. The cells, which were unstimulated, were lysed, and CAP was precipitated with anti-FLAG. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies to insulin and anti-Myc. Fig. 2 shows that Myc-tagged APS is readily detected in the immunoprecipitates, but we could not detect the insulin receptor in the immunoprecipitates despite the high levels of co-expression and the use of high affinity antibodies to the insulin receptor. Deletion of residues 534-621 (M1) in the C terminus of APS abolished the interaction with CAP, suggesting that a prolinerich region in the C terminus of the insulin receptor interacts with the SH3 domain of CAP. Only APS, but Not CAP, Facilitates c-Cbl PhosphorylationâNext, we analyzed c-Cbl phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 3). We used an APS-derived phosphopeptide containing tyrosine 618 to precipitate c-Cbl from these cells, and this phosphopeptide was then analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. The unphosphorylated APS peptide was used as a control. We found that this reagent was much more efficient at precipitating c-Cbl than the antibodies that we used in the past (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The figure shows that co-expression of the insulin receptor and CAP did not reconstitute insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation, but the co-expression of APS resulted in robust insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation. Because this result and previously published results suggested that the recruitment of APS facilitated the movement of c-Cbl to the receptor, we next determined whether the knockdown of the APS gene in 3T3-L1 adipocytes would result in the loss of insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation (Fig. 4). We tested the hypothesis that APS is necessary for c-Cbl phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with siRNA-mediated gene silencing delivered by stably suppressing the expression of mouse APS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a retroviral system (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Using a retroviral system to generate siRNA against the APS protein resulted in an 80% decrease in the expression of APS. This was sufficient to abolish c-Cbl phosphorylation without affecting the expression of CAP or c-Cbl. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the reduction of APS expression, while leaving the expression of CAP intact, abolished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Cbl in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Concomitantly with the abolition of insulin-stimulated Cbl phosphorylation, there was a marked reduction (70%) in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation as assessed by the plasma membrane sheet assay. In a separate experiment, c-Cbl and Cbl-b were silenced using synthetic siRNA. This resulted in an â¼50% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport (Fig. 4d). However, in both instances, even though it was reduced, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was still detectable. Redistribution of CAP in Response to Insulin Occurs Only When APS Is Co-expressedâWe analyzed the subcellular localization of CAP by immunofluorescence (Fig. 5) or subcellular fractionation (Fig. 6) before and after insulin stimulation. In CHO.T CAP cells, insulin did not alter the localization of CAP, but the co-expression of APS with CAP facilitated the movement of CAP to the cytosol. In the basal state (Fig. 5), CAP was localized to the membrane when APS was co-expressed. Upon insulin stimulation, there was a redistribution of CAP to the cytosol. In contrast, in cells that only expressed CAP and insulin receptor, there was no change with insulin. Similar results were obtained by crude subcellular fractionation (Fig. 6). The cells were lysed and then separated into detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions (membrane and pellet) by centrifugation. Insulin or phorbol esters triggered the loss of CAP from the pellet fraction in CHO.T-APS-CAP cells but not in CHO.T-CAP cells. Insulin Stimulates the Dissociation of APS and CAPâWe next analyzed the effects of insulin stimulation on the association of APS and CAP (Fig. 7A). In the basal state, APS is constitutively associated with CAP as detected by immunoprecipitation, but, following insulin stimulation, there is a marked decrease in the amount of CAP bound to APS, suggesting that these proteins dissociate as a result of insulin stimulation. Interaction of SH2-B with CAP and Insulin-stimulated DissociationâBecause SH2-B is similar to APS and has broadly similar functions, we assessed the role of SH2-B using co-expression of SH2-B and CAP (Fig. 7B). Under basal conditions, SH2-B is also constitutively bound to CAP. The addition of insulin decreased the amount of SH2-B bound to CAP as detected using anti-Myc immunoblotting, indicating that the interaction of SH2-B and CAP is regulated in a manner similar to that of APS. Over the last few years, it has emerged that there are two pathways necessary for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, namely an insulin receptor substrate/PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway and a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway that requires the APS adapter protein, CAP, and c-Cbl (2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Cbl and b-Cbl in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but not in undifferentiated fibroblasts or CHO.T cells expressing high levels of insulin receptor, indicating that an adipocyte-specific accessory protein is required for this to occur (21Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two such adipocyte-specific proteins were identified previously. First, CAP was identified as a c-Cbl-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adipocyte-library by using Cbl as bait and it was proposed to be the protein that recruits c-Cbl (10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, we and others subsequently found that APS coupled the insulin receptor to Cbl in a ligand-dependent manner (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, both APS and CAP appeared to facilitate the recruitment of c-Cbl to the insulin receptor via distinct mechanisms. APS is also expressed specifically in adipocytes and appears to provide the mechanism for the ligand-dependent recruitment of c-Cbl. We embarked on this study to understand the molecular basis of the interaction of CAP with the insulin receptor and to determine the relative roles of the two proteins, APS and CAP, in recruiting c-Cbl. This was achieved by using a relatively simple strategy. First, we attempted to delineate interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using both kinase-active and kinase-defective mutants, no interaction of CAP with the insulin receptor could be detected. The absence of these proteins in CHO cells allows a fortuitous opportunity to dissect the events involved. APS and CAP were ectopically expressed in CHO.T cells that do not express these proteins. As has been described previously (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), CAP was constitutively bound to APS under basal conditions, but we could not detect any interaction between the insulin receptor and CAP under conditions of overexpression and detection with high affinity antibodies. Interestingly, we found that deletion of the C terminus of APS abolished the interaction of CAP with APS, indicating that the C terminus contains the important interacting motifs. CAP interacts with c-Cbl through an SH3 domain-mediated interaction through the C-terminal SH3 domain (10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, CAP can also interact with APS through the C-terminal SH3 domain (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interaction of APS and c-Cbl is phosphorylation-dependent and occurs following the binding of the variant SH2 domain of c-Cbl to the phosphorylated Tyr-618 of APS (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CAP is thought to be constitutively bound to the insulin receptor and dissociates from the receptor following insulin stimulation (10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We used these cells to analyze the phosphorylation of c-Cbl. We had shown previously that the ectopic expression of APS to CHO.T cells expressing the insulin receptor was sufficient to reconstitute the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Cbl (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether similar results could be obtained if CAP was co-expressed with the insulin receptor in the absence and presence of APS. Consistent with the data obtained previously by us and others (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we could not reconstitute or increase the phosphorylation of c-Cbl by simple over-expression of CAP, but we could easily detect it if APS was co-expressed, with or without CAP. The next strategy we used was to determine whether the silencing of the mouse APS gene would be sufficient to abolish insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Expression of the mouse APS gene was reduced by 80% using siRNA, and this resulted in the loss of insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation and a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation, indicating that the APS protein was essential for this event. However, even though it was impaired, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was still detectable. In the basal state, there is a significant amount of APS localized to the plasma membrane. In addition CAP appears to be localized to the membrane and, following insulin stimulation, adopts a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. This relocalization from the plasma membrane only occurs when APS is co-expressed. Interestingly, insulin stimulation resulted in the dissociation of CAP from APS after several minutes. However, a previous study (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) did not find evidence for an insulin-stimulated dissociation. The reason for that finding is not obvious, but it may be a result of time course differences. The interaction of APS with CAP appears to be mediated by the C terminus of APS, because deletion of the C terminus abolished the interaction of APS with CAP. The dissociation of APS from CAP may explain why an apparent dissociation of CAP from the insulin receptor may be observed following insulin stimulation (10Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). APS binds with high affinity to the insulin receptor and probably remains bound for some time after CAP and c-Cbl have translocated to a distinct compartment away from the receptor to initiate the events leading to GLUT4 translocation. The C-terminal SH3 domain of CAP has been shown to bind to APS. To determine which part of APS interacted with CAP, deletions were engineered in APS, and the mutants were transfected into CHO.T CAP cells. We found that removal of the C terminus of APS abolished the interaction of APS with CAP. Examination of the sequence of APS revealed four proline-rich regions in APS, of which three are contained in the C terminus. Because the C-terminal SH3 domain is utilized by both APS and CAP, it is not likely that CAP bridges a ternary complex, and, in fact, such a scenario is probably unnecessary, because the mechanisms for the recruitment of CAP and Cbl appear to be distinct. Thus, it is likely that APS directs the formation of this ternary complex to the insulin receptor. This idea is supported by the immunofluorescence results showing that CAP will translocate in cells only when APS is co-expressed, suggesting that APS is required to direct the movement of CAP between different compartments, at least in the initial proximal signaling events. Interestingly, a CAP mutant deficient in the lipid raft association inhibits the phosphorylation of c-Cbl, presumably by mistargeting c-Cbl or APS (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). There is also a pool of CAP proteins that would be constitutively bound to c-Cbl and would be recruited indirectly by being transported by c-Cbl when c-Cbl binds to phosphorylated APS. The importance of this second pool is not clear and will have to be addressed using mutants of APS that are defective in recruiting c-Cbl. It is possible that these two mechanisms, in combination, provide a means for amplifying the amount of CAP that is localized to the membrane. While this manuscript was under review, Minami et al. (22Minami A. Iseki M. Kishi K. Wang M. Ogura M. Furukawa N. Hayashi S. Yamada M. Obata T. Takeshita Y. Nakaya Y. Bando Y. Izumi K. Moodie S.A. Kajiura F. Matsumoto M. Takatsu K. Takaki S. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported the phenotype of the APS knock-out mice. These mice display increased insulin sensitivity and hypoinsulinemia, which is unexpected and is the reverse of the predicted phenotype. It is possible that in these mice SH2-BÎ± provides an alternative mechanism for the recruitment of CAP, because it binds to CAP constitutively and dissociates upon insulin stimulation. We have shown previously that SH2-B has broadly similar functions to APS in insulin signaling (8Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we show, for the first time, that SH2-B interacts with CAP, and this would explain the absence of a loss-of-function phenotype. It should be noted that, although glucose uptake was impaired, it was not abolished in the cells used in the present study, suggesting that other proteins may play a role in compensating for insulin-stimulated glucose transport when APS is decreased or absent. Why do these mice display a gain-of-function phenotype? One possibility is that the deletion of APS abrogates a negatively regulatory function that is either contained in APS itself or requires APS for initiation. One such candidate is c-Cbl. We and others have shown previously that phosphorylation of APS facilitates the recruitment of Cbl (3Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SH2-B is a weaker substrate for the insulin receptor (15Ahmed Z. Pillay T.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and, hence, is less able to facilitate the recruitment of c-Cbl, a known negative regulator of tyrosine kinases. The loss of Cbl recruitment could potentially explain the gain-of-function. Another possibility is that APS recruits other proteins that play a negative role in insulin signaling and that the deletion of APS abolishes the negative effects of these proteins. We have recently identified one such candidate recruited by APS and specifically expressed in adipocytes. 2A. Wilcox, K. D. Katsanakis, F. Bheda, and T. S. Pillay, manuscript in preparation. There may be other compensatory mechanisms that occur in the context of a knock-out mouse that are not seen in a cultured cell system, such as 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and these mechanisms may explain the differences seen both in this study and in other studies (4Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Taken together, the data from these studies indicate the following sequence of events (summarized Fig. 8). First, APS is recruited to the insulin receptor following insulin stimulation. This allows it to transport CAP to the insulin receptor. The localization of CAP to the membrane is aided by its constitutive interaction with APS, even though there may be a pool of CAP proteins carried by c-Cbl. Phosphorylation of APS then allows it to recruit Cbl. Thus, APS provides a central mechanism for the recruitment of both CAP and Cbl and is therefore both necessary and sufficient for the ligand and phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of c-Cbl. The data also indicate that APS is important for the recruitment of Cbl. After the initial recruitment, CAP dissociates from APS and presumably re-associates with Cbl, allowing transportation to the lipid rafts that are enriched in flotillin.

Here, we report the precise delimitation and a first functional analysis of the talin rod domain integrin-binding site. Partially overlapping cDNAs covering the entire human talin gene were transiently expressed as DsRed fusion proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing Î±IIbÎ²3, linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two-color fluorescence analysis of the transfected cells, spread on fibrinogen, revealed distinct subcellular staining patterns including focal adhesion, actin filament, and granular labeling for different talin fragments. The rod domain fragment G (residues 1984â2344), devoid of any known actin- or vinculin-binding sites, colocalized with Î²3-GFP in focal adhesions. Direct in vitro interaction of fragment G with native platelet integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 or with the recombinant wild type, but not the Y747A mutant Î²3 cytoplasmic tail, linked to glutathione S-transferase, was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis and pull-down assays, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo relevance of this interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Î²3-GFP and DsRed-talin fragment G. Further in vitro pull-down studies allowed us to map out the integrin-binding site within fragment G to a stretch of 130 residues (fragment J, residues 1984â2113) that also localized to focal adhesions.

Finally, we show by a cell biology approach that this integrin-binding site within the talin rod domain is important for Î²3-cytoskeletal interactions but does not participate in Î±IIbÎ²3 activation. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion and signaling are crucial events for numerous biological processes such as morphogenesis, the immune response, hemostasis, cell growth, and differentiation as well as for cell survival (1Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Integrins function as noncovalent Î±Î² heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton; they are, however, unable to directly interact with actin filaments. A number of actin-binding proteins, including talin, Î±-actinin, filamin, myosin, and skelemin, have been identified that act as intermediates in connecting integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (2Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, talin was the first intracellular ligand shown to interact directly with integrin Î²-subunit cytoplasmic tails (3Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Talin is a multifunctional â¼270-kDa (2541 amino acids) cytoskeletal protein that forms antiparallel homodimers, which represent the biologically active form of the protein (4Goldmann W.H. Bremer A. Haner M. Aebi U. Isenberg G. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vivo, talin is found in equilibrium between a membrane-bound and a cytoplasmic form (4Goldmann W.H. Bremer A. Haner M. Aebi U. Isenberg G. J. Struct.

Talin colocalizes with integrins at sites of cell-matrix interactions and membrane ruffles of moving cells (9Burridge K. Connell L. J.

The functional role of talin has been elucidated by antibody inhibition studies and genetic approaches. Microinjection of anti-talin antibodies into fibroblasts led to the disruption of FAs and associated stress fibers (11Nuckolls G.H. Romer L.H. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 753-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and down-regulation of talin by antisense mRNA or short hairpin RNAs reduced cell spreading and FA assembly in HeLa cells, integrin processing and transport to the cell surface, and energy-dependent integrin activation (8Tadokoro S.

Disruption of the Talin1 gene by a knockout approach in mice revealed that undifferentiated Talin1 (-/-) embryonic stem cells exhibited defective cell adhesion and spreading and were unable to assemble FAs or stress fibers, whereas differentiated cells readily formed these adhesion complexes (14Monkley S.J. Zhou X.H. Kingston S.J. Giblett S.M. Hemmings L. Priddle H. Brown J.E. Pritchard C.A. Critchley D.R. Fassler R. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The only partially inhibitory phenotype observed in Talin1 (-/-) mouse fibroblast-like cells may be explained by the presence of a second, recently identified TALIN2 gene in mammalian cells (15Monkley S.J.

Using in vitro solid phase binding assays, the Î²3 integrin-binding site of the rod domain has recently been shown to be contained within a recombinant fragment encoding the 558 C-terminal residues of talin (29Xing B.

The functional significance of the interaction between the talin rod domain and the Î²-subunit of integrins in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading remains largely unknown. In order to study this specific interaction, we have used a cell biology and a biochemical approach to map the integrin-binding site in the talin rod domain to a polypeptide of 130 amino acids, located between the C-terminal actin- and vinculin-binding sites. We also provide evidence that in FAs this fragment directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Î²3 but that this interaction does not participate in integrin activation. Protein Expression and Affinity PurificationâTalin cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1â433 (fragment A), 430â1076 (fragment B), 1984â2541 (fragment F), and 1984â2344 (fragment G) were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using human erythroleukemic HEL cell mRNA; cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1984â2270 (fragment H), 1984â2113 (fragment J), and 2093â2344 (fragment K) were amplified by PCR from the talin G construct. The primers used for PCR amplification were designed to generate appropriate restriction sites allowing the cloning of the amplified cDNAs into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences); for fragment A, SalI and EcoRI restriction sites were generated at the 5â²- and 3â²-ends, respectively; all remaining fragments were cloned using a single SalI site, and their orientation in the vector was determined by PCR. Fidelity of all cloned talin cDNA fragments with the human talin sequence (GenBankâ¢ AF078828) was confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 Â°C. Cells were lysed as previously described (34Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Talapatra A. Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Fusion proteins from the soluble fraction were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and finally dialyzed against PBS. Talin fragments used for surface plasmon resonance analysis were cleaved from the GST tag by thrombin digestion (10 units/mg of protein, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Thrombin was neutralized with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and the fragments were dialyzed against PBS. cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic tail of wild type Î²3 or the Î²3Y747A mutant (residues 716â762) were generated from the corresponding full-length constructs (35Schaffner-Reckinger E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12623-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using primers introducing BamHI and SmaI restriction sites at the 5â²- and 3â²-ends, respectively. These fragments were ligated into the pGEX-4T-2 vector, and the corresponding GST-fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described above. For expression of talin fragments in CHO Î±IIbÎ²3-GFP cells, recombinant DsRed fusion proteins of human talin were generated by cloning the cDNA of talin fragment A into the SalI and SacI and the cDNAs of all the other talin fragments into the SalI and BamHI restriction sites of the pDsRed-N1 vector (Clontech), resulting in fragments covering talin residues 1â433 (fragment A), 430â1076 (fragment B), 1075â1623 (fragment C), 1622â2270 (fragment D), 2267â2541 (fragment E), 1984â2541 (fragment F), 1984â2344 (fragment G), 1984â2270 (fragment H), 2267â2344 (fragment I), 1984â2113 (fragment J), 2093â2344 (fragment K), and 2093â2270 (fragment L). For integrin activation studies by flow cytometry, GFP fusion proteins of talin fragments A, G, and J were generated by cloning the corresponding cDNAs into the pEGFP-N1 vector using SalI and BamHI restriction sites. Furthermore, the cDNA encoding talin residues 1977â2113 was also inserted into the pcDNA4/TO/myc-His vector (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, generating a recombinant protein with a C-terminal myc-His tag (Jmyc). Cell Transfection and Indirect ImmunofluorescenceâCHO cells, stably transfected with Î±IIbÎ²3-GFP (36PlancÌ§on S. Morel-Kopp M.C. Schaffner-Reckinger E. Chen P. Kieffer N. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or HT-144 human melanoma cells (ATCC HTB 63) were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin and were transfected as previously described (35Schaffner-Reckinger E. Gouon V. Melchior C. PlancÌ§on S. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12623-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each cDNA construct, 1.5 Ã 106 adherent cells were transfected with 3â15 Î¼g of cDNA using LipofectAMINEâ¢ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fetal calf serum (10% final concentration) was added after 24 h, and 48 h after transfection, cells were detached with EDTA buffer (50 mm Hepes, 126 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), washed, resuspended in serum-free IMDM, and seeded onto glass coverslips coated with fibrinogen (20 Î¼g/ml). After 2 h of adhesion at 37 Â°C, cells were fixed for 15 min at 4 Â°C in fixation buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose) and washed four times in washing buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). For indirect immunofluorescence staining of the myc-tagged fragment J, the fixed cells were incubated for 40 min with a monoclonal mouse anti-myc antibody (9B11, 0.5 Î¼g/ml; Cell Signaling) and for 30 min with a rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (7.5 Î¼g/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). After each incubation step, the coverslips were washed three times for 5 min in washing buffer. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on microscopy slides in Mowiol/DABCO (Sigma). Fluorescence Microscopy and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) AnalysisâFor fluorescence analysis, GFP- and DsRed-conjugated proteins were visualized in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells adherent on fibrinogen-coated glass coverslips. Single images were collected under a conventional fluorescence microscope (LEICA Leitz DMRB) with a 63Ã oil immersion objective and a LEICA DC 300F camera using the LEICA IM1000 1.20 software. Images were processed digitally with Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems). FRET experiments were performed on a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad 1024, krypton-argon laser 488 nm, 568 nm; Nikon Eclipse TE300, 40Ã oil immersion CFI Plan-Fluor numerical aperture 1.3 objective), using the GFP/DsRed couple as a donor/acceptor pair. A spectral parameter indicating the ability of donor/acceptor fluorescent molecules to exhibit efficient FRET is R0, the FoÌrster distance equal to the donor/acceptor separation at which FRET is 50% efficient. For the GFP/DsRed couple, this value is 5.7 nm (37Erickson M.G. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), comparable with that reported for cyan fluorescent protein/yellow fluorescent protein, the leading pair for FRET experiments (38Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. J.M. M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar, 39Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images of the donor were acquired by exciting GFP with the 488-nm line of the krypton-argon laser and detected using a 522 Â± 35-nm filter. Images of the acceptor were acquired by exciting DsRed with the 568-nm line of the krypton-argon laser and detected with a 585-nm long pass filter. FRET was determined by the acceptor photobleaching method (40Bastiaens P.I. Jovin T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8407-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, after acquisition of an acceptor image (A1), a first Z-series of the donor (GFP) was acquired by scanning repeatedly with the 488-nm light of the confocal system (prebleach; D1). Then a region of interest of the cell was photobleached at 568 nm with 100% laser power until all acceptor (DsRed) was photodestroyed (A2), and a second Z-series of the donor was acquired (postbleach; D2). After correction for image acquisition using the Amira software (TGS), maximum intensity projections from the Z-series of GFP images were generated. The FRET-dependent increase in fluorescence of the donor in the photobleached region was visualized by subtracting the prebleach GFP image from the postbleach GFP image (D2 - D1). For each experiment, FRET efficiencies in FA sites (EFA) were calculated from the pre- and postbleach donor images according to the following equation: EFA = 1 - (IFA, prebleach/IFA, postbleach), where I is the average intensity measured for the corresponding FA (41Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For each cell analyzed, EFA values were calculated for 4â8 FA sites in the photobleached region as well as in the control (nonbleached) region, and the results were expressed as means Â± S.E. Pull-down AssaysâPlatelets were isolated from freshly drawn whole blood as described previously (42Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and lysed by sonication on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm Pipes, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2.5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.8). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 Â°C for 30 min at 13,000 rpm, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. For direct protein-protein interaction assays, 200 Î¼l of crude bacterial lysates containing the GST fusion proteins talin A, B, F, G, H, J, or K or GST alone were each mixed with 20 Î¼l of glutathione-Sepharose beads for1hat4 Â°C and subsequently washed four times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20. Sepharose beads coated with the different talin fragments were then incubated with 1 mg of platelet lysate for 2.5 h at 4 Â°C. Unbound proteins were washed off three times with PBS. Protein complexes were extracted in 25 Î¼l of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (5 min, 100 Â°C) and separated on a 4â12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). Western blot analysis of the transferred proteins was performed with a monoclonal anti-Î²3 cytoplasmic tail antibody (C3a). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)âMeasurements were performed on a Biacore3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Goat anti-GST antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biacore). Briefly, after activation of the carboxylate groups on the chip by a mixture of N-ethyl-Nâ²-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (Biacore), a solution of 35 Î¼g/ml goat anti-GST antibody in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.9) was fluxed over the four channels of the chip for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min. The residual activated carboxylate groups were neutralized with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5); for regeneration, 10 mm HCl was fluxed over the channels for 1 min. For kinetic analysis, two channels were pretreated for 2 min at 5 Î¼l/min with a 400 nm solution of recombinant GST (control channel) or GST-Î²3 integrin constructs in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.05% NP20 (HBS-N; Biacore). Subsequently, the purified recombinant talin fragment A or G, at a concentration ranging from 0.25 to 2 Î¼m in HBS-N, was allowed to react with the two channels at a flow rate of 20 Î¼l/min for 5 min, followed by a dissociation phase of 7.5 min. After each run, the channels were completely regenerated with 10 mm HCl. The obtained sensorgrams were analyzed with Biaeval 3.1 software (Biacore). Sensorgrams of the control channel were subtracted from the sensorgrams on the experimental channel and analyzed using nonlinear regression statistics to fit a simple Langmuir 1:1 binding model, taking into account the drifting base line, which is caused by the differential dissociation rate of GST alone and GST-Î²3 from the anti-GST antibodies. PAC-1 Binding Experiments and Flow CytometryâBinding of the mouse antibody PAC-1, which is specific for the activated form of Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin, was assessed as previously described (36PlancÌ§on S.

Briefly, â¼5 Ã 105 cells in 50 Î¼l of IMDM were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of the Î±IIbÎ²3-activating mouse antibody D3GP3 (3 Î¼g). For control experiments, nonspecific binding of PAC-1 was assessed by incubating the cells in the presence of 1 mm RGDS peptide. PAC-1 antibody (3.5 Î¼g in 50 Î¼l of IMDM) was then directly added to the suspension, and cells were further incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in cold IMDM and incubated for 30 min on ice with a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), diluted in IMDM. Finally, cells were washed and resuspended in an appropriate buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, 1 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4). Flow cytometry was performed using a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). After electronic compensation of the FL1 and FL2 fluorescence channels, PAC-1 binding (FL2) was analyzed on cells, which expressed the relevant GFP fusion proteins (FL1). Subcellular Localization of Recombinant Talin Fragments Covering the Entire Amino Acid Sequence of Human talin1âWe have previously shown that fusion of GFP to the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²3 integrin subunit allowed surface expression of a fully functional Î±IIbÎ²3-GFP receptor (36PlancÌ§on S.

Upon activation, Ras interacts with a spectrum of functionally diverse downstream effectors and stimulates multiple cytoplasmic signaling cascades that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition to the association of Ras with the plasma membrane, recent studies have established an association of Ras with Golgi membranes. Whereas the effectors of signal transduction by activated, plasma membrane-localized Ras are well characterized, very little is known about the effectors used by Golgi-localized Ras. In this study, we report the identification of a novel Ras-interacting protein, Rain, that may serve as an effector for endomembrane-associated Ras. Rain does not share significant sequence similarity with any known mammalian proteins, but contains a Ras-associating domain that is found in RalGDS, AF-6, and other characterized Ras effectors. Rain interacts with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo, requires an intact Ras core effector-binding domain for this interaction, and thus fits the definition of a Ras effector. Unlike other Ras effectors, however, Rain is localized to perinuclear, juxta-Golgi vesicles in intact cells and is recruited to the Golgi by activated Ras. Finally, we found that Rain cooperates with activated Raf and causes synergistic transformation of NIH3T3 cells.

Taken together, these observations support a role for Rain as a novel protein that can serve as an effector of endomembrane-localized Ras. Ras proteins (H-, N- and K-Ras) are essential components of the extracellular signaling cascades that control cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutated alleles of Ras are found in a variety of human tumors (1Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras induces the growth and morphological transformation of many cell types in vitro and is directly linked to tumorigenesis in animal models (2Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Ras is a plasma membrane-localized protein that cycles between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) states. After activation by external stimuli, Ras-GTP binds with multiple downstream effectors through the core Ras effector-binding domain (residues 32â40), which results in the stimulation of signaling cascades that regulate cytoplasmic and nuclear events. A growing number of Ras effectors have been identified over the years, with the Raf serine/threonine kinases, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RA, Ras-associating; DB, binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; RA, Ras-associated; DIL, dilute; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GalT, galactosyl transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RA, Ras-associating; DB, binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; RA, Ras-associated; DIL, dilute; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GalT, galactosyl transferase. lipid kinases, and the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors among the best characterized (3Downward J.

Dev. 1999; 9: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ras activation of effector function is mediated, in part, by the recruitment of these cytoplasmic proteins to the plasma membrane. Recent studies involving live-cell imaging, electron microscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer have shown that in addition to the plasma membrane, H-Ras and N-Ras, but not K-Ras, localize to intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (7Choy E.

Philips and colleagues (8Bivona T.G. Perez de Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) have shown that Golgi-localized Ras is activated through a Src/phospholipase CÎ³1/Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein pathway that is distinct from the classic protein receptor tyrosine kinase/Grb2/SOS pathway that activates Ras at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, they demonstrated that endomembrane-associated Ras is biologically active because silencing of endogenous Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein-mediated activation of Ras completely blocks T-cell receptor-stimulated Ras activation in Jurkat cells and neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells. In NIH3T3 transformation assays, a constitutively active, palmitoylation-deficient H-Ras mutant that is localized and activated on endomembranes exhibits transforming activity comparable with that of wild-type activated H-Ras (9Chiu V.K.

Whether the endomembrane and plasma membrane pools of biologically active Ras use the same set of effector molecules remains unknown. Genetically engineered variants of Raf, PI3K, and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors that are targeted to the plasma membrane in the absence of Ras activation are constitutively active as signaling molecules (10Leevers S.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), establishing these proteins as bona fide effectors of plasma membrane-localized Ras. The identification of the effectors of endomembrane-associated Ras is the next challenge in understanding the role and importance of Ras signaling originating from endomembranes. Herein, we report the identification of Rain, a novel Ras-interacting protein that displays the characteristics of an effector of endomembrane-localized Ras. First, Rain possesses a Ras-associating (RA) domain homologous to the RA domains of other Ras effectors, including the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors, AF-6, Rin1, and phospholipase CÏµ (14Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Second, like Raf and all other known Ras effectors, Rain preferentially binds to the GTP-loaded form of Ras in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction of Rain with Ras is abolished by mutations in the core effector domain of Ras. Third, we show that Rain localizes to a perinuclear, juxta-Golgi region in intact cells and is recruited to the Golgi by active Ras. Finally, we determined that co-expression of Rain together with activated Raf causes synergistic transformation of NIH3T3 cells. These data support a role for Rain as a novel effector for the activated pool of Ras localized to endomembranes in mammalian cells. Yeast Two-hybrid AssaysâIndividual Gal4 DNA binding domain (DB)-Ras fusion constructs (DB-Ras G12V,C186S; DB-Ras G12V,T35S,C186S; DB-Ras G12V,E37G,C186S; and DB-Ras G12V,Y40C,C186S) were generated by standard procedures. Full-length cDNA sequences encoding effector domain mutants of activated H-Ras G12V were amplified by PCR using primers to introduce 5â²-BamHI and 3â²-EcoRI sites and to alter the coding sequence to contain a C186S substitution of the cysteine residue of the H-Ras CAAX prenylation signaling motif. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the yeast expression vector pAS2â1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). Two hybrid screens were performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 using RasG12V,C186S-Gal4 DB as the bait and a human skeletal muscle cDNA library cloned into pACT2 (BD Biosciences Clontech). Transformants were plated on Leu- Trp- His- selection, and large colonies were assayed for Î²-galactosidase activity as described previously (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The pACT2 plasmid was recovered from each Î²-galactosidase-positive colony and propagated in Escherichia coli strain DH5. All positive clones were sequenced and characterized further as described in the text. A Gal4 DB-Rain (amino acids 79â447) yeast expression construct in pAS2â1 was generated using available NcoI sites. Interactions between Rain and Ras family members were tested by co-transformation of S. cerevisiae strain L40 (gift from A. Vojtek) with pACT2 Rain 79â447 and individual small GTPases expressed in yeast as LexA DB fusion proteins (gift from A. Vojtek and M. Hansen) (16Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and liquid cultures assayed for Î²-galactosidase activity as described above. Isolation of the Full-length Rain cDNAâRain 79â962 (clone C15) was excised from the pACT2 plasmid by EcoRI/XhoI digestion and cloned into pBS-KS. Expressed sequence tag clone AI928221 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and used to isolate the cDNA sequence encoding the N terminus of Rain. A 600-bp fragment (encoding amino acids 1â180 of Rain) was isolated by EcoRI/SacI digestion and subcloned into the pBS-KS plasmid (designated Rain 1â180/pBS). pBS Rain 79â962 was digested with SacI, and the isolated 2.2-kb fragment was inserted into the SacI site of pBS Rain 1â180. A plasmid with a confirmed orientation of the SacI fragment then was digested with EcoRI/HincII to excise a 1.1-kb fragment encoding the Rain amino terminus, and this fragment was subcloned into pBS Rain 79â962 digested with EcoRI/HincII to generate a full-length Rain cDNA. This full-length cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA, pcDNA3 HA, and pBabe-puro mammalian expression vectors. An expression vector encoding Rain tagged at the amino acid terminus with green fluorescent protein Rain (GFP-Rain) was generated by PCR amplification of the enhanced GFP sequence and insertion into pcDNA3 Rain. The same approach was used to generate an expression vector encoding cyan fluorescent protein-tagged Rain (CFP-Rain). The human Rain cDNA sequence reported here has been entered into the GenBank data base under accession number AY378097. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection AssaysâNIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and antibiotics. COS-1 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. NIH3T3 cells or HEK293 cells (5 Ã 105 and 3 Ã 105 cells per 100-mm dish, respectively) were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and whole cell extracts were used for immunoblot analyses. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal human Rain peptide (EQQELPANYRHGPPVATSP; residues 944â962) was used to detect endogenous and exogenously expressed Rain proteins in cell extracts. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Rain was detected with an anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Applied Science). NIH3T3 Transformation AssaysâWe employed a cooperation focus formation assay to assess the contribution of Rain to transformation through Ras signaling pathways. NIH3T3 cells were plated at 1 Ã 105 cells per 60-mm dish and transfected the next day using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) and procedures recommended by the manufacturer. DNA constructs used for transfection were pBabe-raf-Raf22W (50 ng/plate) (17Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 363-373PubMed Google Scholar), and pcDNA3 Rain (1 Î¼g/plate). Raf22W is an amino-terminally truncated, constitutively activated variant of human Raf-1. RhoA(63L) is a GTPase-deficient, constitutively activated mutant of human RhoA. Cells were fed growth medium 3 h after transfection and every 48 h thereafter. The appearance of transformed foci was monitored for 16 days and quantified visually using phase contrast microscopy. Data are expressed as number of foci per plate, averaged from three plates per group from three independent transfection experiments. For documentation, the cultures were fixed and stained with 0.4% crystal violet. Rain Expression AnalysesâTo evaluate Rain mRNA expression in the mouse, we used total RNA isolated from adult mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcription-PCR. The primers for the mouse Rain cDNA were as follows: 5â²-CTACTCTGGGTGTGTTCCAGGC-3â² (forward), 5â²-TGCGTCATCTGTCACAGGGC-3â² (reverse) and were designed to amplify a 550-bp fragment at the 3â² end of the Rain open reading frame. Two micrograms of total RNA from each tissue were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h, and 1 Î¼l of each reaction was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase for 35 cycles. For human Rain mRNA expression analysis, a multiple-tissue human mRNA blot (BD Biosciences Clontech) was probed with a randomprimed, 32P-labeled 2.1-kb cDNA fragment of Rain (nt 1167â3230). Blots were hybridized at 65 Â°C in rapid-hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, washed, and exposed to x-ray film. To evaluate Rain protein expression, mouse tissues isolated from an adult FVB mouse were lysed by homogenizing in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentration determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of extract were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using the polyclonal anti-Rain antiserum described above. Interaction between Rain and Small GTPasesâBacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the isolated Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1 (amino acids 51â131; Raf-RBD) and a region of Rain containing the RA domain (amino acids 121â245; Rain-RA) were expressed and purified from Rosetta E. coli strain (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Bacterially expressed and purified H-Ras protein (PanVera, Madison, WI) was pre-loaded with 2 mm Î²,Î³-imido-GTP or GDP by incubating for 10 min at 37 Â°C in 40 Î¼l of loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions were cooled on ice, the MgCl2 concentration adjusted to 15 mm, and the samples diluted to 300 Î¼l with binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton-X100) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 25 Î¼m concentration of the corresponding nucleotide before incubation with 5 Î¼g of GST-RA-Rain or GST-Raf-RBD proteins for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Protein complexes bound to glutathione beads were washed three times with binding buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The amount of H-Ras protein bound to RA-Rain or Raf-RBD was detected by immunoblotting using a pan-Ras antibody (Ab-3; Oncogene, San Diego, CA). To determine the ability of Rain to bind to other small GTPases, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 2 Î¼g of plasmid DNA expressing Flag epitope-tagged versions of activated H-Ras, Rap1A, R-Ras, or M-Ras/R-Ras3 (a gift of L. Quilliam). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and 250 Î¼g of each cell lysate were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 Â°C with 5 Î¼g of GST, GST-Raf-RBD, or GST-Rain-RA proteins immobilized on glutathione beads. Protein complexes were washed three times, eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using an anti-Flag antibody (M2; Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation AnalysesâNIH3T3 cells stably expressing H-Ras61L alone, or together with HA-Rain, were grown to subconfluence and lysed in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. Five hundred micrograms of total protein extract in a volume of 1 ml were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with 50 Î¼l of anti-HA antibody coupled to agarose beads (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science). Protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer, and resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-HA and anti-Ras antibodies. Immunofluorescence AnalysesâCOS-1 cells were plated at 3 Ã 105 cells per 60-mm plate and transfected with 2 Î¼g of HA-Ras61L, 3 Î¼g of GFP-Rain, or both constructs using Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained using an anti-HA antibody (HA.11; Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ) as described previously (19Mitin N. Ramocki M.B. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Staining was visualized using an Olympus fluorescence microscope with a 60Ã objective. To confirm Rain localization at the Golgi, 1 Ã 105 COS-1 cells were plated onto 35-mm MatTek dishes containing number 1.5 glass slides on the bottom (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and transfected as described above with 1 Î¼g of CFP-Rain and 0.3 Î¼g of YFP-GalT (a gift from M. Philips) in the presence or absence of 0.5 Î¼g of H-Ras61L-Flag. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or viewed live using a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope. Identification of a Novel Ras-interacting ProteinâTo identify additional Ras effectors, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a Gal4-DB-H-Ras G12V fusion protein as the bait and an adult human skeletal muscle cDNA library as the source of interacting proteins. From 1.8 Ã 107 independent transformants, 46 clones were selected that displayed interaction dependent growth on His- agar and high levels of Î²-galactosidase activity. The specificity of the interaction with Ras G12V was confirmed by retesting each clone with a variety of control baits (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the clones revealed that 41 represented partial cDNA sequences for the known Ras effectors, Rin1, RalGDS, and RalGDS-like 2 protein. The remaining five clones represented cDNAs encoding the same protein. All of these cDNAs were 2.9 kb long and contained an open reading frame of 883 amino acids, a 284-bp 3â² untranslated region, and a poly(A) tail. A search of the GenBank nucleotide data base with the sequence of a representative clone (C15) revealed no significant homology with any known genes but identified several expressed sequence tag clones identical to regions of the C15 cDNA. One expressed sequence tag (GenBank accession number AI928221) contained information that was used to extend the C15 cDNA by 0.3 kb in the 5â² direction and to incorporate an in-frame initiator ATG codon (Fig. 1A). The completed cDNA (3.2 kb) is identical to a recently released IMAGE clone (GenBank accession number BC028614) and contains an open reading frame for a 962-amino acid, highly basic (pI = 8.7) polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 104 kDa. Because the protein encoded by this cDNA binds to Ras, we named this protein Rain, for Ras-interacting protein. Rain contains a single RA (RalGDS/AF-6) domain (14Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) in the N terminus (Fig. 1A). This domain (amino acids 144â247) has the highest homology to the RA domains of human AF-6 (Fig. 2), a protein first identified as a 3â² portion of a translocation product in some human leukemias (20Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K. et al.Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5624-5628PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently as a putative Ras/Rap effector (21Van Aelst L. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An amino acid sequence alignment of the RA domain of Rain with the RA domains of other known Ras-interacting proteins is shown in Fig. 1B. Rain possesses the conserved basic residue (Arg182) found to be critical for the interaction of other effectors with Ras [Arg-89 in c-Raf-1 and Lys-685 in RGL (22Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Shirouzu M. Hashimoto K. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5103-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)]. In addition to the RA domain, Rain contains a proline-rich region (amino acids 59â136) that is similar to the Src homology 3 domain binding motifs found in many intracellular proteins. Rain also contains a putative dilute (DIL) domain (amino acids 769â877) found in the globular tail of the myosin V proteins (24Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 265-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In myosins, the DIL domain may be involved in binding to cargo during vesicle trafficking (25Rogers S.L. Karcher R.L. Roland J.T. Minin A.A. Steffen W. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer J.A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It is interesting that, outside of the myosin V family, AF-6 is the only protein found to contain a DIL domain. However, the role of this domain in AF-6 function is unknown. When the amino acid sequence of Rain was used to search the NCBI protein data base, we identified a protein sequence that is likely to represent a rat homolog of Rain (accession number XP_214916). In addition, this search identified a second human and mouse protein pair (accession number NP_060529 and NP_84887, respectively) that has the same domain architecture as Rain. These proteins, along with the AF-6 and its orthologs, are likely to comprise a new family of proteins with a unique combination of protein domains (Fig. 2). No Rain orthologs have been identified in invertebrates. Our search of the human high throughput genomic sequence data base identified two genomic contigs containing the Rain gene (GenBankâ¢ accession numbers AC009002 and AC008888). The contigs and the hypothetical protein they encode (FLJ20401) map to chromosome 19q13.33. Alignment of the Rain cDNA with its genomic sequence revealed that the Rain gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns, 10 of which interrupt the protein-coding region (Fig. 1C). Expression analysis of the human RAIN gene revealed a single transcript (â¼3.5 kb) that closely matched the size of the cloned Rain cDNA in all human tissues examined, with highest levels found in heart (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from adult mouse tissues confirmed that the Rain gene is transcriptionally active in the majority of samples examined, with the highest level of Rain mRNA detected in mouse lung (Fig. 3B). To evaluate the expression of the Rain protein, we used a carboxyl-terminal peptide from human Rain to generate a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts prepared from mouse tissues with the anti-Rain antiserum revealed two peptides of 115 and 85 kDa in lung and a single 85-kDa peptide in spleen (Fig. 3C). To test the specificity of the Rain antiserum, immunoblots were performed with protein extracts isolated from mouse lung or from NIH3T3 cells expressing HA-tagged Rain. The anti-HA antibody detected the 115-kDa HA-Rain protein expressed in the transfected cells (Fig. 3D). When the same extracts were immunoblotted using anti-Rain antibodies, 115- and 85-kDa peptides were detected in both samples. Pre-incubation of the anti-Rain antibodies with the Rain peptide used to generate the antiserum completely abolished detection of the 115-kDa protein and had no effect on the detection of the 85-kDa peptide. No proteins of 115 kDa were observed when pre-immune rabbit serum was used to probe the same samples (data not shown). Thus, together with the predicted size of Rain, these analyses indicate that the 115-kDa band corresponds to endogenous mouse Rain protein. Rain Binds to Ras in a GTP-dependent MannerâRas effectors preferentially bind to the activated (GTP-bound) form of Ras through a region referred to as the core effector domain (Ras residues 32â40). Yeast two-hybrid assays were used to evaluate Rain interaction with different Ras effector domain mutants. These results show that an intact Ras effector domain is necessary for interaction with Rain. Although Rain showed a strong interaction with E37G H-Ras effector domain variant, no interaction was detected using the T35S or Y40C variants (Fig. 4A). We next determined whether the Rain-Ras interaction is influenced by the activation state of Ras. Recombinant Ras protein was loaded with GDP or Î²,Î³-imido-GTP (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog) and incubated with a GST fusion protein containing the isolated RA domain of Rain (amino acids 121â245). The RBD of Raf-1 (Raf-RBD) was used as a positive control. The amount of Ras protein bound was determined by immunoblotting using an anti-Ras antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, Rain exhibited a higher affinity for Ras-GTP than Ras-GDP. As expected, a similar binding preference was observed for the Raf-RBD. When we evaluated the ability of Ras to bind to Rain peptides lacking the RA domain, no interactions were detected (data not shown), indicating that the RA domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Ras. Taken together with the yeast two-hybrid studies, these results show that Rain meets the criteria of an effector for Ras. We next tested whether the Rain-Ras interaction occurs in mammalian cells. For these studies, NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with an expression vector for activated H-Ras (Ras61L) and either a control plasmid or a plasmid expressing full-length, HA-tagged Rain. HA-Rain was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using an anti-HA antibody, and the protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an anti-Ras antibody. Results revealed that the Ras protein is detected only in precipitates from HA-Rain-expressing cells (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that Rain-Ras interaction occurs in mammalian cells and supports a role for Rain as a physiologically relevant effector of Ras. Rain Binds to Other Ras Family MembersâBecause many of the Ras effectors characterized to date (e.g. Raf, RalGDS, AF-6, Nore1) interact with other Ras-related proteins in addition to Ras, we used yeast two-hybrid"

In this study, a variant of full-length PrP with an unpaired cysteine at the C terminus was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli, covalently coupled to a thiol-reactive phospholipid, and incorporated into liposomes to serve as a model for studying possible changes in structure and stability of recombinant PrP upon membrane attachment. Covalent coupling of PrP to liposomes did not result in significant structural changes observable by far-UV circular dichroism. Moreover, limited proteolysis experiments failed to detect changes in the stability of liposome-bound PrP relative to soluble PrP. These data suggest that the requirement of raft localization for the PrPC to PrPSc conversion, observed previously in cell culture models, is not because of a direct influence of raft lipids on the structure and stability of membranebound PrPC but caused by other factors, e.g. increased local PrP concentrations or high effective concentrations of membrane-associated conversion factors.

To evaluate diagnostic usefulness and reliability of the detection of protease-resistant prion protein in urine, we extensively analyzed proteinase K (PK)-resistant proteins in patients affected with prion diseases and control subjects by Western blot, a coupled liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis, and N-terminal sequence analysis. The PK-resistant signal migrating around 32 kDa previously reported by Shaked et al. (Shaked, G. M., Shaked, Y., Kariv-Inbal, Z., Halimi, M., Avraham, I., and Gabizon, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 31479-31482) was not observed in this study. Instead, discrete protein bands with an apparent molecular mass of â¼37 kDa were detected in the urine of many patients affected with prion diseases and two diseased controls. Although these proteins also gave strong signals in the Western blot using a variety of anti-PrP antibodies as a primary antibody, we found that the signals were still detectable by incubation of secondary antibodies alone, i.e. in the absence of the primary anti-PrP antibodies. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal protein sequencing analysis revealed that the majority of the PK-resistant 37-kDa proteins in the urine of patients were outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of the Enterobacterial species. OMPs isolated from these bacteria were resistant to PK and the PK-resistant OMPs from the Enterobacterial species migrated around 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, nonspecific binding of OMPs to antibodies could be mistaken for PrPSc. These findings caution that bacterial contamination can affect the immunological detection of prion protein. Therefore, the presence of Enterobacterial species should be excluded in the immunological tests for PrPSc in clinical samples, in particular, urine.

Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders pathologically characterized by accumulation of an abnormal isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) in the central nervous system. A definite diagnosis of prion diseases relies on the detection of PrPSc (1World Health OrganizationWHO Infection Control Guidelines for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: Report of a WHO Consultation, Geneva, Switzerland, 23-26 March 1999.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is currently one of the most helpful techniques to detect abnormal high intensity lesions in the cerebral cortices and basal ganglia in the early stage of the disease (2Demaerel P. Baert A.L. Vanopdenbosch L. Robberecht W. Dom R. Lancet. 1997; 349: 847-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The detection of 14-3-3 proteins and measurement of phosphorylated tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid has been found to be useful in supporting the clinical diagnosis of CJD (3Hsich G. Kenny K.

Although these tests are clinically useful, they are surrogate markers and therefore cannot provide direct evidence of the presence of PrPSc. Moreover, although a brain biopsy can reveal the deposition of PrPSc in the brain (5Castellani R. Parchi P. Stahl J. Capellari S. Cohen M. Gambetti P. Neurology. 1996; 46: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is highly invasive and is not suitable for preclinical screening or early diagnosis. Detection of PrPSc in body fluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid has been extensively investigated, but these tests still need a new technological device to increase the sensitivity (6Bieschke J.

Their data suggests that UPrPSc will reflect the presence of PrPSc in the central nervous system and will also be a useful preclinical diagnostic test for prion diseases.

Western blot analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies 3F4 at 1:10,000 (Signet Laboratories), 6H4 at 1:5,000 (Prionics, Switzerland), or 3O8 at 1:1,000 (Cayman Chemical) followed by incubation with donkey-derived anti-mouse IgG (AP192A, Chemicon), goat-derived anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (S372B, Promega), or the F(abâ²)2 fragment of rabbit-derived anti-mouse IgG (710-4520, Rockland) and development in a chemiluminescent substrate (CDP Star or ECL-Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Some blots were labeled with PrP2B, rabbit-derived polyclonal antibody raised against PrP89-103, followed by incubation with donkey-derived anti-rabbit IgG (AP182A, Chemicon). In some blots, incubation with primary antibody was omitted for the experimental purpose. Coupled Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) Analysis of Protease-resistant ProteinsâA PK-resistant signal of 37 kDa on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel was cut out and transferred to a clean, siliconized Eppendorf tube. In-gel digestion was performed as previously described (8Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation of gels with trypsin at 37 Â°C, the digested protein was extracted twice with 50% acetonitrile, 50% trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation. An LC/MS analysis was performed using the QSTAR XL system (Applied Biosystems) and MAGIC 2002 liquid chromatography (Michrom BioResourse). The obtained protein masses were queried against entries for all species in the SwissProt data base using the Mascot Search program offered by Matrix Science. 2Available at www.matrixscience.com. N-terminal Protein SequencingâPK-resistant protein was obtained from the urine of patients sCJD 4, 5, and 7 and dural graft-associated CJD-1 as described above, or from urine of other patients as described by Shaked et al. (7Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After separation of the protein samples by 12% mini SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-PSQ transfer membrane (Millipore). PK-resistant bands visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were cut out and stored at 4 Â°C until the sequencing procedure. N-terminal protein sequencing by automated Edman degradation was performed using the Procise 491cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems), as previously described (9Morgenstern J.P. Griffith I.J. Brauer A.W. Rogers B.L. Bond J.F. Chapman M.D. Kuo M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9690-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing proceeded for 13 to 23 cycles. The obtained amino acid sequences were queried against entries for all species in the SwissProt data base using the FASTA search program offered by GenomeNet. 3fasta.genome.ad.jp. Assays of Protease Resistance of Outer Membrane Proteins (OMP)âOMPs were isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium as previously described (10HernaÌndez-AlleÌs S. AlbertiÌ S. AÌlvarez D. DomeÌnech-SaÌnchez A. MartiÌnez-MartiÌnez L. Gil J. TomaÌs J.M. BenediÌ V.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, cells harvested from overnight cultures in Super Broth medium were recovered by centrifugation. After washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, cells were broken by sonication. Unbroken cells were eliminated and cell envelopes were recovered at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h. After solubilization in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate for 30 min at 25 Â°C, insoluble OMPs were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h. OMPs were resuspended in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS (pH 7.4), or 2% Sarkosyl STE buffer and digested with 40 Î¼g/ml of PK at 37 Â°C for 1 h, under the same conditions as urine proteins. In parallel, 15 Î¼g of ovalbumin was digested with PK as a control. Binding of OMPs to F(abâ²)2 Fragment of ImmunoglobulinâIsolated OMPs were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. To determine whether OMPs bind to antibodies via the Fc region of immunoglobulin, the membrane was incubated with the F(abâ²)2 fragment of anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (710-4520, Rockland) after blocking with 5% nonfat milk. The membrane was then developed in a chemiluminescent substrate (CDP Star, Amersham Biosciences). PK-resistant Protein in the Urine of Humans Affected with Prion Diseases Directly Reacted with Secondary AntibodiesâThe results of urine protein examination and patient and control characteristics are summarized in Table I. We examined the PK sensitivity of urine proteins of patients affected with prion diseases (n = 54), healthy controls (n = 23), and disease control patients with (n = 20) and without dementia (n = 23). Clinical durations between disease onset and urine collection were 1.5 to 72 months in prion diseases. 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid was frequently positive in sporadic CJD (93.5%, 29/31) and dural graft-associated CJD (100%, 3/3). Abnormal high intensity signals in the cerebral cortices or basal ganglia were observed in the majority of patients with sporadic CJD (75.0%, 15/20). Most patients carried methionine homozygosity at codon 129 in the prion protein gene (PRNP), except for one case that was affected with Gerstmann-StraÌussler-Scheinker syndrome. No patients carried lysine polymorphisms at codon 219 in the PRNP. Three kinds of signals migrating around 37, 28, and 22 kDa were observed after PK treatment of the urine. PK-resistant signals of 37 kDa were prominent and observed in all positive cases, whereas the other two signals were usually faint and not always observed in all the positive cases. The signals of 28 kDa were also observed in controls after digestion with PK, suggesting that it represented a nonspecific signal because of PK itself. PK-resistant signals around 32 kDa, detected by Shaked et al. (7Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in CJD patients, were not observed in the present study. Therefore, we decided to utilize the 37-kDa signal as a PK-resistant protein in urine in this study. PK-resistant protein signals of 37 kDa were detectable in 70.4% (38/54) of the patients affected with prion diseases, whereas 3% (2/66) of the control subjects were positive for PK-resistant signals. The PK-resistant signal was not detectable in healthy controls or diseased controls with dementia (Table I and Fig. 1B). Although PK-sensitive and -resistant signals were detectable by labeling with 3F4 (Fig. 1A, left panel), 6H4, 3O8, or PrP2B (data not shown), these signals were also detectable with anti-mouse IgG antibody alone, omitting the incubation with 3F4 (Fig. 1A, right panel). This phenomenon was observed in all cases (11 cases; sporadic CJD, one case; dura-associated CJD) tested and reproducible using three kinds of anti-mouse IgG antibodies (AP192A, Chemicon; S372B, Promega; and 710-4520, Rockland) and an anti-rabbit IgG antibody (AP182A, Chemicon) (data not shown). To examine the possible influence of assay conditions on the detection of PK-sensitive or -resistant signals, urine proteins were re-suspended prior to PK digestion in 2% Sarkosyl STE buffer as described previously by Shaked et al. (7Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, PBS buffer. As shown in Fig. 1C, 37-kDa signals were similarly detectable in both assay conditions, indicating that the difference of the assay conditions did not influence the detection of these signals. Contamination of Urine with Bacterial Outer Membrane ProteinsâTo characterize the PK-resistant protein of 37 kDa on Western blot analysis, the bands from the urine of three patients were purified from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and prepared for LC/MS as previously described (8Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). One of these patients was diagnosed as probable sporadic CJD and the others were pathologically definite sporadic CJD. Protein mass analysis using LC/MS demonstrated that the major component of the PK-resistant signal was the OMPs of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium (Table II). No molecules of human origin, including PrP and immunoglobulin, were detected with any significance. Fig. 2 demonstrated the results of LC/MS analysis of a patient (sCJD-2).Table IIList of proteins detected by LC/MS analysisPatient IDSignificant hitsPeptides matchedProtein identificationSpeciessCJD-1asCJD, sporadic CJD.Outer membrane protein C precursorK. pneumoniae11Outer membrane protein C, chain AK. pneumoniae8Outer membrane protein C precursorS. typhimurium3sCJD-2Outer membrane protein C precursorE. coli13Outer membrane protein C precursorE. coli O 157:H713Outer membrane protein C precursorS. typhimurium4Translation initiation factor IF-2Geobacillus stearothermophilus3Outer membrane protein S2 precursorS. typhimurium2Outer membrane protein F precursorS. typhimurium2sCJD-3Outer membrane protein C precursorE. coli O157:H716Outer membrane protein C precursorE. coli O611Outer membrane protein C precursorS. typhimurium5Outer membrane protein C precursorK. pneumoniae4Outer membrane protein (fragment)Sodalis glossinidius2Outer membrane protein S1 precursorS. typhimurium2Outer membrane protein S2 precursorS. typhimurium2Outer membrane protein F precursorS. typhimurium2Glial fibrillary acidic protein homologCarassius auratus2Elongation factor P-like proteinS. typhimurium1a sCJD, sporadic CJD. Open table in a new tab We performed an N-terminal sequencing analysis to confirm the results of the LC/MS more quantitatively. It revealed that prominent PK-resistant signals in the urine of these three patients and all other patients examined (10/10) consisted of a mature chain of OMPs (Table III). Neither PrPs nor immunoglobulins were detected.Table IIIResults of the N-terminal sequence of PK-resistant signal in patients' urinePatient IDN-terminal sequenceProtein identification and speciesSporadic CJDsCJD-1aUrine samples were re-suspended in STE buffer containing 2% Sarkosyl as described by Shaked et al.

Open table in a new tab As described above, two other minor signals migrating around 28 and 22 kDa were observed on SDS-PAGE after PK treatment in the urine of some patients and controls. The N-terminal protein sequence analysis revealed that the signal at 28 kDa corresponded to the fragment of PK used for the assay and another signal at 22 kDa corresponded to the fragment of OMPs. OMPs Are Resistant to PKâTo evaluate PK sensitivity, OMPs were isolated from overnight cultured K. pneumoniae or S. typhimurium in Super Broth medium. After digestion with PK, a considerable amount of OMPs remained undigested and migrated around 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A, fourth and sixth lanes), whereas ovalbumin was completely digested under the same conditions (Fig. 3A, second lane). The electrophoretic mobility of PK-resistant OMPs was similar to that of the PK-resistant urine protein isolated from a patient affected with sporadic CJD (Fig. 3A, seventh lane). OMPs Reacted with the F(abâ²) Portion of ImmunoglobulinsâTo evaluate if OMPs bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins like protein A, a cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus, one of the gels was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to perform Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, OMPs bound to the F(abâ²)2 fragment of anti-mouse IgG, indicating that OMPs bind to immunoglobulins in a manner that is different from that of protein A with immunoglobulins. This observation as well as PK resistance of OMPs was not influenced by the difference in assay conditions (Fig. 3C). In the present study, we found that the PK-resistant protein was frequently detected in the urine of patients affected with prion diseases. However, the LC/MS and N-terminal protein sequencing analysis revealed that the majority of PK-resistant proteins in the urine of patients, which migrated around 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE and reacted non-specifically with several secondary antibodies, comprised OMPs of bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium, the popular causative agents for urinary tract infections. This finding indicated that bacterial contamination of urine might cause false-positive results in the assay for detecting UPrPSc. It is known that urinary tract infections associated with urethral catheterization is the most common nosocomial infection and is often asymptomatic. In this study, the majority of patients affected with prion diseases were already bearing catheters because of severe deterioration of intellectual and motor functions as they were suspected to be suffering from prion diseases. Furthermore, two of the diseased control patients with positive PK-resistant urine protein were also bearing persistent or intermittent urethral catheters. One patient suffered from neurogenic bladder because of multiple sclerosis and another was long bedridden because of cerebral infarction. The signal intensity decreased after PK digestion in a patient affected with multiple sclerosis (Fig. 1B), whereas it was not significant in patients affected with sporadic CJD (Fig. 1A). Differences in bacterial species or growth conditions in urine between the cases might cause such a variation in PK sensitivity of OMPs. On the other hand, all diseased controls affected with Alzheimer's disease or cerebrovascular dementia were outpatients; therefore, they were thought to be at lower risk of urinary tract infections. These circumstances strongly supported that possible bacterial contamination resulted in the detection of confusing PK-resistant protein in urine. OMPs are 36- to 39-kDa membrane spanning proteins that form channels in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. The primary and secondary structures of OMPs are well conserved in Enterobacterial species containing 16-stranded antiparallel Î² barrels to form channels (11Weiss M.S. Abele U. Weckesser J. Welte W. Schiltz E. Schulz G.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Biochemically, OMPs are heat modifiable and resistant to trypsin (12AlbertiÌ S. RodriÌquez-QuioÌones F. Schirmer T. Rummel G. TomaÌs J.M. Rosenbusch J.P. BenediÌ V.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have confirmed that OMPs of K. pneumoniae and S. typhimurium were also resistant to PK and the resulting molecules migrated around 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE. OMPs act as a determinant of the permeability of antimicrobial agents and affect the interaction between bacteria and host defense mechanisms (13Benz R. Ghuysen J.-M. Hackenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Walls. Elsevier, Amsterdam1994: 397-424Google Scholar). Whereas it is known that the OMPs of K. pneumoniae bind to C1q (14AlbertiÌ S. MarqueÌs G. CamprubiÌ S. Merino S. TomaÌs J.M. Vivanco F. BenediÌ V.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are no previous reports that indicate the binding between OMPs and IgG. We found that OMPs bound non-specifically to IgG (several kinds of antibodies) during the procedure of Western blot analysis. Because protein A, a cell wall component of S. aureus, has been known to bind to the Fc region of IgG (15Kessler S.W. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 1617-1624PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that OMPs might also bind to IgG in the same manner. Contrary to our expectations, OMPs still reacted with the F(abâ²)2 fragment of anti-mouse IgG, indicating that they bound to IgG in a manner that is different from that of protein A with immunoglobulins. It might be suggested that accidentally acquired antibodies against bacterial OMPs in the serum of immunized animals might react with OMPs, resulting in protease-resistant signals. However, Western blot analysis using anti-mouse IgG produced by a phage-display method, for example, would be required to exclude this hypothesis. Our findings were not consistent with those of a previous report by Shaked et al. (7Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). They showed that PK-resistant proteins in the urine of patients and animals affected with prion diseases were prion protein and termed them UPrPSc. The signal of UPrPSc showed a downward shift after PK digestion resulting in a 32-kDa fragment, whereas the majority of PK-resistant signals that we detected did not show a significant downward shift. Apart from the 37-kDa PK-resistant signal, a faint 22-kDa signal was observed in some patients and a 28-kDa signal was observed in both patients and controls. N-terminal sequencing revealed that these signals were fragments of OMPs and PK molecules, respectively. In this study, we did not observe any PK-resistant signals migrating around 32 kDa, which was detected by Shaked et al. (7Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in the urine of patients. Therefore, the possibility that the PK-resistant molecule in this study might be a different molecule from UPrPSc, as demonstrated by Shaked et al. (7Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was not excluded. However, the high incidence of OMPs (37-kDa PK-resistant signals, non-specifically bind to immunoglobulins) in the urine of patients affected with prion diseases, irrespective of the assay conditions, indicated that bacterial contamination would always have to be considered in the application of a âUPrPSc assayâ in the diagnosis of human prion diseases. Our findings suggest that PrPSc and PrPC may not always exist or could exist at a very low level in urine, and bacterial contamination may often cause false detection of a PK-resistant isoform of prion protein in urine and a misinterpretation of results. We have also analyzed the urine protein of mice experimentally infected with a prion agent. The PK-resistant signals of 25 kDa were found in the urine of affected mice, but these signals were also detectable using a secondary antibody alone, omitting the labeling by a primary antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, N-terminal sequencing analysis revealed that these PK-resistant signals in mice urine were OMPs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In conclusion, the detection of UPrPSc is not useful or reliable for ante-mortem, definite diagnosis of human prion diseases in the present situation. Further improvement in sensitivity and specificity of this assay may make it a powerful diagnostic tool for prion diseases in the future.

In mice, u-PAR expression is restricted to a few tissues, one of which is the colon. We therefore screened a colon expression library for regulators of u-PAR promoter activity and identified a zinc finger protein bearing consensus sequences to the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors and showing partial homology with one of the members, KLF4. Like u-PAR, KLF4 expression is predominant in the luminal surface epithelial cells of the colonic crypt, and we hypothesized that u-PAR synthesis in these cells is directed by this transcription factor. Colon cells from KLF4 null mice showed a dramatic reduction in u-PAR protein compared with wild-type mice. Conversely, KLF4 expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells increased the amount of u-PAR protein/mRNA. Transient transfection of KLF4 with a reporter driven by 5â²-deleted u-PAR promoter fragments indicated the requirement of the proximal 200 base pairs for optimal expression. Mobility-shifting experiments demonstrated binding of KLF4 to multiple regions of the u-PAR promoter (-154/-128, -105/-71, and -51/-24), and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of KLF4 to the endogenous promoter. Deletion of the -144/-123 promoter region diminished but did not eliminate the ability of KLF4 to transactivate the u-PAR promoter, suggesting cooperativity of these binding sites with respect to activation of gene expression.

Finally, it has been shown that the seven-transmembrane receptor, formyl peptide receptor-like receptor-1/lipoxin A4 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, directly interacts with a soluble cleaved form of u-PAR to induce chemotaxis (10Resnati M.

In cancer, there is strong evidence implicating u-PAR expression in tumor growth and progression. Indeed, elevated u-PAR levels are evident in various malignancies (11Memarzedeh S. Kozak K.R.

Moreover, interfering with u-PAR expression or function retards growth and invasiveness of some cancers, including glioblastomas (14Lakka S.S. Gondi C.S. Yanamandra N. Dinh D.H. Olivero W.C.

The amount of u-PAR protein is controlled mainly at the transcriptional level, although altered message stability (17Lund L.R. Ellis V. Ronne E. Pyke C. Dano K. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) all contribute to the quantity of this gene product. Our laboratory and others have previously described several upstream transcriptional elements regulating u-PAR expression in tissue culture. Thus, Soravia et al. (21Soravia E. Grebe A. De Luca P. Helin K. Suh T.T. Degen J.L. Blasi F. Blood. 1995; 86: 624-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to report a GC-rich region (-99/-70) bound with Sp1, which was required for basal expression of the gene. We subsequently identified a separate sequence (-148/-124) bound with Sp1/Sp3 and an AP-2Î±-related factor and was required for u-PAR expression in cultured colon cancer cells (22Lengyel E. Wang H.

Additionally, a third region with a DNase I footprint spanned nucleotides -190/-171, contained a consensus AP-1 motif, and was necessary for the constitutively high or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-inducible expression of u-PAR (22Lengyel E.

In separate investigations, Hapke et al. (24Hapke S. Gawaz M. Dehne K. Kohler J. Marshall J.F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Reuning U. Lengyel E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2118-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) implicated a PEA3/Ets silencing motif located at -248, whereas Wang et al. (25Wang Y. Dang J. Wang H. Allgayer H. Murrell G.A. Boyd D.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3248-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated a novel NF-ÎºB element (located at -45) that was required for expression of this gene in cultured cells. In addition to these reports, our studies analyzing tissue-specific expression of u-PAR in transgenic mice indicated the requirement for a region residing between -1.5 and -8.5 kb for expression in the placenta (26Wang H. Hicks J. Khanbolooki P. Kim S.J. Yan C. Wang Y. Boyd D.D. Am. J Patho. 2003; 163: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One of the few tissues that constitutively express u-PAR in the healthy mouse is the colon where u-PAR protein/mRNA predominates in the upper region of the crypt (26Wang H. Hicks J. Khanbolooki P. Kim S.J. Yan C. Wang Y. Boyd D.D. Am. J Patho. 2003; 163: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). u-PAR localization to the surface epithelial cells may contribute to their detachment via proteolysis whereupon the epithelial cells undergo anoikis as a result of the absence of a basement membrane-generated survival signal (27Strater J. Wedding U. Barth T.F.E. Koretz K. Elsing C. Moller P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1776-1784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, at the present time, the mechanism that drives expression of this gene in the colon is unknown. Consequently, we undertook expression cloning studies with a colon cDNA library to identify regulators of u-PAR expression in colon tissue. Constructs and AntibodiesâA FLAG sequence flanked with HindIII, BamHI, XhoI, and XbaI sites (AAG CTTACC ATG GAC TAC AAA GAC GAT GAC GAC AAGGGA TCC CTC GAG TCT AGA GGG CCC (underlined nucleotides indicate restriction sites)) was synthesized and cloned between the HindIII and XbaI sites at the multiple cloning sites in the pcDNA3 vector generating the pcDNA/FLAG/BamHI vector. The KLF4 coding sequence was then isolated from pcDNA3.1-KLF4 and subcloned into the pcDNA/FLAG/BamHI vector. The KLF4-FLAG sequence was subsequently purified using HindIII and XhoI and cloned into the Eco47III and XhoI-generated window of the pIRES2-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) vector (Clontech) to generate the KLF4-EGFP expression vector. Sequencing was used to confirm the identity and orientation of this construct. All u-PAR promoter fragments were cloned into the pGL3-Basic (Promega) reporter construct. Fragments -398/+52, -197/+52, and -8/+52 were recovered by restriction digestion from the corresponding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs described previously (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The -1469/+52 u-PAR promoter fragment was prepared by PCR from genomic DNA whereas fragments -154/+52, -105/+52, -88/+52, and -51/+52 were generated by PCR using -398/+52 as a template. All fragments were blunt-ended and ligated into pGL3-Basic following SmaI digestion and phosphorylation of the latter. Antibodies to Sp1 (sc-59x), Sp3 (sc-644x), and GKLF (KLF4) (sc-20691x) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-FLAG antibody (F3165) was obtained from Sigma. Expression CloningâAn arrayed human colon cDNA library (LCO-1001, Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD) in which cDNAs were constructed in the pCMV6-XL4 expression vector was used. DH10B Escherichia coli bacteria were transformed with DNA from the library and seeded on ampicillin LB agar plates to obtain â¼100 colonies per plate. Every plate was replicated using the replica plating tool and velveteen replica plating squares (Bel-Art Products) or by manual selection. The cDNA pool of each plate was prepared by the Qiagen Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the primary screening, HCT116 cells were seeded at 1 Ã 105/well in 24-well plates. After 24 h, cells in each well were cotransfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with a DNA mixture composed of the cDNA pool (350 ng), the u-PAR-luciferase reporter (50 ng), and 1 ng of a pRL-SV40 internal control according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were lysed in a reporter lysis buffer (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). In secondary screens, positive pools were further subdivided into 10 colonies per plate. cDNAs subpools were prepared and assayed as described above. Finally, in a tertiary screen, single colonies from positive subpools (selected in the secondary screen) were identified as described above. ImmunohistochemistryâImmunohistochemistry was carried out using a rabbit anti-u-PAR antibody essentially as described previously (26Wang H. Hicks J. Khanbolooki P. Kim S.J. Yan C. Wang Y. Boyd D.D. Am. J Patho. 2003; 163: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but with the minor modification that blocking was accomplished with 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat serum and that 3,3â²-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as a substrate for visualizing immunoreactive products. Counterstaining was achieved with hematoxylin. Alcian Blue StainingâDetection of acidic mucins was performed by staining of tissue with Alcian Blue as described elsewhere (28Katz J.P. Perreault N. Goldstein B.G. Lee C.S. Labosky P.A. Yang V.W. Kaestner K.H. Development. 2002; 129: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western BlottingâWestern blotting for u-PAR was performed as described previously (29Allgayer H. Wang H. Gallick G.E. Crabtree A. Mazar A. Jones T. Kraker A.J. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18428-18445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extract (in a Triton X-100 buffer with protease inhibitors) was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-u-PAR antibody. The immunoprecipitated material was then subjected to Western blotting, and the blot was probed with 5 Î¼g/ml anti-u-PAR monoclonal antibody (3931, American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Bands were visualized by ECL. For detection of KLF4, 80 Î¼g of cellular protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detection was achieved using an anti-FLAG M2 as primary antibody (Sigma) and an anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega). Northern BlottingâTotal cellular RNA was isolated from 90% confluent cultures using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was resolved in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary action using 20Ã SSC. The blot was probed at 65 Â°C with a randomly primed, radiolabeled 0.8-kb cDNA specific for human u-PAR mRNA. Stringencies were performed with 0.1Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 Â°C. Loading efficiencies were checked by reprobing the blot with a radiolabeled cDNA, which hybridizes with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. TransfectionsâTransfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, 12 Î¼g of DNA diluted into Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (catalog no. 31985-070, Invitrogen) was mixed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (using Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium as diluent), and the mixture was added to 107 cells. After 24 h, cells were either observed by fluorescence to determine transfection efficiency or harvested. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) AnalysisâCells were harvested with 3 mm EDTA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with an anti-u-PAR monoclonal antibody (R4) or a control IgG1 antibody (5 Î¼g/ml). After washing, all samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (5 Î¼g/ml). Samples were then fixed in 70% ethanol (4 Â°C) overnight, after which cell pellets were resuspended in 50 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide and 20 Î¼g/ml RNase. Cells were incubated at 37 Â°C for 20 min and then subjected to FACS analysis. Reporter AssaysâCells (300,000) were subcultured into 24-well plates. After 24 h, cells were cotransfected (using LipofectAMINE 2000) with a u-PAR promoter-driven luciferase reporter (0.2 Î¼g) and an expression vector (pcDNA3.1) encoding KLF4. Where indicated, transfections included 0.03 ng of a Î²-actin-regulated Renilla luciferase reporter to normalize for varying transfection efficiencies. Cells were washed 24 h later, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. Statistical analyses (unpaired t test) were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, version 3). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)âNuclear extracts and EMSA were carried out as described by us elsewhere (23Allgayer H. Wang H. Wang Y. Heiss M.M. Bauer R. Nyormoi O. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4702-4714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Allgayer H. Wang H. Gallick G.E. Crabtree A. Mazar A. Jones T. Kraker A.J. Boyd D.D. J. Biol.

EMSA was performed using 10 Î¼g of nuclear extract, 0.6 Î¼g of poly(dIÂ·dC), and 2 Ã 104 cpm of a [Î³-32P]ATP T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled oligonucleotide. Chromatin ImmunoprecipitationsâThese assays were performed essentially as described previously (30Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) but with modifications. Cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min to cross-link proteins to DNA. The cells were collected, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then washed sequentially for 10 min in ice-cold Solution 1 (0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and thereafter in Solution 2 (0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors) and sonicated eight times in 15-s bursts. The lysate was diluted to 1 ml in lysis buffer, and an aliquot of 2% was saved as input. Lysate was precleared sequentially with rabbit IgG and then protein A-agarose. Anti-KLF4 antibody, 2.5 Î¼g (sc20691x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was added to the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by adding salmon sperm/protein A-agarose slurry (catalog no. 16-157, Up-state Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed once sequentially with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40), high salt wash (500 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), and LiCl wash (250 mm LiCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The beads were then treated overnight with RNase (50 Î¼g/ml) at 37 Â°C for 30 min and proteinase K. Cross-links were reversed at 65 Â°C, and the DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and coprecipitated with glycogen. DNA was dissolved in 25 Î¼l of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Real Time (Quantitative) PCRâReal time PCR assays were performed essentially as described previously by this laboratory (31Yan C. Wang H. Toh Y. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2309-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. The primers used in the reaction had a concentration of 100 nm. A threshold cycle (Ct) value was obtained from each amplification curve using the software provided by the manufacturer. A ÎCt value was calculated by subtracting the Ct value for the 2% input sample from the Ct value for the immunoprecipated (IP) sample, i.e. ÎCt = Ct(input) - Ct(IP). The percentage of the total input amount for the IP sample was then calculated by raising 2 to the ÎCt power, i.e. the total percentage of IP sample = 2ÎCt Ã 2 as described previously. The following primers, corresponding to the human u-PAR promoter sequence, were used for real time PCR: forward (5â²-TTTACAGCAGTGGAGAGCGATT-3â²) and reverse (5â²-CCCTGACTCATGGAGTTGTGAT-3â²). These primers correspond to sequences -286/-265 and -116/-134, respectively, of the u-PAR promoter. For conventional PCR, the identical primer pair was used with the following PCR cycle parameters: denaturation at 94 Â°C for 30 s, annealing at 50 Â°C for 30 s, and extension at 72 Â°C for 30 s, with a total of 35 cycles. To verify the amplicon size, PCR products were checked in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Expression Cloning of a Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates u-PAR Promoter ActivityâTo identify regulators of u-PAR expression in the colon, we screened an arrayed colon cDNA library representing â¼500,000 clones. The library was subdivided such that primary screenings were undertaken with pools of 100 cDNAs. Accordingly, HCT116 colon cancer cells were cotransfected with cDNA pools and a luciferase reporter regulated by 1469 base pairs of u-PAR upstream sequence and were subsequently assayed for luciferase activity. We previously showed that this promoter sequence includes all the regulatory elements necessary for appropriate u-PAR expression in the colon (26Wang H. Hicks J. Khanbolooki P. Kim S.J. Yan C. Wang Y. Boyd D.D. Am. J Patho. 2003; 163: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One of the primary screens (Fig. 1A) identified a pool (B4) stimulating u-PAR promoter activity. This pool was further subdivided and screened in two subsequent rounds, thereby identifying clone B4-7-5, which selectively increased u-PAR promoter activity (Fig. 1B). Sequencing of this clone followed by a NCBI BLAST search identified a cDNA encoding a 538-amino acid zinc finger protein (zinc finger protein 306, accession number BT007427.1). Interestingly, a conserved CxxCxKxFxSxLxxHxxH amino acid sequence in the predicted peptide identified zinc finger protein 306 as a member of the C2H2 subfamily of zinc finger proteins, and a TGEKPYX sequence evident between zinc fingers further refined the cDNA within the Kruppel-like subfamily of the C2H2 group (32Pi H. Li Y. Zhu C. Zhou L. Luo K. Yuan W. Yi Z. Wang Y. Wu X. Liu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a homology search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq) combined with a literature review for colon-specific Kruppel-like transcription factors identified KLF4 (also known as GKLF) as a 56-kDa Kruppel-like DNA-binding protein (33Garrett-Sinha L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showing partial homology with zinc finger protein 306 (Fig. 1C). Of particular interest was the observation that, like u-PAR (26Wang H. Hicks J. Khanbolooki P. Kim S.J. Yan C. Wang Y. Boyd D.D. Am. J Patho. 2003; 163: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), KLF4 expression is restricted to the luminal surface epithelial cells of the colon (33Garrett-Sinha L. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 34Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Consequently, we determined whether KLF4 directs u-PAR expression in the luminal surface epithelial cells of the colon. Diminished u-PAR Protein in the Colon from KLF4-/- MiceâThe predominant expression of u-PAR mRNA in the luminal surface cells of the gastrointestinal tract has been previously reported (36Kristensen P. Eriksen J. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 115: 1763-1771Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and as expected immunohistochemical staining for u-PAR protein in the adult mouse colon revealed intense staining in the upper region of the colonic crypt (Fig. 2A, left panel, arrows). Some staining was evident in the muscularis propria, but this was erratic and may represent u-PAR expression in smooth muscle as reported elsewhere (37Bonavaud S. Charriere-Bertrand C. Rey C. Leibovitch M.-P. Pedersen N. Frisdal E. Planus E. Blasi F. Gherardi R. Barlovatz-Meimon G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Degryse R. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If KLF4 regulates u-PAR expression in the epithelial cells at the luminal surface of the mouse colon, then the absence of u-PAR protein would be predicted for this tissue derived from KLF4 null mice. Mice lacking both alleles of the KLF4 gene die 1 day postnatally (28Katz J.P. Perreault N. Goldstein B.G. Lee C.S. Labosky P.A. Yang V.W. Kaestner K.H. Development. 2002; 129: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and u-PAR protein expression was analyzed in sections of colon from these animals. Like the colon from the adult mouse, u-PAR immunoreactivity was detected in the cells located at the mouth of the colonic crypt (Fig. 2B, upper panels, arrows). u-PAR immunoreactivity was also evident in migrating immune cells (rectangles) (39Almus-Jacobs F. Varki N. Sawdey M.S. Loskutoff D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 688-698PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bianchi E. Ferrero E. Fazioli F. Mangili F. Wang J. Bender J.R. Blasi F. Pardi R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the presence of these activated cells probably reflecting an inflammatory response to maternal feeding in the new-born mice. More importantly, u-PAR immunoreactivity was dramatically diminished in the luminal surface cells of the colon derived from the KLF4 null mice (Fig. 2B, lower panels). Thus, although the u-PAR immunoreactivity was consistently detected throughout the luminal surface epithelial cell layer of wild-type mice, few cells showed u-PAR positivity in the KLF4 null mice. Furthermore, long stretches of the surface epithelium were completely devoid of this protein in the KLF4 knock-out mice. These data would suggest that u-PAR expression in the normal colon surface epithelium is driven largely by the KLF4 transcription factor. However, there is a concern relating to the ability of KLF4 to promote goblet cell differentiation (28Katz J.P. Perreault N. Goldstein B.G. Lee C.S. Labosky P.A. Yang V.W. Kaestner K.H. Development. 2002; 129: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this tissue. Accordingly, it may be that the absence of u-PAR protein is secondary to the lack of maturation of these cells. To address this possibility,"
https://openalex.org/W2044383658,"In the central nervous system, glycine is a co-agonist with glutamate at the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors and also an agonist at inhibitory, strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. The GLYT1 subtypes of glycine transporters (GLYTs) are responsible for regulation of glycine at excitatory synapses, whereas a combination of GLYT1 and GLYT2 subtypes of glycine transporters are used at inhibitory glycinergic synapses. Zn2+ is stored in synaptic vesicles with glutamate in a number of regions of the brain and is believed to play a role in modulation of excitatory neurotransmission. In this study we have investigated the actions of Zn2+ on the glycine transporters, GLYT1b and GLYT2a, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and we demonstrate that Zn2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GLYT1 but has no effect on GLYT2. We have also investigated the molecular basis for these differences and the relationship between the Zn2+ and proton binding sites on GLYT1. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified 2 histidine residues, His-243 in the large second extracellular loop (ECL2) and His-410 in the fourth extracellular loop (ECL4), as two coordinates in the Zn2+ binding site of GLYT1b. In addition, our study suggests that the molecular determinants of proton regulation of GLYT1b are localized to the 2 histidine residues (His-410 and His-421) of ECL4. The ability of Zn2+ and protons to regulate the rate of glycine transport by interacting with residues situated in ECL4 of GLYT1b suggests that this region may influence the substrate translocation mechanism. In the central nervous system, glycine is a co-agonist with glutamate at the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors and also an agonist at inhibitory, strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. The GLYT1 subtypes of glycine transporters (GLYTs) are responsible for regulation of glycine at excitatory synapses, whereas a combination of GLYT1 and GLYT2 subtypes of glycine transporters are used at inhibitory glycinergic synapses. Zn2+ is stored in synaptic vesicles with glutamate in a number of regions of the brain and is believed to play a role in modulation of excitatory neurotransmission. In this study we have investigated the actions of Zn2+ on the glycine transporters, GLYT1b and GLYT2a, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and we demonstrate that Zn2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GLYT1 but has no effect on GLYT2. We have also investigated the molecular basis for these differences and the relationship between the Zn2+ and proton binding sites on GLYT1. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified 2 histidine residues, His-243 in the large second extracellular loop (ECL2) and His-410 in the fourth extracellular loop (ECL4), as two coordinates in the Zn2+ binding site of GLYT1b. In addition, our study suggests that the molecular determinants of proton regulation of GLYT1b are localized to the 2 histidine residues (His-410 and His-421) of ECL4. The ability of Zn2+ and protons to regulate the rate of glycine transport by interacting with residues situated in ECL4 of GLYT1b suggests that this region may influence the substrate translocation mechanism. The amino acid glycine is a co-agonist with glutamate at the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; GLYT, glycine transporter; GLYT1b, glycine transporter subtype 1b; GLYT2a, glycine transporter subtype 2a; GABA, Î³-aminobutyric acid; DAT, dopamine transporter; hDAT, human dopamine transporter; NET, norepinephrine transporter; hNET, human norepinephrine transporter; GAT, Î³-aminobutyric acid transporter; rGAT-1, rat Î³-aminobutyric acid transporter-1; SERT, serotonin transporter; TM, transmembrane domain; ECL, extracellular loop; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, 2-sulfonatoethylmethanethiosulfonate. subtype of glutamate receptors (1McBain C.J.

Life Sci. 1965; 4: 2075-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Glycine transporters (GLYTs), which regulate synaptic glycine concentrations, belong to the Na+- and Clâ-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family that includes the transporters for Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (GAT), dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) (3Amara S.G.

These membrane proteins share a common structure of 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) with amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends oriented intracellularly. Two high affinity glycine transporters, both with several alternative isoforms, have been identified (4Guastella J. Brecha N. Weigmann C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The GLYT1 subtypes are expressed in glial cells throughout the brain and spinal cord in close proximity to both excitatory glutamatergic synapses and inhibitory glycinergic synapses, whereas the GLYT2 subtypes are expressed in inhibitory glycinergic neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem (11Zafra F. Aragon C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Gimenez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the GLYT1 subtypes are responsible for regulation of glycine at excitatory synapses, whereas a combination of GLYT1 and GLYT2 subtypes are used at inhibitory glycinergic synapses (7Smith K.E.

The stoichiometry of ion flux coupling for GLYT1 is 2 Na+ and 1 Clâ transport for each molecule of glycine, and from this it may be predicted that under physiological conditions GLYT1 will maintain extracellular glycine concentrations at â¼150 nm (16Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 17Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The concentration of glycine required to activate NMDA receptors varies within the range of 0.1â3 Î¼m, depending on the NMDA receptor subtype (18Danysz W. Parsons A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore the equilibrium glycine concentration maintained by GLYT1 transporters falls within the dynamic response range for activation of NMDA receptors. Thus, modulation of glycine transporter activity has the capacity to influence the extent of glycine occupancy of NMDA receptors and provide an alternate mechanism for modulation of NMDA-mediated excitatory neurotransmission (12Berger A.J. Dieudonne S. Ascher P. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors and the GLYT1 subtype of glycine transporters are both modulated by a number of endogenous compounds, including arachidonic acid (19Pearlman R.J. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), anandamide (19Pearlman R.J. Aubrey K.R. Vandenberg R.J. J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Zn2+ is widely distributed in the central nervous system, with chelatable Zn2+ being abundant in particular regions of the brain, including excitatory terminals of the mossy fibers of the hippocampus. In this region, Zn2+ is co-localized in synaptic vesicles with glutamate and is released into the synaptic cleft during neurotransmission, reaching concentrations up to 300 Î¼m (21Assaf S.Y.

It has been shown that micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ can modulate the activity of a number of proteins within excitatory synapses, including NMDA receptors (25Peters S. Koh J. Choi D.W.

Moreover, it has recently been reported that low concentrations of Zn2+ (5 Î¼m) impaired glycine transport by the heterologously expressed GLYT1 (31Laube B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we have further investigated the actions of Zn2+ on the glycine transporters, GLYT1b and GLYT2a, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and demonstrate that Zn2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GLYT1 but has no effect on GLYT2. We have also investigated the molecular basis for these differences and the relationship between the Zn2+ and proton binding sites on GLYT1. This study expands the number of endogenous compounds that show coordinated modulation of receptors, ion channels, and transporters within excitatory synapses. ChemicalsâAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Sydney, Australia) unless otherwise stated. [2-(Trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) and 2-sulfonatoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSES) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Zinc chloride was diluted from a stock solution of 20 mm in frog Ringer's solution. The stock solution was stored at 4 Â°C and was made up fresh each week. Expression of Transporters in X. laevis Oocytes and Electrophysiological RecordingsâcDNAs encoding the human glycine transporter GLYT1b were subcloned into the pOTV plasmid. The wild type and mutant GLYT1b transporters were linearized with SpeI and cRNA transcribed from the cDNA construct with T7 RNA polymerase and capped with 5â²-7-methyl guanosine using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc., TX). Mutations in GLYT1b were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Oocytes were harvested from X. laevis as previously described (32Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and 50 nl of cRNA was injected into defolliculated, stage V oocytes and incubated at 16 Â°C in standard frog Ringer's solution (ND96; 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55), supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, 50 Î¼g/ml gentamycin. 2â5 days later, current recordings were made at â60 mV using the 2-electrode voltage clamp technique with a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced with a MacLab 2e chart recorder (ADI Instruments, Sydney, Australia) using Chart software (ADI Instruments). Recordings were made using the standard frog Ringer's solution, and, in experiments investigating the effects of pH, the pH of the bath solution was adjusted with HCl and NaOH. [3H]Glycine Uptake AssaysâUptake assays were performed in oocytes expressing wild type and mutant GLYT1b transporters at room temperature (22 Â°C) in ND96, using 2-[3H]glycine (15 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences, Sydney, Australia). [3H]Glycine and Zn2+ were added to the cells at the indicated concentrations. After a 5-min incubation, the oocytes were washed three times in ice-cold ND96 buffer followed by lysis in 50 mm NaOH and scintillation counting. MTSET-treated cells were incubated in 1 mm MTSET for 5 min and washed three times in room temperature ND96 before [3H]glycine uptake was performed. Nonspecific uptake was determined by performing parallel experiments with uninjected oocytes. All determinations were performed with at least 5 cells for each condition, and the experiments were carried out with two batches of oocytes. Charge-to-flux RatioâZinc inhibition of [3H]glycine uptake by oocytes expressing GLYT1b, GLYT1b-H243A, and GLYT1b-H410A and uninjected oocytes was measured under voltage-clamp conditions. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at â60 mV, and 30 Î¼m [3H]glycine, in the absence or presence of 100 Î¼m Zn2+, was applied for 1 min with constant flow followed by a 2-min washout. The oocyte was then removed from the recording chamber and lysed in 50 mm NaOH, and scintillation counting was performed. Estimates of the net charge generated by 30 Î¼m [3H]glycine transport were calculated by integrating the transport current over 1 min using Chart software (version 3.5, ADI Instruments). Analysis of Kinetic DataâZn2+ chelates glycine; therefore, the free glycine and free Zn2+ concentrations were calculated according to the correction methods of Dawson et al. (33Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biomedical Research. 3rd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). In all calculations and figures, free glycine and free Zn2+ concentrations have been used. Analysis of kinetic data was carried out using Kaleidagraph software version 3.1. Current (I) as a function of glycine concentration ([Gly]) was fitted by least-squares analysis to I/Imax = [Gly]/(EC50 + [Gly]), where Imax is the maximal current and EC50 is the concentration of glycine that generates a half-maximal current. For Zn2+ dose responses, currents as a function of Zn2+ concentration ([Zn2+]) were fitted by least squares to I/Imax = 1 â [Zn2+]/(IC50 + [Zn2]+) + R/Imax, where Imax is the maximal current inhibited by Zn2+, IC50 is the concentration of Zn2+ causing half-maximal inhibition of glycine transport current, and R is the residual transport current at a maximal dose of Zn2+. Similar analyses were carried out for the [3H]glycine uptake data and proton inhibition of transport current, with [H+] substituted in the above equation for [Zn2+]. Reported values represent means Â± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Significance tests were performed using two-tailed Student's t test. p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Zn2+ Modulation of Glycine TransportâGlycine transport by GLYT1 and GLYT2 is coupled to 2 and 3 Na+ ions, respectively and 1 Clâ ion (17Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 34Aragon M.C. Gimenez C. Mayor F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), resulting in a net transfer of one positive charge with each glycine molecule for GLYT1 and two positive charges for GLYT2. Application of glycine to oocytes expressing the human glycine transporters, GLYT1b or GLYT2a, voltage-clamped at â60 mV, generates dose-dependent inward currents. Co-application of 100 Î¼m Zn2+ with 30 Î¼m glycine significantly reduced the GLYT1b transport current but had no effect on GLYT2a (Fig. 1). The onset of inhibition by Zn2+ in GLYT1b was rapid and reversible with washout of Zn2+ from the bath solution, which indicates a direct interaction of Zn2+ with the transporter. Dose-dependent GLYT1b transport currents were measured in the absence and presence of 100 Î¼m Zn2+. Under these conditions, 100 Î¼m Zn2+ reduced the maximal glycine transport current by 42 Â± 2% (n = 5) with no significant change in the EC50 for glycine (18 Â± 3 versus 21 Â± 4 Î¼m, n = 5) (Fig. 2A; Table I). This suggests that Zn2+ is acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor of GLYT1b. Inhibition of GLYT1b transport currents by Zn2+ is dose-dependent with an IC50 value of 9.7 Â± 1.9 Î¼m (n = 8) and maximal inhibition of 47 Â± 4% (n = 8) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, application of up to 1 mm Zn2+ to oocytes expressing GLYT2a had no effect on glycine transport currents (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Zn2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GLYT1b. A, dose-dependent glycine transport currents by GLYT1b were measured in the presence (open squares) and absence (closed circles) of 100 Î¼m Zn2+. Data from individual oocytes were normalized to the maximal current in the absence of Zn2+ and fit to the modified Michaelis-Menten equation (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Data presented represent the means Â± S.E. from 5 oocytes. B, glycine (30 Î¼m) transport currents for GLYT1b (closed circles) and GLYT2a (open circles) were measured in the presence of increasing doses of Zn2+. Current measurements were normalized to the current in the absence of Zn2+. The data plotted represent the means Â± S.E. (n = 8 for GLYT1b; n = 5 for GLYT2a). Some of the error bars for GLYT2a are smaller than the size of the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IKinetic constants for Zn2+ modulation of glycine transport currents by glycine transporters GLYT1b, GLYT2a, and site-directed mutantsTransporterEC50EC50*IC50InhibitionÎ¼mÎ¼mÎ¼m%GLYT1b21 Â± 418 Â± 39.7 Â± 1.947 Â± 4GLYT1b-H199A13 Â± 3ND22 Â± 740 Â± 6GLYT1b-H213P23 Â± 3ND24 Â± 448 Â± 7GLYT1b-H239A16 Â± 1ND25 Â± 344 Â± 4GLYT1b-H243A23 Â± 418 Â± 2237 Â± 7831 Â± 6GLYT1b-H410A48 Â± 440 Â± 4>1 mmGLYT1b-H421A25 Â± 122 Â± 12.9 Â± 0.749 Â± 5GLYT1b-E432Q11 Â± 0.411 Â± 116 Â± 332 Â± 2GLYT1b-E432H12 Â± 112 Â± 13.3 Â± 0.530 Â± 1GLYT1b-H588A19 Â± 414 Â± 23.0 Â± 0.949 Â± 2GLYT1b-C116A23 Â± 1ND12 Â± 245 Â± 2GLYT1b-C116A,H243C29 Â± 1ND7.3 Â± 1.218 Â± 2GLYT1b-C116A,H410C48 Â± 6ND>300GLYT2a18 Â± 416 Â± 3>1 mmGLYT2a-A363H,E530H11 Â± 2ND>300 Open table in a new tab In other closely related neurotransmitter transporters, such as DAT and GAT, application of substrate activates an uncoupled ion conductance (35Sonders M.S.

A. 1996; 93: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the effects of Zn2+ on GLYT1 can be solely attributed to a reduction in the rate of glycine uptake rather than alteration of an uncoupled conductance state. This was carried out in two separate experiments. First, [3H]glycine uptake in oocytes expressing GLYT1b was measured. In parallel to observations from electrophysiological studies, Zn2+ potently inhibited [3H]glycine uptake with an IC50 value of 11 Î¼m and a maximal inhibition of 52% (Fig. 5B; Table II). Second, [3H]glycine uptake was performed under voltage clamp conditions to obtain measures of charge-to-flux ratios. 30 Î¼m [3H]glycine was applied to oocytes voltage-clamped at â60 mV in frog Ringer's solution with and without 100 Î¼m Zn2+ for 1 min. In the presence of 100 Î¼m Zn2+, the glycine transport currents and the rate of [3H]glycine uptake were significantly reduced by 49 Â± 6% (n = 6) and 45 Â± 4% (n = 6), respectively, compared with that obtained in the absence of Zn2+ (Fig. 3). The charge-to-flux ratio in the presence of Zn2+ (1.24 Â± 0.04; n = 6) was not significantly different from the value obtained in the absence of Zn2+ (1.18 Â± 0.08; n = 6) (Fig. 3), which indicates that Zn2+ inhibits glycine transport currents by reducing the rate of glycine transport through GLYT1b. The charge-to-flux ratios obtained are also consistent with the stoichiometry of 2 Na+:1 Clâ:1 glycine for GLYT1b (17Roux M.J. Supplisson S.

Estimates of the total charge transfer were calculated by integrating the current measured during the 1-min application of 30 Î¼m [3H]glycine (AâC) and the flux of [3H]glycine was measured by liquid scintillation counting (DâF). Nonspecific uptake was determined by conducting parallel experiments on uninjected oocytes. The charge-to-flux ratios were calculated by dividing the charge transfer by the flux of [3H]glycine and adding proportional errors (GâI). Data represent means Â± S.E. from 6 cells for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have also examined the ability of other divalent cations, Cd2+ and Ni2+, to inhibit glycine transport currents by GLYT1b. Ni2+ potently inhibited glycine transport currents with the IC50 value (8.2 Â± 1.0 Î¼m, n = 4) and the maximal inhibition value (39 Â± 4%, n = 4) similar to that of Zn2+, whereas application of up to 100 Î¼m Cd2+ had no effect on GLYT1b transport currents. Identification of the Zn2+-binding Residues of GLYT1bâIn the following experiments, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acid residues that may form the Zn2+ binding site on GLYT1b and also explain the differential Zn2+ sensitivity of GLYT1b compared with GLYT2a. Histidines, cysteines, glutamates, and aspartates are generally found as coordinating residues in Zn2+ binding sites (37Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity Zn2+ binding site in the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), another member of the Na+/Clâ-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family, was mapped to 3 coordinating residues situated on the extracellular face of the transporter (Fig. 4) (38Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 39Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on the homology between GLYT1b and DAT, we targeted histidine residues and a select number of glutamate residues, which are predicted to be on the extracellular domains of GLYT1b and in similar locations to the Zn2+-binding residues of DAT. Histidine residues at positions 199, 239, 243, 410, 421, and 588 of GLYT1b were mutated individually to alanine, and histidine 213 was mutated to proline because a proline residue is found at this position in the closely related GLYT2 subtype of glycine transporters. Application of glycine to oocytes expressing the GLYT1b mutants H199A, H213P, H239A, H243A, H410A, H421A, and H588A generated dose-dependent transport currents of similar magnitude with EC50 values similar to that of wild type GLYT1b (Table I). All the point-mutated GLYT1b transporters were also tested for sensitivity to Zn2+. Mutations of His-199, His-213, and His-239 did not alter the Zn2+ sensitivity of GLYT1b with IC50 values and % inhibition values comparable with that of wild type GLYT1b, whereas mutations of His-421 and His-588 led to a 3-fold decrease in the IC50 value for Zn2+ (Table I). In contrast, mutations of His-243 and His-410 markedly impaired the sensitivity to Zn2+ (Fig. 5A). Mutation of His-243, which lies in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) between TM3 and TM4, caused a 24-fold increase in the IC50 value for Zn2+ to 237 Â± 78 Î¼m (n = 3) with a maximal inhibition of 31 Â± 6% (n = 3) (Fig. 5A; Table I). Furthermore, mutation of His-410 in the fourth extracellular loop (ECL4) between TM7 and TM8 renders the GLYT1b transporter insensitive to Zn2+, at concentrations up to 1 mm (Fig. 5A; Table I). Thus, mutations of His-243 and His-410 to an alanine residue selectively alters the Zn2+ sensitivity of GLYT1b without affecting the EC50 for glycine transport. This suggests that these residues are likely to coordinate Zn2+ binding to GLYT1b. [3H]Glycine uptake experiments were also carried out in oocytes expressing H243A and H410A mutant GLYT1b transporters. Both mutant transporters displayed EC50 and Vmax values for [3H]glycine uptake comparable with wild type GLYT1b (Table II). In agreement with electrophysiological findings, a low affinity inhibition of [3H]glycine uptake was observed in H243A with an IC50 of 184 Î¼m and, in the case of H410A, [3H]glycine uptake was insensitive to Zn2+ at concentrations up to 300 Î¼m (Fig. 5B; Table II). We also examined the effects of Zn2+ on the charge-to-flux coupling of H243A and H410A by applying [3H]glycine under voltage clamp conditions as described before. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the charge-to-flux ratios for both transporters is â¼1 both in the absence and in the presence of Zn2+, which is same as wild type GLYT1b. Therefore, the glycine-induced current is tightly coupled to glycine uptake both in the presence and absence of Zn2+ in these mutant transporters. Glutamate 432 is located at the extracellular end of TM8 of GLYT1b and is conserved in GLYT1, hDAT, hNET (the human norepinephrine transporter), and GAT (Fig. 4). In DAT, it has been shown that the equivalent glutamate residue is involved in forming the Zn2+ coordination site and, furthermore, substitution of this glutamate residue with a histidine residue allowed Zn2+ to more effectively inhibit dopamine uptake by hDAT (39Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of this residue in the formation of the Zn2+ binding site of GLYT1b. E432Q and E432H mutants were constructed in GLYT1b, and Zn2+ inhibition of glycine transport currents and Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]glycine uptake were measured. Both mutants have EC50 values for glycine transport currents and for [3H]glycine uptake similar to those of wild type GLYT1b (Tables I and II), which demonstrates that the mutations do not disrupt the transport process. The E432Q mutation did not significantly affect the Zn2+ sensitivity of glycine transport currents or [3H]glycine uptake, whereas the E432H mutation resulted in a small but significantly lower IC50 value for Zn2+ inhibition of glycine currents and [3H]glycine uptake compared with both wild type GLYT1b and the E432Q mutant (Tables I and II). Both mutations caused a slight decrease in the maximal inhibition value for Zn2+ inhibition of glycine currents and also for [3H]glycine uptake (Tables I and II). The small effects on the IC50 for Zn2+ and on the % maximal inhibition caused by mutations at Glu-432 suggest that this glutamate residue may play a minor role in the formation of the Zn2+ binding site, but is unlikely to directly form the coordination site for Zn2+ on GLYT1b. Three cysteine residues are located on extracellular loops of GLYT1b. It has previously been shown that application of the membrane impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET to oocytes expressing GLYT1b led to an inhibition of glycine transport via an interaction with cysteine 116, which is located in ECL1 of GLYT1b (40Roux M.J.

Therefore, Cys-116 was examined in our study for potential Zn2+ coordination. The C116A mutant exhibited similar EC50 value for glycine transport currents and IC50 value for Zn2+ inhibition of transport currents as wild type GLYT1b (Table I). Thus, the C116A mutation does not appear to alter the functiona"

These deposits are composed predominantly of amyloid fibrils, the unbranched, Î²-sheet rich structures that result from the misfolding and subsequent aggregation of many proteins. In addition, amyloid deposits contain a number of non-fibrillar components that interact with amyloid fibrils and are incorporated into the deposits in their native folded state. The influence of a number of the non-fibrillar components in amyloid-related diseases is well established; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we describe the effect of two of the most important non-fibrillar components, serum amyloid P component and apolipoprotein E, upon the solution behavior of amyloid fibrils in an in vitro model system. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy, and rheological measurements, we demonstrate that these non-fibrillar components cause soluble fibrils to condense into localized fibrillar aggregates with a greatly enhanced local density of fibril entanglements. These results suggest a possible mechanism for the observed role of non-fibrillar components as mediators of amyloid deposition and deposit stability.

These results suggest a possible mechanism for the observed role of non-fibrillar components as mediators of amyloid deposition and deposit stability. The self-association of proteins into amyloid fibrils and the further aggregation of these fibrils into insoluble deposits is implicated in a diverse range of diseases, including Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases (1Masters C.L.

Sci. 2001; 356: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Over twenty proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in vivo, and the deposits formed by each of these proteins are associated with a distinct disease state (4Westermark P. Benson M.D. Buxbaum J.N. Cohen A.S. Frangione B. Ikeda S. Masters C.L. Merlini G. Saraiva M.J. Sipe J.D. Amyloid. 2002; 9: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of any similarity in primary sequence or native structure among these precursors, the underlying structures and histological properties of the deposits are remarkably similar. The bulk of the amyloid deposit is the amyloid fibrils themselves: linear unbranched assemblies of the specific precursor protein with a core cross-Î² structure (5Sunde M. Blake C.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Deposits also contain a number of non-fibrillar components, the identity of which is essentially independent of the precursor protein comprising the amyloid fibrils. These non-fibrillar components include the protein serum amyloid P component (SAP), 1The abbreviations used are: SAP, serum amyloid P component; apoE, apolipoprotein E; apoE3/4, apolipoprotein E3/4; apoC-II, apolipoprotein C-II. apolipoprotein E (apoE), as well as other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, and proteoglycans. The ubiquity and specificity of the non-fibrillar components of amyloid deposits is such that radiolabeled SAP is used clinically as a quantitative tracer of amyloid deposits (3Pepys M.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, findings that SAP stabilizes in vitro amyloid deposits from phagocytic and proteolytic degradation has prompted the design of inhibitors of the SAP-amyloid interaction. One such molecule is under clinical trial against systemic amyloidosis (6Pepys M.B. Herbert J. Hutchinson W.L. Tennent G.A. Lachmann H.J. Gallimore J.R. Lovat L.B. Bartfai T. Alanine A. Hertel C. Hoffmann T. Jakob-Roetne R. Norcross R.D. Kemp J.A. Yamamura K. Suzuki M. Taylor G.W. Murray S. Thompson D. Purvis A. Kolstoe S. Wood S.P. Hawkins P.N. Nature. 2002; 417: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Despite this growing clinical interest in the effects of non-fibrillar components of amyloid deposits, structural details of their interactions with amyloid fibrils and deposits are entirely lacking, as are details of the mechanism by which they protect amyloid deposits from degradation. In vitro studies of the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation by a number of proteins have shown it to be a complex process, often involving a number of intermediate species and occasional off-pathway aggregates. Although the relationship between this process and the pathogenic mechanisms of the amyloid diseases are unclear and somewhat controversial, the distinct biological properties of the different assembly states of amyloid fibrils are likely to be significant. For example, several unrelated proteins, including some that are not known to form amyloid in vivo, are cytotoxic as pre- or proto-fibrillar aggregates early in the amyloid formation process but not as mature fibrils (7Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 8Conway K.A. Lee S.J.

Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar), and much recent research into the etiology of the neurodegenerative amyloidoses has focused upon this mechanism as an important factor. In the case of the systemic amyloidoses, however, the major cause seems to be direct impairment of organ function by the large amounts of insoluble material deposited (11Pepys M.B. Weatherall D.J. Ledingham J.G. Warrel D.A. Oxford Textbook of Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1512-1524Google Scholar). We have recently developed methodology for sedimentation velocity analysis of amyloid fibrils and demonstrated the utility of this approach as a probe of higher-level association of the fibrils (12MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we extend that work to consider the effect of non-fibrillar components of amyloid deposits upon the association state of amyloid fibrils. As a model system for this investigation, we have chosen the fibrils formed by human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II). Apolipoproteins are over-represented among proteins known to form amyloid in vivo (13Hatters D.M. Howlett G.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and apoC-II has been proposed as a good model for their behavior (14Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent evidence implicates apoC-II amyloid fibrils in the activation of macrophages during the development of atherosclerosis (15Medeiros L.A. Khan T. El Khoury J.B. Pham C.L. Hatters D.M. Howlett G.J. Lopez R. O'Brien K.D. Moore K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 10643-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoC-II fibrils display a simple and homogenous morphology that has been characterized in detail, and which, importantly, is not complicated by the presence of appreciable amounts of non-fibrillar aggregates (14Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This allows the hydrodynamic properties of apoC-II fibrils to be interpreted in terms of their association state (12MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By exploiting this property, we demonstrate an increase in fibril entanglement mediated by the non-fibrillar components apoE and SAP. The capacity of these proteins to modulate the association state of amyloid fibrils may explain their ubiquity in amyloid deposits and provide insight into the mechanisms of fibril deposition in vivo. MaterialsâApoC-II was expressed (16Wang C.S. Downs D. Dashti A. Jackson K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and purified (14Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as described previously. The purified protein ran as a single band on SDS-PAGE. The purified protein stock was stored at a concentration of 40 mg/ml in 6.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 at 4 Â°C. SAP was purified from human plasma (kindly provided by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service) by affinity chromatography on single-stranded calf thymus DNA-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). 5 ml of DNA-agarose was washed thoroughly with 10 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 25 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4, and then with TNC buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4). The washed resin was resuspended in 5 ml of TNC buffer and then mixed with 250 ml of serum and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The resin was removed by filtration, poured into a glass chromatography column, and washed with TNC buffer until a steady baseline A280 nm was attained. SAP was eluted from the resin with 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and then dialysed against this buffer and concentrated to â¼1 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Purity of the preparation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Human ApoE3 and E4 isoforms were expressed and purified as described previously (17Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Amyloid Fibril PreparationâApoC-II was prepared by direct dilution from the stock into the experimental buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with 10 mm EDTA or 2 mm Ca2+, as appropriate) to a final concentration of between 0.2â1 mg/ml apoC-II. ApoC-II freshly prepared in this manner consists almost entirely of monomers (14Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils were allowed to form by incubation of freshly prepared apoC-II at room temperature for 3â7 days, depending upon the apoC-II concentration. Sedimentation Velocity AnalysisâSamples were analyzed using an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with an AnTi60 rotor at 20 Â°C. Protein samples (300â400 Î¼l) were added to double-sector epon-filled centerpieces, with refolding buffer in the reference compartment. Radial absorbance data were acquired at wavelengths of 280 or 292 nm, radial increments of 0.002 cm in continuous scanning mode, and rotor speeds of between 4,000â10,000 rpm. Scans were taken at 5- or 10-min intervals. The sedimenting boundaries were fitted to a model describing the sedimentation of a distribution of sedimentation coefficients with no diffusion (ls-g*(s)) using SEDFIT (18Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Data were fitted using a Tikhonov-Phillips regularization parameter of p = 0.95, and 200 sedimentation coefficient increments in the range of 20â3000 S, depending upon the sample. Weight average sedimentation coefficients were calculated from the resulting ls-g*(s) distributions using the algorithm included for this purpose in SEDFIT (19Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To correct for residual monomeric apoC-II or free non-fibrillar components, which sediment negligibly at the rotor speeds used, we fitted a time-independent background contribution to the overall radial absorbance. Bead Modeling and Determination of Sedimentation Coefficientsâ The procedure for constructing bead models of apoC-II amyloid fibrils has been described in detail previously (12MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fibrils are treated as worm-like chains of n linear segments, each of length l and zero mass. Spherical beads of radius l/2 and mass m are positioned at the vertices of the chain, where l and m are selected such that the average volume per unit length and density of the model match that of hydrated apoC-II fibrils. The orientation of each chain segment with respect to the previous one is randomly determined within a normal distribution, such that the persistence length of the chain is 36 nm, matching that measured for apoC-II fibrils. Protein bound to the apoC-II fibrils was treated in the following way: additional beads were added to the model at regular distances along the fibril, displaced from the fibril axis by a distance l. For computational reasons, these beads must also have radius l/2 and mass m, 2O. Byron, personal communication. corresponding to a total mass of â¼180 kDa, â¼50% more than the mass of the SAP pentamer. In this manner, ensembles of bead models were constructed at each of 7 lengths (44 nm, 87 nm, 170 nm, 440 nm, 870 nm, 1.7 Î¼m, and 5.2 Î¼m), and additional beads representing bound protein were added at regular intervals to give added mass fractions of 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2. The added mass fraction is given by the total mass of the additional beads divided by the mass of the fibril prior to the addition of the additional beads. A total of 100 bead models were constructed for each length/added mass combination, and the sedimentation coefficient of each model was calculated using HYDRO (20Garcia de la Torre J. Navarro S. Lopez Martinez M.C. Diaz F.G. Lopez Cascales J.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 530-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As in our previous method, fibril flexibility was treated by averaging the sedimentation coefficient over each ensemble of models of identical composition but randomly varied conformation (12MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Electron MicroscopyâCopper grids (400 mesh) were coated with thin carbon film and glow-discharged in nitrogen. Samples of apoC-II fibrils, with or without non-fibrillar components, were applied to the grid and allowed to equilibrate for 30 s. The samples were washed twice with refolding buffer followed by staining with 3â4 drops of 2% potassium phosphotungstate at pH 6.0â7.0. The grids were air-dried and examined using a JEOL 2000FX transmission electron microscope (Brooksvale, NSW, Australia) operating at 120 kV. Micrographs were recorded at nominal magnifications of Ã40,000. RheologyâAliquots of 1.0 mg/ml apoC-II amyloid fibrils were incubated at room temperature with 0.3 mg/ml SAP and 2 mm Ca2+ for 24 h before measurement. To obtain accurate viscoelastic profiles, solvent viscosities were raised prior to measurement by the addition of 40% (w/w) glycerol. The addition of glycerol caused no change in the observed sedimentation behavior of the system after correction for the change in solvent viscosity, confirming that glycerol does not affect the structure or interactions of the fibrils. Samples were then mixed by gentle inversion 10 times, placed on a slowly rocking platform for 30 min, and allowed to stand for 15 min. This procedure was adopted to avoid more vigorous agitation, which had been observed to disrupt the underlying gel-like structure of the fibril solution. Measurements were made at 20 Â°C using an ARES rheometer (Rheometric Scientific, Piscataway, NJ) using a cone-and-plate geometry with a 50-mm plate diameter and a 42-Î¼m gap. Dynamic Strain sweeps were performed to elucidate the linear viscoelastic region, and dynamic frequency tests were done within this region with 2 or 5% constant strain. Steady-shear rate tests were performed with a 10-s measurement delay and 30-s measurement time to ensure that steady state was achieved. Our initial investigations focused on the sedimentation behavior of 0.3 mg/ml apoC-II fibrils in the presence of varying concentrations of non-fibrillar components of amyloid deposits (Figs. 1 and 2). In all cases, the fibrils were observed to sediment significantly faster in the presence of non-fibrillar components at concentrations between 0.05â0.3 mg/ml. The most striking effect was seen in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml SAP, in which the majority of the sample optical density had reached the bottom of the cell within a 5-min centrifugation at 3000 rpm (data not shown). It is not possible to determine a sedimentation coefficient distribution for such rapidly sedimenting material; however, the observed behavior implies maximum apparent sedimentation coefficients greater than 104 S. In contrast, SAP at the lower concentration of 0.1 mg/ml causes a more modest increase in sedimentation coefficient, with the weight average sedimentation coefficient increasing from 120 S for the apoC-II fibrils alone to 171 S in the presence of SAP. When apoE3 is added to the fibrils at a concentration of 0.025 mg/ml, an increase in average sedimentation coefficient of slightly smaller magnitude is observed. This effect is seen to increase systematically with apoE concentration over the range 0.025â0.075 mg/ml (Fig. 2) to a maximum weight average sedimentation coefficient of 220 S at 0.075 mg/ml apoE. The effect of apoE4 on the sedimentation coefficient of apoC-II fibrils is indistinguishable from that of apoE3.Fig. 2Sedimentation velocity of apoC-II amyloid fibrils (0.3 mg/ml) in the absence (A) and presence (B) of 0.075 mg/ml ApoE3. Rotor speed was 8000 rpm, with radial absorbance scans collected at 10-min intervals. For clarity, every second scan was omitted from the figure. C, ls-g*(s) sedimentation coefficient of apoC-II fibrils in the absence (solid line), and the presence of apoE3 at 0.025 mg/ml (dashed line), 0.05 mg/ml (dotted line), and 0.075 mg/ml (dash-dot line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two lines of evidence point to the specificity of these effects: (i) SAP has no effect on the sedimentation behavior of apoC-II fibrils in the absence of calcium (Fig. 1C), and the effect in the presence of calcium is entirely reversible with the addition of an excess of EDTA; and (ii) serum albumin, a protein found at high concentrations in serum but not in amyloid deposits, does not elicit an effect on the sedimentation behavior of apoC-II fibrils under similar conditions and at concentrations up to 0.14 mg/ml. 3C. L. L. Pham, G. J. Howlett, unpublished data. Under the rotor speeds selected for these experiments, neither monomeric apoC-II nor free non-fibrillar components sediment appreciably. On the other hand, non-fibrillar components that are bound to the apoC-II fibrils will sediment with the fibrils. Thus, if the amount of non-sedimenting material is determined in the presence and absence of non-fibrillar component, the difference between these two values will yield an estimate of the amount of free non-fibrillar component in each sample. In this way, we estimate the amount of non-fibrillar component bound to the fibrils. At an SAP concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, 0.27 g of SAP is bound per gram of fibril, corresponding to an approximate stoichiometry of one SAP pentamer per 50 apoC-II monomers. ApoE at 0.075 mg/ml binds at a density of 0.15 g of apoE per g of apoC-II, corresponding to a stoichiometry of one apoE monomer per 40 apoC-II molecules. To determine whether the resulting increase in sedimentation coefficient can be accounted for in terms of the increased mass of the fibrils due to binding of non-fibrillar components, we have modified our previous methodology for the analysis of sedimentation coefficients of flexible fibrils (12MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bead models of the apoC-II fibrils are constructed as before, with the addition of extra mass and volume corresponding to the bound non-fibrillar component. This additional mass is added to the model fibril as discrete spherical units positioned regularly along the fibril. This distribution of additional mass is expected to model the frictional effects of the binding of globular proteins at discrete positions along the fibril. We have also predicted the change in sedimentation coefficient associated with an increase in fibril mass using an approximate analytical solution for the frictional properties of worm-like chains (21Yamakawa H. Fujii M. Macromolecules. 1973; 6: 407-415Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This model treats the additional mass as uniformly distributed by increasing the radius of the cylindrical fibril and, as such, gives the maximum possible change in sedimentation coefficient for a given mass increase, because uniform distribution minimizes the frictional contribution of the additional volume. The results of both of these approaches give qualitatively similar pictures of the changes to the sedimentation coefficient because of the binding of inert mass to apoC-II fibrils. In each case, the change in sedimentation coefficient, expressed as the ratio of the sedimentation coefficient of the fibril with additional mass bound to the sedimentation coefficient in the absence of additional mass (s/so), is found to be approximately linear with respect to the amount of mass bound for fibrils of fixed length. For fibrils with a fixed amount of additional mass (as a fraction of initial fibril mass), s/so is essentially invariant with fibril length for fibrils longer than 500 nm. The results from these models are compared with the experimental data in Fig. 3. The experimental results are plotted as s/so versus the mass fraction of additional protein bound to the fibrils, with s and so values calculated as weight averages from the sedimentation coefficient distributions in Figs. 1C and 2C, and the mass of bound protein determined from the non-sedimenting optical density, as described above. Similarly, s/so is plotted against the mass of additional protein bound to the fibrils for the two model approaches at a fibril length of 870 nm. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the observed changes in sedimentation coefficient are not consistent with our models, which are based upon a simple increase in fibril mass and volume because of the binding of non-fibrillar components. This is evident not only from the fact that the observed changes are much larger than predicted by any of the models; it is also suggested from the dramatic concentration dependence observed for the SAP-induced effect, by which SAP at 0.3 mg/ml induces increases in the sedimentation coefficient of at least two orders of magnitude. This behavior is in clear contrast to the predictions of our models, in which the relationship between s/so and mass bound is approximately linear and has a maximal gradient of 1. As such, the observed behavior suggests that the effect of SAP on the sedimentation behavior of apoC-II fibrils is due to higher order interactions between SAP and the fibrils rather than simple one-to-one binding. Although the effect of apoE at the concentrations studied is less dramatic than the effect of SAP at 0.3 mg/ml, the apoE-induced changes in sedimentation coefficient exceed those predicted theoretically by more than a factor of five. Thus, it is likely that both SAP and apoE promote higher order interactions between apoC-II fibrils. To explore the structural basis for the observed changes in sedimentation coefficient and thus to shed light on the interaction of non-fibrillar components of amyloid deposits, we examined apoC-II fibrils in the presence and absence of SAP (Fig. 4) and apoE (Fig. 5) by electron microscopy. In the absence of non-fibrillar components, apoC-II fibrils can be seen as the long, twisted ribbons we have characterized in detail elsewhere (14Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Hatters D.M. MacRaild C.A. Daniels D.R. Gosal W.S. Thomson N.H. Jones J.A. Davis J.J. MacPhee C.E.

J. 2003; 85: 3979-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), distributed in a uniform and apparently random fashion over the electron microscopy grid. In the presence of SAP and calcium, the fibrous morphology of the apoC-II remains unchanged, and small ring-like structures can be seen bound along the fibrils. Identical structures are seen when solutions of SAP alone are imaged under identical conditions, and the shape and size of these structures is consistent with that of the SAP pentamer (23Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The distribution of the fibrils in the presence of SAP and calcium is markedly different from that in the absence of SAP, however, with the SAP-bound fibrils displaying a less uniform, more âclumpedâ distribution. Similarly, the presence of apoE has no effect on the fibrillar morphology of apoC-II, but instead it results in the apparent clumping or bundling of the fibrils.Fig. 5Negatively stained electron micrographs of apo C-II fibrils formed at 0.4 mg/ml before (A) and after the addition of 0.05 mg/ml apoE3 (B). Bar, 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This observation raises the possibility that SAP and apoE change the conformation or flexibility of the fibrils, and that these changes might have an impact on the observed sedimentation behavior. To address this question, we calculated sedimentation coefficients from the analytical approximation of Yamakawa and Fujii (21Yamakawa H. Fujii M. Macromolecules. 1973; 6: 407-415Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar) for fibrils of varying persistence length. This revealed that changes to the persistence length by a factor of two produced corresponding changes in the sedimentation coefficient of less than 25%. Thus, any small change in persistence length that may be caused by SAP is not likely to contribute greatly to the observed change in sedimentation coefficient. To relate this observation to the solution properties and interactions of the fibrils, we performed oscillatory rheological measurements on solutions of apoC-II fibrils in the absence and presence of SAP. These measurements yielded the viscoelastic spectra shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of SAP, apoC-II fibrils behave as a very weak physical gel, with both the storage modulus, Gâ², and the loss modulus, Gâ³, showing only a weak dependence upon frequency over the range measured and with the value of Gâ² exceeding that of Gâ³ over the whole range of frequencies explored. Such behavior is consistent with a model of the fibril solution as a network of interacting fibrils that spans the entire solution volume. As indicated by the large value of Gâ², this transient network is able to efficiently store the applied stress through conformational deformations that subsequently relax. The frequency at which Gâ² and Gâ³ are equal in magnitude is a measure of the timescale of this mechanical stress relaxation in the sample. In the case of apoC-II fibrils alone, this value lies outside of the experimentally accessible frequency range, suggesting relaxation times of at least several seconds.

The 108M and 108V variants are reported to differ in their thermal stability, with 108M COMT losing catalytic activity more rapidly. Because human s-COMT contains seven cysteine residues and includes CXXC and CXXS motifs that are associated with thiol-disulfide redox reactions, we examined the effects of reducing and oxidizing conditions on the enzyme. In the absence of a reductant 108M s-COMT lost activity more rapidly than 108V, whereas in the presence of 4 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) we found no significant differences in the stability of the two variants at 37 Â°C. DTT also restored most of the activity that was lost upon incubation at 37 Â°C in the absence of DTT. Mass spectrometry showed that cysteines 188 and 191 formed an intramolecular disulfide bond when s-COMT was incubated with oxidized glutathione, whereas cysteines 69, 95, 157, and 173 formed protein-glutathione adducts. Replacing Cys-95 by serine protected 108M s-COMT against inactivation in the absence of a reductant; C33S and Cys-188 mutations had little effect, and C69S was destabilizing. The sequences surrounding the reactive cysteine residues of human s-COMT and other proteins that form glutathione adducts at identified sites all include Pro and/or Gly and most include a hydrogen-bonding residue, suggesting that glutathiolation at conserved sites plays a physiologically important role.

It plays important roles in the metabolism of catechol estrogens and the degradation of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine and epinephrine. COMT is produced as both a soluble protein with 221 residues (s-COMT, 25 kDA) and a membrane-bound protein with an additional 50 residues at the N terminus (mb-COMT, 30 kDa) (1Huh M.M. Friedhoff A.J.

The association of the 108/158M allele with mental dysfunction is particularly strong in patients with velocardiofacial syndrome, who lack the gene for COMT entirely on one copy of chromosome 22 and, thus, may be especially sensitive to the allele on the other copy (8Lachman H.M.

No high-resolution structures of human COMT have been described. However, crystal structures of rat s-COMT in complex with SAM and catechol inhibitors are known (39Vidgren J. Svensson L. Lundstrom K.

Engl. 2001; 40: 4040-4042Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the human protein probably is similar in structure because the amino acid sequences are 81% identical (see Figs. 1 and 2). The central structural motif, a seven-stranded Î²-sheet with helices on either side, is also characteristic of other SAM-dependent methyltransferases (42Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The SAM binding domain of human histamine methyltransferase, for example, is superimposable on rat s-COMT with a root mean square deviation of 2.9 AÌ over 156 CÎ± atoms (42Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The variable residue 108 of s-COMT is located in a loop between a helix and Î²-strand whose distal ends are close to the SAM binding site (Fig. 1). The rat protein has a leucine residue at position 108 and no known polymorphism at that location. Remarkably, however, histamine-N-methyltransferase has a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (105Thr/Ile) at almost exactly the same position. In that case, the two variants of the enzyme have somewhat different kinetic properties but similar thermal stabilities (43Horton J.R. Sawada K. Nishibori M. Zhang X. Cheng X.

Whether the inactivation of the 108M enzyme reflects gross unfolding or a more subtle change in the structure is unknown. Weinshilboum and co-workers (17Aksoy S. Klener J. Weinshilboum R.M. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Grossman M.H. Szumlanski C. Littrell J.B. Weinstein R. Weinshilboum R. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) examined the proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, immune fixation, and photoaffinity labeling, and found no significant differences between the Met and Val variants. However, a possible clue comes from early observations that rat s-COMT loses activity on storage but can be reactivated by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (44Assicot M. Bohuoh C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Of the 20 common amino acids, cysteine is the most sensitive to oxidation; the thiol groups of exposed cysteines readily oxidize to form intra- or intermolecular disulfide bridges. Cysteine is one of the least abundant amino acids in proteins and also has the highest sequence conservation. Rat s-COMT contains four cysteines (residues 33, 69, 157, and 188), whereas human s-COMT has seven (33, 69, 95, 157, 173, 188, and 191). Two of the three additional cysteines in the human protein (Cys-95 and Cys-173) are close to the active site and may contribute to or modulate substrate binding (Fig. 1). The third (Cys-191) along with Cys-188 forms a CXXC motif, which is found in thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, DsbA, and protein disulfide isomerase, proteins that undergo reversible thiol/disulfide oxidation/reduction reactions (45Martin J.L.

Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11214-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In addition, Cys-69 is part of a CXXS motif that is found in many proteins with thiol/disulfide oxido-reductase activities (49Fomenko D.E. Gladyshev V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2285-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fomenko and Gladyshev (49Fomenko D.E. Gladyshev V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2285-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggest that the local secondary structure and hydrogen bonding with the serine hydroxyl group makes cysteines in this motif particularly prone to oxidation. Vilbois et al. (12Vilbois F. Caspers P. Da Prada M. Lang G. Karrer C. Lahm H.-W. Cesura A.M. Eur. J.

They further showed that SAM and MgCl2 decrease the reaction with cysteines 69 and 95 and partially protect the enzyme against inactivation by the thiol reagent, suggesting that cysteine 69, 95, or both are essential for catalytic activity (12Vilbois F. Caspers P. Da Prada M. Lang G. Karrer C. Lahm H.-W. Cesura A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, no intramolecular disulfide linkages were detected via mass spectroscopy in those studies. With the above observations in mind it occurred to us that the reported differences between the thermal stabilities of the 108V and 108M variants of human s-COMT could reflect differences in susceptibility to oxidation or in the effects of oxidation on catalytic activity. The presence of two redox-associated motifs further suggested that cysteine oxidation and/or glutathiolation might be part of a mechanism for regulating COMT activity or, in the case of glutathiolation, for protecting the protein under conditions of oxidative stress. Although many investigators have included DTT or Î²-mercaptoethanol in assays for COMT activity, there have been no published studies of the effects of oxidants or reductants on the difference between the thermal stabilities or activities of the Val and Met variants. To our knowledge, mutations of Cys residues in human COMT also have not been investigated. However, MaÌnnistoÌ et al. (50MaÌnnistoÌ P.T. Ulmanen I. LundstroÌm K. Taskinen J. Tenhunen J. Tilgmann C. Kaakkola S. Prog. Drug Res. 1992; 39: 291-350PubMed Google Scholar) report without details that a C33A mutation destroys the activity of rat s-COMT; the C69A, C157A, and C191A mutant enzymes were said to be active (as mentioned above, rat s-COMT does not have cysteines at positions 95, 173, and 191). In the present work we have compared the enzymatic activities of the 108V and 108M human s-COMT variants at physiological temperature in the presence or absence of DTT. Additionally, we have studied the effects of C33S, C69S, C95S, and C188S mutations on the enzymatic activity and stability of the 108M and 108V variants of recombinant human s-COMT. We also have looked for changes in the redox states of the cysteine residues when the 108M and 108V enzymes are incubated under oxidizing or reducing conditions and have examined the reactivation of the oxidized enzymes by DTT. ChemicalsâS-(5â²-Adenosyl)-l-methionine (SAM), 4â²-hydroxy-3â²-methoxyacetophenone, 1,4-dithio-l-threitol, l-glutathione, isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside, DTT and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, 4â²-methoxy-3â²-hydroxyacetophenone was from Taizhou Dongdong Pharmachem (China), and 3â²,4â²-dihydroxyacetophenone was from Oakwood Products, Inc. Cloning, Expression, and PurificationâDr. David Eaton and Helen Smith (Department of Environmental Health, University of Washington) provided a c-DNA clone of 108V human s-COMT in the Novagen pET22b(+) vector that contains a C-terminal histidine tag. Starting with the 108V clone, we mutated Thr-39 to Ala to agree with the NCBI sequence for human s-COMT (NP_009294.1) and then introduced the V108M mutation followed by C33S, C69S, C95S, and C188S mutations for both the 108V and 108M variants. All the mutations were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DNA from each strain was sequenced to verify the mutation and ensure that no unintended changes had occurred. Recombinant s-COMT was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21*(DE3) cells (Stratagene). Cell cultures with an absorbance of â¼0.65 at 595 nm were induced with 500 Î¼m isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Cultures were centrifuged at 4000 Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C, and the pellets were re-suspended and disrupted by sonication (50% duty, 80% power for 10 min) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C to pellet any insoluble material. The resulting supernatant was passed through a filter with 0.22-Î¼m pores (Millipore) and applied to a 4-ml column of Talon Metal Affinity resin (Clontech). Nonspecifically bound proteins were cleared using 30 ml of wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol) followed by 30 ml of wash buffer with 7 mm imidazole. COMT then was eluted using two 6-ml volumes of elution buffer (wash buffer plus 100 mm imidazole) and pooled into 6 ml of ice-cold storage buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2). This procedure yielded up to 15 mg (â¼0.6 Î¼mol) of COMT per liter of culture. The concentrated protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 Â°C in 2-liter storage buffer and stored at -20 Â°C. To remove DTT and mercaptoethanol, enzyme stocks were thawed, exchanged into buffer lacking a reducing agent (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2) using Quick Spin protein columns (Roche Applied Science), and returned to -20Â°C for storage. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) or, in a few cases, ultraviolet absorbance (52Gill S.C. von Hipple P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The latter gave somewhat lower enzyme concentrations and, thus, higher specific activities. COMT Enzymatic ActivityâThe assay mixture contained 1 Î¼m recombinant COMT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and except where indicated otherwise, 4 mm DTT in a total volume of 250 Î¼l. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 Î¼m dihydroxyacetophenone (Km â¼ 10 Î¼m (53Borchardt R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 54Lautala P. Ulmanen I.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar)), allowed to proceed for 15 or 30 min at either 22 or 37 Â°C, and terminated by the addition of 150 Î¼l of saturated NaCl and 250 Î¼l of ethyl acetate and vortexing. After the mixture had separated into aqueous and organic phases, 150 Î¼l of the organic phase was removed for analysis by gas chromatography. The methylated products (4â²-hydroxy-3â²-methoxyacetophenone and 4â²-methoxy-3â²-hydroxyacetophenone) were separated as shown in Fig. 3 in an Agilent Technologies 5890B gas chromatography apparatus with a fused silica capillary column (30-m Ã 0.25-mm Ã 0.25-Î¼m film thickness, Agilent Technologies HP5), a 95% methyl-, 5% phenyl-silicone stationary phase, and a mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5970B). 1 Î¼l of sample was injected in the splitless mode, and helium at a starting pressure of 15 p.s.i. was used as the carrier gas in constant-flow mode. The oven temperature was increased from 70 to 250 Â°C over a total run time of 15 min. The solvent delay was 3 min. The retention times of the two products were separated by â¼1 min. The products were identified by comparison with standards and by mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron-impact mode using single-ion-monitoring at m/z = 166. A standard curve relating concentration to the integrated peak area of the gas chromatogram was produced for each product. Enzyme activities are expressed as Î¼m methylated products (3â²-hydroxy-4â²methoxyacetophenone plus 3â²-methoxy-4â²-hydroxyacetophenone) formed per unit time (30 or 15 min, as indicated) per Î¼m protein, and the values given are the mean and S.D. of the mean of three measurements. The meta/para methylation ratio typically was between 1.3 and 1.6. Reaction with Glutathione, Proteolysis, and Matrix-assisted Laser-desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF Mass SpectrometryâHuman s-COMT (â¼20 Î¼m) was incubated for 5 h at 4 Â°C in 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm NaCl with or without 7 mm DTT or 5 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG). 10 Î¼l of 5 mm iodoacetamide, an alkylating agent, was then added to 10 Î¼l of protein samples. After 45 min in the dark at room temperature, the protein was digested with 200 ng of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) for 2 h at 37 Â°C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of acetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. The proteolyzed material was analyzed with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager DE-Pro, Applied Biosystems). A 1-Î¼l fraction of proteolyzed sample was mixed with 2.0 Î¼l of matrix solution (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile saturated with Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid), and 1.0 Î¼l of the mixture was spotted onto a stainless steel target and allowed to dry. Positive-ion spectra were collected in the reflector mode. The mass accuracy of fragment ions was Â±1 Da. A standard peptide mixture was used for external calibration. ImmunoblottingâAfter treatment with oxidized glutathione as described above, human s-COMT (20-40 Î¼g) was submitted to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was exposed to an IgG2a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes glutathione-protein disulfide adducts (Virogen). Adherent antibody was detected by reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Bioinformatics and Homology ModelingâAmino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). The CYSPRED algorithm (55Fiser A. Simon I.

The mycobacterial cell envelope contains lipoglycans, and of particular interest is lipoarabinomannan, one of the most potent mycobacterial immunomodulatory molecules. We have investigated the presence of lipoglycans in Tsukamurella paurometabola and report here the isolation and structural characterization of a new lipoarabinomannan variant, designated TpaLAM. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometric analysis revealed that TpaLAM had an average molecular mass of 12.5 kDa and consequently was slightly smaller than Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan. Using a range of chemical degradations, NMR experiments, capillary electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry analyses, TpaLAM revealed an original carbohydrate structure. Indeed, TpaLAM contained a mannosylphosphatidyl-myo-inositol (MPI) anchor glycosylated by a linear (Î±1â6)-Manp mannan domain, which is further substituted by an (Î±1â5)-Araf chain. Half of the Araf units are further substituted at the O-2 position by a Manp-(Î±1â2)-Manp-(Î±1â dimannoside motif.

There is a bewildering range of aerobic actinomycetes, found in almost any environment imaginable, with some pathogenic to humans and others that are not (1McNeil M.M. Brown J.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 7: 357-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The aerobic actinomycetes may be further subdivided into the ânocardioform actinomycetesâ (2Prauser H. Publ. Fac. Univ. Purkyne, Brno. K40. 1967; 196: 196-199Google Scholar). This informal terminology is now widely used to describe a number of organisms with similar characteristics, with key members including mycobacteria, nocardia, rhodococcus, and corynebacteria (3Lechevalier H.A. Williams S.T. Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. 4. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1986: 2348-2402Google Scholar). Unlike the previously mentioned members the genus Tsukamurella is in its infancy, whereas the type strain, Tsukamurella paurometabola, has had a long taxonomical history, with names including Corynebacterium paurometabolum (4Steinhaus E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1941; 42: 747-790Crossref Google Scholar), Gordona aurantiaca (5Tsukamura M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1971; 68: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and Rhodococcus aurantiacus (6Tsukamura M. Kawakami K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1982; 16: 604-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This taxonomical puzzle was finally resolved, when in 1988 Collins et al. (7Collins M.D. Smida J. Dorsch M. Stackenbrandt E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1988; 38: 385-391Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showed that the 16 S RNAs of R. aurantiacus and C. paurometabolum were 99% homologous. And so they proposed reclassifying and renaming this organism T. paurometabola, after the microbiologist M. Tsukamura, who first isolated the species (7Collins M.D. Smida J. Dorsch M. Stackenbrandt E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1988; 38: 385-391Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cases of human infection with T. paurometabola are infrequent, nevertheless diagnosis rates are increasing, typically in patients with underlying predisposing factors, including immunosuppression (8Prinz G. Ban E. Fekete S. Szabo Z. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 472-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rey D. De Briel D. Heller R. Fraisse P. Partisani M. Leiva-Mena M. Lang J.M. AIDS. 1995; 9: 1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), chronic pathology (6Tsukamura M. Kawakami K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1982; 16: 604-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and indwelling foreign bodies (10Shapiro C.L. Haft R.F. Gantz N.M. Doern G.V. Christenson J.C. O'Brien R. Overall J.C. Brown B.A. Wallace Jr., R.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, there are a number of reported cases in which infected patients had no underlying factors, with Granel et al. (11Granel F. Lozniewski A. Barbaud A. Lion C. Dailloux M. Weber M. Schmutz J.L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 23: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) describing an inflammatory cutaneous infection in an otherwise healthy individual. All members of the nocardioform actinomycetes possess a similar whole cell carbohydrate composition, whereas the majority also contain long-chain branched fatty acids, termed mycolic acids (12Goodfellow M. Lechevalier M.P. Holt J.G. Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. 4. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1989: 2350-2361Google Scholar). The majority of our current knowledge about actinomycetes cell wall architecture comes from pioneering studies on mycobacterial strains (13Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Such work led to the identification, within the cell envelope, of a biosynthetically related family of glycolipids, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), 1The abbreviations used are: PIM, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside; Araf, arabinofuranose; APTS, 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate; AsuLAM, amycolatopsis sulphurea lipoarabinomannan; Î±TpaLAM, Î±-mannosidase-treated TpaLAM; CE-LIF, capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence; CE/ESI, capillary electrophoresis/electrospray ionization; dTpaLAM, deacylated TpaLAM; GC, gas chromatography; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bound correlation spectroscopy; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy; HOHAHA, homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy; IL, interleukin; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; LM, lipomannan; mahTpaLAM, mild acidic-hydrolyzed TpaLAM; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; Manp, mannopyranose; ManLAM, LAM with mannosyl caps; MPI, mannosylphosphatidyl-myo-inositol; MS, mass spectrometry; PILAM, LAM with phosphoinositide caps; ReqLAM, rhodococcus equi lipoarabinomannan; t, terminal; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF-Î±, tumor necrosis factor Î±; TpaLAM, Tsukamurella paurometabola lipoarabinomannan. and lipoglycans, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) (13Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Mycobacterial LAM is a large heterogeneous macroamphiphile that possesses three distinct domains, a mannosylphosphatidyl-myo-inositol (MPI) anchor, a carbohydrate backbone, and various capping motifs (14Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate backbone is composed of two homopolysaccharides, D-mannan and D-arabinan. In all species described to date the D-mannan domain exists as a linear Î±(1â6)-Manp backbone substituted according to the species at the O-2 or O-3 positions by single Manp residues. The D-arabinan domain consists of a linear Î±(1â5)-Araf backbone punctuated by branching fashioned from 3,5-O-linked Î±-d-Araf residues (14Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In slow growing mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the capping motifs consist of Manp residues (16Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), resulting in LAM being termed either ManLAM or PILAM, respectively. In addition, a new class of LAMs has been described that lacks any capping motifs (20Guerardel Y. Maes E. Elass E. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Besra G.S. Locht C. Strecker G. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30635-30648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), termed AraLAM. These subtle differences in the capping motifs are thought to explain the different immunomodulatory functions of ManLAM and PILAM. Indeed, a paradigm is emerging whereby ManLAMs possess the ability to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12 and TNF-Î± (21Knutson K.L. Hmama Z. Herrera-Velit P.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar); conversely, PILAM stimulates the production of such cytokines (18Gilleron M. Himoudi N. Adam O. Constant P. Venisse A.

Immun. 1993; 61: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoglycans from other nocardioform actinomycetes have been identified and have been shown to have related, but distinct structures to that of mycobacterial LAM. In particular, they are smaller in size and do not necessarily possess distinct mannan and arabinan domains (24Sutcliffe I.C. Arch.

Few of these studies examined whether these lipoglycans possessed any in vitro biological activity; nevertheless, in a recent publication we have demonstrated that a LAM-like molecule from Amycolatopsis sulphurea, designated AsuLAM, which possessed mannose capping motifs, failed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern (27Gibson K.J.C. Gilleron M. Constant P. Puzo G. Nigou J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in agreement with the findings that ManLAMs can modulate the immune response by inhibiting the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We report here the isolation and structural characterization of a lipoglycan originating from T. paurometabola. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the molecular motifs underlying bacterial lipoglycan mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Bacteria and Growth ConditionsâT. paurometabola, type strain DSM 20162, was purchased from Deutsche Sammlung van Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen GmbH (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), Germany. It was routinely grown at 30 Â°C in GYM streptomyces medium, which contained 4 g of glucose, 4 g of yeast, and 10 g of maltose extract per liter of deionized water supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80. Cells were grown to late log phase, harvested by centrifugation, washed, and lyophilized. Purification of TpaLAMâPurification procedures were adapted from protocols established for the extraction and purification of mycobacterial lipoglycans (31Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B.

The organic extract was removed by filtration, and the delipidated biomass was resuspended in deionized water and disrupted by sonication (MSE Soniprep, 12 micro amplitude, 60 s on, 90 s off for 10 cycles, on ice). The cellular glycans and lipoglycans were further extracted by refluxing the broken cells in 50% ethanol at 65 Â°C overnight. Contaminating proteins and glucans were removed by enzymatic degradation using protease and Î±-amylase treatments followed by dialysis. The resulting extract was resuspended in buffer A, 15% propan-1-ol in 50 mm ammonium acetate, and loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (50 Ã 2.5 cm) and eluted with 400 ml of buffer A at 5 ml/h, enabling the removal of non-lipidic moieties (22Nigou J.

The resulting lipoglycans were resuspended in buffer C, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8, to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (50 Ã 2.5 cm) and eluted with buffer C at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions (1.25 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by periodic acid-silver nitrate staining. The resulting lipoglycan fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively against water, lyophilized, and stored at â20 Â°C. Preparation of Chemically or Enzymatically Modified TpaLAMâ Deacylated TpaLAM (dTpaLAM) was obtained by incubating 100 Î¼g of TpaLAM with 200 Î¼l of 0.1 n NaOH for 2 h at 37 Â°C. The reaction was stopped by extensive dialysis against water. TpaLAM lipomannan core (i.e. mild acid hydrolyzed TpaLAM, mahTpaLAM) was prepared by mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl at 110 Â°C for 25 min) of TpaLAM. TpaLAM lipomannan core was recovered after dialysis against water and analyzed for carbohydrate content via capillary electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) as described below. Î±-Exomannosidase-treated TpaLAM (Î±TpaLAM) was prepared by incubating TpaLAM (100 Î¼g) for 6 h at 37 Â°C in 30 Î¼l of a jack bean Î±-mannosidase (Sigma) solution (2 mg/ml, 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 1 mm ZnSO4). After a second addition of 50 Î¼l of enzyme solution, the reaction was continued overnight. The reaction products were then dialyzed against 50 mm NH4CO3, pH 7.6. Elimination of Î±-mannosidase was achieved by denaturation (2 min at 110 Â°C) followed by overnight tryptic digestion (37 Â°C, 3.2 Î¼g of trypsin). Î±TpaLAM was recovered after dialysis against water and analyzed for cap contents by CE-LIF (22Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF/MSâThe matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at a concentration of 10 Î¼g/Î¼l in a mixture of water/ethanol (1:1, v/v). 0.5 Î¼l of TpaLAM, at a concentration of 10 Î¼g/Î¼l, was mixed with 0.5 Î¼l of the matrix solution. Analyses were performed on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using linear mode detection. Mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode using a 300-ns time delay with a grid voltage of 94% of full accelerating voltage (20 kV) and a guide wire voltage of 0.1%. The mass spectra were mass assigned using external calibration. Fatty Acid Analysisâ200 Î¼g of TpaLAM was deacylated using strong alkaline hydrolysis (200 Î¼lof1 m NaOH at 110 Â°C for 2 h). The reaction mixture was neutralized with HCl, and the liberated fatty acids were extracted three times with chloroform and, after drying under nitrogen, were methylated using three drops of 10% (w/w) BF3 in methanol (Fluka) at 60 Â°C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of water and the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted three times with chloroform. After drying, the fatty acid methyl esters were solubilized in 10 Î¼l of pyridine and trimethylsilylated using 10 Î¼l of hexamethyldisilazane and 5 Î¼l of trimethylchlorosilane at room temperature for 15 min. After drying under a stream of nitrogen, the fatty acid derivatives were solubilized in cyclohexane before analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Glycosidic Linkage AnalysisâGlycosyl linkage composition was performed according to the modified procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (33Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). The per-O-methylated TpaLAM was hydrolyzed using 500 Î¼l of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 Â°C for 2 h, reduced using 350 Î¼l of a 10 mg/ml solution of NaBD4 (1 m NH4OH/C2H5OH, 1:1, v/v) and per-O-acetylated using 300 Î¼l of acetic anhydride for 1 h at 110 Â°C. The resulting alditol acetates were solubilized in cyclohexane before analysis by GC and GC/MS. APTS Derivatizationâ1â5 Î¼g of lipoglycans, in the presence of mannoheptose as an internal standard, were hydrolyzed using either strong acid hydrolysis (30 Î¼l of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 Â°C for 2 h) (total carbohydrate analysis) or mild acid hydrolysis (30 Î¼l of 0.1 m HCl at 110 Â°C for 20 or 30 min) (caps analysis). The samples were dried and mixed with 0.3 Î¼l of 0.2 m 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate (APTS) (Interchim, MontlucÌ§on, France) in 15% acetic acid and 0.3 Î¼l of a 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride solution dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture was heated at 55 Â°C for 90 min and subsequently quenched by the addition of 20 Î¼l of water. A 2-Î¼l solution of the APTS derivatized solution was diluted 10-fold before being subjected to capillary electrophoresis. CE-LIFâAnalyses were performed on a P/ACE capillary electrophoresis system (Beckman Instruments, Inc.) with the cathode on the injection side and the anode on the detection side (reverse polarity). The electropherograms were acquired and stored on a Dell XPS P60 computer using the System Gold software package (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). APTS derivatives were loaded by applying 0.5 p.s.i. (3.45 kPa) vacuum for 5 s (6.5 nl injected). Separations were performed using an uncoated fused-silica capillary column (Sigma, Division Supelco, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France) of 50-Î¼m internal diameter with 40 cm of effective length (47-cm total length). Analyses were carried out at a temperature of 25 Â°C with an applied voltage of 20 kV using acetic acid 1% (w/v), triethylamine 30 mm in water, pH 3.5, as running electrolyte. The detection system consisted of a Beckman laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) equipped with a 4-milliwatt argon-ion laser with the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength filter of 520 nm. CE-ESI/MSâAnalyses were performed on a CE system P/ACEâ¢ MDQ (Beckman Coulter, Inc) with a 75-Î¼m Ã 80-cm fused-silica capillary. The outlet was integrated into the electrospray ionization (ESI) needle that was directly coupled to an ion trap MS system (LCQâ¢ DUO, ThermoFinnigan, Inc.). Separations were carried out with an electrolyte composed of acid acetic (1%, v/v), triethylamine (30 mm), pH 3.5, and an applied voltage of â20 kV. Migration was monitored by the total ion current. During analysis, temperature was constantly maintained (25 Â°C) along the capillary, and the outlet end of the capillary was at a spray voltage of 4 kV. The sheath liquid, consisting of water: isopropanol (20:80), was infused to the ESI needle through a syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 Î¼l minâ1 using nitrogen as a nebulizing gas. For measurements, negative mode was used and all data were collected and analyzed on Xcalibur software. NMR SpectroscopyâNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer equipped with a double resonance (1H/X)-BBi z-gradient probe head. TpaLAM (10 mg) was exchanged in D2O (D, 99.97% from Euriso-top, Saint-Aubin, France), with intermediate lyophilization, then re-dissolved in 0.4 ml of Me2SO-d6 (D, 99.8% from Euriso-top, Saint-Aubin, France) and analyzed in 200 Ã 5 mm 535-PP NMR tubes at 343 K. Data were processed on a Bruker-X32 workstation using the xwinnmr program. Proton and carbon chemical shifts are expressed in ppm and referenced relative to internal Me2SO signals at Î´H 2.52 and Î´C 40.98. The one dimensional (1D) proton (1H) spectrum was recorded using a 90Â° tipping angle for the pulse and 1 s as recycle delay between each of the 128 acquisitions of 1.64 s. The spectral width of 2948 Hz was collected in 16,000 complex points that were multiplied by a Gaussian function (LB = â1, GB = 0.2) prior to processing to 32,000 real points in the frequency domain. After Fourier transformation, the spectra were baseline-corrected with a fourth order polynomial function. Two-dimensional (2D) spectra were recorded without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment (TPPI) method. The 2D 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) were recorded in the proton-detected mode with a Bruker 5-mm 1H broad band tunable probe with reverse geometry. The Globally optimized Alternating-phase Rectangular Pulses sequence (34Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) at the carbon frequency was used as a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. The 1H-13C HMQC spectrum was obtained according to Bax and Subramanian pulse sequence (35Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). Spectral widths of 25,154 Hz in 13C and 2,948 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 2,048 Ã 413 (TPPI) point data matrix with 80 scans/t1 value expanded to 4,096 Ã 1,024 by zero filling. The relaxation delay was 1 s. A sine bell window shifted by Ï /2 was applied in both dimensions. The 1H-13C HMBC spectrum was obtained using the Bax and Summers pulse sequence (36Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). Spectral widths of 25,154 Hz in 13C and 2,948 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 2,048 Ã 512 (TPPI) point data matrix with 96 scans/t1 value expanded to 4,096 Ã 1,024 by zero filling. The relaxation delay was 1 s. A sine bell window shifted by Ï /2 was applied in both dimensions. The 2D 1H-1H HOHAHA spectrum was recorded using a MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 112 ms (37Bax A. Davies D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The spectral width was 2,948 Hz in both F2 and F1 dimensions. 512 spectra of 4,096 data points with 24 scans/t1 increment were recorded. TNF-Î± Production by MacrophagesâTHP-1 and J774 monocyte/macrophage human and murine cell lines, respectively, were maintained in continuous culture with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C, THP-1 as non-adherent and J774 as adherent cells. Purified native or modified TpaLAM were added in duplicate or triplicate to monocyte/macrophage cells (5 Ã 105 cells/well) in 24-well culture plates and then incubated for 20 h at 37 Â°C. Stimuli were previously incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C in the presence or absence of 10 Î¼g/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) known to inhibit the effect of (contaminating) LPS (23Adams L.B. Fukutomi Y. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the TLR dependence of TNF-Î±-inducing TpaLAM activity, monoclonal anti-TLR-2 (clone TL2.1, eBioscience) or anti-TLR-4 (clone HTA125, Serotec) antibodies or an IgG2a isotype control (clone eBM2a, eBioscience) at a concentration of 10 Î¼g/ml were added together with TpaLAM to THP-1 cells. Supernatants from THP-1 cells were assayed for TNF-Î± by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercially available kits and according to manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Supernatants from J774 cells were assayed for TNF-Î± using the previously described cytotoxic assay against WEHI164 clone 13 cells (38Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Basically, 50 Î¼l of supernatant was added to 50 Î¼lof WEHI cells (5 Ã 105 cells/ml) in flat-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 20 h at 37 Â°C, then 50 Î¼l of tetrazolium salts (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) were added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Formazan crystals were solubilized with 100 Î¼l of lysis buffer (N,N-dimethyl formamide, 30% SDS (1:2) adjusted to pH 4.7 with acetic acid), and the optical density was read at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). The TNF-Î± content of supernatants was determined by comparing to a reference curve obtained using serial dilutions of human recombinant TNF-Î± (Invitrogen). LPS was from Escherichia coli 055:B5 (Sigma) and Man-LAM from Mycobacterium bovis BCG. A lipoglycan with a SDS-PAGE migration similar to that of M. tuberculosis LAM was purified from T. paurometabola (Fig. 1A). The negative MALDI mass spectrum of the lipoglycan exhibited a broad unresolved peak centered at m/z 12500, indicating a molecular mass around 12.5 kDa for the major molecular species of this lipoglycan (Fig. 1B). CE-LIF analysis of the total acid hydrolyzed lipoglycan showed that it contained Ara and Man, in a ratio of 1:1.7. In addition, myo-inositol, glycerol, and fatty acids were also detected by GC analysis. The predominant fatty acids identified were palmitic (C16:0, 50%) and octadecenoic (C18:1, 20%), with smaller amounts of stearic (C18:0, 15%) and tuberculostearic (methyl-10-methyloctadecanoic, C19:0, 15%) acids. Altogether, the lipoglycan exhibited the basic components of a structure related to mycobacterial LAM and was subsequently termed TpaLAM. NMR Signal AssignmentâPer-O-methylation analysis of TpaLAM indicated the presence of 5-Araf, t-Manp, 2,5-Araf, and 2-Manp residues in similar ratios, with slightly less 6-Manp detectable. Accordingly, the 1H-NMR anomeric region of TpaLAM exhibited five anomeric signals at Î´ 5.07 (I1), Î´ 5.02 (II1), Î´ 4.94 (III1), Î´ 4.85 (IV1), and Î´ 4.71 (V1), in a ratio 1.4/1.5/1.8/1.5/1 (Fig. 2A). As revealed by the 1H-13C HMQC spectrum, their corresponding anomeric carbons resonate at Î´ 99.5 (I1), Î´ 107.1 (II1), Î´ 103.1 (III1), Î´ 109.3 (IV1), and Î´ 100.7 (V1), respectively (Fig. 2D). Proton and carbon resonances of the different spin systems were assigned from 1H-13C HMQC and 1H-1H HOHAHA experiments (partially shown in Figs. 2C, 2D, and Fig. 3, respectively) and were based on our previous studies with mycobacterial LAMs (17Venisse A.

https://openalex.org/W1992663828,"Upon binding to androgen, androgen receptor (AR) can activate expression of target genes through its direct binding to the androgen-responsive elements (AREs), which are located within the target gene promoters and/or enhancers. A number of cellular proteins have been identified as co-regulators to regulate this transactivation process. One common structural feature among these co-regulators is the presence of the LXXLL motif (X, any amino acid), the so-called nuclear receptor (NR) box, through which binding of these regulatory proteins to AR occurs. We have recently shown that Tip110 functions to potentiate the transactivation activity of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) Tat protein. In this study, we report that Tip110 is a potent AR-binding protein that can suppress AR activity. Tip110 bound to AR in an NR box-dependent manner and inhibited AREs-mediated reporter gene expression. The inhibitory effects were abolished by removal of the NR box. Moreover, knock-down of the constitutive Tip110 expression significantly augmented AR transcriptional activation. In agreement with these findings, Tip110 overexpression blocked the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene, a well characterized target gene of AR from expression in LNCaP cells. Further analysis revealed that Tip110 prevented the complex formation between AR and AREs. Taken together, these results indicate that Tip110 is a negative regulator of AR transcriptional activation, and may be directly involved in AR-related developmental, physiological, and pathological processes.

These include male sexual differentiation, maturation, and spermatogenesis, and primary prostate cancer growth in prostate cancer patients (3Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K.

Thus, it is conceivable that changes in AR, androgen, or interaction between AR and androgen have been noted in male infertility, androgen insensitivity, and tumorigenesis. Structurally, AR is divided into four functional domains: the NH2-terminal transactivation domain (or A/B domain), the DNA binding domain (DBD), hinge region, and the COOH-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (7Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6085) Google Scholar). Two transcriptional activation functions have been identified in AR. One is at the NH2-terminal (AF1) and functions in a ligand-independent manner, whereas the other located within the LBD requires AR ligand for its function (AF2) (8Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D.

The DBD consists of two zinc fingers that recognize specific DNA consensus sequences called AR-responsive elements (AREs) (11Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B.A. Dahlman K. Freedman L.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Yamamoto K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Kaptein R. Science. 1990; 249: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). AR binds to AREs as a homodimer, or in a heterodimer with other steroid hormone receptors. Androgen functions by binding to and inducing a conformational change in AR. This is believed to facilitate interaction between the NH2 and COOH terminus of AR and recruitment of AR co-regulators and subsequent regulation of target genes (12Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A number of co-regulatory proteins have been identified to interact with AR and modulate AR transcriptional activation in a positive manner (co-activators) or a negative manner (co-repressors) (14Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In general, the co-regulators themselves do not possess specific DNA binding property (12Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 15McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

There are multiple mechanisms by which co-regulators affect AR transcriptional activation. Some co-regulators function with AR at the target gene promoter to facilitate DNA occupancy, chromatin remodeling, or recruitment of general transcription factors associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Some co-regulators exert their effects through direct regulation of AR folding, stability, and nuclear translocation, ligand binding, intramolecular interaction between the NH2 and the COOH domains, or signal transduction (14Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In addition, several co-regulators have also been found to directly modulate the ability of AR to bind its recognition sequence AREs and subsequently to transactivate gene expression (17Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteijn C.Y. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Sharma M.

X-ray crystallographic studies of the highly conserved LBD of NRs have revealed that ligand binding induces movement of helix 12 in the LBD against helices 3 and 5 and subsequently creates a small hydrophobic cleft to be recognized and bound by the co-regulators (31Shiau A.K.

We have recently identified a novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat-interacting protein Tip110. Sequence analysis indicates an NR box present at amino acid residues (aa) 118â122 of Tip110. In this study, we have shown that the NR box-containing Tip110 protein bound to AR and negatively regulated AR transcriptional activation activity. These studies may have important implications for understanding regulation of AR functions in normal physiological processes, as well as for developing therapeutics for AR-related pathophysiological disorders including cancers. Cell Lines and Cell Transfectionâ293T cells and LNCaP cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. For luciferase reporter gene assay and detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, LNCaP cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% dextran charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. 293T cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (38Liu Y.

LNCaP cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 100 nm R1881 (Sigma) 10â12 h after transfection unless otherwise stated, and cells were harvested for protein analysis by Western blot or immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot, or for assay of the luciferase reporter gene activity, or for isolation of total RNAs and RNA analysis by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or Northern blot. In all transfections, pcDNA3 was used to equalize the amount of DNA transfected, and pTKÎ²gal was included to normalize the variations in transfection efficiency. PlasmidsâPlasmid pTip110.His, the deletion mutants ÎCT, ÎNLS, ÎRRM, and ÎNLSÎRRM, pAs-Tip110, and pTKÎ²gal are described elsewhere (38Liu Y. Li J. Kim B.O. Pace B.S. He J.J. J. Biol.

Tip110 mutants; ÎNR deleted for the NR box, L118A (leucine at position 118 mutated to alanine), L121A (leucine at position 121 mutated to alanine), and L122A (leucine at position 122 mutated to alanine); were constructed similarly in the context of the pTip110.His backbone using the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

The pGEX-Tip110 plasmid expressing Tip110 as the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was constructed in the context of the pGEX4T-3 backbone purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ), using the standard PCR cloning technique with oligonucleotides 5â²-GGA ATT CAC CAT GGC GAC TGC GGC CGA A-3â² (EcoRI site underlined) and 5â²-CCC GCT CGA GTC AAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GCT TTC TCA GAA ACA GCT TGG C-3â² (XhoI site underlined and His tag in italics). pGL3.TATA-Luc containing the synthetic adenovirus E1b TATA sequence (TATATAAT) and p4GRE.TATA-Luc containing the TATA and 4 tandem copies of GREs (TGTACAGGATGTTCT) from the murine mammary tumor virus promoter were constructed in the context of the pGL3 backbone (Promega, Madison, WI). pAR.FLAG expressing the human AR tagged with the FLAG epitope at the COOH terminus is described elsewhere (39Wang C.

Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western BlotâCells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before they were harvested for preparing whole cell lysates according to the methods previously described (38Liu Y. Li J. Kim B.O. Pace B.S. He J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23854-23863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were suspended in two volumes of the whole cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm NaHPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% sodium azide, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.004% sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Whole cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation and removal of the cell debris. For Western blots, cell lysates (25 Î¼g of protein) or immunoprecipitates (500 Î¼g of protein) were electrophoretically separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-His (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-PSA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-AR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Î²-actin antibody (Sigma) at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers, followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and then visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Analysis by RT-PCR and Northern BlotâTotal RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.2 Î¼g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified with PSA-specific 5â²-GGCAGGTGCTTGTAGCCTCTC-3â² and 5â²-CACCCGAGCAGGTGCTTTTGC-3â²) using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The PCR program consisted of 2 min of denaturation at 94 Â°C, 10 cycles of amplifications with 45 s of elongation time, followed by 25 cycles of amplifications with 45 s of elongation time plus 5 s for each cycle. The expected PCR DNA products were about 522 bp in length. The human Î²-actin gene was included in the RT-PCR as an internal control, with primers 5â²-CAGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAGGTC-3â² and 5â²-CAGGTCATCACCATTGGCAATCAG-3â², and the expected PCR DNA was 139 bp in length. For Northern blots, total RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells as described above, and 25 Î¼g of RNA was fractionated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 18 and 28 S rRNAs, and the PSA mRNA was detected by hybridization with the 32P-labeled 522-bp PSA probe (the RT-PCR product). The probe was prepared using the random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). Recombinant Protein PurificationâGST-Tip110 and GST proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. Bacteria harboring the pGST-Tip110 or pGEX-4T-3 plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin at 26 Â°C overnight, diluted by 1:20 with fresh LB media, and allowed to grow until the OD600 of the culture reached 0.6. To induce the fusion protein expression, isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-galactoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the culture was continued for 3 h. The bacteria were then lysed in a lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm benzamidine, and 200 Î¼g/ml lysozyme and sonicated. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation and allowed to bind to immobilized glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pierce Biotechnology). Bound Tip110-GST fusion protein or GST protein was eluted by 0.4 m reduced glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the glutathione was removed by extensive dialysis against PBS. For the full-length recombinant AR protein, preparation of baculovirus stock, infection of SF9 cells, and AR purification were performed exactly as previously described (40Zhu Z. Bulgakov O.V. Scott S.S. Dalton J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The purity of GST, Tip110-GST, and AR protein was determined to be higher than 95% by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)âThe double-stranded AR DNA binding fragment ARE was made by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides: 5â²-GAAGTCTGGTACAGGGTGTTCTTTTTG-3â² and 5â²-CAAAAAGAACACCTGTACCAGACTTC-3â². The ARE DNA was radiolabeled using [Î±-32P]dATP and Klenow enzyme to a specific activity of 5 Ã 108 cpm/Î¼g, removing the free [Î±-32P]dATP. The AR-ARE complex formation was carried out in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 Î¼g/ml poly(dI:dC), and in the presence of 100 mm R1881, unlabeled ARE DNA, GST, or GST-Tip110 protein. Complex formation was determined on a pre-run 4% native polyacrylamide gel (29:1) containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5Ã Tris borate/EDTA buffer (45 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Tip110 Binding to ARâWe have recently identified a new protein Tip110 as a co-transactivator of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) Tat protein (38Liu Y. Li J. Kim B.O. Pace B.S. He J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23854-23863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Further examination of the Tip110 primary amino acid sequence revealed an LXXLL motif between amino acid positions118 and 122. Various androgen receptor co-regulators contain this LXXLL motif, which is recognized by and recruited through the activation function 2 (AF2) domain of AR. To investigate whether Tip110 binds to AR, 293T cells were transfected with Tip110 expression plasmid pTip110.His, AR expression plasmid pAR.FLAG, or both. His and FLAG epitope tags were used to facilitate detection of Tip110 and AR, respectively. pcDNA3 was included to normalize the amount of DNAs among transfections. Expression of Tip110 or AR was determined by Western blot of cell lysates, and the binding by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by Western blot against anti-His antibody. Tip110 and AR were expressed at the expected molecular sizes and comparable levels when they were transfected separately or together (Fig. 1, top and middle panels). Tip110 was detected in immunoprecipitates of cell lysates prepared from co-transfection of Tip110 and AR (Fig. 1, lane 4, bottom panel), but not in immunoprecipitates of cell lysates from AR expression plasmid transfection alone (lane 3) or transfections without AR expression plasmids (lanes 1 and 2). Complex formation of Tip110 and AR was also detected in immunoprecipitates against anti-His antibody followed by Western blot against the FLAG antibody in the cell lysates of Tip110 and AR co-transfections (data not shown). These results suggest that Tip110 was able to bind to AR. NR-dependent Tip110 Binding to ARâBesides the NR box, Tip110 has been found to contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS, amino acids 600â670) and RNA recognition motifs (RRM, amino acids 740â850) (38Liu Y. Li J. Kim B.O. Pace B.S. He J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23854-23863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of Tip110 binding to AR and the role of the NR box of Tip110 in its binding to AR, we constructed a series of Tip110 deletion mutants including the mutant deleted for the NR box (Fig. 2A). Similarly, we transfected 293T cells with the AR expression plasmid in combination with each of Tip110 mutants and determined its binding to each of the Tip110 mutants by immunoprecipitation and Western blot. All mutants except the Tip110ÎRRM mutant were expressed at the expected molecular sizes and at comparable levels (Fig. 2B, top panel). Like the wild-type Tip110, deletion of the nuclear localization signal (ÎNLS), the RNA recognition motifs (ÎRRM), or the COOH terminus domain (ÎCT, amino acids 670â963) retained the ability of Tip110 to bind to AR (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). In contrast, NR box deletion (ÎNR) abolished Tip110 binding to AR (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Interestingly, the mutant deleted for both NLS and RRM (ÎNLSÎRRM) rendered Tip110 unable to bind to AR (Fig. 2B, lane 7), suggesting that in addition to the NR box, intramolecular interaction or appropriate conformation of Tip110 may also be required for Tip110 interaction with AR. To ascertain whether the NR box is directly involved in Tip110 binding to AR, we sequentially mutated each of the leucine amino residues at amino acid positions 118, 121, and 122 to alanine within the NR box. Similarly, we co-expressed these site-directed Tip110 mutants with AR and analyzed their interaction. The results showed no complex formation detected between AR and any of these three Tip110 mutants, although they were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2C, lanes 4â6). In addition, we also co-expressed the wild-type Tip110 with AR in 293T cells and cultured the transfected cells in medium containing dextran charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The results showed no complex formation between Tip110 and AR in lysates prepared from these cells (Fig. 2C, lane 7). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the NR box was directly involved in Tip110 binding to AR and further support that Tip110 bound to AR in a specific manner. Inhibition of AR Transcriptional Activation by Tip110 âA number of AR co-regulators have been identified to interact with AR and function as either AR co-activators or co-repressors in AR-mediated gene expression. Our results showed complex formation between Tip110 and AR. Thus, we decided to investigate the effect of Tip110 on AR transcriptional activation. We took advantage of an AR reporter gene assay, which involves use of an AR-responsive DNA element-driven fruit fly luciferase reporter gene p4GRE.TATA-Luc containing 4 tandem repeats of AR-responsive DNA elements (39Wang C. Yeung F. Liu P.C. Attar R.M. Geng J. Chung L.W. Gottardis M. Kao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32423-32430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and human prostate LNCaP cancer cells, constitutively expressing AR. LNCaP cells were transfected with p4GRE.TATA-Luc plasmid alone or in combination with Tip110 expression plasmid, and the transfected cells were allowed to grow in the absence or presence of a synthetic androgen R1881. As expected, addition of 100 nm R1881 increased AR-mediated Luc expression by about 3.5-fold (Fig. 3A). Expression of Tip110 resulted in a considerable reduction of AR-mediated Luc expression in the presence of R1881, and the inhibition appeared to be correlated with the amount of Tip110 DNA transfected (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, Tip110 expression in the absence of R1881 showed little effect on the basal level of AR-mediated Luc expression (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the inhibitory effects of Tip110 were not caused by decreased levels of AR expression (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in non-prostate cancer cells such as 293T cells by co-transfection of p4GRE.TATA-Luc, AR, and Tip110 (data not shown). These results suggest that Tip110 functioned as a repressor of ligand-dependent AR transcriptional activation. Ablation of Tip110 Inhibition of AR Transcriptional Activation by Removal of the NR BoxâAlthough the NR box has been shown to be important for AR binding to its co-regulators, its direct function on AR transcriptional activation remains largely inconsistent. For example, the NR box in Tip60 is directly involved in Tip60-induced AR transcriptional activation, but the NR box in p160 has no effect on AR transcriptional activation. Thus, we next determined whether NR-mediated Tip110 binding to AR is attributable to the inhibitory effect of Tip110 on AR transcriptional activation activity. LNCaP cells were transfected with p4GRE.TATA-Luc in combination with each of the Tip110 mutants, and the AR-mediated Luc expression was determined in the presence of R1881. Tip110 mutants ÎCT, ÎNLS, and ÎRRM exhibited Luc expression at a level similar to that of the wild-type Tip110, whereas both mutants ÎNR and ÎNLSÎRRM showed no inhibitory effect on Luc expression (Fig. 4). These effects were in agreement with the abilities of Tip110 mutants to bind to AR. These results suggest that direct binding of Tip110 with AR is a prerequisite for Tip110-induced inhibition of AR transcriptional activation. Enhancement of AR Transcriptional Activation by Tip110 Knock-downâOur previous studies have shown ubiquitous expression of Tip110 mRNA in a variety of human tissues and cell lines (41Liu Y. Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10391-10396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To further characterize the potential roles of Tip110 in AR transcriptional activation, Tip110 expression was determined in LNCaP cells. Western blot analysis showed that Tip110 protein was expressed in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2), which raised the possibility that Tip110 may be a constitutive repressor of AR. To test this possibility, we down-modulated constitutive Ti"

The mammalian Ras family of small GTPases consists of more than 20 members including Ras, Rap, R-Ras, Ral, Rin, and Rheb (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). As molecular switches, these GTPases cycle between two conformational states depending on whether GDP or GTP is bound. The GTP-bound form represents the active conformation, which interacts with and stimulates downstream target proteins. In the case of Ras as a representative of the small GTPases, two regions, designated switch 1 (amino acids 32-40) and switch 2 (amino acids 60-76), undergo conformational change upon GDP/GTP exchange. These two regions have been implicated in interaction of Ras with an array of its regulatory and target molecules (3Corbett K.D. Alber T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 710-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar).

In addition to the binding through the effector region, a second GTP-independent interaction between Ras and its effector is required for full activation of the effectors (5Okada T. Hu C.-D. Jin T.-G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6057-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ras acts as a molecular switch of a wide variety of signaling pathways that direct cell cycle progression, survival and differentiation depending on cell types (6Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Being localized in the plasma membrane as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, Ras is activated by GEFs, including Sos1, Sos2, Ras-GRF1, Ras-GRF2, and Ras-GRP-1 to 4, in response to signals triggered by various membrane-spanning receptors. Activated Ras, in turn, interacts with and stimulates a variety of target proteins. Signaling pathways downstream of Ras ultimately modulate specific gene expression in the nucleus. Once its GTP-hydrolyzing activity is impaired by mutation, Ras becomes oncogenic as a constitutive GTP-bound form. Such mutations, in fact, have been identified in various human cancers as well as in carcinogen-induced mouse tumors, implying that genetic alteration at the ras locus is a critical step in carcinogenesis. Rap1, also called Krev-1 and smg p21, is a close relative of Ras, sharing the identical effector region with Ras (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar, 9Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In fact, Rap1 associates with a subset of Ras effectors including Raf-1, B-Raf, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Ral GEFs, and PLCÏµ. Still, the interaction with Rap1 does not cause, for instance, Raf-1 activation and even antagonizes Ras signaling, thereby suppressing Ki-Ras-induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells. These activities are proposed to be ascribable to the tight binding of Rap1 to the cysteine-rich domain, the second Ras/Rap1-binding site, of Raf-1 (5Okada T. Hu C.-D. Jin T.-G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6057-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Contrary to the downstream targets, Rap1 does not share its GEFs, including C3G, Epac/cAMP-GEF, CalDAGGEF1, RA (PDZ)-GEF-1, and RA (PDZ)-GEF-2, with Ras. Although Rap1 exhibits the Ras-antagonizing activity under certain conditions, Rap1 is localized predominantly in the perinuclear compartments including the Golgi apparatus and late endosomes in a marked contrast to Ras, a large population of which exists in the plasma membrane (10Beranger F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, it is feasible that Rap1 exerts its own functions in addition to inhibition of the Ras pathways. Indeed, Rap1 has been reported to mediate activation of integrins and subsequent cell adhesion following extracellular stimulations such as T-cell receptor or CD31 ligation and lipopolysaccharide treatment (9Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, subcellular location of Rap1 pertinent to these functions remains obscure. Both Ras and Rap1 undergo a series of posttranslational modifications in the COOH-terminal hypervariable region, which are thought to be crucial for determination of their subcellular localization (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Initially, a lipid tail (a farnesyl moiety for Ras and a geranylgeranyl moiety for Rap1) is attached to a cysteine residue at the fourth position from the COOH terminus. This is an obligatory event to elicit subsequent processes including proteolytic removal of the COOH-terminal three amino acids and methylation of the COOH terminus. In Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras4A, and N-Ras, an additional membrane-targeting signal involving one or two palmitoylated cysteine residues within the COOH-terminal portion cooperates with the farnesyl moiety. In Ki-Ras4B and Rap1, a polybasic motif consisting of multiple lysine residues near the COOH terminus enhances the membrane attachment. Although the farnesyl moiety is required for membrane attachment of Ha-Ras, it alone does not suffice for targeting this protein to the plasma membrane. In fact, a Ha-Ras mutant that lacks the palmitoylation sites is localized and activated in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (14Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T.

Although the association of Ras and Rap1 with the membrane is primarily because of the COOH-terminal lipid modifications, the mechanisms whereby Ras and Rap1 are localized in specific subcellular membrane compartments remain to be clarified. Here, as a step toward understanding this issue, we have attempted to identify a specific region of Ras and Rap1 responsible for determination of their differential subcellular localizations by employing a series of chimeric constructs between them. PlasmidsâcDNAs for wild-type human Ha-Ras (GenBankâ¢ accession number AF493916) and human Rap1A (GenBankâ¢ accession number NM_002884) and their mutants were subcloned between HindIII and BamHI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) for expression as EGFP fusions in COS-7 cells and into a BamHI site of pEF-BOS (16Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

The cDNA for EGFP-tagged Raf-1 RBD (amino acids 50-131) was subcloned between HindIII and BamHI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2. The expression plasmid for an MBP fusion Raf-1 RBD was previously described (17Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate oligonucleotides. For the construction of cDNAs for Ha-Ras/Rap1A chimeras, the following restriction enzyme cleavage sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis; MluI sites were generated by the introduction of a âCGGâ to âCGCâ mutation at the 102nd codons of Rap1A and Ha-Ras, SalI sites were generated by the introduction of an âATTGATâ to âGTCGACâ mutation in the region of 46th and 47th codons of Ha-Ras and the introduction of a âGATâ to âGACâ mutation at the 47th codon of Rap1A (1-101)-Ha-Ras, and a BssHII site was generated by the introduction of a âGCCCGAâ to âGCGCGCâ mutation in the region of 134th and 135th codons of Rap1A (1-101)-Ha-Ras. The cDNA for Rap1A-(1-134) with BssHII sites at both ends was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. All the recombinant cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Confocal Laser MicroscopyâCOS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and transfected with expression plasmids by using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After culture for 48 h, cells were fixed in PBS supplemented with formaldehyde (3.7% (v/v)) for 30 min. For immunofluorescent staining, fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with methanol for 1 min. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with horse serum (10% (v/v)) for 1 h and then in PBS supplemented with horse serum (10% (v/v)) and a primary antibody (an antibody against the HA tag (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Calbiochem), or lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS, and incubated in PBS supplemented with horse serum (10% (v/v)) and an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor546 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h, followed by washing three times with PBS. Staining of the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum with BODIPY TR ceramide (Molecular Probes) and Alexa-Fluor594-conjugated concanavalin A (Molecular Probes), respectively, was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (18Jin T.-G.

Fluorescent labels were visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss). The protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 and the protein geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor GGTI-286 were purchased from Calbiochem. Preparation of Recombinant Ha-Ras ProteinsâWild-type and mutant Ha-Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, Ha-Ras(NNTKS85-89TAQST), Ha-Ras(NN85-86TA), Ha-Ras(TKS87-89QST)) were expressed as GST fusions in an E. coli strain BL21 in the presence of isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at 30 Â°C for 3 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.8% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 Î¼m GDP, and disrupted by sonication (15 s Ã 5 times). Supernatants of centrifugation at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 Â°C for 3 h. After washing with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA), glutathione-Sepharose beads were treated with PreScission protease (125 units/ml, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 Â°C overnight. Recombinant Ha-Ras proteins without GST were collected and subjected to further experiments. Pull-down Assay for RasÂ·GTPâRaf-1 RBD was expressed as an MBP fusion in an E. coli strain BL21 in the presence of isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at 30 Â°C for 3 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A, and disrupted by sonication (15 s Ã 5 times). The supernatant of centrifugation at 15,000 Ã g for 1 h was collected, and MBP-Raf-1 RBD in the supernatant was immobilized on amylose resin (Bio-Rad). COS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged wild-type and mutant Ha-Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, Ha-Ras(G12V), Ha-Ras(G12V, NNTKS85-89TAQST), Ha-Ras(G12V, NN85-86TA), Ha-Ras(G12V, TKS87-89QST)) were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then serum-starved for another 16 h. Cells were lysed in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 15,000 Ã g for 15 min. The resultant supernatants were incubated with MBP-Raf-1 RBD immobilized on amylose resin at 4 Â°C for 3 h. After washing with buffer C four times, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Preparation of Soluble and Particulate Subcellular FractionsâCOS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmids were suspended in PBS, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h. The supernatant and the precipitate were used as soluble and particulate fractions. Subcellular Localization of Ha-Ras/Rap1A Chimeric ConstructsâTo determine the region that is important for the perinuclear localization of Rap1A, a series of chimeric constructs between Ha-Ras and Rap1A as well as various Rap1A deletion mutants were expressed as EGFP fusions in COS-7 cells, and their subcellular localization was assessed by confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 1). Wild-type Ha-Ras and Rap1A were localized in the cell surface membrane and the perinuclear region, respectively (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3, E and F). The perinuclear location of Rap1A matched well with that of the Golgi apparatus, which was stained with BODIPY TR ceramide (18Jin T.-G. Satoh T. Liao Y. Song C. Gao X. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30301-30307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A chimera composed of the NH2-terminal half of Rap1A and the COOH-terminal half of Ha-Ras (termed Rap1A (1-101)-Ha-Ras) (Fig. 1), which is anticipated to undergo Ha-Ras-type posttranslational modifications at its COOH terminus, was predominantly localized in the perinuclear region, suggesting that the NH2-terminal portion of Rap1A contains a signal that directs the perinuclear localization of the protein (Fig. 2C). To further delineate the region responsible for the perinuclear localization, the subcellular localization of a Ha-Ras-derived protein, in which a central region (amino acid residues 46-101) was replaced by the corresponding Rap1A sequence (termed Ha-Ras-Rap1A-Ha-Ras) (Fig. 1), was examined. This construct indeed localized in the perinuclear region, which was stained with BODIPY TR ceramide, supportive of a role of the sequence between amino acid residues 46 and 101 of Rap1A for the perinuclear localization (Figs. 2, D-F, and 3G).Fig. 2Subcellular localization of Ha-Ras/Rap1A chimeras and Rap1A deletion mutants. COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras (A), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Rap1A (B), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Rap1A-(1-101)-Ha-Ras (C), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras-Rap1A-Ha-Ras (D-F), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Rap1A-ÎN30 (G), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Rap1A-ÎN60 (H), and pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Rap1A-ÎN90 (I), and the subcellular localization of the expressed proteins was examined by confocal laser microscopy.

COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras (A-E), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Rap1A (F), and pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras-Rap1A-Ha-Ras (G), and the subcellular localization of the expressed proteins was examined by confocal laser microscopy. Percentages of cells where the expressed protein is localized predominantly in the plasma membrane (A, âPMâ), mainly in the plasma membrane rather than the perinuclear region (B, âPM > PNâ), mainly in the perinuclear region rather than the plasma membrane (C, âPN > PMâ) or predominantly in the perinuclear region (D, âPNâ) are shown. More than 100 cells were counted in each experiment. Scale bar, 10 Î¼m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next constructed a series of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Rap1A as shown in Fig. 1, and their subcellular localization was examined. Rap1A-ÎN30 and Rap1A-ÎN60 were mainly localized in the perinuclear region, whereas Rap1A-ÎN90 was localized in the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, G-I). Therefore, posttranslational modifications at the COOH terminus of Rap1A are not sufficient for its perinuclear localization, and a region spanning amino acid residues 60-90 may also be required. A Small Region Consisting of Amino Acid Residues 85-89 of Rap1A Is Sufficient for Golgi LocalizationâToward identifying residues of Rap1A that determine the perinuclear localization, various Ha-Ras mutants that contain Ha-Ras to Rap1A-type substitutions of several consecutive amino acids within the region of residues 46-101 were generated, and their localization was examined (Fig. 4). Among them, a substitution of five amino acids (NNTKS85-89TAQST) altered the subcellular localization of Ha-Ras from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region (Fig. 5, A-D). In marked contrast, amino acid substitutions in adjacent regions (FAI82-84YSI and FEDI90-93FNDL) virtually unaffected the plasma membrane localization of Ha-Ras (Fig. 5, E-L). All other substitutions tested also did not show any effects on the subcellular localization (data not shown). We attempted to further specify residues responsible for the perinuclear localization employing two Ha-Ras mutants with double or triple amino acid change (NN85-86TA and TKS87-89QST). Interestingly, both of these mutants were localized in the perinuclear region like Ha-Ras(NNTKS85-89TAQST) (Fig. 5, M-T). However, all single amino acid substitutions between residues 85-89 failed to convert the subcellular localization of Ha-Ras to the perinuclear region (data not shown).Fig. 5Subcellular localization of Ha-Ras mutants containing Ha-Ras to Rap1A-type substitutions in the region of amino acid residues 82-93. COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras(NNTKS85-89TAQST) (A-D), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras(FAI82-84YSI) (E-H), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras(FEDI90-93FNDL) (I-L), pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras(NN85-86TA) (M-P), and pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-Ha-Ras(TKS87-89QST) (Q-T), and the subcellular localization of the expressed proteins was examined.

Scale bar, 10 Î¼m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The subcellular localization of Ha-Ras(NNTKS85-89TAQST) was further analyzed employing several markers for specific perinuclear endomembrane structures (Fig. 6). Ha-Ras(NNTKS85-89TAQST) as well as wild-type Rap1A were colocalized with the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, a marker for the trans Golgi network (19Valetti C. Wetzel D.M. Schrader M. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Kreis T.E. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ha-Ras-(NNTKS85-89TAQST) and wild-type Rap1A were localized in neither the endoplasmic reticulum nor lysosomes as revealed by staining with fluorescent dye-conjugated concanavalin A (20Gurung R. Tan A. Ooms L.M. McGrath M.J. Huysmans R.D. Munday A.D. Prescott M. Whisstock J.C. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol.

Letesson J.J. Van den Brule F. Castronovo V. Wattiaux R. Coninck S.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), respectively. Biochemical Properties of Perinuclear Region-localized Ha-Ras MutantsâWild-type Ha-Ras and three Ha-Ras mutants that are localized in the perinuclear region (Ha-Ras(NNTKS85-89TAQST), Ha-Ras(NN85-86TA), and Ha-Ras(TKS85-89QST)) were produced in E. coli, and dissociation rate constants for mant-GDP were determined (Fig. 7). Dissociation rate constants of three Ha-Ras mutants varied from 3.3 Ã 10-3 (s-1) to 3.8 Ã 10-3 (s-1), which are comparable with that of wild-type Ha-Ras (3.4 Ã 10-3 (s-1)). Thus, the interaction of Ha-Ras with mant-GDP in vitro remained unaffected upon amino acid substitutions in the region of residues 85-89. GTP binding of Ha-Ras mutants in cells was also examined by pull-down assays using GTPase-deficient versions of Ha-Ras (Fig. 8). Introduction of the G12V mutation in wild-type Ha-Ras and its perinuclear region-localized mutants did not change the subcellular localization (Fig. 8, A-E). All of the three perinuclear region-localized mutants bound GTP within the cell similarly to Ha-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 8F). To further substantiate that these mutants indeed exist in the perinuclear region as a GTP-bound from, an in situ detection assay for GTP-bound Ras was carried out (Fig. 9). EGFP-RBD, which specifically binds to the GTP-bound form of Ras, was detected in the plasma membrane when coexpressed with Ha-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 9, B-D). In marked contrast, EGFP-RBD was colocalized in the perinuclear region with GTPase-deficient Ha-Ras mutants harboring substitutions in residues 85-89 (Fig. 9, E-M).Fig. 9In situ detection of GTP-bound forms of GTPase-deficient Ha-Ras mutants. COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2-EGFP-RBD alone (A) or with pEF-BOS-HA-Ha-Ras(G12V) (B-D), pEF-BOS-HA-Ha-Ras(G12V, NN85-86TA) (E-G), pEF-BOS-HAHa-Ras(G12V, TKS87-89QST) (H-J), or pEF-BOS-HA-Ha-Ras(G12V, NNTKS85-89TAQST) (K-M). Subcellular localization of the Ha-Ras mutants (C, F, I, and L) and their GTP-bound forms (B, E, H, and K) were examined by confocal laser microscopy.

Indeed, this Rap1A mutant was not localized in the perinuclear region, supportive of a role of the region of residues 85-89 for the perinuclear localization (data not shown). However, this mutant was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm but not in the plasma membrane, which is presumably ascribed to the lack of COOH-terminal palmitoylation as reported (14Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we next examined a chimeric construct consisting of the NH2-terminal portion (residues 1-134) of Rap1A and the COOH-terminal portion (residues 134-189) of Ha-Ras (termed Rap1A-(1-134)-Ha-Ras) and its derivative containing a substitution of residues 85-89 for the Ha-Ras sequence (termed Rap1A-(1-134)-Ha-Ras(TAQST85-89NNTKS)) (Fig. 10A). Like Rap1A-(1-101)-Ha-Ras, Rap1A-(1-134)-Ha-Ras predominantly existed in the perinuclear region (Fig. 10, B and C). Introduction of a Ha-Ras-type substitution into amino acid residues 85-89 (TAQST85-89NNTKS) caused the plasma membrane localization (Fig. 10, D and E). Therefore, the region of residues 85-89 within the structural context of Rap1A or Ha-Ras is not only sufficient but also required for the localization in the perinuclear region. Membrane Attachment and Lipid Modification of the Mutant ProteinsâMembrane attachment of the Golgi-(Ha-Ras(G12V, NNTKS85-89TAQST)) or plasma membrane-(Rap1A-(1-134)-Ha-Ras(TAQST85-89NNTKS)) localized mutants was verified by subcellular fractionation. Like wild-type Ha-Ras and Rap1A, both Ha-Ras(G12V, NNTKS85-89TAQST) and Rap1A-(1-134)-Ha-Ras(TAQST85-89NNTKS) were predominantly localized in the particulate fraction but not the soluble fraction (Fig. 11A). Furthermore, prenylation status of these mutant proteins was examined by the use of specific inhibitors for protein farnesyltransferase (FTI-277) or protein geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTI-286) (Fig. 11B). The amounts of the unmodified form of Ha-Ras(G12V), but not Rap1A(G12V), relative to the modified form increased upon treatment with FTI-277, whereas GGTI-286 inhibited prenylation of Rap1A(G12V), but not Ha-Ras(G12V). Both Ha-Ras(G12V, NNTKS85-89TAQST) and Rap1A-(1-134)-Ha-Ras(TAQST85-89NNTKS) were sensitive to the inhibitory effect of FTI-277 but not GGTI-286, leading to the notion that both of the mutants were farnesylated but not geranylgeranylated, as expected from their COOH-terminal amino acid sequence, which is identical to that of Ha-Ras. Nascent Ras proteins are not targeted directly from the cytosol to the plasma membrane but instead take an indirect route via the endomembrane system (14Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 22Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Farnesylation of Ras is thought to occur within the cytoplasm because the responsible enzyme farnesyltransferase is soluble. Prior to plasma membrane expression, farnesylated Ras is transiently localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it becomes a substrate for a endoprotease that cleaves the COOH-terminal three amino acids, leaving the prenylcysteine as the new COOH terminus. Subsequently, Ras is methylated and then transported to the plasma membrane. Trafficking of Ras from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane requires either palmitoylation or a polybasic motif. Following palmitoylation, Ha-Ras and N-Ras are suggested to transit brefeldin A-sensitive membrane structures, such as the Golgi apparatus, which are known to be the components of the conventional exocytic pathway. Ki-Ras4B, on the other hand, is likely to be transported along an alternative trafficking pathway to the plasma membrane by virtue of its polybasic motif. In contrast to Ras, the mechanism underlying the determination of the subcellular localization of Rap1 remains largely unknown. Rap1 is found predominantly in the perinuclear membrane structures and endocytic vesicles, although a small portion of Rap1 resides in the plasma membrane (10Beranger F. Goud B.

Geranylgeranyltransferase attaches the prenyl moiety to Rap1 in the cytoplasm, allowing Rap1 to translocate to membrane compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus. Rap1 does not further translocate to the plasma membrane but instead stays in the perinuclear region even though Rap1 has a cluster of basic amino acids like Ki-Ras4B. Thus, a Rap1-specific mechanism that determines the perinuclear localization of Rap1 may exist. In this study, we identified a small segment consisting of five amino acid residues (TAQST) that causes re-localization of Ha-Ras, which otherwise is mainly localized in the plasma membrane, to the perinuclear region in COS-7 cells. This sequence spanning threonine 85 to threonine 89 of Rap1A is not only sufficient but also required for the perinuclear localization of Rap1A. Considering that this region lies between the fourth Î² sheet and the third Î± helix, and is exposed to the surface of the molecule, as revealed by the analysis of the tertiary structure of Rap1A (24Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), a still unidentified receptor protein that specifically recognizes this sequence may direct Rap1A to the perinuclear region during intracellular trafficking. Replacement of two (NN85-86TA) or three (TKS87-89QST) consecutive amino acid residues in this region also caused the perinuclear localization of Ha-Ras, suggesting that the interaction with the putative receptor protein may require only two or three residues given that these amino acids reside within the structural context of Rap1A or Ha-Ras. The KDEL carboxyl-terminal sequence is known as a retrieval signal that directs the localization of many soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (25Pelham H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the TAQST sequence in Rap1A may not act as a signal for the perinuclear localization of diverse proteins because this sequence is found only in Rap1 GTPases (Rap1A and Rap1B). Ha-Ras and N-Ras have recently been reported to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus as well as the plasma membrane, being activated following extracellular stimulation (15Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson R. L. II Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Notably, Ras activation upon T-cell receptor engagement is restricted to the Golgi apparatus, highlighting a significant role of Ras in subcellular compartments other than the plasma membrane (26Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol-responsive GEF RasGRP1 is implicated in the activation of Golgi-localized Ras, which in turn activates downstream molecules, such as ERK, JNK, and Akt, similarly to plasma membrane-localized Ras (26Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 27Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rap1A, when overexpressed, is known to antagonize Ras-induced transformation, which is believed to be ascribed to tight binding of Rap1A to Ras targets such as Raf-1 without activating significantly (5Okada T. Hu C.-D. Jin T.-G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6057-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect of Rap1A may not be accounted for solely by competitive binding to target proteins because the vast majority of Rap1A, unlike Ras, resides in the perinuclear region. Instead, Rap1A-specific signals from the perinuclear region may modulate Ras-dependent signaling pathways. Ha-Ras and Rap1A mutants whose subcellular localization was converted may become a useful tool to test this possibility. Furthermore, Ha-Ras and Rap1A stimulate common targets or downstream signaling pathways in different subcellular compartments with different time courses. For instance, PLCÏµ interacts with both Ha-Ras and Rap1A being activated in the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region, respectively (16Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic BaF3 cells, Ha-Ras is responsible for rapid and transient activation of PLCÏµ upon platelet-derived growth factor treatment, whereas Rap1A induces delayed and prolonged PLCÏµ activation (28Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Likewise, Ha-Ras mediates nerve growth factor signaling in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells through a transient activation of ERK, whereas Rap1 continuously activates ERK leading to neuronal differentiation. Although a role for the GEF domain of PLCÏµ in Rap1A-dependent sustained activation has been suggested (18Jin T.-G. Satoh T. Liao Y. Song C. Gao X. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

The possibility of subcellular compartment-specific or GTPase-specific down-regulation is currently being assessed by the use of Ha-Ras and Rap1A mutants described in this study.

Quantum systems offer the potential of a much more powerful computing technology, however. In their Perspective, [Bennett and Shor][1] discuss an important aspect of quantum computing--the theoretical capacity of a quantum information channel. Although a number of concepts can be carried over from classical information theory, quantum systems have their own unusual properties. Recently, researchers have been able to show that these unique quantum aspects can provide much higher information flow than previously expected.

Curiously, overexpression of c-Src in tissue culture cells results in a weakly or non-transforming phenotype, indicating that it alone is not sufficient for oncogenesis. However, the protein has been demonstrated to potentiate mitogenic signals from transmembrane receptors. This report investigates the requirement for c-Src in breast cancer as a transducer and integrator of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth signals by utilizing the Src family pharmacological inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, or stable overexpression of the catalytically inactive c-Src mutant (K- c-Src). Both methods of inhibiting endogenous c-Src diminished formation of soft agar colonies and tumors in nude mice. The majority of the dominant-negative activity of K- c-Src was mapped to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and C-terminal half of the molecule, but not to the Unique domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, or the N-terminal half of K- c-Src. Further analysis of the C terminus revealed that its ability to inhibit growth localized to the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) of the catalytic region. These results underscore the requirement for c-Src to maintain the oncogenic phenotype of breast cancer cells and suggest that c-Src may be manipulated to inhibit cell growth by the direct disruption of its catalytic activity or the introduction of either the SH2 domain or the N-lobe of K- c-Src.

The mechanism for the abnormal up-regulation of protein expression or catalytic activity of c-Src in cancers remains undefined. Attempts to address whether overexpression of c-Src alone induces cellular transformation have shown that the protein is non- or weakly oncogenic (3Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

Although overexpression of c-Src alone is insufficient, c-Src appears to promote the mitogenic and tumorigenic properties of other cellular proteins. For example, c-Src potentiates EGF-induced anchorage-dependent and -independent growth in murine fibroblasts by mediating phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at tyrosine 845 (Tyr-845) (5Biscardi J.S.

Independent of its role in enhancing immediate downstream signals, c-Src has also been implicated in promotion of cell cycle progression by virtue of its cellular localization to the perinuclear and nuclear regions (19David-Pfeuty T.

Thus, despite its ineffectiveness as a single oncogenic agent, c-Src appears to have many opportunities to promote mitogenic and tumorigenic activity through other molecules. Mutational analysis of c-Src has revealed its functional activity as well as defined its structural components. These studies have demonstrated that c-Src is composed of multiple domains. As ordered from its N to C termini, these domains include the membrane association, Unique, Src homology-3 (SH3), SH2, SH2-kinase linker, tyrosine kinase, and negative regulatory domains. The first 17-amino acid sequence of the membrane association domain, which is also known as the SH4 domain, undergoes post-translational myristoylation (23Kaplan J.M. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Pellman D. Garber E.A. Cross F.R. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1985; 314: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which targets c-Src to the plasma membrane in proximity with membrane receptors and cytoskeletal proteins, as well as to endocytic vesicles and perinuclear organelles (20David-Pfeuty T.

The Unique domain of c-Src, which is the least conserved region among Src family members, mediates protein interactions and is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and the Cdc2-cyclin complex (14Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Gauen L.K. Winitz S. Coggeshall K.M. Johnson G.L. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5877-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Collett M.S. Erikson E. Erikson R.L. J.

The SH3 and SH2 domains of c-Src interact with proteins containing polyproline motifs or phosphorylated tyrosine, respectively (28Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 29Summy J.M. Guappone A.C. Sudol M. Flynn D.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Together, the SH4, Unique, SH3, SH2, and the SH2-kinase linker comprise the N-terminal regulatory half of c-Src. The N terminus is involved in the regulation of the catalytic activity of c-Src and can functionally replace full-length wt c-Src in the proper formation of focal adhesions and cell spreading on fibronectin (30Kaplan K.B.

The tyrosine kinase and negative regulatory domains comprise the C-terminal half of c-Src, and each domain contains a site for tyrosine phosphorylation, Tyr-416 and Tyr-527, respectively, in chicken c-Src and Tyr-419 and Tyr-530 in human c-Src (36Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr-416 has been shown to enhance the activity of c-Src (36Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H.

Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of Tyr-527 by C-terminal Src kinase or CHK, a related family member, inhibits c-Src via an intramolecular interaction between phospho-Tyr-527 and the SH2 domain (39Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 40Roussel R.R. Brodeur S.R. Shalloway D. Laudano A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Auto-inhibition of c-Src also involves intramolecular interactions between the SH3 domain, a Type 2 polyproline sequence on the SH2-kinase linker, and the small N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) of the kinase domain (42Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 43Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol.

Phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-527 or SH2 and SH3 mutations that displace the autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions result in constitutive activation of c-Src and cellular transformation (36Piwnica-Worms H.

The rationale for this assessment is based on its involvement in a variety of cellular growth-promoting pathways and its up-regulation in many human cancers. Other than overexpressing C-terminal Src kinase, several pharmacological means of inhibiting c-Src have been described. ATP analogs, such as PP1 and PP2, competitively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src (49Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Another means of reducing Src activity is treatment with agents such as herbimycin A and geldanamycin, which destabilize newly synthesized c-Src by preventing its association with Hsp90 (50Neckers L.

Src-activated signaling pathways have also been attenuated by compounds, such as AP22161 and UCS15A, that interrupt protein-protein interactions with c-Src (52Rickles R.J. Henry P.A. Guan W.

Bone. 2001; 28: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In our assessment of c-Src as a therapeutic target, we demonstrate that inhibition of c-Src activity in several breast tumor cell lines by PP1/PP2 and catalytically inactive c-Src (K- c-Src) results in reduced anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, in vitro and in vivo. We also explored which regions of K- c-Src were responsible for its dominant interfering activity. The ability of K- c-Src to act in a growth-inhibitory manner localized to the SH2 domain and the C terminus, both independently of kinase activity. Further analysis revealed that the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain contained the predominant inhibitory activity of the C terminus. These results provide evidence that c-Src is a critical component of human breast cancer progression and should be explored further as a therapeutic target in this disease. In addition, the data suggest a novel mechanism for disrupting Src-mediated cellular signaling. ConstructsâA pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) encoding wt chicken c-Src was constructed by inserting a HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the wt c-Src cDNA (from pRL plasmid, gift of J. T. Parsons, University of Virginia) into the corresponding HindIII-EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 vector. Kinase-inactive (K-) c-Src was isolated by PCR from pm430 plasmid and cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 vector. Individual c-Src domains were generated by PCR from either wt or K- (for C terminus) c-Src pcDNA3 vector templates and cloned into the XbaI-HindIII site of the pcDNA3.1 myc-tag vector. Specifically, sequences encoding the Unique domain (residues 1-84), the SH3 domain (residues 85-149), the SH2 domain (residues 150-260), the N terminus (residues 1-260), and the C terminus (residues 261-533) of the chicken c-Src protein were isolated. The first seven amino acids of the c-Src membrane-targeting sequence were added to the N terminus of the isolated SH3 and SH2 domains during the PCR reaction. The sequences of each construct were confirmed by DNA sequencing. K- c-Src and C terminus were confirmed to be kinase-inactive by in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). Similarly, regions within the C terminus were generated by PCR from full-length kinase-inactive c-Src and cloned into the XbaI-HindIII site of the pcDNA3.1 myc-tag vector. One region developed from the C terminus was the catalytic domain of K- c-Src (K- domain, residues 261-519). The K- domain was further divided into two separate structural sections: the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe, residues 261-342) and the C-terminal lobe (C-lobe, residues 343-519). The negative regulatory region (residues 520-533) was also constructed but was not expressible. Additionally, myristoylated versions of the C terminus (Myr. C-term) and K- domain (Myr. K- domain) were constructed by attaching the sequence of the first seven amino acids of c-Src to the N terminus during PCR. Cell LinesâMaintenance of the breast tumor cell lines in culture has previously been described (1Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cell lines, stably expressing either K- c-Src or c-Src domains, were derived by transfection of appropriate plasmids with Lipofectin (Invitrogen), selection by G418 resistance, and cloning by limiting dilution. Clonal populations were screened for expression of the construct by Western immunoblotting. The -fold overexpression of the domains was estimated by comparative Western blotting analysis, using a c-Src-specific antibody directed against amino acids 2-17. Western ImmunoblottingâWestern blotting was performed as described previously (6Maa M.C. Leu T.H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 55Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using purified 2-17 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) to identify c-Src and rabbit polyclonal anti-myc antibody (residues 409-420) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) to identify the myc-tagged c-Src domains. Colony Formation in Soft Agar and TumorigenicityâAnchorage-independent growth was measured as described previously (6Maa M.C. Leu T.H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The indicated number of cells was plated in 60-mm dishes for each of the breast tumor cell lines. PP1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used at a final concentration of 10 Î¼m and added to the culture every 2-4 days. 2- to 3-week-old colonies were stained for 20 h at 37 Â°C in a solution of iodonitrotetrazolium salt (1 Î¼g/ml; Sigma) in water and counted using EagleSight analysis software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The soft agar colony data for the MDA-MB-468 clones expressing various c-Src domains include analysis of two separate clones for each cell type (468 U6, 468 U8), (468 315, 468 318), (468 211, 468 221), (468 N4, 468 N7), and the 468 C terminus as indicated. Assessment of tumor formation in Taconic nu/nu mice was performed as described previously (6Maa M.C. Leu T.H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections and BrdUrd IncorporationâA 50-70% confluent, 35-mm dish of cells was transfected with 20 Î¼l of Lipofectin and 4 Î¼g of plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's directions and incubated in a humidified, 37 Â°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Transfected cells were allowed to recover overnight in growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, after which they were incubated with 100 Î¼m BrdUrd for 17 h. When indicated, PP2 or PP3 (Calbiochem) were added to the growth medium at a final concentration of 10 Î¼m 4-5 h after transfection and again at the time of BrdUrd addition. Alternatively, 50 Î¼m of the inhibitors was added after transfection and not replenished thereafter. BrdUrd incorporation was assessed by treating fixed cells with 2 n HCl for 1 h at 37 Â°C to allow epitope recognition by the FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd mAb (1:15 dilution, Roche Applied Science). Expression of various c-Src domains was detected by coincubation with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-myc tag antibody, followed by a 1:1000 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). ImmunofluorescenceâCOS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the various c-Src domains using Lipofectin as described above. The next day, cells were fixed and stained for expression as previously described (56Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), with either 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal myc-tag antibody to visualize the c-Src domains or 1:5000 dilution of EC10 mouse mAb (at an initial concentration of â¼1 mg/ml) (57Parsons S.J. McCarley D.J. Ely C.M. Benjamin D.C. Parsons J.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 272-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to visualize either full-length wt or K- c-Src. This was followed by incubation with either 1:1000 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For co-localization analysis, antibodies were used in combination. Mitotic VisualizationâMDA-MB-468 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or various c-Src domains using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's direction. Cells were allowed to recover 48 h post-transfection and then fixed. Expression of the carboxyl-terminally myc-tagged c-Src domains was detected by immunostaining with rabbit anti-myc tag antibody and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. DNA was stained with DAPI. The spindle assembly was detected by a mAb specific for tubulin, DM 1A (Sigma), and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Mitotic cells exhibited chromatin condensation and spindle formation. The Catalytic Activity of c-Src Is Required for the Maintenance of Anchorage-independent Growth and Tumor Formation of Breast Cancer Cell LinesâWe have shown previously that many breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and ZR-75-1, overexpress c-Src at levels 5-fold or greater than immortalized normal breast epithelial cell lines (1Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of c-Src in these breast tumor cell lines implies a requirement for c-Src in oncogenic signaling pathways, despite its singularly weak capacity for transformation (3Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Shalloway D. Coussens P.M. Yaciuk P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We first assessed whether these breast carcinoma cell lines required c-Src or its family members to support anchorage-independent growth by utilizing PP1 (49Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar), a Src family pharmacological inhibitor. Fig. 1 shows that treatment with PP1 resulted in a significant reduction of the ability of the three different breast cancer cell lines to form soft agar colonies. The negative effects of PP1 suggest that c-Src or related family members enable these breast cancer cells to grow under anchorage-independent conditions. The requirement for c-Src was further assessed by stable introduction of catalytically inactive (K-) c-Src into two different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 (Fig. 2A). Two clones from each breast cancer cell line were selected for further examination to compare the effects of varying the expression levels of K- c-Src, which is inactivated by a Val to Ala substitution at amino acid 430 (A430V) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that, similar to PP1 treatment, overexpression of K- c-Src reduced the ability of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 to form colonies in soft agar. Furthermore, inhibition of colony formation by K- c-Src was dose-dependent (Fig. 2B). The dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-468 colony formation by K- c-Src was replicated in vivo in a tumor formation study in nude mice (Table I). The MDA-MB-468 stable clone (468 K-8) with 10-fold higher K- c-Src overexpression than endogenous c-Src had a significantly lower tumor volume compared with either the parental cell line or the stable clone with only a 4-fold increased level of K- c-Src (Table I). These results demonstrated that the catalytic activity of c-Src is necessary for maintaining the tumorigenic phenotype of breast cancer cells.Table IKinase-deficient c-Src inhibits tumor formation of MDA-MB-468 breast tumor cells in a dose-dependent mannerCell lineTumor sizeaMean tumor volume Â± SE (expressed in mm3) of eight individual sites was measured at day 23 after subcutaneous injection of 107 cells into nu/nu mice.mm3MDA-MB-468230 Â± 40468 K2â100 Â± 20468 K8â60 Â± 10a Mean tumor volume Â± SE (expressed in mm3) of eight individual sites was measured at day 23 after subcutaneous injection of 107 cells into nu/nu mice. Open table in a new tab The C Terminus and SH2 Domain of c-Src Inhibit Growth of MDA-MB-468 Breast Tumor CellsâThe growth inhibitory effects of K- c-Src suggested that endogenous c-Src-mediated pathways were disrupted through competitive interactions with the catalytically inactive form of the protein. To further characterize the mechanism of K- c-Src action, we assessed which particular domain(s) of K- c-Src inhibited anchorage-independent growth. C-terminally myc-tagged constructs of each domain or combination of domains from K- c-Src were developed and stably introduced into MDA-MB-468 breast tumor cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The isolated SH2 and SH3 domains included an N-terminal myristoylation signal for membrane targeting, because the isolated SH3 domain lacking the myristoylation sequence localized almost exclusively to the nucleus (data"
