The current study examined the potential transgenerational actions of the herbicide atrazine. Atrazine is one of the most commonly used herbicides in the agricultural industry, in particular with corn and soy crops. Outbred gestating female rats were transiently exposed to a vehicle control or atrazine. The F1 generation offspring were bred to generate the F2 generation and then the F2 generation bred to generate the F3 generation. The F1, F2 and F3 generation control and atrazine lineage rats were aged and various pathologies investigated. The male sperm were collected to investigate DNA methylation differences between the control and atrazine lineage sperm. The F1 generation offspring (directly exposed as a fetus) did not develop disease, but weighed less compared to controls. The F2 generation (grand-offspring) was found to have increased frequency of testis disease and mammary tumors in males and females, early onset puberty in males, and decreased body weight in females compared to controls. The transgenerational F3 generation rats were found to have increased frequency of testis disease, early onset puberty in females, behavioral alterations (motor hyperactivity) and a lean phenotype in males and females. The frequency of multiple diseases was significantly higher in the transgenerational F3 generation atrazine lineage males and females. The transgenerational transmission of disease requires germline (egg or sperm) epigenetic alterations. The sperm differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs), termed epimutations, induced by atrazine were identified in the F1, F2 and F3 generations. Gene associations with the DMRs were identified. For the transgenerational F3 generation sperm, unique sets of DMRs (epimutations) were found to be associated with the lean phenotype or testis disease. These DMRs provide potential biomarkers for transgenerational disease. The etiology of disease appears to be in part due to environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, and epigenetic biomarkers may facilitate the diagnosis of the ancestral exposure and disease susceptibility. Observations indicate that although atrazine does not promote disease in the directly exposed F1 generation, it does have the capacity to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease."

Our objective was to provide an update on the validity and reliability of the chronic unpredictable mild stress model, by analyzing the interrelationships among the indexes using stepwise discriminant analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the possible combinations. We evaluated the depressive rats in both the presence and the absence of chronic unpredictable mild stress, using weight change, percentage of sucrose preference, coat state, splash test, open-field test, elevated plus-maze test, forced swimming test, and Morris water maze test. The results showed that 6-week-long chronic unpredictable mild stress produces significant depression and anxiety-like behavior. The combination of body weight change, percentage of sucrose preference, coat state score, open-field score, grooming latency of splash test, immobility time in force swimming test, and platform crossing in the Morris water maze test can effectively discriminate between normal and chronic unpredictable mild stress rats. Strong interrelationships were noted among these indexes in both open-field test and elevated plus-maze test. In conclusion, there might be certain criteria for the combination of behavioral endpoints, which is advantageous to more effectively and reliably assess the chronic unpredictable mild stress induced depression model."
https://openalex.org/W2754799198,"The modern Western diet is rich in advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have previously shown an association between dietary AGEs and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in a population of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). In the current pilot study we explored the effects of dietary AGEs on the gut bacterial microbiota composition in similar patients. AGEs play an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular (CVD) disease. Plasma concentrations of different bacterial products have been shown to predict the risk of incident major adverse CVD events independently of traditional CVD risk factors, and experimental animal models indicates a possible role AGEs might have on the gut microbiota population. In this pilot randomized open label controlled trial, twenty PD patients habitually consuming a high AGE diet were recruited and randomized into either continuing the same diet (HAGE, n = 10) or a one-month dietary AGE restriction (LAGE, n = 10). Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after intervention. Variable regions V3-V4 of 16s rDNA were sequenced and taxa was identified on the phyla, genus, and species levels. Dietary AGE restriction resulted in a significant decrease in serum Ne-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and methylglyoxal-derivatives (MG). At baseline, our total cohort exhibited a lower relative abundance of Bacteroides and Alistipes genus and a higher abundance of Prevotella genus when compared to the published data of healthy population. Dietary AGE restriction altered the bacterial gut microbiota with a significant reduction in Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium animalis relative abundance and increased Alistipes indistinctus, Clostridium citroniae, Clostridium hathewayi, and Ruminococcus gauvreauii relative abundance. We show in this pilot study significant microbiota differences in peritoneal dialysis patients' population, as well as the effects of dietary AGEs on gut microbiota, which might play a role in the increased cardiovascular events in this population and warrants further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2754161296,"Respiratory tract infections such as flu cause severe morbidity and mortality and are among the leading causes of death in children and adults worldwide. Commensal microbiota is critical for orchestrating tissue homeostasis and immunity in the intestine. Probiotics represent an interesting source of immune modulators and several clinical studies have addressed the potential beneficial effects of probiotics against respiratory infections. Therefore, we have investigated the mechanisms of protection conferred by L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 strain in a mouse model of influenza infection. Notably, local myeloid cells accumulation is generated in the lungs after seven days feeding with L. paracasei prior to viral infection. L. paracasei-fed mice showed reduced susceptibility to the influenza infection, associated with less accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs, faster viral clearance and general health improvement. Interestingly, Allobaculum was significantly increased in L. paracasei-fed mice 7 days after influenza infection, even if the gut microbiota composition was not altered overall. L. paracasei-purified peptidoglycan partially recapitulated the protective phenotype observed with the entire bacteria. Collectively, our results demonstrate that oral consumption of L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 modulates lung immunity was associated with an improved control of influenza infection. These results further extend the beneficial role for certain lactobacilli to alleviate the burden of respiratory tract infections."
https://openalex.org/W2755015599,"In poor African countries, where no medical and biological facilities are available, the identification of potential emerging pathogens of concern at an early stage is challenging. Head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis, have a short life, feed only on human blood and do not transmit pathogens to their progeny. They are, therefore, a perfect tool for the xenodiagnosis of current or recent human infection. This study assessed the occurrence of bacterial pathogens from head lice collected in two rural villages from Mali, where a high frequency of head lice infestation had previously been reported, using molecular methods. Results show that all 600 head lice, collected from 117 individuals, belonged to clade E, specific to West Africa. Bartonella quintana, the causative agent of trench fever, was identified in three of the 600 (0.5%) head lice studied. Our study also shows, for the first time, the presence of the DNA of two pathogenic bacteria, namely Coxiella burnetii (5.1%) and Rickettsia aeschlimannii (0.6%), detected in human head lice, as well as the DNA of potential new species from the Anaplasma and Ehrlichia genera of unknown pathogenicity. The finding of several Malian head lice infected with B. quintana, C. burnetii, R. aeschlimannii, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia is alarming and highlights the need for active survey programs to define the public health consequences of the detection of these emerging bacterial pathogens in human head lice."
https://openalex.org/W2755951350,"Aedes aegypti is one of the species most favored by changes in the environment caused by urbanization. Its abundance increases rapidly in the face of such changes, increasing the risk of disease transmission. Previous studies have shown that mosquito species that have adapted to anthropogenic environmental changes benefit from urbanization and undergo population expansion. In light of this, we used microsatellite markers to explore how urbanization processes may be modulating Ae. aegypti populations collected from three areas with different levels of urbanization in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Specimens were collected at eleven sites in three areas with different degrees of urbanization in the city of São Paulo: conserved, intermediate and urbanized. Ten microsatellite loci were used to characterize the populations from these areas genetically. Our findings suggest that as urbanized areas grow and the human population density in these areas increases, Ae. aegypti populations undergo a major population expansion, which can probably be attributed to the species’ adaptability to anthropogenic environmental changes. Our findings reveal a robust association between, on the one hand, urbanization processes and densification of the human population and, on the other, Ae. aegypti population structure patterns and population expansion. This indicates that this species benefits from anthropogenic effects, which are intensified by migration of the human population from rural to urban areas, increasing the risk of epidemics and disease transmission to an ever-increasing number of people."
https://openalex.org/W2755172593,"Snakehead fishes of the family Channidae are predatory freshwater teleosts from Africa and Asia comprising 38 valid species. Snakeheads are important food fishes (aquaculture, live food trade) and have been introduced widely with several species becoming highly invasive. A channid barcode library was recently assembled by Serrao and co-workers to better detect and identify potential and established invasive snakehead species outside their native range. Comparing our own recent phylogenetic results of this taxonomically confusing group with those previously reported revealed several inconsistencies that prompted us to expand and improve on previous studies. By generating 343 novel snakehead coxI sequences and combining them with an additional 434 coxI sequences from GenBank we highlight several problems with previous efforts towards the assembly of a snakehead reference barcode library. We found that 16.3% of the channid coxI sequences deposited in GenBank are based on misidentifications. With the inclusion of our own data we were, however, able to solve these cases of perpetuated taxonomic confusion. Different species delimitation approaches we employed (BIN, GMYC, and PTP) were congruent in suggesting a potentially much higher species diversity within snakeheads than currently recognized. In total, 90 BINs were recovered and within a total of 15 currently recognized species multiple BINs were identified. This higher species diversity is mostly due to either the incorporation of undescribed, narrow range, endemics from the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot or the incorporation of several widespread species characterized by deep genetic splits between geographically well-defined lineages. In the latter case, over-lumping in the past has deflated the actual species numbers. Further integrative approaches are clearly needed for providing a better taxonomic understanding of snakehead diversity, new species descriptions and taxonomic revisions of the group."
https://openalex.org/W2755196863,"Analyses of high-throughput transcriptome sequences of non-model organisms are based on two main approaches: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly using mapping to assign reads prior to assembly. Given the limits of mapping reads to a reference when it is highly divergent, as is frequently the case for non-model species, we evaluate whether using blastn would outperform mapping methods for read assignment in such situations (>15% divergence). We demonstrate its high performance by using simulated reads of lengths corresponding to those generated by the most common sequencing platforms, and over a realistic range of genetic divergence (0% to 30% divergence). Here we focus on gene identification and not on resolving the whole set of transcripts (i.e. the complete transcriptome). For simulated datasets, the transcriptome-guided assembly based on blastn recovers 94.8% of genes irrespective of read length at 0% divergence; however, assignment rate of reads is negatively correlated with both increasing divergence level and reducing read lengths. Nevertheless, we still observe 92.6% of recovered genes at 30% divergence irrespective of read length. This analysis also produces a categorization of genes relative to their assignment, and suggests guidelines for data processing prior to analyses of comparative transcriptomics and gene expression to minimize potential inferential bias associated with incorrect transcript assignment. We also compare the performances of de novo assembly alone vs in combination with a transcriptome-guided assembly based on blastn both via simulation and empirically, using data from a cyprinid fish species and from an oak species. For any simulated scenario, the transcriptome-guided assembly using blastn outperforms the de novo approach alone, including when the divergence level is beyond the reach of traditional mapping methods. Combining de novo assembly and a related reference transcriptome for read assignment also addresses the bias/error in contigs caused by the dependence on a related reference alone. Empirical data corroborate these findings when assembling transcriptomes from the two non-model organisms: Parachondrostoma toxostoma (fish) and Quercus pubescens (plant). For the fish species, out of the 31,944 genes known from D. rerio, the guided and de novo assemblies recover respectively 20,605 and 20,032 genes but the performance of the guided assembly approach is much higher for both the contiguity and completeness metrics. For the oak, out of the 29,971 genes known from Vitis vinifera, the transcriptome-guided and de novo assemblies display similar performance, but the new guided approach detects 16,326 genes where the de novo assembly only detects 9,385 genes."
https://openalex.org/W2754213998,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in human malignancies and can be used as biomarkers for cancer. Until now, a number of biomarkers for prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) have been reported in tumor tissues but only a few biomarkers in circulating fluid. Using a custom microarray, we previously identified 19 differentially expressed miRNAs in serum of patients with GBM. In this study, we investigated whether 3 of the 19 miRNAs in serum could be used as prognostic biomarkers for patients with GBM. We first validated the serum levels of 3 candidate miRNAs in an independent cohort of 24 GBM patients and 12 healthy volunteers by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), and then evaluated the prognostic value of these miRNAs in a total of 36 GBM patients. The results show that the serum levels of the 3 miRNAs (miR-451a, miR-485-3p and miR-4298) determined by qRT-PCR are significantly different between 24 GBM patients and 12 healthy volunteers (all P <0.05) and are in concordance with the results of microarray analysis. High serum level of miR-451a is correlated with positive tumor O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression (P = 0.040). Survival analysis showed that low serum miR-485-3p level is associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.004) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.023). Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses demonstrated that that serum miR-485-3p expression is a significant independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in GBM patients. In conclusion, serum miR-485-3p level is reduced and might be a potential prognostic biomarker in GBM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2754719305,"Flavones are a class of natural plant secondary metabolites that have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effects. Some flavones also activate the T2R14 bitter taste receptor, which is expressed in motile cilia of the sinonasal epithelium and activates innate immune nitric oxide (NO) production. Flavones may thus be potential therapeutics for respiratory infections. Our objective was to examine the anti-microbial effects of flavones on the common sinonasal pathogens Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, evaluating both planktonic and biofilm growth. Flavones had only very low-level antibacterial activity alone. They did not reduce biofilm formation, but did reduce production of the important P. aeruginosa inflammatory mediator and ciliotoxin pyocyanin. However, flavones exhibited synergy against P. aeruginosa in the presence of antibiotics or recombinant human lysozyme. They also enhanced the efficacy of antimicrobials secreted by cultured and primary human airway cells grown at air-liquid interface. This suggests that flavones may have anti-gram-negative potential as topical therapeutics when combined with antibiotics or in the context of innate antimicrobials secreted by the respiratory or other epithelia. This may have an additive effect when combined with T2R14-activated NO production. Additional studies are necessary to understand which flavone compounds or mixtures are the most efficacious."
https://openalex.org/W2754577572,"The all-female Caucasian rock lizard Darevskia rostombekowi and other unisexual species of this genus reproduce normally via true parthenogenesis. Typically, diploid parthenogenetic reptiles exhibit some amount of clonal diversity. However, allozyme data from D. rostombekowi have suggested that this species consists of a single clone. Herein, we test this hypothesis by evaluating variation at three variable microsatellite loci for 42 specimens of D. rostombekowi from four populations in Armenia. Analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms of each locus reveal five genotypes or presumptive clones in this species. All individuals are heterozygous at the loci. The major clone occurs in 24 individuals and involves three populations. Four rare clones involve one or several individuals from one or two populations. Most variation owes to parent-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, which occur as heterozygotes. This result fails to reject the hypothesis of a single hybridization founder event that resulted in the initial formation of one major clone. The other clones appear to have originated via post-formation microsatellite mutations of the major clone."
https://openalex.org/W2755958520,"Between-female variation in reproductive output provides a strong measure of individual fitness and a quantifiable measure of the health of a population which may be highly informative to management. In the present study, we examined reproductive traits in female bottlenose dolphins from the east coast of Scotland using longitudinal sightings data collected over twenty years. From a total of 102 females identified between 1997 and 2016, 74 mothers produced a collective total of 193 calves. Females gave birth from 6 to 13 years of age with a mean age of 8. Calves were produced during all study months, May to October inclusive, but showed a seasonal birth pulse corresponding to the regional peak in summer water temperatures. Approximately 83% (n = 116) of the calves of established fate were successfully raised to year 2–3. Of the known mortalities, ~45% were first-born calves. Calf survival rates were also lower in multiparous females who had previously lost calves. A mean inter-birth interval (IBI) of 3.80 years (n = 110) and mean fecundity of 0.16 was estimated for the population. Calf loss resulted in shortened IBIs, whilst longer IBIs were observed in females assumed to be approaching reproductive senescence. Maternal age and size, breeding experience, dominance, individual associations, group size and other social factors, were all concluded to influence reproductive success (RS) in this population. Some females are likely more important than others for the future viability of the population. Consequently, a better knowledge of the demographic groups containing those females showing higher reproductive success would be highly desirable for conservation efforts aimed at their protection."
https://openalex.org/W2755712727,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the early changes in serial serum levels of copeptin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in neonates diagnosed with birth asphyxia, and to determine whether these biomarkers measured in the first 168 hours after birth are predictive of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Copeptin and NSE levels were measured from serum samples collected 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours after birth from 75 term neonates diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and treated with therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours. In addition, serum copeptin levels after birth were measured from 10 HIE diagnosed neonates, who were randomized to the normothermic arm of the TOBY cohort. All neonates underwent neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II at two years of age. Copeptin levels were highest at 6 hours after birth and steadily decreased, whereas the highest NSE levels were measured at 24 hours after birth. The biomarker levels correlated with blood-gas parameters (base excess, pH and lactate) at 6 and 12 hours after birth. Copeptin and NSE levels in the early postnatal period were significantly higher in neonates with poor outcome compared to those with favorable outcome at two years of age. Furthermore, in the TOBY cohort, copeptin levels were significantly lower in hypothermic compared to normothermic neonates. To conclude, copeptin and NSE measured in the early postnatal period are potential prognostic biomarkers of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in term neonates diagnosed with HIE and treated with therapeutic hypothermia."
https://openalex.org/W2756209412,"Influenza A virus (IAV) causes an acute infection in humans that is normally eliminated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Individuals expressing the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2 produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes bearing T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the immunodominant IAV epitope GILGFVFTL (GIL). Most GIL-specific TCRs utilize α/β chain pairs encoded by the TRAV27/TRBV19 gene combination to recognize this relatively featureless peptide epitope (canonical TCRs). However, ∼40% of GIL-specific TCRs express a wide variety of other TRAV/TRBV combinations (non-canonical TCRs). To investigate the structural underpinnings of this remarkable diversity, we determined the crystal structure of a non-canonical GIL-specific TCR (F50) expressing the TRAV13-1/TRBV27 gene combination bound to GIL–HLA-A2 to 1.7 Å resolution. Comparison of the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex with the previously published complex formed by a canonical TCR (JM22) revealed that F50 and JM22 engage GIL–HLA-A2 in markedly different orientations. These orientations are distinguished by crossing angles of TCR to peptide–MHC of 29° for F50 versus 69° for JM22 and by a focus by F50 on the C terminus rather than the center of the MHC α1 helix for JM22. In addition, F50, unlike JM22, uses a tryptophan instead of an arginine to fill a critical notch between GIL and the HLA-A2 α2 helix. The F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex shows that there are multiple structurally distinct solutions to recognizing an identical peptide–MHC ligand with sufficient affinity to elicit a broad anti-IAV response that protects against viral escape and T-cell clonal loss.

This canonical TRAV27/TRBV19 gene combination is observed in multiple HLA-A2-matched but otherwise genetically unrelated individuals. More recently, however, high-throughput sequencing and single-cell TCR analysis have revealed substantially greater repertoire diversity than previously realized, with only ∼60% of GIL-specific TCRs expressing the TRBV19 gene and ∼20% expressing TRAV27 (14Chen G.

These non-canonical TCRs utilize a wide variety of TRAV and TRBV genes, including TRAV13-1, TRAV17, TRAV29, TRAV38-2, TRBV14, TRBV24-1, TRBV27, and TRBV29-1, among others. Indeed, 2,406 unique TCRα and 2,437 TCRβ sequences have been identified for TCRs recognizing the GIL peptide presented by HLA-A2 (14Chen G. Yang X. Ko A. Sun X. Gao M. Zhang Y. Shi A. Mariuzza R.A.

In most pMHC structures, one or more residues in the central portion of the antigenic peptide (P4–P6) feature solvent-exposed side chains that facilitate TCR binding (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, the GIL peptide is unusual in that only the side chain of P8 Thr, at the C-terminal end of the peptide, is substantially exposed to solvent, making GIL a challenging target for TCR recognition (23Stewart-Jones G.B. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. A structural basis for immunodominant human T cell receptor recognition.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a canonical GIL-specific TRAV27/TRBV19 TCR (JM22) bound to GIL–HLA-A2 revealed what appears to be the most efficient solution to recognizing the featureless GIL peptide with sufficient affinity to permit selection of engaging T cells. In the JM22–GIL–HLA-A2 complex, the side chain of the conserved βArg98 residue of the 97XRSX100 CDR3β consensus motif fills a notch between the peptide and the HLA-A2 α2 helix (23Stewart-Jones G.B.

This structural solution is also adopted by other GIL-specific TCRs expressing TRBV19 and the 97XRSX100 CDR3β motif, even when TRBV19 is paired with α chains different from TRAV27 (14Chen G. Yang X. Ko A. Sun X. Gao M. Zhang Y. Shi A. Mariuzza R.A. Weng N.P.

Biol. 2017; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, ∼40% of GIL-specific TCRs do not use the canonical TRBV19 gene, and not all TRBV19-expressing TCRs contain the 97XRSX100 CDR3β motif (14Chen G. Yang X. Ko A. Sun X. Gao M. Zhang Y. Shi A.

Biol. 2017; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hence, multiple solutions exist for binding the featureless GIL peptide. Here we investigated the structural basis for the surprising diversity of the TCR response to this dominant IAV epitope by determining the structure of a GIL-specific TCR (F50) expressing a completely different, non-canonical TRAV/TRBV gene combination (TRAV13-1/TRBV27) in complex with GIL–HLA-A2. The IAV GIL-specific TCR F50 was isolated from CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood of an HLA-A2+ healthy male donor following in vitro stimulation with the GIL peptide as described under “Experimental procedures.” F50 utilizes gene segments TRAV13-1 and TRAJ54 for the α chain, and TRBV27 and TRBJ1-1 for the β chain, whereas JM22 utilizes TRAV27 and TRAJ37 for the α chain and TRBV19 and TRBJ7–2 for the β chain. We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the affinity of TCR F50 for HLA-A2 loaded with the GIL peptide (Fig. 1A). To characterize the interaction of F50 with GIL–HLA-A2, we expressed these proteins by in vitro folding from inclusion bodies produced in Escherichia coli. Biotinylated GIL–HLA-A2 was directionally coupled to a streptavidin-coated biosensor surface, and different concentrations of F50 were sequentially flowed over the immobilized pMHC ligand. A dissociation constant (KD) of 76 ± 4 μm was obtained by fitting equilibrium data to a 1:1 binding model (Fig. 1B). This affinity is ∼25-fold weaker than that of JM22 for GIL–HLA-A2 (KD = 3.2 μm) (25Ishizuka J. Stewart-Jones G.B. van der Merwe A. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Jones E.Y. The structural dynamics and energetics of an immunodominant T cell receptor are programmed by its Vβ domain.Immunity. 2008; 28: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with the caveat that we did not independently measure the affinity of JM22 in our experimental system. It is, however, well within the range of 0.5–500 μm for natural TCR-pMHC interactions (26Sewell A.K. Why must T cells be cross-reactive?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is consistent with the much lower representation among GIL-specific TCRs of the TRBV27 β chain expressed by F50 than the dominant TRBV19 β chain expressed by JM22 (14Chen G. Yang X. Ko A. Sun X. Gao M. Zhang Y. Shi A. Mariuzza R.A. Weng N.P.

Biol. 2017; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in agreement with the concept of affinity-driven clonal expansion of T cell repertoires. To understand how TCR F50 recognizes GIL–HLA-A2 and to compare its recognition mode with that of JM22, we determined the structure of the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex to 1.7 Å resolution (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). The interface between F50 and GIL–HLA-A2 was in unambiguous electron density for the single complex molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (Fig. 2b). Of note, the resolution of the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex is one of the highest reported for any TCR-pMHC class I or II complex (>60 unique structures), whose resolutions seldom exceed 2.5 Å (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Indeed, the 1.7 Å resolution of the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex is second only to that of the JM22–GIL–HLA-A2 complex itself at 1.4 Å (23Stewart-Jones G.B. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. A structural basis for immunodominant human T cell receptor recognition.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The comparably high resolutions of these two structures justify detailed comparisons between them.Table 1Data collection and structure refinement statisticsF50–GIL–HLA-A2Data collection Space groupP1211 Cell dimensions a (Å)66.3 b (Å)71.1 c (Å)100.7 α, β, γ (°)90, 96.2, 90 Resolution range (Å)aThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.37.9–1.70 (1.76–1.70) Unique reflectionsaThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.100,320 (9,832) RmergeaThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.,bRmerge = Σ|Ij − <I> |/ΣIj, where Ij is the intensity of an individual reflection, and <I> is the average intensity of that reflection.0.055 (0.647) Mean I/σ(I) aThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.7.52 (1.2) Completeness (%)aThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.98.1 (96.6)Refinement Resolution range (Å)aThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.37.9–1.70 Rwork (%)/Rfree (%)aThe values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell.,cRwork = Σ||Fo| − |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where Fc is the calculated structure factor.

Open table in a new tab F50 docks symmetrically over GIL–HLA-A2 in a diagonal orientation, with a crossing angle of TCR to pMHC (27Rudolph M.G. Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. How TCRs bind MHCs, peptides, and coreceptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 419-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) of 29° compared with 69° for JM22 (Fig. 2c). Upon binding GIL–HLA-A2, F50 buries 73% (215 Å2) of the peptide solvent-accessible surface. This percentage is significantly less than the 85% (258 Å2) of peptide surface buried by JM22 (23Stewart-Jones G.B. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. A structural basis for immunodominant human T cell receptor recognition.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the lower affinity of F50 compared with JM22. As shown by the footprint of F50 on the pMHC surface (Fig. 2d), F50 establishes contacts with the N-terminal half of the GIL peptide mainly via the CDR1α and CDR3α loops, whereas the CDR1β and CDR3β loops mostly contact the C-terminal half. F50 utilizes all six CDR loops to interact with the MHC molecule, with CDR1α and CDR2α positioned over the HLA-A2 α2 helix, and CDR1β and CDR2β positioned over the HLA-A2 α1 helix (Fig. 2c). The F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex buries a total solvent-accessible surface of 1760 Å2, comparable with that in other TCR-pMHC complexes (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The Vα and Vβ domains bury 46% (333 Å2) and 54% (391 Å2) of HLA-A2 surface area, respectively. This roughly equal contribution of Vα and Vβ is typical of TCR-pMHC complexes (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex, MHC recognition in the JM22–GIL–HLA-A2 complex is dominated by Vβ, which accounts for 67% of the buried surface on HLA-A2 (23Stewart-Jones G.B. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. A structural basis for immunodominant human T cell receptor recognition.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, F50 and JM22 use different strategies to engage an identical pMHC ligand. Overall, Vα of F50 makes 27 van der Waals contacts and three hydrogen bonds with HLA-A2, compared with 25 van der Waals contacts and two hydrogen bonds by Vβ. These interactions are mediated by six Vα and six Vβ residues and involve twelve MHC residues, eight of which are also contacted by JM22 (Table 2). Of the total buried surface on HLA-A2, excluding the GIL peptide, CDR1α, CDR2α, and CDR3α contribute 6, 22, and 19%, respectively, compared with 9, 20, and 28% for CDR1β, CDR2β, and CDR3β, respectively. Thus, MHC recognition by F50 involves both germline-encoded and somatically generated interactions. The contributions of CDR2α and CDR2β to the MHC buried surface in the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex (22 and 20%, respectively) are substantially greater than the average for 34 other TCR-pMHC class I complexes (11 and 12%, respectively) (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In particular, CDR2α of the canonical JM22 TCR accounts for only 7% of the buried surface on HLA-A2. Unlike JM22, F50 does not recruit water molecules to the interface with HLA-A2 (see below).Table 2Interactions between TCR and MHC in the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 and JM22–GIL–HLA-A2 complexesHydrogen bondsvan der Waals contactsHydrogen bondsvan der Waals contactsHLA-A2F50F50JM22JM22R65HQ58βK66HN98αK68HD56βA69HI96βD56βG99βQ72HM50βI53βG99βN55βT73HI53βR75HN55βV76HM50βI53βT80HA80H (Oγ1) N51β (Nδ2)N51βY84HY84H(OH) E30β(Oε2)E30βK146HL95βA149HY101βA150HR52αA150H(O) R98β(Nε)R98βL96βA150H(O) R98β(Nη2)Y101βW99βH151HR52αV51αR98βY101βV152HW99βR98βE154HE154H (Oε2) N54α (Nδ2)N54αS31αV51αQ155HQ155H (Nε2) N32α (Nδ2)N32αQ155H (Oε1) R98β (Nη1)S31αQ155H (Oε1) S53α (Oγ)R52αQ155H (Oε1) R98β (Nη2)G94αS53αR98βN54αS100βW99β Open table in a new tab F50 engages the HLA-A2 α2 helix mainly through CDR1α and CDR2α. Thus, residues αAsn32, αSer53, and αAsn54 form a network of three side-chain–side-chain hydrogen bonds linking F50 to residues Glu154H and Gln155H of the HLA-A2 α2 helix (Table 2 and Fig. 3a). These hydrogen bonds are reinforced by 16 germline-encoded van der Waals contacts with CDR1α and CDR2α that further anchor Vα to helix α2. Because of the acute crossing angle of F50 to GIL–HLA-A2 (29° compared with 69° for JM22), CDR3α of F50 contacts the HLA-A2 α1 helix instead of the α2 helix contacted by CDR3α of JM22 (Table 2) (23Stewart-Jones G.B. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. A structural basis for immunodominant human T cell receptor recognition.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Indeed, interactions between CDR3α and the MHC α1 helix are characteristic of TCRs docking on pMHC ligands with acute crossing angles (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition to CDR3α, F50 engages the HLA-A2 α1 helix through CDR1β, CDR2β, and CDR3β (Table 2). Notably, these interactions focus on the C terminus of the α1 helix, as illustrated by the positions of CDR1β and CDR2β on the pMHC surface (Fig. 2, c and d). This C-terminal site is rarely targeted by other TCRs, including JM22 (Fig. 2, c and e), which typically dock more toward the center of the MHC α1 helix (22Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In particular, F50 residues βGlu30 and βAsn51 make two side-chain–side-chain hydrogen bonds with C-terminal HLA-A2 α1 residues Tyr84H and Thr80H, respectively (Fig. 3b). Neither of these HLA-A2 residues contacts JM22, which instead targets the central portion of helix α1 via its CDR2β (Fig. 2c and Table 2). Interestingly, the HLA-A24-restricted HIV-specific TCR T36-5 (28Shimizu A. Kawana-Tachikawa A. Yamagata A. Han C. Zhu D. Sato Y. Nakamura H. Koibuchi T. Carlson J. Martin E. Brumme C.J. Shi Y.

For example, whereas βAsn51 hydrogen bonds with Thr80H in the F50–GIL–HLA-A2 complex, this same residue hydrogen bonds with Ala69H and Thr73H in the T36-5–HIV–HLA-A24 complex, in agreement with the"
https://openalex.org/W2754266387,"DNA barcode sequences were developed from 557 mesopelagic and upper bathypelagic teleost specimens collected in waters off Atlantic Canada. Confident morphological identifications were available for 366 specimens, of 118 species and 93 genera, which yielded 328 haplotypes. Five of the species were novel to the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). Most of the 118 species conformed to expectations of monophyly and the presence of a “barcode gap”, though some known weaknesses in existing taxonomy were confirmed and a deficiency in published keys was revealed. Of the specimens for which no firm morphological identification was available, 156 were successfully identified to species, and a further 11 to genus, using their barcode sequences and a combination of distance- and character-based methods. The remaining 24 specimens were from species for which no reference barcode is yet available or else ones confused by apparent misidentification of publicly available sequences in BOLD. Addition of the new sequences to those previously in BOLD contributed support to recent taxonomic revisions of Chiasmodon and Poromitra, while it also revealed 18 cases of potential cryptic speciation. Most of the latter appear to result from genetic divergence among populations in different ocean basins, while the general lack of strong horizontal environmental gradients within the deep sea has allowed morphology to be conserved. Other examples of divergence appear to distinguish individuals living under the sub-tropical gyre of the North Atlantic from those under that ocean’s sub-polar gyre. In contrast, the available sequences for two myctophid species, Benthosema glaciale and Notoscopelus elongatus, showed genetic structuring on finer geographic scales. The observed structure was not consistent with recent suggestions that “resident” populations of myctophids can maintain allopatry despite the mixing of ocean waters. Rather, it indicates that the very rapid speciation characteristic of the Myctophidae is both on-going and detectable using barcodes."
https://openalex.org/W2756179627,"Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that Zetaproteobacteria are widespread in hydrothermal systems and that they contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of iron in these environments. However, how chemical factors control the distribution of Zetaproteobacteria and their co-occurring taxa remains elusive. Here we analysed iron mats from the Troll Wall Vent Field (TWVF) located at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR) in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The samples were taken at increasing distances from high-temperature venting chimneys towards areas with ultraslow low-temperature venting, encompassing a large variety in geochemical settings. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of biogenic iron stalks in all samples. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence profiling we found that relative abundances of Zetaproteobacteria in the iron mats varied from 0.2 to 37.9%. Biogeographic analyses of Zetaproteobacteria, using the ZetaHunter software, revealed the presence of ZetaOtus 1, 2 and 9, supporting the view that they are cosmopolitan. Relative abundances of co-occurring taxa, including Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria, also varied substantially. From our results, combined with results from previous microbiological and geochemical analyses of the TWVF, we infer that the distribution of Zetaproteobacteria is connected to fluid-flow patterns and, ultimately, variations in chemical energy landscapes. Moreover, we provide evidence for iron-oxidizing members of Gallionellaceae being widespread in TWVF iron mats, albeit at low relative abundances."
https://openalex.org/W2754049119,"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) involves failure of arousal to potentially life threatening events, including hypoxia, during sleep. While neuronal dysfunction and abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems within the medulla oblongata have been implicated, the specific pathways associated with autonomic and cardiorespiratory failure are unknown. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its tachykinin neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) have been shown to play an integral role in the modulation of homeostatic function in the medulla, including regulation of respiratory rhythm generation, integration of cardiovascular control, and modulation of the baroreceptor reflex and mediation of the chemoreceptor reflex in response to hypoxia. Abnormalities in SP neurotransmission may therefore result in autonomic dysfunction during sleep and contribute to SIDS deaths. [125I] Bolton Hunter SP autoradiography was used to map the distribution and density of the SP, NK1R to 13 specific nuclei intimately related to cardiorespiratory function and autonomic control in the human infant medulla of 55 SIDS and 21 control (non-SIDS) infants. Compared to controls, SIDS cases exhibited a differential, abnormal developmental profile of the SP/NK1R system in the medulla. Furthermore the study revealed significantly decreased NK1R binding within key medullary nuclei in SIDS cases, principally in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and all three subdivisions of the inferior portion of the olivo-cerebellar complex; the principal inferior olivary complex (PIO), medial accessory olive (MAO) and dorsal accessory olive (DAO). Altered NK1R binding was significantly influenced by prematurity and male sex, which may explain the increased risk of SIDS in premature and male infants. Abnormal NK1R binding in these medullary nuclei may contribute to the defective interaction of critical medullary mechanisms with cerebellar sites, resulting in an inability of a SIDS infant to illicit appropriate respiratory and motor responses to life threatening challenges during sleep. These observations support the concept that abnormalities in a multi-neurotransmitter network within key nuclei of the medullary homeostatic system may underlie the pathogenesis of a subset of SIDS cases."

The predominant Proteobacteria varied from 71.81% (GZ) to 96.08% (YN), and Delftia (10.39–38.42%), Burkholderia (2.71–15.98%), Escherichia/Shigella (4.90–25.12%), Pseudomonas (2.68–30.72%) and Sphingomonas (1.83–2.05%) dominated in four planting bases. Pseudomonas (17.94–22.06%), Escherichia/Shigella (6.59–11.59%), Delftia (9.65–22.14%) and Burkholderia (3.12–11.05%) dominated in all the tissues. According to Meta-nifH sequencing, 4 phyla and 45 genera were identified, while 17 genera and 24 genera from 4 phyla were shared by all the planting bases and all the tissues, respectively. Burkholderia and Bradyrhizobium were the most popular in the planting bases, followed by Methylovirgula and Mesorhizobium. Mesorhizobium was the most popular in different tissues, followed by Beijerinckia, Xanthobacter, and Burkholderia. Among the genera, 39 were completely overlapped with the results based on the 16S rRNA gene. In conclusion, abundant bacteria and diazotrophs were identified in common in different tissues of D. catenatum from five planting bases, which might play a great role in the supply of nutrients such as nitrogen. The exact abundance of phylum and genus on the different tissues from different planting bases need deeper sequencing with more samples."
https://openalex.org/W2754230158,"Prion transmission between species is governed in part by primary sequence similarity between the infectious prion aggregate, PrPSc, and the cellular prion protein of the host, PrPC. A puzzling feature of prion formation is that certain PrPC sequences, such as that of bank vole, can be converted by a remarkably broad array of different mammalian prions, whereas others, such as rabbit, show robust resistance to cross-species prion conversion. To examine the structural determinants that confer susceptibility or resistance to prion conversion, we systematically tested over 40 PrPC variants of susceptible and resistant PrPC sequences in a prion conversion assay. Five key residue positions markedly impacted prion conversion, four of which were in steric zipper segments where side chains from amino acids tightly interdigitate in a dry interface. Strikingly, all five residue substitutions modulating prion conversion involved the gain or loss of an asparagine or glutamine residue. For two of the four positions, Asn and Gln residues were not interchangeable, revealing a strict requirement for either an Asn or Gln residue. Bank voles have a high number of Asn and Gln residues and a high Asn:Gln ratio. These findings suggest that a high number of Asn and Gln residues at specific positions may stabilize β-sheets and lower the energy barrier for cross-species prion transmission, potentially because of hydrogen bond networks from side chain amides forming extended Asn/Gln ladders. These data also suggest that multiple PrPC segments containing Asn/Gln residues may act in concert along a replicative interface to promote prion conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2755503860,"The tumour immune microenvironment is considered to influence cancer behaviour and outcome. Using a panel of markers for innate and adaptive immune cells we set out to characterise and understand the bladder tumour microenvironment of 114 patients from a prospective multicentre cohort of newly-diagnosed bladder cancer patients, followed-up for 4.33±1.71 years. We found IL-17-positive cells were significantly increased in primary and concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS), p<0.0001, a highly malignant lesion which is the most significant single risk factor for disease progression. Further characterisation of the tumour immunophenotype identified IL-17+ cells as predominantly mast cells rather than T-cells, in contrast to most other tumour types. Expression of the IL-17-receptor in bladder tumours, and functional effects and gene expression changes induced by IL-17 in bladder tumour cells in vitro suggest a role in tumour behaviour. Finally, we assessed the effects of IL-17 in the context of patient outcome, following intravesical BCG immunotherapy which is the standard of care; higher numbers of IL-17+ cells were associated with improved event-free survival (p = 0.0449, HR 0.2918, 95% CI 0.08762–0.9721) in patients with primary and concomitant CIS (n = 41), we propose a model of IL-17+ Mast cells mechanism of action. Thus, in the context of bladder CIS, IL-17+ mast cells predict favourable outcome following BCG immunotherapy indicative of a novel mechanism of BCG immunotherapy in UBC and could form the basis of a stratified approach to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2755329110,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a failure of neuronal cells to express the gene encoding the fragile mental retardation protein (FMRP). Clinical features of the syndrome include intellectual disability, learning impairment, hyperactivity, seizures and anxiety. Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice do not express FMRP and, as a result, reproduce some FXS behavioral abnormalities. While intrinsic and synaptic properties of excitatory cells in various part of the brain have been studied in Fmr1 KO mice, a thorough analysis of action potential characteristics and input-output function of CA1 pyramidal cells in this model is lacking. With a view to determining the effects of the absence of FMRP on cell excitability, we studied rheobase, action potential duration, firing frequency–current intensity relationship and action potential after-hyperpolarization (AHP) in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus of wild type (WT) and Fmr1 KO male mice. Brain slices were prepared from 8- to 12-week-old mice and the electrophysiological properties of cells recorded. Cells from both groups had similar resting membrane potentials. In the absence of FMRP expression, cells had a significantly higher input resistance, while voltage threshold and depolarization voltage were similar in WT and Fmr1 KO cell groups. No changes were observed in rheobase. The action potential duration was longer in the Fmr1 KO cell group, and the action potential firing frequency evoked by current steps of the same intensity was higher. Moreover, the gain (slope) of the relationship between firing frequency and injected current was 1.25-fold higher in the Fmr1 KO cell group. Finally, AHP amplitude was significantly reduced in the Fmr1 KO cell group. According to these data, FMRP absence increases excitability in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2756196630,"By whole-genome sequencing of resistant mutants, a putative receptor for plantaricin JK, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by some Lactobacillus plantarum strains, was identified in Lactobacillus plantarum NCFB 965 and Weissella viridescens NCFB 1655. The receptors of the two species had 66% identical amino acid sequences and belong to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) transporter protein family. The resistant mutants contained point mutations in the protein-encoding gene resulting in either premature stop codons, leading to truncated versions of the protein, or single amino acid substitutions. The secondary structure of the W. viridescens protein was predicted to contain 12 transmembrane (TM) helices, a core structure shared by most members of the APC protein family. The single amino acid substitutions that resulted in resistant strains were located in a confined region of the protein that consists of TM helix 10, which is predicted to be part of an inner membrane pore, and an extracellular loop between TM helix 11 and 12. By use of template-based modeling a 3D structure model of the protein was obtained, which visualizes this mutational hotspot region and further strengthen the hypothesis that it represents a docking site for plantaricin JK."
https://openalex.org/W2754918845,"In this study, we used electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals to extract the onset of arm movement as well as the velocity of the hand as a function of time. ECoG recordings were obtained from three individuals while they performed reaching tasks in the left, right and forward directions. The ECoG electrodes were placed over the motor cortex contralateral to the moving arm. Movement onset was detected from gamma activity with near perfect accuracy (> 98%), and a multiple linear regression model was used to predict the trajectory of the reaching task in three-dimensional space with an accuracy exceeding 85%. An adaptive selection of frequency bands was used for movement classification and prediction. This demonstrates the efficacy of developing a real-time brain-machine interface for arm movements with as few as eight ECoG electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W2756034228,"Disruption of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress. Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) acts to restore protein homeostasis or, if ER stress is severe or persistent, drive apoptosis, which is thought to proceed through the cell intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway. Indeed, cells that lack the key executioner proteins BAX and BAK are protected from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Here we show that chronic ER stress causes the progressive inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signalling pathway. This is causally related to ER stress since reactivation of ERK1/2 can protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis whilst ERK1/2 pathway inhibition sensitises cells to ER stress. Furthermore, cancer cell lines harbouring constitutively active BRAFV600E are addicted to ERK1/2 signalling for protection against ER stress-induced cell death. ERK1/2 signalling normally represses the pro-death proteins BIM, BMF and PUMA and it has been proposed that ER stress induces BIM-dependent cell death. We found no evidence that ER stress increased the expression of these proteins; furthermore, BIM was not required for ER stress-induced death. Rather, ER stress caused the PERK-dependent inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA translation and the progressive loss of pro-survival proteins including BCL2, BCLXL and MCL1. Despite these observations, neither ERK1/2 activation nor loss of BAX/BAK could confer long-term clonogenic survival to cells exposed to ER stress. Thus, ER stress induces cell death by at least two biochemically and genetically distinct pathways: a classical BAX/BAK-dependent apoptotic response that can be inhibited by ERK1/2 signalling and an alternative ERK1/2- and BAX/BAK-independent cell death pathway."

Dyspnea was assessed by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases and six-minute walk test were performed. Laboratory parameters including C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were analyzed.Ninety percent of patients were dyspneic before surgery (mMRC scale ≥ 1) versus 59% after surgery (p<0.001). Mean mMRC score improved after bariatric surgery (1.5 ± 0.9 vs 0.7 ± 0.7, p<0.0001). Among patients with dyspnea before surgery (n = 38), a more marked increase in ERV after surgery was observed in patients with improvement of dyspnea compared to patients with no improvement of dyspnea (+0.17 ± 0.32 L vs +0.49 ± 0.35 L, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis including age, variation of BMI, variation of CRP, variation of Total Lung Capacity and variation of ERV demonstraded that ERV was the only variable associated with improvement of the mMRc score after bariatric surgery (p = 0.04).Weight loss associated with bariatric surgery improves dyspnea in daily living. This improvement could be partly related to increased ERV."
https://openalex.org/W2755728625,"MBI9915 is an introgression cotton line with excellent fiber quality. It was obtained by advanced backcrossing and continuous inbreeding from an interspecific cross between the upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) cultivar CCRI36 as the recurrent parent and the sea island cotton (G. barbadense) cultivar Hai1, as the donor parent. To study the genetic effects of the introgressed chromosome segments in G. hirsutum, an F2 secondary segregating population of 1537 individuals was created by crossing MBI9915 and CCRI36, and an F2:3 population was created by randomly selecting 347 individuals from the F2 generation. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and interaction for fiber length and strength were identified using IciMapping software. The genotype analysis showed that the recovery rate for MBI9915 was 97.9%, with a total 6 heterozygous segments and 13 homozygous segments. A total of 18 QTLs for fiber quality and 6 QTLs for yield related traits were detected using the two segregating generations. These QTLs were distributed across 7 chromosomes and collectively explained 0.81%-9.51% of the observed phenotypic variations. Six QTLs were consistently detected in two generations and 6 QTLs were identified in previous studies. A total of 13 pairs of interaction for fiber length and 13 pairs of interaction for fiber strength were identified in two generations. Among them, 3 pairs of interaction for fiber length and 3 pairs of interaction for fiber strength could be identified in all generations; 4 pairs of interactions affected fiber length and fiber strength simultaneously. The results clearly showed that 5 chromosome segments (Seg-5-1, Seg-7-1, Seg-8-1, Seg-20-2 and Seg-20-3) have important effects on fiber yield and quality. This study provides the useful information for gene cloning and marker-assisted breeding for excellent fiber related quality."
https://openalex.org/W2756362736,"C5a regulates the development of maladaptive immune responses in allergic asthma mainly through the activation of C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). Yet, the cell types and the mechanisms underlying this regulation are ill-defined. Recently, we described increased C5aR1 expression in lung tissue eosinophils but decreased expression in airway and pulmonary macrophages as well as in pulmonary CD11b+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) during the allergic effector phase using a floxed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-C5aR1 knock-in mouse. Here, we determined the role of C5aR1 signaling in neutrophils, moDCs and macrophages for the pulmonary recruitment of such cells and the importance of C5aR1-mediated activation of LysM-expressing cells for the development of allergic asthma. We used LysM-C5aR1 KO mice with a specific deletion of C5aR1 in LysMCre-expressing cells and confirmed the specific deletion of C5aR1 in neutrophils, macrophages and moDCs in the airways and/or the lung tissue. We found that alveolar macrophage numbers were significantly increased in LysM-C5aR1 KO mice. Induction of ovalbumin (OVA)-driven experimental allergic asthma in GFP-C5aR1fl/fl and LysM-C5aR1 KO mice resulted in strong but similar airway resistance, mucus production and Th2/Th17 cytokine production. In contrast, the number of airway but not of pulmonary neutrophils was lower in LysM-C5aR1 KO as compared with GFP-C5aR1fl/fl mice. The recruitment of macrophages, cDCs, moDCs, T cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells was not altered in LysM-C5aR1 KO mice. Our findings demonstrate that C5aR1 is critical for steady state control of alveolar macrophage numbers and the transition of neutrophils from the lung into the airways in OVA-driven allergic asthma. However, C5aR1 activation of LysM-expressing cells plays a surprisingly minor role in the recruitment and activation of such cells and the development of the allergic phenotype in OVA-driven experimental allergic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2755344636,"Background The Zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) is a promising candidate gene for schizophrenia and the broader psychosis phenotype that emerged from genome-wide association studies. It is related to neurodevelopment and associated to severe symptoms of schizophrenia and alterations in brain structure, as well as positive schizotypal personality traits in non-clinical samples. Moreover, a female-specific association has been observed between ZNF804A and schizophrenia. Aim The present study examined the association of two ZNF804A polymorphisms (rs1344706 and rs7597593) with the positive dimension of schizotypy and psychotic-like experiences in a sample of 808 non-clinical subjects. Additionally, we wanted to explore whether the sexual differences reported in schizophrenia are also present in psychosis-proneness. Results Our results showed an association between rs7597593 and both schizotypy and psychotic-like experiences. These associations were driven by females, such those carrying the C allele had higher scores in the positive dimension of both variables compared to TT allele homozygotes. Conclusion The findings of the present study support the inclusion of ZNF804 variability in studies of the vulnerability for the development of psychopathology in non-clinical samples and consideration of sex as a moderator of this association."

This study evaluates the effects of seven different ethnicities (Arab, Central-East African, Eastern Mediterranean, European, North African, South Asian and Southeast Asian) and gender on SAF as well as validating SAF assessment as a risk estimation tool for CVD and DM in an Arabian cohort. SAF data from self-reported healthy 2,780 individuals, collated from three independent studies, has been linear modelled using age and gender as a covariate. A cross-study harmonized effect size (Cohens'd) is provided for each ethnicity. Furthermore, new data has been collected from a clinically well-defined patient group of 235 individuals, to evaluate SAF as a clinical tool for DM and CVD-risk estimation in an Arab cohort. In an Arab population, SAF-based CVD and/or DM risk-estimation can be improved by referencing to ethnicity and gender-specific SAF values. Highest SAF values were observed for the North African population, followed by East Mediterranean, Arab, South Asian and European populations. The South Asian population had a slightly steeper slope in SAF values with age compared to other ethnic groups. All ethnic groups except Europeans showed a significant gender effect. When compared with a European group, effect size was highest for Eastern Mediterranean group and lowest for South Asian group. The Central-East African and Southeast Asian ethnicity matched closest to the Arab and Eastern Mediterranean ethnicities, respectively. Ethnic and gender-specific data improves performance in SAF-based CVD and DM risk estimation. The provided harmonized effect size allows a direct comparison of SAF in different ethnicities. For the first time, gender differences in SAF are described for North African and East Mediterranean populations."

Most were nongroupable (61.0%), followed by genogroups B (11.9%) and Y (8.5%). We identified 34 different sequence types (STs), eight were new STs, distributed among 14 clonal complexes (cc), cc1136 represented 20.3% of the nongroupable isolates. The porA and fetA genotypes included P1.18,25-37 (11.9%), P1.18-1,3 (10.2%); F5-5 (23.7%), F4-66 (16.9%) and F1-7 (13.6%). The porB class 3 protein and the fHbp subfamily A (variants 2 and 3) genotypes were found in 93.0 and 71.0% of the isolates, respectively. NHBA was present in all isolates, and while most lacked NadA (94.9%), we detected the hyperinvasive lineages B:P1.19,15:F5-1:ST-639 (cc32); C:P1.22,14-6:F3-9:ST-3780 (cc103) and W:P1.5,2:F1-1:ST-11 (cc11).

https://openalex.org/W2754571498,"Climate warming and land use change are some of the drivers affecting soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. The Grain for Green Project, local natural resources, and geographical conditions have resulted in farmland conversion into tea plantations in the hilly region of Western Sichuan. However, the effect of such land conversion on SOC mineralization remains unknown. In order to understand the temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition in tea plantations converted from farmland, this study considered the different years (i.e., 2–3, 9–10, and 16–17 years) of tea plantations converted from farmland as the study site, and soil was incubated for 28 days at 15°C, 25°C, and 35°C to measure the soil respiration rate, amount, and temperature coefficient (Q10). Temperature and land use type interactively affected the SOC mineralization rate, and the cumulative amount of SOC mineralization in all the plots was the largest at 35°C. SOC mineralization was greater and more sensitive to temperature changes in the farmland than in the tea plantations. Compared with the control, tea plantation soils showed lower SOC mineralization rate and cumulative mineralization amount. The 16–17-year-old tea plantation with a low SOC mineralization amount and high SOC content revealed the benefits of carbon sequestration enhancement obtained by converting farmland into tea plantations. The first-order kinetic equation described SOC mineralization dynamics well. Farmland conversion into tea plantations appeared to reduce the potentially mineralizable carbon pool, and the age of tea plantations also had an effect on the SOC mineralization and sequestration. The relatively weak SOC mineralization temperature sensitivity of the tea plantation soils suggested that the SOC pool of the tea plantation soils was less vulnerable to warming than that of the control soils."

Abnormal diurnal blood pressure (BP) rhythms such as non-dipping may contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in HIV infected individuals. However, little data exists on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and measures of vascular stiffness in the black African HIV infected population.This is a cross-sectional analysis of otherwise well, HIV infected outpatients on ART for >5 years. Study assessments included: 24hr ABP monitoring, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) using a AtCor Medical Sphygmocor device, fasting lipogram, oral glucose tolerance test, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and anthropometric data. Patients completed a questionnaire of autonomic symptoms. CD4+ counts and viral loads were obtained from the National Laboratory results system.Sixty seven black participants were included in the analysis of whom 91% (n = 61) were female with a mean age of 42.2 ± 8.6 years. The median duration on ART was 7.5 years (IQR = 6-10), 84% were virally supressed and the median CD4 count was 529.5cells/mm3 (IQR = 372.0-686.5). The majority (67%) were classified as overweight and 76% had an increased waist circumference, yet only 88% of participants were normotensive. A hsCRP level in the high cardiovascular risk category was found in 68% of participants. The prevalence of non-dipping BP was 65%. Interestingly, there was no association on multivariable analysis between dipping status and traditional risk factors for non-dipping BP, such as: obesity, autonomic dysfunction and older age.This relatively young cross-sectional sample of predominantly normotensive, but overweight black women on effective ART >5 years showed: a high prevalence of non-dipping BP, inflammation and vascular stiffness. Causality cannot be inferred but cardiovascular risk reduction should be emphasized in these patients."

Polyol/Monosaccharide transporter (PLT) proteins previously identified in plants are involved in the loading of polyols into the phloem and are reported to be located in the plasma membrane. The functions of PLT proteins in leguminous plants are not yet clear. In this study, a total of 14 putative PLT genes (LjPLT1-14) were identified in the genome of Lotus japonicus and divided into 4 clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Different patterns of expression of LjPLT genes in various tissues were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. Four genes (LjPLT3, 4, 11, and 14) from clade II were expressed at much higher levels in nodule than in other tissues. Moreover, three of these genes (LjPLT3, 4, and 14) showed significantly increased expression in roots after inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti. Three genes (LjPLT1, 3, and 9) responded when salinity and/or osmotic stresses were applied to L. japonicus. Transient expression of GFP-LjPLT fusion constructs in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts indicated that the LjPLT1, LjPLT6 and LjPLT7 proteins are localized to the plasma membrane, but LjPLT2 (clade IV), LjPLT3, 4, 5 (clade II) and LjPLT8 (clade III) proteins possibly reside in the Golgi apparatus. The results suggest that members of the LjPLT gene family may be involved in different biological processes, several of which may potentially play roles in nodulation in this nitrogen-fixing legume."
https://openalex.org/W2755915406,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a bacterium frequently isolated from chronic periodontal lesions and is involved in the development of chronic periodontitis. To colonize the gingival crevice, P. gingivalis has to adapt to environmental stresses. Microbial gene expression is regulated by transcription factors such as those in two-component systems and extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. ECF sigma factors are involved in the regulation of environmental stress response genes; however, the roles of individual ECF sigma factors are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions, including autoaggregation, hemagglutination, gingipain activity, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, and surface structure formation, of P. gingivalis ECF sigma factors encoded by SigP (PGN_0274), SigCH (PGN_0319), PGN_0450, PGN_0970, and SigH (PGN_1740). Various physiological aspects of the sigP mutant were affected; autoaggregation was significantly decreased at 60 min (p < 0.001), hemagglutination activity was markedly reduced, and enzymatic activities of Kgp and Rgps were significantly decreased (p < 0.001). The other mutants also showed approximately 50% reduction in Rgps activity. Kgp activity was significantly reduced in the sigH mutant (p < 0.001). No significant differences in susceptibilities to tetracycline and ofloxacin were observed in the mutants compared to those of the wild-type strain. However, the sigP mutant displayed an increased susceptibility to ampicillin, whereas the PGN_0450 and sigH mutants showed reduced susceptibility. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed increased levels of outer membrane vesicles formed at the cell surfaces of the sigP mutant. These results indicate that SigP is important for bacterial surface-associated activities, including gingipain activity, autoaggregation, hemagglutination, vesicle formation, and antimicrobial susceptibility."

Studies have found a correlation between the plasma levels of thyroid hormones and ghrelin, but an effect of ghrelin on the human thyroid has never been investigated even though ghrelin receptors are present in the thyroid. The present study shows a ghrelin-induced decrease in the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-induced production of thyroglobulin and mRNA expression of thyroperoxidase in a primary culture of human thyroid cells obtained from paranodular tissue. Accordingly, a trend was noted for an inhibition of TSH-stimulated expression of the sodium-iodine symporter and the TSH-receptor. Thus, this study suggests an effect of ghrelin on human thyrocytes and thereby emphasizes the relevance of examining whether ghrelin also influences the metabolic homeostasis through altered thyroid hormone production."

Global hypomethylation is observed in nearly all CRC, but a distinct subset of CRC show the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). These tumors show DNA hypermethylation of a specific subset of CpG islands, resulting in transcriptional downregulation of nearby genes. Recently we reported the establishment of novel CRC cell lines derived from primary and metastatic CRC tissues. In this study we describe the DNA methylation profiling of these low passage CRC cell lines. We generated global DNA methylation profiles with Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips and analysed them in conjunction with matching gene expression profiles. Multidimensional scaling of the DNA methylation and gene expression datasets showed that BRAF mutated cell lines form a distinct group. In this group we investigated the 706 loci which we have previously identified to be hypermethylated in BRAF mutant CRC. We validated the significant findings in the The Cancer Genome Atlas colon adenocarcinoma dataset. Our analysis identified ELOVL5, FAM127B, MTERF1, ZNF606 to be subject to transcriptional downregulation through DNA hypermethylation in CRC. We further investigated ELOVL5 with qPCR and immunohistochemical staining, validating our results, but did not find a clear relation between ELOVL5 expression and tumor stage or relapse free survival. ELOVL5, FAM127B, MTERF1, ZNF606 are involved in important cellular processes such as apoptosis, lipogenesis and the downstream transcriptional effect of the MAPK-pathway. We have identified a DNA methylation profile regulating key cellular processes in CRC, resulting in a growth advantage to the tumor cells."

Metagenomic technology is a shortcut approach used to obtain new genes from uncultured microorganisms. In this study, a subtropical soil metagenomic library was constructed, and a putative LDC gene named ldc1E was isolated by function-based screening strategy through the indication of pH change by L-lysine decarboxylation. Amino acid sequence comparison and homology modeling indicated the close relation between Ldc1E and other putative LDCs. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that Ldc1E contained a highly conserved motif Ser-X-His-Lys (Pxl), and molecular docking results showed that this motif was located in the active site and could combine with the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The ldc1E gene was subcloned into the pET-30a(+) vector and highly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. The maximum activity of Ldc1E occurred at pH 6.5 and 40°C using L-lysine monohydrochloride as the substrate. Recombinant Ldc1E had apparent Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values of 1.08±0.16 mM, 5.09±0.63 s-1, and 4.73×103 s-1 M-1, respectively. The specific activity of Ldc1E was 1.53±0.06 U mg-1 protein.

Disadvantages, such as low accessibility, high costs, and imprecision of clinical tests and ultrasonography measurements, may compromise health decisions at birth, based on the gestational age. Newborns' organs and tissues can indirectly indicate their physical maturity, and we hypothesized that evolutionary changes in their skin, detected using an optoelectronic device meter, may aid in estimating the gestational age. This study analyzed the feasibility of using newborn skin reflectance to estimate the gestational age at birth noninvasively.A cross-sectional study evaluated the skin reflectance of selected infants, preferably premature, at birth. The first-trimester ultrasound was the reference for gestational age. A prototype of a new noninvasive optoelectronic device measured the backscattering of light from the skin, using a light emitting diode at wavelengths of 470 nm, 575 nm, and 630 nm. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis models were employed to predict gestational age, combining skin reflectance with clinical variables for gestational age estimation. The gestational age at birth of 115 newborns from 24.1 to 41.8 weeks of gestation correlated with the light at 630 nm wavelength reflectance 3.3 mm/6.5 mm ratio distant of the sensor, at the forearm and sole (Pearson's correlation = 0.505, P < 0.001 and 0.710, P < 0.001, respectively). The best-combined variables to predict the gold standard gestational age at birth was the skin reflectance at wavelengths of 630 nm and 470 nm in combination with birth weight, phototherapy, and adjusted to include incubator stay, and sex (R2 = 0.828, P < 0.001). The main limitation of the study is that it was very specific to the premature population we studied and needs to be studied in a broader spectrum of newborns.A novel automated skin reflectometer device, in combination with clinical variables, was able to predict the gestational age and could be useful when the information is in doubt or is unknown. Multivariable predictive models associated the skin reflectance with easy to obtain clinical parameters, at the birth scenario. External validation needs to be proven in an actual population with the real incidence of premature infants."
https://openalex.org/W3151916380,"Finite time synchronization, which means synchronization can be achieved in a settling time, is desirable in some practical applications. However, most of the published results on finite time synchronization don’t include delays or only include discrete delays. In view of the fact that distributed delays inevitably exist in neural networks, this paper aims to investigate the finite time synchronization of memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (MCGNNs) with both discrete delay and distributed delay (mixed delays). By means of a simple feedback controller and novel finite time synchronization analysis methods, several new criteria are derived to ensure the finite time synchronization of MCGNNs with mixed delays. The obtained criteria are very concise and easy to verify. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results."

We aimed to estimate the prevalence and related risk factors of HCV infections by the stages of liver fibrosis, using non-invasive methods, to understand testing needs in Poland.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012-2016 adopting a stratified random sampling of primary health care units followed by systematic sampling of patients within each unit. Study participants filled a questionnaire and donated blood for laboratory HCV testing. Additionally, the results of liver function tests and platelet count were collected to calculate APRI and FIB-4 scores. Cases were classified according to the level of fibrosis: 'significant fibrosis' (APRI≥0.7 or FIB4≥1.45) and 'no significant fibrosis' (APRI<0.7 and FIB4<1.45).Of 21 875 study participants, 102 were HCV-RNA positive. Prevalence of HCV infections and significant fibrosis was estimated at 0.47% (95% CI 0.38% - 0.57%) and 0.12% (0.08% - 0.17%), respectively. Cases with significant fibrosis accounted for 51.6% (33.4%-69.9%) in men and 34.4% (17.3%-51.4%) in women. There was no correlation between the HCV prevalence and age. Blood transfusion prior to 1992 strongly predicted significant fibrosis as did the history of injecting drug use (IDU) and ever having an HCV-infected sexual partner in men and caesarean sections in women. Factors associated with HCV infection without significant fibrosis were tattooing in men and younger age in women. We acknowledge limited possibility to study the associations between IDU and ever having HCV-infected sexual partner, given small sample sizes for these exposures.As no clear birth cohort affected by HCV could be identified, risk factor-based screening in the general population should be considered, taking into account the association between the increased risk of liver fibrosis and the history of transfusion prior to 1992 and caesarean sections."
https://openalex.org/W2756144725,"Background Undernutrition below two years of age remains a major public health problem in India. We conducted an evaluation of an integrated nutrition and health program that aimed to improve nutritional status of young children by improving breast and complementary feeding practices over that offered by the Government of India’s standard nutrition and health care program. Methods In Uttar Pradesh state, through multi-stage cluster random sampling, 81 villages in an intervention district and 84 villages in a comparison district were selected. A cohort of 957 third trimester pregnant women identified during house-to-house surveys was enrolled and, following childbirth, mother-child dyads were followed every three months from birth to 18 months of age. The primary outcomes were improvements in weight-for-age and length-for-age z scores, with improved breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices as intermediate outcomes. Findings Optimal breastfeeding practices were higher among women in intervention than comparison areas, including initiating breastfeeding within one hour of delivery (17.4% vs. 2.7%, p<0.001), feeding colostrum (34.7% vs. 8.4%, p<0.001), avoiding pre-lacteals (19.6% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and exclusively breastfeeding up to 6 months (24.1% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.001). However, differences were few and mixed between study arms with respect to complementary feeding practices. The mean weight-for-age z-score was higher at 9 months (-2.1 vs. -2.4, p = 0.0026) and the prevalence of underweight status was lower at 12 months (58.5% vs. 69.3%, p = 0.047) among intervention children. The prevalence of stunting was similar between study arms at all ages. Coefficients to show the differences between the intervention and comparison districts (0.13 cm/mo) suggested significant faster linear growth among intervention district infants at earlier ages (0–5 months). Interpretation Mothers participating in the intervention district were more likely to follow optimal breast, although not complementary feeding practices. The program modestly improved linear growth in earlier age and weight gain in late infancy. Comprehensive nutrition and health interventions are complex; the implementation strategies need careful examination to improve feeding practices and thus impact growth. Trial registration The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00198835."
https://openalex.org/W2895065487,"Previously, Bithionol (BT) was shown to enhance the chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines to cisplatin treatment. In the present study, we focused on the anti-tumor potential of the BT-paclitaxel combination when added to a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. This in vitro study aimed to 1) determine the optimum schedule for combination of BT and paclitaxel and 2) assess the nature and mechanism(s) underlying BT-paclitaxel interactions. The cytotoxic effects of both drugs either alone or in combination were assessed by presto-blue cell viability assay using six human ovarian cancer cell lines. Inhibitory concentrations to achieve 50% cell death (IC50) were determined for BT and paclitaxel in each cell line. Changes in levels of cleaved PARP, XIAP, bcl-2, bcl-xL, p21 and p27 were determined via immunoblot. Luminescent and colorimetric assays were used to determine caspases 3/7 and autotaxin (ATX) activity. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Our results show that the efficacy of the BT-paclitaxel combination depends upon the concentrations and sequence of addition of paclitaxel and BT. Pretreatment with BT followed by paclitaxel resulted in antagonistic interactions whereas synergistic interactions were observed when both drugs were added simultaneously or when cells were pretreated with paclitaxel followed by BT. Synergistic interactions between BT and paclitaxel were attributed to increased ROS generation and enhanced apoptosis. Decreased expression of pro-survival factors (XIAP, bcl-2, bcl-xL) and increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors (caspases 3/7, PARP cleavage) was observed. Additionally, increased expression of key cell cycle regulators p21 and p27 was observed. These results show that BT and paclitaxel interacted synergistically at most drug ratios which, however, was highly dependent on the sequence of the addition of drugs. Our results suggest that BT-paclitaxel combination therapy may be effective in sensitizing ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment, thus mitigating some of the toxic effects associated with high doses of paclitaxel."
https://openalex.org/W2753994888,"Despite spectacular progress in cellular transplantology, there are still many concerns about the fate of transplanted cells. More preclinical studies are needed, especially on large animal models, to bridge the translational gap between basic research and the clinic. Herein, we propose a novel approach in analysis of cell transplantation effects in large animals explants using in vivo imaging system (IVIS®) or similar equipment.In the in vitro experiment cells labeled with fluorescent membrane dyes: DID (far red) or PKH26 (orange) were visualized with IVIS®. The correlation between the fluorescence signal and cell number with or without addition of minced muscle tissue was calculated. In the ex vivo study urethras obtained from goats after intraurethral cells (n = 9) or PBS (n = 4) injections were divided into 0.5 cm cross-slices and analyzed by using IVIS®. Automatic algorithm followed or not by manual setup was used to separate specific dye signal from tissue autofluorescence. The results were verified by systematic microscopic analysis of standard 10 μm specimens prepared from slices before and after immunohistochemical staining. Comparison of obtained data was performed using diagnostic test function.Fluorescence signal strength in IVIS® was directly proportional to the number of cells regardless of the dye used and detectable for minimum 0.25x106 of cells. DID-derived signal was much less affected by the background signal in comparison to PKH26 in in vitro test. Using the IVIS® to scan explants in defined arrangement resulted in precise localization of DID but not PKH26 positive spots. Microscopic analysis of histological specimens confirmed the specificity (89%) and sensitivity (80%) of IVIS® assessment relative to DID dye. The procedure enabled successful immunohistochemical staining of specimens derived from analyzed slices.The IVIS® system under appropriate conditions of visualization and analysis can be used as a method for ex vivo evaluation of cell transplantation effects. Presented protocol allows for evaluation of cell delivery precision rate, enables semi-quantitative assessment of signal, preselects material for further analysis without interfering with the tissue properties. Far red dyes are appropriate fluorophores to cell labeling for this application."
https://openalex.org/W2754847531,"Tubulin polymerization promoting proteins (TPPPs) belong to a family of neomorphic moon lighting proteins, involved in various physiological and pathological conditions. In physiological conditions, TPPPs play an important role in microtubule dynamics regulating mitotic spindle assembly and in turn cell proliferation. In pathological situations, TPPPs interact with α-synuclein and β-amyloid and promote their aggregation leading to Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy. Orthologs of TPPP family proteins were identified in ciliary proteomes from various organisms including Chlamydomonas but their role in ciliogenesis was not known. Here we showed that Flagellar Associated Protein, FAP265, a Chlamydomonas homologue of TPPP family proteins, localizes in the cytosol, at the basal bodies and in the flagella of vegetative Chlamydomonas cells. During cell division, the protein was found as a distinct spot in the nucleus and at the cleavage furrow which forms between the daughter cells. Further null mutants of Chlamydomonas FAP265 protein, fap265, showed severe defects in hatching from the mother sporangium. Daughter cells of fap265 were significantly larger in size compared with wild type cells. Moreover, the daughter cells present within the mother sporangium failed to form flagella before hatching. They reassembled their flagella only after hatching from the sporangium suggesting that FAP265 plays an important role in flagellar reassembly after cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2755367792,"Objective To evaluate predictive factors for retrograde ureteral stent failure in patients with non-urological malignant ureteral obstruction. Materials and methods Between 2005 and 2014, medical records of 284 malignant ureteral obstruction patients with 712 retrograde ureteral stent trials including 63 (22.2%) having bilateral malignant ureteral obstruction were retrospectively reviewed. Retrograde ureteral stent failure was defined as the inability to place ureteral stents by cystoscopy, recurrent stent obstruction within one month, or non-relief of azotemia within one week from the prior retrograde ureteral stent. The clinicopathological parameters and first retrograde pyelographic findings were analyzed to investigate the predictive factors for retrograde ureteral stent failure and conversion to percutaneous nephrostomy in multivariate analysis with a statistical significance of p < 0.05. Results Retrograde ureteral stent failure was detected in 14.1% of patients. The mean number of retrograde ureteral stent placements and indwelling duration of the ureteral stents were 2.5 ± 2.6 times and 8.6 ± 4.0 months, respectively. Multivariate analyses identified several specific RGP findings as significant predictive factors for retrograde ureteral stent failure (p < 0.05). The significant retrograde pyelographic findings included grade 4 hydronephrosis (hazard ratio 4.10, 95% confidence interval 1.39–12.09), irreversible ureteral kinking (hazard ratio 2.72, confidence interval 1.03–7.18), presence of bladder invasion (hazard ratio 4.78, confidence interval 1.81–12.63), and multiple lesions of ureteral stricture (hazard ratio 3.46, confidence interval 1.35–8.83) (p < 0.05). Conclusion Retrograde pyelography might prevent unnecessary and ineffective retrograde ureteral stent trials in patients with advanced non-urological malignant ureteral obstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2754110579,"The branched-chain sugar apiose was widely assumed to be synthesized only by plant species. In plants, apiose-containing polysaccharides are found in vascularized plant cell walls as the pectic polymers rhamnogalacturonan II and apiogalacturonan. Apiosylated secondary metabolites are also common in many plant species including ancestral avascular bryophytes and green algae. Apiosyl-residues have not been documented in bacteria. In a screen for new bacterial glycan structures, we detected small amounts of apiose in methanolic extracts of the aerobic phototroph Geminicoccus roseus and the pathogenic soil-dwelling bacteria Xanthomonas pisi. Apiose was also present in the cell pellet of X. pisi. Examination of these bacterial genomes uncovered genes with relatively low protein homology to plant UDP-apiose/UDP-xylose synthase (UAS). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these bacterial UAS-like homologs belong in a clade distinct to UAS and separated from other nucleotide sugar biosynthetic enzymes. Recombinant expression of three bacterial UAS-like proteins demonstrates that they actively convert UDP-glucuronic acid to UDP-apiose and UDP-xylose. Both UDP-apiose and UDP-xylose were detectable in cell cultures of G. roseus and X. pisi. We could not, however, definitively identify the apiosides made by these bacteria, but the detection of apiosides coupled with the in vivo transcription of bUAS and production of UDP-apiose clearly demonstrate that these microbes have evolved the ability to incorporate apiose into glycans during their lifecycles. While this is the first report to describe enzymes for the formation of activated apiose in bacteria, the advantage of synthesizing apiose-containing glycans in bacteria remains unknown. The characteristics of bUAS and its products are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2755451140,"A hypothesis that anger is related to high energetic arousal (EA), but only at a low level of agreeableness was tested. In the first two studies, the association between trait anger, agreeableness, and EA was explored. In the next two studies, the interactions of agreeableness with constructs conceptually and empirically close to EA, in predicting anger were tested. Study 3 revealed that anger was predicted by a low level of agreeableness and a high level of positive affect. In study 4 task engagement (construct containing an energetic component) was included in the context of cognitive performance. At a high level of agreeableness the association between anger and task engagement was negative, whereas among individuals with low agreeableness this relation was not significant."
https://openalex.org/W2755962885,"The maximum entropy (ME) method is a recently-developed approach for estimating local false discovery rates (LFDR) that incorporates external information allowing assignment of a subset of tests to a category with a different prior probability of following the null hypothesis. Using this ME method, we have reanalyzed the findings from a recent large genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease (CAD), incorporating biologic annotations. Our revised LFDR estimates show many large reductions in LFDR, particularly among the genetic variants belonging to annotation categories that were known to be of particular interest for CAD. However, among SNPs with rare minor allele frequencies, the reductions in LFDR were modest in size."
https://openalex.org/W2756394004,"To assess in clinical practice the frequency and diagnosis associated with the SS-B-positive/SS-A negative autoantibody profile.We analyzed a one-year consecutive population of 624 patients referred by clinicians to the immunology laboratory to investigate anti-SS-A and/or anti-SS-B autoantibodies, who were detected using luminex technology. Data were analyzed for patients with isolated anti-SS-B autoantibodies. The clinical characteristics and diagnosis of connective tissue diseases (CTD) were retrieved according to the international criteria.Among 1173 sera positive for anti-SS-A and/or anti-SS-B autoantibodies from 624 patients, we identified 84 patients (13.5%) that had isolated anti-SS-B. Among the 75 patients positive for anti-SS-B with known clinical data, 15 were diagnosed with a CTD (20%) including 4 systemic lupus erythematosus (5%), 4 rheumatoid arthritis (5%), 2 idiopathic inflammatory myositis (3%), 1 primary Sjögren's syndrome pSS (1%), 1 systemic sclerosis (1%), 2 undefined CTD (3%), and 1 mixed CTD (1%). Among the 60 other patients, 18 had non-CTD autoimmune diseases and 42 had non-autoimmune diseases. Within the CTD population, the presence of isolated anti-SS-B was not significantly associated to characteristic indicating a specific syndrome. There was no association between diagnosis of CTD and level of anti-SS-B autoantibodies (p = 0.70). Arthralgia was the more frequent sign and encountered in 10 patients (67%), of whom 3 had arthritis.The presence of anti-SS-B, without anti-SS-A autoantibodies using luminex technology, was not associated with CTD, especially pSS, in daily clinical practice. Our data suggests that the SS-B serological profile is not contributive for the classification criteria of pSS."
https://openalex.org/W2754071562,"Frataxin is a highly conserved protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is involved in several central functions in cells, which include iron delivery to biochemical processes, such as heme synthesis, assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC), storage of surplus iron in conditions of iron overload, and repair of ISC in aconitase. Frataxin from different organisms has been shown to undergo iron-dependent oligomerization. At least two different classes of oligomers, with different modes of oligomer packing and stabilization, have been identified. Here, we continue our efforts to explore the factors that control the oligomerization of frataxin from different organisms, and focus on E. coli frataxin CyaY. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that higher iron-to-protein ratios lead to larger oligomeric species, and that oligomerization proceeds in a linear fashion as a results of iron oxidation. Native mass spectrometry and online size-exclusion chromatography combined with SAXS show that a dimer is the most common form of CyaY in the presence of iron at atmospheric conditions. Modeling of the dimer using the SAXS data confirms the earlier proposed head-to-tail packing arrangement of monomers. This packing mode brings several conserved acidic residues into close proximity to each other, creating an environment for metal ion binding and possibly even mineralization. Together with negative-stain electron microscopy, the experiments also show that trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and presumably higher-order oligomers may exist in solution. Nano-differential scanning fluorimetry shows that the oligomers have limited stability and may easily dissociate at elevated temperatures. The factors affecting the possible oligomerization mode are discussed"
