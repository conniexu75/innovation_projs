https://openalex.org/W1969464492,"Some stimulatory receptors of the innate immune system, such as the NKG2D receptor (also called KLRK1) expressed by natural killer cells and activated CD8(+)T cells, recognize self-molecules that are upregulated in diseased cells by poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that mouse and human NKG2D ligands are upregulated in non-tumour cell lines by genotoxic stress and stalled DNA replication, conditions known to activate a major DNA damage checkpoint pathway initiated by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) or ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) protein kinases. Ligand upregulation was prevented by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ATR, ATM or Chk1 (a downstream transducer kinase in the pathway). Furthermore, constitutive ligand expression by a tumour cell line was inhibited by targeting short interfering RNA to ATM, suggesting that ligand expression in established tumour cells, which often harbour genomic irregularities, may be due to chronic activation of the DNA damage response pathway. Thus, the DNA damage response, previously shown to arrest the cell cycle and enhance DNA repair functions, or to trigger apoptosis, may also participate in alerting the immune system to the presence of potentially dangerous cells."

Here, we present new evidence that basin-scale changes in the Atlantic Ocean, probably related to the thermohaline circulation, have been an important driver of multidecadal variations in the summertime climate of both North America and western Europe. Our findings advance understanding of past climate changes and also have implications for decadal climate predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2119170562,"The midbrain dopamine neurons are hypothesized to provide a physiological correlate of the reward prediction error signal required by current models of reinforcement learning. We examined the activity of single dopamine neurons during a task in which subjects learned by trial and error when to make an eye movement for a juice reward. We found that these neurons encoded the difference between the current reward and a weighted average of previous rewards, a reward prediction error, but only for outcomes that were better than expected. Thus, the firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons is quantitatively predicted by theoretical descriptions of the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models for circumstances in which this signal has a positive value. We also found that the dopamine system continued to compute the reward prediction error even when the behavioral policy of the animal was only weakly influenced by this computation."

https://openalex.org/W2060603511,"Using an active approach to preventing biofilm formation, we implemented a microfluidic bioreactor that enables long-term culture and monitoring of extremely small populations of bacteria with single-cell resolution. We used this device to observe the dynamics of Escherichia coli carrying a synthetic “population control” circuit that regulates cell density through a feedback mechanism based on quorum sensing. The microfluidic bioreactor enabled long-term monitoring of unnatural behavior programmed by the synthetic circuit, which included sustained oscillations in cell density and associated morphological changes, over hundreds of hours."
https://openalex.org/W2139049032,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a multiserotype bacterial pathogen representing a major cause of life-threatening infections in newborns. To develop a broadly protective vaccine, we analyzed the genome sequences of eight GBS isolates and cloned and tested 312 surface proteins as vaccines. Four proteins elicited protection in mice, and their combination proved highly protective against a large panel of strains, including all circulating serotypes. Protection also correlated with antigen accessibility on the bacterial surface and with the induction of opsonophagocytic antibodies. Multigenome analysis and screening described here represent a powerful strategy for identifying potential vaccine candidates against highly variable pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2061258627,"We present evidence for a specific role of p53 in the mitochondria-associated cellular dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities of Huntington’s disease (HD). Mutant huntingtin (mHtt) with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) binds to p53 and upregulates levels of nuclear p53 as well as p53 transcriptional activity in neuronal cultures. The augmentation is specific, as it occurs with mHtt but not mutant ataxin-1 with expanded polyQ. p53 levels are also increased in the brains of mHtt transgenic (mHtt-Tg) mice and HD patients. Perturbation of p53 by pifithrin-α, RNA interference, or genetic deletion prevents mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytotoxicity in HD cells, as well as the decreased respiratory complex IV activity of mHtt-Tg mice. Genetic deletion of p53 suppresses neurodegeneration in mHtt-Tg flies and neurobehavioral abnormalities of mHtt-Tg mice.

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a genetically dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene leading to an abnormal Huntingtin protein product (Htt) (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research GroupA novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington’s disease chromosomes.Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6496) Google Scholar).

Mitochondrial disturbances in HD patient brains are not likely secondary to overall neuropathologic alterations, as lymphoblasts from HD patients manifest abnormal mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Panov et al., 2002Panov A.V.

The mitochondrial defect may be disease specific, as lymphoblasts from the patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), another neurodegenerative condition caused by an expanded polyQ in the disease gene ataxin-1, do not display mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Sawa et al., 1999Sawa A.

Mutant Htt interacts with nuclear factors such as CREB binding protein (CBP) (Nucifora et al., 2001Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S.

Sp1 and TAFII130 transcriptional activity disrupted in early Huntington’s disease.Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), whose loss of function may mediate cytotoxicity. The tumor suppressor gene p53 has multiple functions in processes as diverse as angiogenesis and chemotaxis (Vogelstein et al., 2000Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5529) Google Scholar). p53 is also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where its function is not established (Morrison and Kinoshita, 2000Morrison R.S. Kinoshita Y. The role of p53 in neuronal cell death.Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). While acute excitotoxic insults, such as kainic acid, induce p53 activation and p53 null mice are mildly resistant to neurotoxicity (Morrison et al., 1996Morrison R.S. Wenzel H.J. Kinoshita Y. Robbins C.A. Donehower L.A. Schwartzkroin P.A. Loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene protects neurons from kainate-induced cell death.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the increase of p53 is primary or secondary to excitotoxicity. Overexpression of p53 in dissociated primary neuron cultures elicits neuronal death (Jordan et al., 1997Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Prehn J.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Beckett M. Ghadge G.D. Roos R.P. Leiden J.M. Miller R.J. p53 expression induces apoptosis in hippocampal pyramidal neuron cultures.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of endogenous p53 has not been investigated. Binding of mHtt with p53 has been reported (Steffan et al., 2000Steffan J.S. Kazantsev A. Spasic-Boskovic O. Greenwald M. Zhu Y.Z. Gohler H. Wanker E.E. Bates G.P. Housman D.E. Thompson L.M. The Huntington’s disease protein interacts with p53 and CREB-binding protein and represses transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), but its pathophysiological implication remains unknown. Immortalized striatal neurons derived from mHtt knockin mouse embryos show elevated levels of p53 protein (Trettel et al., 2000Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Dominant phenotypes produced by the HD mutation in STHdh(Q111) striatal cells.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Genes regulated by p53 are among a large cohort upregulated in cell cultures transfected with mHtt (Sipione et al., 2002Sipione S. Rigamonti D. Valenza M. Zuccato C. Conti L. Pritchard J. Kooperberg C. Olson J.M. Cattaneo E. Early transcriptional profiles in huntingtin-inducible striatal cells by microarray analyses.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although nuclei and mitochondria participate in HD pathology, their relationship has been elusive. Because nuclear p53 regulates many mitochondrial genes and genes for oxidative stress (Sharpless and DePinho, 2002Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. p53: good cop/bad cop.Cell. 2002; 110: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Vogelstein et al., 2000Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5529) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that p53 might link the nuclear and mitochondrial pathologies in HD. We have investigated p53 in HD cell and transgenic animal models expressing mHtt as well as HD patient brains. We present evidence for a specific role of p53 in the mitochondria-associated cellular dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities of Huntington’s disease. In PC12 cells stably expressing the N-terminal 63 amino acids of Htt with 148 polyQ (N63-148Q) in an inducible manner (Igarashi et al., 2003Igarashi S. Morita H. Bennett K.M. Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Peters M.F. Cooper J.K. Wood J.D. Sawa A. Ross C.A. Inducible PC12 cell model of Huntington’s disease shows toxicity and decreased histone acetylation.Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the protein level of p53 is increased more than 10-fold after induction of mHtt, but not wild-type Htt (wtHtt) N63-18Q. The increased p53 occurs selectively in the P1 fractions designated as crude nuclei (Figure 1A ) in 1% SDS-soluble, nonaggregate fractions (Figure 1C), implying that the transactivation-independent role for p53 in the mitochondria is unlikely (Chipuk et al., 2004Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Direct activation of Bax by p53 mediates mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis.Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The increase of p53 protein appears to be posttranslational, as mRNA levels of p53 are increased only 1.4-fold (Figure 1B). In the brains of transgenic mice expressing the N-terminal 171 amino acids of Htt with 82 polyglutamine repeats (N171-82Q) (Schilling et al., 1999Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. et al.Intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates in transgenic mice expressing a mutant N-terminal fragment of huntingtin.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p53 is also elevated (Figure 1D). Enhancement of p53 is selective, as kainate, which causes more neuronal death than mHtt, induces a lesser increase in p53. Postmortem brains of human HD patients also manifest substantial p53 increases, with the highest levels in the cases with the most extensive HD pathology (Figure 1E). Only striatum and cerebral cortex show p53 upregulation with no increase in cerebellum, fitting with the regional and cellular selectivity of HD pathology (Sawa, 2001Sawa A.

Confirming the previously reported interaction between exon 1 of Htt (N63-20Q, -51Q, and -83Q) and p53 (Steffan et al., 2000Steffan J.S. Kazantsev A. Spasic-Boskovic O. Greenwald M. Zhu Y.Z. Gohler H. Wanker E.E. Bates G.P. Housman D.E. Thompson L.M. The Huntington’s disease protein interacts with p53 and CREB-binding protein and represses transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), we observe direct binding of Htt N171 and p53 in vitro (Figure 1F). Furthermore, p53 coimmunoprecipitates with N171 as well as full-length (FL) Htt in transiently transfected 293T cells (Figures 1G and 1H). In both cases, mHtt binds more efficiently to p53 than wtHtt. Coimmunoprecipation (co-IP) of p53 and Htt at endogenous protein levels is evident in stressed HD patient lymphoblasts (Figure 1I). We wondered whether augmented p53 is associated with increased transcriptional activity. Using the p53 binding sequence upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (el-Deiry et al., 1992el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Definition of a consensus binding site for p53.Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), we monitored p53-mediated gene activation (Figures 2A and 2B ). Stable expression of mHtt N63-148Q in PC12 cells elicits a 4-fold increase of p53 transcriptional activation, while in rat primary cortical cultures, transient transfection of mHtt N171-82Q causes an approximately 5-fold amplification of p53 activity. Activation is selective for N171-82Q as well as FL mHtt, since transient expression of ataxin-1 with expanded polyQ fails to influence p53 transcriptional activity (Figure 2C). Vector-based RNA interference (RNAi) to p53 (pSuper-p53) (Brummelkamp et al., 2002Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

Bax and Puma protein levels are significantly augmented by mHtt, whereas Apaf-1 is only marginally augmented (Figures 2F). Mitochondrial membrane depolarization is enhanced in lymphoblasts of HD but not SCA1 patients treated with low concentrations of cyanide (25 μM) (Sawa et al., 1999Sawa A. Wiegand G.W. Cooper J. Margolis R.L. Sharp A.H. Lawler Jr., J.F. Greenamyre J.T. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Increased apoptosis of Huntington disease lymphoblasts associated with repeat length-dependent mitochondrial depolarization.Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As p53 can mediate mitochondrial function and is selectively influenced by mHtt but not by mutant ataxin-1 (Figure 2C), we explored a role for p53 in mHtt-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Pretreatment of the cyanide-exposed HD lymphoblasts with 10 μM pifithrin-α blocks depolarization of the mitochondria (Figure 3A). Induction of mHtt N63-148Q in PC12 cells causes pronounced mitochondrial membrane depolarization after 5 days of induction (Figures 3B and 3C ). Treatment with pifithrin-α (1 μM) completely blocks the depolarization, indicating that p53 mediates the mitochondrial abnormality. By contrast, pifithrin-α does not affect the rapid mitochondrial membrane depolarization elicited by carbonylcyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a protonophore and uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, demonstrating specificity of pifithrin-α for the p53 pathway. In primary cortical cultures of p53+/+ mice, we observe substantial mitochondrial membrane depolarization associated with transfected mHtt N63-148Q but not wtHtt N63-18Q at a time when nuclei are intact in most neurons (Figures 3D and 3E). Cultures from p53+/− and p53−/− mice (Donehower et al., 1992Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Mice deficient for p53 are developmentally normal but susceptible to spontaneous tumours.Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3904) Google Scholar) are protected from this mitochondrial depolarization. mHtt-Tg mouse models display mitochondrial dysfunction affecting enzymes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain IV (Tabrizi et al., 2000Tabrizi S.J. Workman J. Hart P.E. Mangiarini L. Mahal A. Bates G. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical damage in the Huntington R6/2 transgenic mouse.Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To evaluate the influence of p53 on such mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo, we injected line 81 N171-82Q mHtt-Tg mice i.p. with pifithrin-α, which efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier (Duan et al., 2002Duan W. Zhu X. Ladenheim B. Yu Q.S. Guo Z. Oyler J. Cutler R.G. Cadet J.L. Greig N.H. Mattson M.P. p53 inhibitors preserve dopamine neurons and motor function in experimental parkinsonism.Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The treatment significantly prevents impaired complex IV activity of mHtt-Tg mice (Figure 3F). To address the cellular consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction, we evaluated cytotoxicity following inhibition of p53 with pifithrin-α, RNAi, or genetic deletion. Induction of mHtt N63-148Q (Igarashi et al., 2003Igarashi S. Morita H. Bennett K.M. Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Peters M.F. Cooper J.K. Wood J.D. Sawa A. Ross C.A. Inducible PC12 cell model of Huntington’s disease shows toxicity and decreased histone acetylation.Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or transfection of FL-82Q causes the death of PC12 cells. The tripling of PC12 cell death elicited by mHtt is abolished by pifithrin-α (10 μM) or pSuper-p53 (Figure 4A ). Antisense oligonucleotides against p53 provide about the same degree of protection as pifithrin-α (data not shown). We also employed primary cerebral cortical cultures from wild-type and p53-deleted mice. In p53+/+ cultures, mHtt N171-82Q transfection elicits 2.5 times greater cell death than wtHtt N171-18Q. By contrast, mHtt fails to elicit neurotoxicity in cultures from p53−/− mice. Pronounced, but not complete, protection is also evident in p53+/− cultures (Figures 4B and 4C). We investigated whether p53 is also involved in mHtt-associated aggregate formation (DiFiglia et al., 1997DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N.

Nuclear inclusions in glutamine repeat disorders: are they pernicious, coincidental, or beneficial?.Cell. 1998; 95: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We monitored the formation and nuclear targeting of mHtt aggregates in cortical cultures (Figures 4D and 4E). We find no significant difference between p53+/+ and p53−/− neurons in aggregate formation and nuclear localization of mHtt. We observe substantial nuclear fragmentation and condensation in p53+/+ but not in p53−/− preparations of mHtt cells. Thus, in contrast to the critical role of p53 in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell death, mHtt-associated nuclear aggregate formation does not appear to be influenced by p53. To explore the role of p53 in mHtt-induced cell death of intact animals, we evaluated the effect of p53 deletion in mHtt-Tg flies (Jackson et al., 1998Jackson G.R. Salecker I. Dong X. Yao X.

The mHtt-Tg flies, which express mHtt N170-120Q under the control of the eye-specific expression GMR promoter (Hay et al., 1994Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Expression of baculovirus P35 prevents cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), manifest prominent cell death of photoreceptor neurons. We crossed mHtt-Tg flies with p53 mutant flies in which the p53 gene was deleted by homologous recombination (Rong et al., 2002Rong Y.S. Titen S.W. Xie H.B. Golic M.M. Bastiani M. Bandyopadhyay P.

Wild-type compound eyes contain ∼800 ommatidia, each of which includes seven photoreceptor cells in any given plane of section. The photoreceptor cells contain a microvillar structure referred to as the rhabdomere. Wild-type (wt) and p53 knockout flies (p53) display a normal composition of seven photoreceptor cells in each ommatidium (Figure 5). mHtt-Tg flies (Htt), however, manifest strong age-dependent loss of rhabdomeres and photoreceptor cells, as reported previously (Jackson et al."

https://openalex.org/W2149368193,"Ubiquitination controls a broad range of cellular functions. The last step of the ubiquitination pathway is regulated by enzyme type 3 (E3) ubiquitin ligases. E3 enzymes are responsible for substrate specificity and catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between a lysine residue of the substrate (or the N terminus of the substrate) and ubiquitin. MIR1 and MIR2 are two E3 ubiquitin ligases encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus that mediate the ubiquitination of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules and subsequent internalization. Here, we found that MIR1, but not MIR2, promoted down-regulation of MHC I molecules lacking lysine residues in their intracytoplasmic domain. In the presence of MIR1, these MHC I molecules were ubiquitinated, and their association with ubiquitin was sensitive to beta2-mercaptoethanol, unlike lysine-ubiquitin bonds. This form of ubiquitination required a cysteine residue in the intracytoplasmic tail of MHC I molecules. An MHC I molecule containing a single cysteine residue in an artificial glycine and alanine intracytoplasmic domain was endocytosed and degraded in the presence of MIR1. Thus, ubiquitination can occur on proteins lacking accessible lysines or an accessible N terminus."

A recent study reported that edge responses of neurons in area V2 are selective for side-of-figure, suggesting that figure-ground organization is encoded in the contour signals (border ownership coding). Here, we show that area V2 combines two strategies of computation, one that exploits binocular stereoscopic information for the definition of local depth order, and another that exploits the global configuration of contours (Gestalt factors). These are combined in single neurons so that the “near” side of the preferred 3D edge generally coincides with the preferred side-of-figure in 2D displays. Thus, area V2 represents the borders of 2D figures as edges of surfaces, as if the figures were objects in 3D space. Even in 3D displays, Gestalt factors influence the responses and can enhance or null the stereoscopic depth information."

We show here that this entrainment mechanism is inhibited by serotonin, acting through the Drosophila serotonin receptor 1B (d5-HT1B). d5-HT1B is expressed in clock neurons, and alterations of its levels affect molecular and behavioral responses of the clock to light. Effects of d5-HT1B are synergistic with a mutation in the circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) and are mediated by SHAGGY (SGG), Drosophila glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which phosphorylates TIM.

These data identify a molecular connection between serotonin signaling and the central clock component TIM and suggest a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of circadian photosensitivity in Drosophila. The circadian clock in Drosophila consists of interlocked, molecular feedback loops that drive circadian oscillations of gene and protein expression (Williams and Sehgal, 2001Williams J.A. Sehgal A. Molecular components of the circadian system in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 729-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the major loop, the period (PER) and timeless (TIM) proteins negatively regulate synthesis of their own mRNAs in a rhythmic fashion, resulting in cycling mRNA and protein levels. The cycling of clock proteins also depends upon tightly controlled turnover, which is regulated by the action of several kinases and phosphatases, including casein kinase I and II, protein phosphatase 2A, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Akten et al., 2003Akten B.

Entrainment of the clock to light is mediated, in part, by the light-induced degradation of TIM in response to photic signals transmitted by the circadian photoreceptor CRY (Williams and Sehgal, 2001Williams J.A.

In addition to CRY, the visual system can entrain the clock, but the mechanisms involved are not known (Helfrich-Forster et al., 2001Helfrich-Forster C. Winter C. Hofbauer A. Hall J.C. Stanewsky R.

It is clear though that entrainment of the clock is complex and can occur through multiple pathways. Moreover, given that the response of the clock to light is different at different times of day and can also vary based upon environmental conditions, it is likely to be modulated by other systems (Hall, 2000Hall J.C.

Effects of prolonged exposure to darkness on circadian photic responsiveness in the mouse.Chronobiol. Int. 2003; 20: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In mammals, one such system is that of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]). Serotonin has an important role in the modulation of various physiological functions and complex behaviors such as locomotion, learning and memory, feeding, addiction, and aggression (Buhot et al., 2000Buhot M.C. Martin S. Segu L. Role of serotonin in memory impairment.Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Gaspar et al., 2003Gaspar P. Cases O. Maroteaux L. The developmental role of serotonin: news from mouse molecular genetics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). With respect to the mammalian circadian system, it is implicated in entrainment, particularly in mediating nonphotic phase shifts, and sleep (Glass et al., 2003Glass J.D. Grossman G.H. Farnbauch L. DiNardo L. Midbrain raphe modulation of nonphotic circadian clock resetting and 5-HT release in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus.J.

Med. 1999; 31: 12-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for serotonin in circadian modulation, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian oscillator in mammals, receives photic input through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), as well as dense serotonergic innervation (Pickard and Rea, 1997Pickard G.E. Rea M.A. Serotonergic innervation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and photic regulation of circadian rhythms.Biol. Cell. 1997; 89: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among others, the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor, the major autoreceptor that regulates the release of serotonin from the dorsal raphe, is associated with the regulation of circadian behavior and sleep (Boutrel et al., 2002Boutrel B. Monaca C. Hen R. Hamon M. Adrien J. Involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in homeostatic and stress-induced adaptive regulations of paradoxical sleep: studies in 5-HT1A knock-out mice.J.

However, despite studies implicating serotonin signaling in the circadian system, its clear role and mechanism of action remain elusive (Morin, 1999Morin L.P. Serotonin and the regulation of mammalian circadian rhythmicity.Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 12-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In insects, serotonin is implicated in visual system function and, to a limited extent, in circadian rhythms (Cymborowski, 1998Cymborowski B.

Serotonin sets the day state in the neurons that control coupling between the optic lobe circadian pacemakers in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus.J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 1305-1314PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about serotonin signaling in Drosophila, the insect most used for molecular analysis of circadian rhythms. In this report, we assayed the effects of serotonin on Drosophila circadian rhythms using pharmacological, genetic, and molecular approaches. We focused on one subtype of Drosophila serotonin receptors, d5-HT1B, an ortholog of the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor. d5-HT1B is expressed in the clock network and affects circadian light sensitivity by decreasing the activity of GSK3β, which, in turn, produces increased stability of TIM. Our data indicate that serotonin affects the posttranslational control of clock proteins and establish a physiological role for it in regulating Drosophila circadian photosensitivity. In mammals, serotonergic agents induce phase shifts in the behavioral rhythm similar to those produced by nonphotic stimuli such as locomotor activity (Glass et al., 2003Glass J.D. Grossman G.H. Farnbauch L. DiNardo L. Midbrain raphe modulation of nonphotic circadian clock resetting and 5-HT release in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7451-7460PubMed Google Scholar). To address a role for serotonin in entrainment in Drosophila, we first subjected adult flies to acute treatment (10 min) with serotonin at different circadian times in constant darkness (DD). Under these conditions, we saw no evidence for a significant phase shift produced by serotonin treatment (data not shown). Extended treatment (24 hr) with agents that increase the level of extracellular serotonin, such as the synthesis precursor 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) and the reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac), did not produce phase shifts either. However, these treatments had an effect on light-induced phase shifts. Circadian photosensitivity in wild-type flies was measured as the magnitude of the phase shift induced by a short light pulse in the late night. Flies were first entrained to a 12:12 light:dark (LD) cycle, then transferred to DD and pulsed on the first day of DD at circadian time (CT) 20, which is 8 hr into the subjective dark period. The shift in phase was determined by comparing daily activity offsets in pulsed flies and unpulsed controls prior to and after the light pulse. We used light pulses of two different light intensities. As demonstrated by previous studies (Suri et al., 1998Suri V. Qian Z. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Evidence that the TIM light response is relevant to light-induced phase shifts in Drosophila melanogaster.Neuron. 1998; 21: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1998Yang Z.

Response of the timeless protein to light correlates with behavioral entrainment and suggests a nonvisual pathway for circadian photoreception.Neuron. 1998; 21: 215-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the magnitude of the phase shift depends upon the dose of the light pulse, and so a larger shift was observed with the more intense pulse. 5-HTP, Prozac, and another reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, reduced light-induced phase shifts significantly, particularly in response to the high intensity light pulse (Figure 1A ), suggesting that increased serotonin levels lead to decreased light responses in flies. To identify possible sites of interaction between the serotonin and circadian systems in Drosophila, we determined their relative distribution in the fly brain. Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a marker for the ventral lateral neurons (LNvs), which are a major component of the Drosophila central clock (Renn et al., 1999Renn S.C. Park J.H. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Taghert P.H. A pdf neuropeptide gene mutation and ablation of PDF neurons each cause severe abnormalities of behavioral circadian rhythms in Drosophila.Cell. 1999; 99: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Adult fly brains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the Pdf promoter were stained with an anti-serotonin antibody. As previous described (Lundell and Hirsh, 1994Lundell M.J.

Comp. Neurol. 1988; 268: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), cell bodies and projections of serotonergic neurons were observed in distinct areas of the brain. These include a cluster located in the posterior lateral subesophageal ganglion, which will henceforth be called SE5HT-IR. Serotonergic neurons were also observed close to the cell bodies of the LNvs (Figure 1B). Using an mCD8::GFP reporter, we also found that large and small LNvs (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) receive projections from Dopa Decarboxylase (Ddc)-expressing cells (data not shown). Although Ddc is expressed in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, in general these observations are consistent with the reported close spatial association of serotonergic systems and clock cells in other organisms (Meinertzhagen and Pyza, 1999Meinertzhagen I.A.

The role of the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor in many animal behaviors, including aggression and sleep, was demonstrated through pharmacological treatments and knockout mouse models (Boutrel et al., 2002Boutrel B. Monaca C. Hen R. Hamon M. Adrien J. Involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in homeostatic and stress-induced adaptive regulations of paradoxical sleep: studies in 5-HT1A knock-out mice.J.

However, the involvement of this receptor in circadian regulation is supported only by pharmacological studies and thus is still uncertain (Smart and Biello, 2001Smart C.M. Biello S.M. WAY-100635, a specific 5-HT1A antagonist, can increase the responsiveness of the mammalian circadian pacemaker to photic stimuli.Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 305: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Of the four serotonin receptors identified in the Drosophila genome, the closest ortholog of the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor is the Drosophila serotonin receptor subtype 1B (d5-HT1B), with 43% sequence similarity between the two receptors (Saudou et al., 1992Saudou F. Boschert U. Amlaiky N. Plassat J.L. Hen R. A family of Drosophila serotonin receptors with distinct intracellular signalling properties and expression patterns.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible role of this receptor subtype in circadian rhythms, we first assayed the properties of d5-HT1B in an S2 cell culture system. In response to serotonin and to 8-OH-DPAT, a mammalian 5-HT1A receptor specific agonist, the d5-HT1B receptor was internalized in intracellular vesicles and activated downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Thus, this receptor shares molecular and pharmacological properties with its mammalian counterpart (Albert and Tiberi, 2001Albert P.R. Tiberi M. Receptor signaling and structure: insights from serotonin-1 receptors.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 453-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There is virtually no information about the expression pattern or the role of d5-HT1B in adult flies. We initiated our analysis of this receptor by determining its spatial expression pattern. We generated transgenic flies containing a genomic fragment of the d5-HT1B upstream region fused to GAL4. The d5-HT1B-GAL4 driver was crossed to UAS-GFP transgenic flies, and the expression pattern of the d5-HT1B promoter was then visualized through fluorescence microscopy. The expression of d5-HT1B is initiated in the late embryonic stage and continues through all developmental stages, with abundant expression in both larval and adult central nervous systems. In the adult fly brain, d5-HT1B expression was observed in the mushroom body, the pars intercerebralis (PI) neurons, a subgroup of dorsal neurons, the LNvs, the optic lobes, and SE5HT-IR neurons (Figure 2A ). To avoid transactivation caused by insertion sites of the Gal4 driver, multiple transgenic lines carrying independent insertions of the Gal4 driver on different chromosomes were tested, and similar patterns of GFP expression were observed (data not shown). To determine the relationship of d5-HT1B-expressing neurons to serotonergic neurons and clock neurons, d5-HT1B-Gal4/UAS-GFP fly brains were costained for serotonin and PDF expression. The colocalization of d5-HT1B and PDF in larval (data not shown), as well as adult fly brains (Figure 2B), indicates that the receptor is expressed in LNvs at both stages; in adults it is expressed in large and small LNvs. There was no significant overlap of d5-HT1B and serotonin expression in the midbrain and the optic lobes (data not shown). However, the expression of d5-HT1B in the SE5HT-IR neurons suggests that it might function as an autoreceptor in these cells (Figure 2C). To study the expression pattern of the d5-HT1B protein, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the third intracellular loop of the receptor. The antibody reacts specifically with a protein of molecular weight ∼70 kDa (which matches the predicted size of the d5-HT1B protein) in fly head extracts. No such signal was observed with either preimmune serum from the immunized animal or with antiserum preabsorbed with purified d5-HT1B protein (data not shown). In adult brain whole mounts, immunostaining using this antibody generated signals in the mushroom bodies, LNvs, dorsal neurons, PI neurons, and optic lobes (Figure 2D). As noted above, the same structures were labeled in the d5-HT1B-Gal4/UAS-GFP flies, indicating good agreement between the two methods used to visualize receptor expression. The stronger signals obtained with the antibody in the large LNvs (Figure 2E) and the PI neurons, and the relatively weaker signals in the small LNvs and the mushroom bodies, may be indicative of altered receptor stability in these cells. Sections of adult heads did not indicate any expression of d5-HT1B in the eye (data not shown). To test possible circadian regulation of the d5-HT1B receptor, we determined the temporal expression pattern of the d5-HT1B transcript and protein using RNase protection assays and Western blots, respectively. There was no significant circadian variation in RNA or protein levels of d5-HT1B in the presence of LD cycles or in DD (Figure S2A). However, receptor levels were affected in clock mutants. Levels were upregulated in timeless (tim01) flies and downregulated in cycle (cyc0) flies (Figure S2B), suggesting possible effects of the circadian system on d5-HT1B protein levels. d5-HT1B is expressed in clock cells, where it could mediate the effects of serotonin on the circadian system. We investigated a possible association of d5-HT1B with the inhibitory effect of serotonin on circadian light responses by genetically modifying levels of d5-HT1B. To increase levels of d5-HT1B, we generated transgenic flies carrying a UAS-d5-HT1B construct and used different Gal4 driver lines to drive its expression. The drivers included tim-Gal4, which gives high-level expression in neurons associated with circadian function, such as the lateral neurons; GMR-Gal4, which has an eye-specific expression pattern; elav-Gal4, which is expressed panneuronally; and d5-HT1B-Gal4, which targets overexpression to cells that normally express d5-HT1B. Increased d5-HT1B protein levels in the overexpression flies were confirmed by Western blots (Figure S3A). The rest-activity rhythms of d5-HT1B-overexpressing flies in LD cycles and in DD were similar to those of wild-type flies (Table 1). We also tested the effects of overexpressing d5-HT1B on the cycling of the period (per) clock gene in DD, using a per-luciferase reporter (BG-LUC) construct (Stanewsky et al., 1997Stanewsky R. Frisch B. Brandes C. Hamblen-Coyle M.J. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of transgenes containing increasing amounts of the Drosophila clock gene period and a lacZ reporter: mapping elements of the PER protein involved in circadian cycling.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 676-696PubMed Google Scholar). Both the cycling and the overall levels of BG-LUC were comparable to those of control flies (data not shown), confirming that overexpressing d5-HT1B does not affect clock function in free-running conditions. To assay the circadian photosensitivity of these flies, we used the behavioral phase shift assay described above. We found that expressing d5-HT1B in clock neurons, using the tim-Gal4 driver, significantly reduced the magnitude of the phase shift induced by a short light pulse in the late (CT20) as well as in the early subjective night (CT15) (Figure 3A ). Expressing d5-HT1B with a single copy of either elav-Gal4 or d5-HT1B-Gal4 also reduced phase shifts, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). The weaker effect of these drivers is most likely because they do not drive expression of the receptor in clock cells to the levels obtained with tim-Gal4. In support of this idea, flies carrying two copies of each of the UAS-1B and d5-HT1B-Gal4 transgenes showed reduced phase shifts, similar to those produced when expression of d5-HT1B was driven by tim-Gal4 (Figure 3A). Expression of d5-HT1B by GMR-Gal4 had no such effect (data not shown), suggesting that central clock neurons, instead of photoreceptors cells in the eye, are the relevant target cells of this inhibitory effect.Table 1Behavioral Phenotype of Flies with Modified d5-HT1B LevelsGenotypeEnvironmental ConditionsNo.Percent RhythmicPeriod Length (Hour ± SEM)FFT Relative Power ± SEMOverexpressiontim-Gal4/UAS-1BDD3196.824.25 ± 0.130.149 ± 0.016UAS-1BDD3110023.32 ± 0.070.212 ± 0.020tim-Gal4DD1510024.07 ± 0.100.121 ± 0.010UAS-1B, UAS-SGG10DD4591.123.62 ± 0.040.123 ± 0.010tim-Gal4/UAS-SGG10DD4187.818.01 ± 0.050.079 ± 0.004tim-Gal4/UAS-1B, UAS-SGG10DD2195.219.85 ± 0.130.058 ± 0.003UAS-1B, UAS-SGG10 (A81T)DD2195.223.38 ± 0.070.085 ± 0.010tim-Gal4/UAS-SGG10 (A81T)DD259223.05 ± 0.060.080 ± 0.006tim-Gal4/UAS-1B, UAS-SGG10 (A81T)DD258823.30 ± 0.090.068 ± 0.006tim-Gal4/UAS-1BLL (2500 lux)4121.926.0 ± 1.200.109 ± 0.018tim-Gal4/UAS-1BLL (250 lux)3345.526.97 ± 0.740.123 ± 0.016UAS-1BLL (2500 lux)250——UAS-1BLL (250 lux)3013.330 ± 00.071 ± 0.017tim-Gal4LL (2500 lux)160——Knockdownelav-Gal4/UAS-1BRNAiLL (<10 lux)1610024.75 ± 0.1440.188 ± 0.010elav-Gal4LL (<10 lux)1610024.16 ± 0.1600.228 ± 0.025UAS-1BRNAiLL (<10 lux)1492.924.19 ± 0.0830.085 ± 0.010elav-Gal4/UAS-1BRNAiDD3110023.64 ± 0.0390.176 ± 0.031elav-Gal4DD2110023.44 ± 0.0980.156 ± 0.019UAS-1BRNAiDD1410023.85 ± 0.0260.151 ± 0.0101B-Gal4/UAS-1BRNAiLL (<10 lux)3293.824.78 ± 0.1700.110 ± 0.0101B-Gal4LL (<10 lux)3210024.09 ± 0.0700.164 ± 0.014UAS-1BRNAiLL (<10 lux)3093.823.73 ± 0.0400.080 ± 0.0101B-Gal4/UAS-1BRNAiDD1693.823.42 ± 0.0460.122 ± 0.0101B-Gal4DD1610023.38 ± 0.0560.140 ± 0.012UAS-1BRNAiDD1593.323.49 ± 0.1600.079 ± 0.010 Open table in a new tab Light-induced behavioral phase shifts in Drosophila are associated with the degradation of the clock protein TIM in LNvs (Suri et al., 1998Suri V.

Response of the timeless protein to light correlates with behavioral entrainment and suggests a nonvisual pathway for circadian photoreception.Neuron. 1998; 21: 215-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine if this molecular response was affected in flies overexpressing d5-HT1B, we exposed entrained flies to a light pulse at ZT20 and collected them 1 hr later. Through immunostaining of whole-mount fly brains, light-induced TIM degradation in LNvs was measured and quantified. TIM levels after a light pulse were significantly higher in flies expressing d5-HT1B under control of either tim-Gal4 or d5-HT1B-Gal4, as compared to the controls (Figures 3B and 3C). The effects were more evident in the small LNvs as compared to the large LNvs (see Discussion). Thus, behavioral and molecular experiments indicate that flies expressing high levels of the d5-HT1B receptor have reduced circadian light responses, similar to flies treated with serotonergic agents. To further investigate the role of d5-HT1B in circadian photosensitivity, particularly in the inhibitory effect of serotonin, we knocked down d5-HT1B expression through RNA interference using a UAS-d5-HT1B RNAi transgene. The RNAi construct was expressed using the d5-HT1B-GAL4 driver; this reduced levels of endogenous d5-HT1B by >70% and decreased levels of overexpressed d5-HT1B (Figure 4A ). To test the effects of reduced d5-HT1B levels on circadian light sensitivity, we exposed these flies to light pulses of different intensities. d5-HT1B knockdown flies showed significantly increased phase shifts as compared to control flies (Figure 4B). To determine if d5-HT1B is required for the inhibitory effects of serotonin on photosensitivity, we treated the knockdown flies with 5-HTP and assayed light-induced phase shifts. As reported above for wild-type flies, the light response of control flies was inhibited by 5-HTP treatment. However, the same treatment did not have a significant effect on the d5-HT1B knockdown flies (Figure 4C). Thus, flies with reduced levels of d5-HT1B display enhanced light-induced phase shifts that are not inhibited by 5-HTP treatment. We also tested the specific role of clock cells in the effect of d5-HT1B knockdown by using a tim-gal4 driver. Flies in which d5-HT1B was knocked down with the tim-Gal4 driver showed significantly increased light-induced phase shifts at low light intensity as compared to control flies. In addition, 5-HTP treatment did not inhibit the light response of these flies (Figure S4). Thus, the effect of d5-HT1B knockdown does appear to be mediated, at least in part, by clock cells, although the tim-Gal4 driver had less of an effect than the d5-HT1B-Gal4 driver (see Discussion). We also measured photosensitivity of the knockdown flies by assaying them under constant dim light conditions (<10 lux), which typically produce long periods in wild-type flies (Konopka et al., 1989Konopka R.J. Pittendrigh C. Orr D. Reciprocal behaviour associated with altered homeostasis and photosensitivity of Drosophila clock mutants.J. Neurogenet. 1989; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4D, expression of the RNAi transgene specifically in cells that normally express d5-HT1B resulted in circadian periods significantly longer than those of controls (see also Table 1), suggesting increased circadian photosensitivity in flies with reduced d5-HT1B levels. Use of the elav-Gal4 driver produced similar results (Table 1). Together, these experiments indicate that d5-HT1B is part of a mechanism for modulating circadian photosensitivity and that it mediates inhibitory effects of serotonin on Drosophila circadian light responses."

During central nervous system (CNS) development, regional fate determination must be coupled to the morphogenetic processes that shape the various structures of the brain. The highly specialized vertebrate eye is one of the organs in which the integration of fate determination and morphogenesis is most evident. The optic vesicles are formed as evaginations of the forebrain, but prior to this, the group of cells that will give rise to the eyes exists as a single bilateral domain called the eye field. The eye field is readily detectable within the anterior neural plate (ANP) by the overlapping expression of a number of transcription factors known as the eye specification network of genes (reviewed in Chuang and Raymond, 2002Chuang J.C. Raymond P.A. Embryonic origin of the eyes in teleost fish.Bioessays. 2002; 24: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). During gastrulation, the ANP becomes subdivided into domains that will generate telencephalic, eye field, diencephalic, and hypothalamic fates. The signaling pathways responsible for this regional patterning are beginning to be unraveled (reviewed in Wilson and Houart, 2004Wilson S.W. Houart C. Early steps in the development of the forebrain.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and one of the pathways that has received the most attention is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade (Logan and Nusse, 2004Logan C.Y. Nusse R. The Wnt signaling pathway in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (3969) Google Scholar). Activation of this signaling cascade is initiated by interaction of Wnt ligands with a receptor complex formed by Frizzled (Fz) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP). Downstream of the receptor, a protein complex containing glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) promotes phosphorylation and, consequently, proteasome-mediated degradation of β-catenin. Inactivation of the GSK3β/axin/β-catenin complex upon pathway activation leads to accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, where it interacts with transcription factors such as the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) or the T cell-specific transcription factor (TCF) to modulate transcription. Various other proteins modulate the activity of the pathway, including the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled that facilitates pathway activation upon ligand/receptor binding. Wnts can also activate alternative signaling cascades, including one branch that shares components with the planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) described in Drosophila (Veeman et al., 2003Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. A second canon. Functions and mechanisms of beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Noncanonical Wnt pathways are GSK3β/axin/APC- and β-catenin-independent, but share a function for Dsh with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Depending on the context, activation of β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling can involve intracellular calcium release, small GTPases of the Rho family, and activation of the JNK signaling cascade. All of these events ultimately affect the cytoskeletal architecture and the establishment of cell polarity and/or cell behavior. In vertebrates, noncanonical Wnt signaling has been most closely studied with respect to its role in modulating the convergence and extension (CE) movements of mesodermal cells that shape the embryo during gastrulation. The vertebrate genome encodes many Wnt ligands, which, in most cases, show preferential activation of either β-catenin-dependent or β-catenin-independent pathways (Veeman et al., 2003Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. A second canon. Functions and mechanisms of beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). It is unclear how the specificity of each ligand for one or other branch of the Wnt pathway is accomplished; it is also largely unclear whether different Wnts have specific Fz partners, and if so, whether this could confer specificity in their signaling activity. A widely favored model of early neural plate patterning postulates that a gradient of Wnt/β-catenin activity specifies different regional fates with high levels of signaling promoting more caudal neural identities (Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001Kiecker C. Niehrs C. A morphogen gradient of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates anteroposterior neural patterning in Xenopus.Development. 2001; 128: 4189-4201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Yamaguchi, 2001Yamaguchi T.P. Heads or tails: Wnts and anterior-posterior patterning.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R713-R724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This leads to establishment of more localized sources of Wnts and Wnt antagonists that subsequently refine regional patterning (Wilson and Houart, 2004Wilson S.W. Houart C. Early steps in the development of the forebrain.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Within the forebrain, evidence from studies in mice, chicks, and fish supports the idea that Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes caudal diencephalic identity and that raised levels of signaling can suppress more rostral forebrain fates. For instance, in zebrafish, establishment of telencephalic identity requires the suppression of high levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Houart et al., 2002Houart C. Caneparo L. Heisenberg C. Barth K. Take-Uchi M. Wilson S. Establishment of the telencephalon during gastrulation by local antagonism of Wnt signaling.Neuron. 2002; 35: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas establishment of diencephalic identity is promoted by high levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Heisenberg et al., 2001Heisenberg C.P.

However, overexpression of Fz receptors in both Xenopus (Rasmussen et al., 2001Rasmussen J.T. Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Rao M.S. Klein P.S. Vetter M.L. Regulation of eye development by frizzled signaling in Xenopus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 3861-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and in zebrafish (FC, FCB, MT, and SW; unpublished data and see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) can lead to induction of ectopic eyes. Therefore, although modulation of the Wnt pathway affects formation of the eyes, the mechanisms underlying this activity are still unclear. In this study, we explore the mechanisms by which Wnt signaling regulates early stages in eye field development. We find that two branches of the Wnt pathway have very different effects on eye formation. High levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling are required for the acquisition of caudal diencephalic fate and antagonize eye induction. In contrast, Wnt11 signaling within the eye field promotes eye formation, at least partially, by antagonizing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In addition, Wnt11 signaling promotes coherence of eye field cells, potentially contributing to the coordinated morphogenetic behaviors of cells in the nascent eye field. Each branch of the Wnt pathway appears to be activated by a different Wnt/Fz combination in the nascent forebrain. We propose that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated by Wnt8b and Fz8a, whereas noncanonical Wnt signaling is activated by Wnt11 and Fz5. These results allow us to present a simple model in which the integration of Wnt11, Fz5, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling coordinates fate determination and morphogenesis of the nascent eye field. During late gastrulation wnt1 and wnt10b (Lekven et al., 2003Lekven A.C. Buckles G.R. Kostakis N. Moon R.T. Wnt1 and wnt10b function redundantly at the zebrafish midbrain-hindbrain boundary.Dev.

Finally, wnt11 is expressed in a broad ANP domain (Heisenberg et al., 2000Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saude L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W.

The expression of all these wnts is first detected at 75%–80% epiboly (Heisenberg et al., 2000Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saude L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W.

To address whether these different Wnt ligands could affect eye formation, we localized overexpression within the eye field by transplanting wnt-expressing cells within the ANP at early to midgastrula stages, just before eye field specification takes place. Transplants of cells overexpressing wnt1 or wnt8b inhibit eye formation (Figure 1H), a result consistent with previous data (Houart et al., 2002Houart C. Caneparo L. Heisenberg C. Barth K.

In contrast, transplants of cells overexpressing wnt11 lead to the development of bigger misshapen eyes (Figure 1I). Wnt11 is thought to activate a signaling pathway related to the PCP pathway of flies (Heisenberg et al., 2000Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saude L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C.

We therefore hypothesized that the activation of different branches of the Wnt signaling pathway might account for the phenotypic differences resulting from overexpression of these proteins within the eye field. Cells overexpressing either wnt8b or wnt1 (wnt8b+/wnt1+) locally suppressed the expression of eye field markers in nearby ANP cells (rx3 and six3 [Seo et al., 1998Seo H.C. Drivenes O.

Dev. 1998; 73: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar]; Figures 2A′ and 2B′ ). This loss of eye field markers was accompanied by an expansion of posterior diencephalic markers (foxb1.2, Odenthal and Nusslein-Volhard, 1998Odenthal J. Nusslein-Volhard C. fork head domain genes in zebrafish.Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar; barH2, Figures 2C′ and 2D′). otx2, which is expressed throughout the forebrain- and midbrain-forming regions of the ANP (Li et al., 1994Li Y.

Dev. 1994; 48: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), was unaffected by the transplants (Figure 2E′), confirming that exogenous Wnt8b/Wnt1 affected regional patterning within the ANP, but not formation of this region of the CNS. Next, we asked if Wnt1 and Wnt8b were acting through the Wnt/β-catenin branch of the Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by different means leads to the same fate transformations, as with wnt8b+/wnt1+ transplants. mbl−/− mutants, which have disrupted function of Axin1 (Heisenberg et al., 2001Heisenberg C.P.

Exposing embryos to lithium chloride (LiCl) activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Hedgepeth et al., 1997Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S.

USA. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) and, when done at midgastrula stages prior to the induction of the eye field, leads to transformation of the eye field into diencephalon (Figures 2M and 2O). Treatment at later stages, when the eye field has already been specified, can reduce the size of this territory, but does not interfere with its specification (Figures 2L and 2N) (Kim et al., 2002Kim S.H. Shin J. Park H.C. Yeo S.Y. Hong S.K. Han S. Rhee M. Kim C.H. Chitnis A.B. Huh T.L. Specification of an anterior neuroectoderm patterning by Frizzled8a-mediated Wnt8b signaling during late gastrulation in zebrafish.Development. 2002; 129: 4443-4455PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results show that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes expression of diencephalic markers and suppresses expression of eye field markers. These results led us to predict that suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the diencephalon should lead to caudal expansion of the eye and suppression of diencephalic identity. Consistent with this idea, downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin activity in the posterior diencephalon suppressed diencephalic gene expression and expanded the eye field. Thus, overexpression of either axin1 or a dominant negative form of Wnt8 (dnwnt8; Hoppler et al., 1996Hoppler S. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Expression of a dominant-negative Wnt blocks induction of MyoD in Xenopus embryos.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2805-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) in the diencephalon induced rx3 and suppressed expression of diencephalic marker genes (Figures 2P–2W). In some dnwnt8+ transplants, diencephalic and midbrain markers shifted caudally, consistent with an overall caudalization of the anterior neural plate (Figures 2U and 2V, arrow). In contrast to wnt8b+/wnt1+ cells, transplants of wnt11+ cells led to the development of bigger eyes (Figure 1I) and, at tailbud, they distorted and expanded rx3 and six3 domains laterally or posteriorly, depending on the position of the transplant (Figures 3A and 3B and data not shown). The caudal expansion of eye field markers was not obviously accompanied by suppression of other anterior neural fates, since the prospective telencephalic, diencephalic, and midbrain markers emx1, foxb1.2, and pax2.1 were still expressed, albeit with distorted expression domains that accommodated the deformed eye fields (Figures 3C and 3D and data not shown). These results are consistent with a role for Wnt11 in modulating morphogenetic cell movements, analogous to the role documented for this protein in the regulation of CE movements of mesendodermal cells that contribute to shaping the embryo during gastrulation (Heisenberg et al., 2000Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saude L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W. Silberblick/Wnt11 mediates convergent extension movements during zebrafish gastrulation.Nature. 2000; 405: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, Tada and Smith, 2000Tada M. Smith J.C. Xwnt11 is a target of Xenopus Brachyury: regulation of gastrulation movements via Dishevelled, but not through the canonical Wnt pathway.Development. 2000; 127: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Wnt11 to disrupt morphogenesis in the eye field could be due to Wnt11 acting either directly on neural plate cells or indirectly through its ability to disrupt mesodermal cell movements that subsequently affect overlying neural tissues (Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard, 1997Heisenberg C.P. Nusslein-Volhard C. The function of silberblick in the positioning of the eye anlage in the zebrafish embryo.Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether Wnt11 can directly affect neural plate cells, we assessed whether it could disrupt eye field morphogenesis in the absence of underlying mesendoderm. Mutants lacking both maternal and zygotic activity of the nodal pathway protein Oep (MZoep mutants) lack all mesendoderm in anterior regions (Gritsman et al., 1999Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. The EGF-CFC protein one-eyed pinhead is essential for nodal signaling.Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). MZoep cells expressing Wnt11 transplanted into MZoep mutants still induced distortion and expansion of the eye field (Figure 3E), indicating that Wnt11 can elicit these phenotypes in the absence of mesendodermal signals. These experiments revealed an ability of Wnt11 to influence the shape of gene expression domains in the ANP, most likely by affecting the movements of eye field cells. Indeed, cell movement defects were evident when comparing the distribution of the transplanted wnt11+ and wild-type cells in the host neural plate: wild-type donor cells interspersed widely with host wild-type cells (e.g., Figure 2F), whereas wnt11+ cells usually remained more coherent and tightly clustered (e.g., Figure 3C). To begin to address the events that lead to these different cell distributions, we performed time lapse analysis on transplants of wild-type and wnt11+ cells. In the first few minutes following transplantation, both wild-type and wnt11+ cells integrated into the host neural plate and interspersed with wild-type host cells (Movies S1 and S2and data not shown). However, subsequent to this, wild-type and wnt11+ cells showed different behaviors. Wild-type cells (or cells expressing dnwnt8, Movie S3) showed variable trajectories with respect to the position of transplantation: some moved toward the center of the transplant; some moved away; and some moved parallel to it (Figures 4A and 4C : paths 1–3, paths 4–7, and paths 8–9, respectively). This is consistent with the cells responding to directional movement cues originated in the host tissue that are independent of the transplant. In contrast, wnt11+ cells were less influenced by gastrulation movements in the host tissue; they moved coherently such that, over time, they tended to converge toward the center of the transplant, thus conferring the well-circumscribed shape to the cluster of transplanted cells by the end of gastrulation (Figures 4B and 4D). To quantitate the behaviors of wild-type and wnt11+ cells, we analyzed cell trajectories of approximately 25 to 30 cells from several representative wild-type and wnt11+ transplants and compared individual cell movements relative to the central position of the transplant. We represented the paths of the cells on a graph with the origin of each cell movement at x0:y0 and the center of the transplant being a fixed reference at x0:y1 (see Experimental Procedures). The paths of wild-type cells (Figure 4E) distributed in all quadrants of the graph, suggesting no common directionality in their movement relative to the center of the transplant. In contrast, the paths of wnt11+ cells were not independent of the position of the transplantation, with most cell paths falling within the two quadrants directed toward the center of the transplant (Figure 4F). Indeed, the distance of the wnt11+ cells to the center of the transplant considerably decreased over time (Figure 4H), which was not observed for wild-type cells (Figure 4G; the trajectories of wild-type versus wnt11+ cells over time with respect to the center of the transplant differs significantly, p = 0.0016). In summary, these results indicate that a source of Wnt11 is able to influence the movement of cells in its vicinity and suggest a direct requirement for Wnt11 in the regulation of morphogenetic movements in the ANP. In gain-of-function experiments, Wnt11 disrupts formation of the eye field; so we next assessed whether embryos with compromised Wnt11 signaling showed an eye field phenotype. silberblick (slb−/−) embryos lack Wnt11 activity (Heisenberg et al., 2000Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saude L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W. Silberblick/Wnt11 mediates convergent extension movements during zebrafish gastrulation.Nature. 2000; 405: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and exhibit partial fusion of the eyes, a phenotype thought to be due to defective signaling from the underlying axial mesendoderm (Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard, 1997Heisenberg C.P.

Functional interactions of genes mediating convergent extension, knypek and trilobite, during the partitioning of the eye primordium in zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 382-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, early stages in eye field formation have not previously been analyzed in slb−/− embryos. The eye field in slb−/− mutants is smaller compared to that in wild-type embryos (Figures 5B and 5E ). ANP cell movements are probably affected in slb−/− mutants (Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard, 1997Heisenberg C.P. Nusslein-Volhard C. The function of silberblick in the positioning of the eye anlage in the zebrafish embryo.Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and this may be contributing to the eye field phenotype. However, the defects in the eye field are more pronounced than in other regions of the ANP, since other ANP regional markers that were analyzed showed only very mild alterations (Figures 5B, 5C, 5E, and 5F, and Figure S2). These results suggest that the eye phenotype in slb−/− may result from a combination of defects in ANP morphogenesis and a local requirement for Wnt11 in the eye field. A specific role"

Comparison of the experimental spectrum at ∼110 kelvin to finite-temperature infrared spectra, calculated by ab initio molecular dynamics, supports fluxionality of bare CH 5 + under experimental conditions and provides a dynamical mechanism for exchange of hydrogens between CH 3 tripod positions and the three-center bonded H 2 moiety, which eventually leads to full hydrogen scrambling.

Whereas ACPC and ACBC partially activate the NMDA receptor by 80% and 42%, respectively, their cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand binding core show the same degree of domain closure as found in the complex with glycine, a full agonist, illustrating that the NR1 subunit provides a new paradigm for partial agonist action that is distinct from that of the evolutionarily related GluR2, AMPA-sensitive receptor. Cycloleucine behaves as an antagonist and stabilizes an open-cleft conformation.

Present in most cells throughout the kingdom of life, ligand-gated ion channels participate in a vast number of signaling pathways. Ligand-gated ion channels possess separate ligand binding and ion channel domains, and agonist interaction with the ligand binding domain generates conformational changes that propagate to the ion channel, opening a conductive transmembrane pore. There is little understanding at the level of atomic detail of the conformational states occupied by ligand-gated ion channels upon the binding of full and partial agonists. Furthermore, because partial agonists elicit submaximal activation of the ion channel, they are useful molecules with which to probe relationships between agonist binding, conformational changes, and ion channel activation. As suggested from studies by del Castillo and Katz (del Castillo and Katz, 1957del Castillo J. Katz B. Interaction at end-plate receptors betwen different choline derivatives.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1957; 146: 369-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a partial agonist in ligand-gated ion channels is a ligand that produces an open channel probability of less than 1 upon occupancy of all binding sites. Over the intervening years, and in the absence of atomic resolution structures, numerous models have been put forth to explain the phenomenon of partial agonism. One common model is rooted in the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for allosteric proteins (Monod et al., 1965Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. On the nature of allosteric transitions: A plausible model.J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). In this model, the ligand-gated ion channel occupies two states—a closed or inactive T state and an open state or active R state—full agonists are maximally effective, or efficacious, at shifting the equilibrium to the open state, while partial agonists are less effective (Li et al., 1997Li J. Zagotta W.N. Lester H.A. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels: structural basis of ligand efficacy and allosteric modulation.Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 177-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). While this model is appealing in its simplicity, in one ligand-gated ion channel, the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 receptor, partial agonists induce a spectrum of conformational states in the agonist binding portion of the receptor channel (Mayer and Armstrong, 2004Mayer M.L. Armstrong N. Structure and function of glutamate receptor ion channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 161-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To elaborate our understanding of partial agonist action in another class of ionotropic glutamate receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subfamily, we embarked on ligand binding, crystallographic, and electrophysiological studies using a series of compounds that differ by a single methylene (-CH2-) group. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that participate in fast excitatory synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal development (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding agonist, iGluRs open a cation-selective ion channel, allowing Na+, K+, and/or Ca2+ ions to flow down their electrochemical gradients (Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). The protein domain responsible for agonist binding, the S1S2 ligand binding core, was first identified in an AMPA receptor (Kuusinen et al., 1995Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. Molecular dissection of the agonist binding site of an AMPA receptor.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Structural and other biophysical studies of the GluR2 ligand binding core have resulted in two main conclusions. First, agonist binding induces a “domain closure” of the ligand binding core around the agonist, with the extent of domain closure correlated with the extent to which the agonist activates the ion channel, i.e., complete domain closure leads to full activation, and incomplete domain closure results in partial activation (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N.

For this mutant, we see partially closed and fully closed conformations of the ligand binding core, even though AMPA behaves like a partial agonist (Armstrong et al., 2003Armstrong N. Mayer M.L.

USA. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Second, the ligand binding cores are arranged as dimers in a “back-to-back” fashion, with the dimer interface playing an important role in receptor desensitization (Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.

NMDA receptors are related to AMPA receptors in amino acid sequence and biological function but are obligatory heteromeric receptors composed of NR1 and NR2 and/or NR3 subunits (Chatterton et al., 2002Chatterton J.E.

Moreover, AMPA and NMDA receptors have different requirements for activation, i.e., the binding of both glycine and glutamate are required for NMDA receptor activation (Johnson and Ascher, 1987Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Glycine potentiates the NMDA response in cultured mouse brain neurons.Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar), NMDA receptors have at most two subconductance states, and in NMDA receptors there is a negative allosteric coupling between the glycine (NR1) and glutamate (NR2) sites (for a recent review, see Erreger et al., 2004Erreger K.

Therefore, we set out to determine whether the GluR2 paradigm of partial agonist action applies to NMDA receptors, first focusing on the NR1, glycine binding subunit. Previously, we showed that the NR1 ligand binding core has a structure similar to that of GluR2 (Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003Furukawa H. Gouaux E. Mechanisms of activation, inhibition, and specificity in NMDA receptors revealed by cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand-binding core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, on the basis of the first series of structures, we found that the partial agonist D-cycloserine yielded a domain closure that was similar to that of glycine, a result that we would not have predicted from the AMPA receptor paradigm. Because this single observation suggested that NMDA and AMPA receptors might conform to different models of partial agonist action, we investigated the structural and functional behavior of the NMDA receptor in the presence of a series of partial agonists. Three cyclic homologs of glycine—1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACPC), 1-aminocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (ACBC), and 1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (cycloleucine)—bind to the NR1, glycine site of the NMDA receptor (Hood et al., 1989Hood W.F.

These compounds have carbocyclic rings of three, four, and five atoms, respectively (Figure 1). ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine, however, have dramatically different affinities for the NR1 ligand binding core, and while the first two are partial agonists, cycloleucine is an antagonist. To probe the mechanism of partial agonism in NMDA receptors, we solved the structures of the NR1 ligand binding core in complexes with ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine. In addition, we measured the binding of the ligands to the soluble NR1 ligand binding core and carried out electrophysiological recordings on wild-type and NR1 mutants to measure the extent of ion channel activation and to test the significance of specific receptor-ligand interactions. NR1 S1S2 is the water-soluble, ligand binding core of the glycine binding NR1 subunit and is composed of polypeptide segments S1 and S2 (Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003Furukawa H. Gouaux E. Mechanisms of activation, inhibition, and specificity in NMDA receptors revealed by cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand-binding core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine are amino acid derivatives with three-, four-, and five-membered carbocyclic rings (Figure 1A). To determine the relative affinities of these compounds at the glycine site of the NR1 receptor, we carried out radioligand displacement experiments using the competitive antagonist [3H]-MDL105,519 (Baron et al., 1996Baron B.M. Siegel B.W. Harrison B.L. Gross R.S. Hawes C. Towers P. [3H]MDL 105,519, a high-affinity radioligand for the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-associated glycine recognition site.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar), the results of which are illustrated in Figure 1B. On the basis of the displacement experiments, the Ki values for ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine are 4.80 ± 0.62 μM, 0.831 ± 0.055 mM, and 15.3 ± 2.49 mM, respectively. As a comparison, the Ki value of glycine is 26.4 μM (Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003Furukawa H. Gouaux E. Mechanisms of activation, inhibition, and specificity in NMDA receptors revealed by cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand-binding core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), indicating that ACPC binds with a 5.5-fold higher affinity than glycine, and ACBC and cycloleucine bind much more weakly than glycine, with 31-fold and 580-fold lower affinities, respectively. The Ki value, therefore, reflects the subtle differences between ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine. Indeed, the molecular volumes increase by only ∼11 Å3 with the addition of each methylene group. To determine the efficacy of ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine on NMDA receptor activation, we carried out the two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) experiments using NR1/NR2B subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Shown in Figure 2 are records and graphical summaries of the TEVC experiments. Here we assume that glycine is a full agonist and produces maximal receptor activation. ACPC and ACBC dose-dependently activate the NR1/NR2B NMDA receptor and yield maximal current amplitudes, relative to glycine, of 80.1% ± 7.0% and 41.6% ± 0.5%, respectively (Figures 2A and 2B). The potencies of ACPC and ACBC for receptor activation parallel their behavior in the binding experiments with ACPC and ACBC having EC50 values that are 2.1-fold lower and 42-fold higher than the EC50 value for glycine, respectively. Cycloleucine, by contrast, is a competitive antagonist and does not activate the NMDA receptor at concentrations up to 50 mM. Because ACPC is a weak antagonist at the NR2 subunit glutamate binding site (Nahum-Levy et al., 1999Nahum-Levy R. Fossom L.H. Skolnick P. Benveniste M. Putative partial agonist 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid acts concurrently as a glycine-site agonist and a glutamate-site antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1207-1218PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to show that the apparent partial agonist behavior of ACPC was not simply due to its antagonist-like action at the NR2B glutamate site. Therefore, we carried out experiments using an ACPC concentration at the “top” of the ACPC dose-response curve and either 0.1 mM or 1.0 mM glutamate. We found that increasing the glutamate concentration from 0.1 mM to 1.0 mM did not substantially alter the maximal current evoked by saturating concentrations of ACBC (Figure 2C), thereby indicating that the partial agonist activity of ACPC was not simply due to competitive antagonist action at the NR2B site. In agreement with the previous studies, our experiments showed that ACPC and ACBC are partial agonists and cycloleucine is a competitive antagonist at NR1/NR2B NMDA receptors (Watson and Lanthorn, 1990Watson G.B. Lanthorn T.H. Pharmacological characteristics of cyclic homologues of glycine at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-associated glycine site.Neuropharmacology. 1990; 29: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for the activity of ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine at NMDA receptors, we cocrystallized the NR1 S1S2 ligand binding core with each of the three compounds. As summarized in Table 1, all of the crystals diffracted beyond 1.8 Å resolution, and the NR1 S1S2/ACPC complex diffracted particularly well, to 1.4 Å resolution. The crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement (MR), using the intact glycine bound structure as a search model for the ACPC and ACBC complexes. For the cycloleucine complex, the MR probes were domains 1 and 2 of the NR1 S1S2/glycine structure. The resulting MR solutions were then subjected to crystallographic refinement, as summarized in Table 2. In the ACPC and ACBC bound structures, there are no electron density features for the four N-terminal and one C-terminal residues. The trace of the ACPC complex is continuous and includes loop 1 (residues 439–449), a region that was disordered in all previous NR1 S1S2 structures and that is also disordered in the ACBC and cycloleucine complexes. The continuous density for the NR1 S1S2/ACPC complex is probably due, at least in part, to the completeness of the diffraction data, even in the highest-resolution shell at 1.45–1.40 Å resolution. In the cycloleucine bound structure, 4 residues at the N terminus and 7 residues at the C terminus are disordered, as are residues 439–449 in loop two, for both protomers in the asymmetric unit. The conserved disulfide bond between Cys744 and Cys798 is visible in the electron density maps for the ACPC and ACBC complexes, but in the cycloleucine complex, the last 6 residues of S2 are disordered in both protomers, and this region includes Cys798 of the conserved disulfide bond.Table 1Data Collection StatisticsLigandACPCACBCCycloleucineSpace groupP212121P212121P1Unit cell (Å)a = 41.4, b = 72.6, c = 96.3a = 41.5, b = 72.7, c = 96.6a = 53.2, b = 53.2, c = 67.5α = 110.1, β = 91.6, γ = 108.7No. per a.u.aNumber of protein molecules per asymmetric unit (a.u.).112Lambda (Å)0.97950.97950.9796dmin (Å)bRmerge = ΣhΣi(|Ii(h)| − |<I(h)>|)/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the observed intensity, and <I(h)> is the mean intensity observed from multiple measurements.1.4 (1.45–1.40)1.5 (1.55–1.50)1.8 (1.86–1.80)Total obs.306,308233,997222,936Unique obs.55,99943,34257,310Rmerge (%)cValues in parentheses define the resolution range at the highest shell of data.,dValues in parentheses are for the last shell data.8.7 (33)8.9 (34)5.9 (25)CompletenessdValues in parentheses are for the last shell data.96.6 (100.0)93.4 (95.6)95.2 (96.3)I/σ (I)dValues in parentheses are for the last shell data.20.0 (3.6)21.3 (3.4)25.7 (3.69)RedundancydValues in parentheses are for the last shell data.5.3 (4.1)5.2 (4.2)3.8 (3.69)a Number of protein molecules per asymmetric unit (a.u.).b Rmerge = ΣhΣi(|Ii(h)| − |<I(h)>|)/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the observed intensity, and <I(h)> is the mean intensity observed from multiple measurements.c Values in parentheses define the resolution range at the highest shell of data.d Values in parentheses are for the last shell data.

Mechanisms of activation, inhibition, and specificity in NMDA receptors revealed by cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand-binding core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and similar to those of GluR2 (Armstrong et al., 1998Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.-Q. Gouaux E. Structure of a glutamate receptor ligand binding core in complex with kainate.Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In all of the complexes, unambiguous electron density defines the position and orientation of each ligand, allowing us to map specific ligand-receptor contacts (Figure 3A ). ACPC is bound to the receptor by a hydrogen bond network composed of 3 residues in domain 1 and 2 residues in domain 2 (Figure 3B). The α-carboxy group of ACPC forms a salt bridge with Arg523 on domain 1 and participates in hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen and the side chain hydroxyl of Ser688, similar to the NR1 S1S2/glycine complex. At the α-amino group of ACPC, there is a salt bridge to Asp732, as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone carbonyl of Pro516 and the hydroxyl of Thr518. In terms of direct ligand-receptor interactions, the ligand-receptor contacts made by ACBC and cycloleucine are similar to those made by ACPC (Figures 3C–3E). Nevertheless, there are important differences between the complexes, and some of these differences include variations in the conformation of Ser688 and Val689 and the position of a key water molecule (W1) in the binding pocket. When comparing the glycine bound structure to the ACPC and ACBC complexes, the volume of the cavity occupied by the ligand increases from ∼56 Å3 to 72 Å3 and 116 Å3, respectively; the expansion of the cavity involves side chain reorientations and small shifts of side chain and main chain positions. For the cycloleucine complex, there is no “cavity” because cycloleucine is partially solvent exposed. The NR1 ligand binding pocket, while replete with polar and charged residues, also contains hydrophobic residues, such as Phe484 on domain 1 and Trp731/Val689 on domain 2, that create a nonpolar surface and constrain ligand-receptor interactions (Figures 3E and 3F). Localized at the end of strand 12 and positioned beneath the ligands, Trp731 “senses” the volume of the substituent attached to the α-carbon of the ligand. As the volume of the substituent increases, the indole of Trp731 moves “down” and away from the ligand binding pocket, resulting in a change in the side chain χ1 dihedral angle of 4.8°, 6.0°, and 10.0° in the ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine complexes, respectively. To illustrate that the indole of Trp “rides” along with the ligand, we note that the closest contacts between ligands and the indole ring are 3.4, 3.5, and 3.5 Å in the ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine complexes, respectively. Therefore, the ligand volume is directly felt by the side chain of Trp731 and can lead to an opening of the binding site cleft if the ligand is sufficiently large, as described below. The isopropyl group of Val689 makes contacts with full and partial agonists, and the distances between the CG2 methyl group of Val689 and either the α-carbon atom of glycine or the closest carbon atoms in the ring of ACPC and ACBC are 5.37, 4.96, and 4.45 Å, respectively. In the ACPC and ACBC complexes, there are changes in the side chain and main chain torsion angles proximal to Val689 (Figure 3F). For example, at Val689 the χ1 dihedral angles in the glycine, ACPC, and ACBC bound states are 185.9°, 177.5°, and 179.8°, respectively. At the polypeptide main chain, the ψ torsion angles of Ser688 and the ϕ torsion angles of Val689 are −30.9°, −21.2°, and −15.7° and −70.0°, −63.1°, and −65.1°, for the glycine, ACPC, and ACBC complexes, respectively. While these dihedral angle changes are modest, they nevertheless result in a rotation of helix F in the ACPC and ACBC complexes, relative to the glycine complex, by ∼11° around an axis parallel to helix F. This rotation relocates Tyr692 on helix F and alters contacts between Tyr692 and Phe754, where the latter residue is located at the “clamshell” interdomain hinge. Phe484 is a key residue that “caps” the ligand binding sites in NR1 S1S2. In AMPA receptors, the equivalent residue is tyrosine, and the aromatic ring occupies a similar position as the aromatic ring of Phe484 in NR1. In NR1 S1S2, as in GluR2 S1S2, the nonpolar portion of agonists, proximal to the α-carbon, participate in hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic ring, and the distances between the α-carbon of ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine and the plane of the phenyl group are 3.3, 3.5, and 3.5 Å, respectively (Figure 3F). For NR1 S1S2, however, the edge of Phe484 interacts with the indole of Trp731, forming a hydrophobic interdomain contact. Thus, as the ring of the ligand expands, in going from ACPC to cycloleucine, and the binding pocket expands, the hydrophobic interdomain interactions between Phe484 and Trp731 are altered. To evaluate the relative disposition of domain 1 and domain 2 in the three complexes, we superposed domain 1 of each of the complexes on domain 1 of the NR1 S1S2/glycine complex. The glycine, ACPC, and ACBC complexes superimpose well (Figure 4A ), but the cycloleucine complex does not: it adopts an “open”-cleft conformation, most similar to the NR1 S1S2 complex with 5,7-dichlorokynureic acid (DCKA) (Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003Furukawa H. Gouaux E. Mechanisms of activation, inhibition, and specificity in NMDA receptors revealed by cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand-binding core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, when domains 1 and 2 are separated and individually superimposed on each other, using the glycine, ACPC, ACBC, and cycloleucine complexes, we find that the root mean squared (rms) deviations for α-carbon positions are less than 0.33 Å for domain 1 and 0.69 Å for domain 2, therefore indicating that the domains behave as relatively rigid bodies, with domain 2 being slightly more variable in conformation. Because there are two protomers in the asymmetric unit of the cycloleucine complex, we compared the crystallographically independent structures and found that they superimposed with a rms deviation on α-carbon position of 0.1 Å. To define the separation of domains 1 and 2, i.e., the extent of “domain closure,” we superimposed domain 1 of two structures and then determined the transformation required to superimpose domain 2. Using the glycine bound structure as a reference, we determined the extent of domain closure for all of the available NR1 S1S2 structures. By plotting the extent of domain closure versus maximal current, we determined the correlation between domain closure and ion channel activation (Figure 4C). For the full and partial agonists of NR1, i.e., glycine, D-serine, ACPC, ACBC, and D-cycloserine, we find that they vary in the extent of domain closure by 0.5° or less. By contrast, the cycloleucine complexes adopt a conformation in which domains 1 and 2 are more op"
https://openalex.org/W2088757208,"During development of the retinocollicular projection in mouse, retinal axons initially overshoot their future termination zones (TZs) in the superior colliculus (SC). The formation of TZs is initiated by interstitial branching at topographically appropriate positions. Ephrin-As are expressed in a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient in the SC, and they suppress branching posterior to future TZs. Here we investigate the role of an EphA7 gradient in the SC, which has the reverse orientation to the ephrin-A gradient. We find that in EphA7 mutant mice the retinocollicular map is disrupted, with nasal and temporal axons forming additional or extended TZs, respectively. In vitro, retinal axons are repelled from growing on EphA7-containing stripes. Our data support the idea that EphA7 is involved in suppressing branching anterior to future TZs. These findings suggest that opposing ephrin-A and EphA gradients are required for the proper development of the retinocollicular projection."

The model licenses testable predictions. Separating figure from background in an image is one of the most important tasks in vision and is commonly seen as a prerequisite to object recognition. However, we still do not understand its neural basis. Figure and ground information in an image can be represented by assigning ownership of the border between two surfaces as belonging to one of the surfaces as the figure, which then occludes the other, the ground. The border is said to be owned by the assigned or occluding figure. The shapes of the surfaces and the resulting perception depend crucially on this allocation of border ownership (BOWN), as is well demonstrated by the famous example in Figure 1A (Rubin, 2001Rubin E. Figure and ground.in: Yantis S. Visual Perception Essential Readings. Psychology Press, Philadelphia2001: 225-230Google Scholar). Here, the bistable perception of either the flower vase or the mirrored, profile faces depends on whether the contour in the image is interpreted as owned by the lighter or darker regions. Many neurons in V2 have been observed to be selective to both the orientation and BOWN of contours (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar). That is, for instance, a cell preferring vertical contours responds more vigorously to a vertical contour segment within its classical receptive field (CRF) if this segment belongs to the surface to the left rather than the right side of this contour. For example, the white square of Figure 1B is more readily seen as a figure occluding a gray background than as a hole in a gray surface revealing an underlying white background. In BOWN terms, the bounding contour of the square is more readily owned by the white. In contrast, Figure 1F is generally interpreted as a gray square in a white background. By construction, the left border of this square is at the same spatial location as the right border of the white square in Figure 1B. Consider the CRF of a model cell shown by the ellipses in the figures. It is centered on this border location but is much smaller than the whole border of the squares. If this cell is tuned to BOWN, its responses to the stimuli depicted in Figures 1B and 1F should differ significantly, even though the stimulus patterns within its CRF are exactly the same for the two examples. It is the stimulus pattern in the context outside the CRF that determines the BOWNs and the neural responses. Figure 1 shows that the same white-left to dark-right luminance contrast stimulus within the CRF can be generated by other Gestalt-based stimulus configurations and BOWN examples: by partial occlusion between white and gray surfaces (Figures 1C and 1G); by a white or gray C-shaped figure in front of gray or white backgrounds (Figures 1D and 1H); by a white semitransparent rectangle on top of a black one (Figure 1I); and by four nonoverlapping black or white figures on a gray background (Figure 1E). The stimulus patterns in Figures 1B–1I are similar to those used by von der Heydt and colleagues to demonstrate BOWN tuning in V2 neurons. They observed that a cell tuned to a figure to the left prefers Figures 1B–1E to Figures 1F–1I (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar; F.T. Qiu et al., 2001, Soc. Neurosci., abstract; R. von der Heydt et al., 2003, J.

Representation of stereoscopic edges in monkey visual cortex.Vision Res. 2000; 40: 1955-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As the size of figure square in Figure 1B grows toward occupying the whole left half of the image, BOWN becomes ambiguous. Correspondingly, the BOWN signals in V2 neurons also weaken (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar), i.e., the differences in responses to Figures 1B and 1F are reduced. Von der Heydt and colleagues also observed that neural tunings to BOWN are not tightly constrained by, or dependent on, any particular image cue such as surface luminance. BOWN tuning was also observed for figures defined by depth using random-dot stereograms (F.T. Qiu et al., 2001, Soc. Neurosci., abstract) or motion (R. von der Heydt et al., 2003, J. Vis., abstract), or even for figures in line drawings (e.g., a square line drawing; Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, BOWN tuning observed when luminance is the cue is consistent with that observed when disparity (von der Heydt et al., 2000von der Heydt R. Zhou H. Friedman H.S.

Vis., abstract) is the cue, if a cell is tuned to BOWN using more than one cue. Furthermore, while surface feature differences between two neighboring surfaces can be qualitatively signaled by the feature contrast polarity of the border, not all cells tuned to BOWN of a contour are tuned to luminance contrast polarity and vice versa (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar), and many cells are tuned to BOWN irrespective of other image cues such as luminance contrast (von der Heydt et al., 2003von der Heydt R. Zhou H. Friedman H.S. Neural coding of border ownership: Implications for the theory of figure-ground perception.in: Behrmann M. Kimchi R. Olson C.R.

Figure 1G demonstrates that the gray figure is perceived as a whole nonoccluded surface, even though the contrast polarity changes along its border due to changes of the occluded region (see also Discussion and Figure 5A). This implies that the contour information overrides the contrast polarity information to determine BOWN. Tuning in BOWN is significantly weaker or even absent in V1 (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the question arises whether the context-dependent neural tuning to BOWN in V2 is generated by mechanisms within this area, or by top-down feedback from one or more higher visual areas, or by a combination of both top-down and local mechanisms (von der Heydt et al., 2003von der Heydt R.

MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1995: 1-70Google Scholar weigh against higher areas. First, they demonstrated that manipulating stimuli to change perceived BOWNs dramatically affects behavior in rapid visual tasks like visual search. Second, in the case of “impossible objects,” such as the famous Penrose “impossible” triangle, BOWN processing leads to perceptions of three-dimensional objects that can never be realized in the real world and that must therefore violate higher-level object knowledge. A possible neural substrate for a local mechanism to process contextual information certainly exists in the form of the intracortical, lateral, neural connections within V2 that link cells with nonoverlapping CRFs separated by a finite distance (Angelucci et al., 2002Angelucci A. Levitt J.B. Walton E.J. Hupe J.M. Bullier J. Lund J.S. Circuits for local and global signal integration in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8633-8646PubMed Google Scholar). Other evidences support contributions beyond V2. The first one comes from data on the latencies of BOWN signals, defined by the times (since initial responses) at which neural responses first differ between inputs with identical CRF stimulation, but different, contextually defined BOWN. In V2, BOWN latency does not seem to depend on the sizes of the figures such as the square in Figure 1B. The essential contextual information needed to determine the ownership of a contour segment on a side of a square come from the ends of the side or other sides of the square. If finite range intracortical connections were used to propagate the contextual information, then larger squares would seem to require longer propagation times, thus requiring longer latencies. That this is not true for squares of sizes 3° and 8° has prompted the suggestion that central (global) feedbacks from visual areas with larger receptive fields are involved (T. Sugihara et al., 2003, Soc. Neurosci., abstract). Secondly, the bistable perception of the flower vase or faces can be influenced by voluntary attention, suggesting top-down modulation. Models have duly been constructed in which BOWN tuning results from a combination of V2 mechanisms and additional, presumably top-down, information such as labels for global figures, T junctions, and corners (unless one views that T junctions and corners can be detected by the end-stopped cells in V1 or V2; Heitger et al., 1992Heitger F.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4117-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), all of which are very helpful to determine BOWN (Finkel and Sajda, 1994Finkel L.H. Sajda P. Constructing visual perception.Am. Scientist. 1994; 82: 224-237Google Scholar; E. Craft et al., 2004, J. Vis., abstract; E. Craft et al., personal communication). Understanding the capacity of local mechanisms in V2 to generate BOWN, particularly with size-independent latency, is therefore a key first step. In this paper, I describe a network model of V2 in which generic local and contextual contour (orientation) information (independent of the input cues responsible for the contours themselves) can feasibly be used by local V2 mechanisms to construct BOWN tuning consistent with all the physiological observations so far described. The additional contributions to BOWN tuning from surface feature (e.g., luminance) cues and top-down factors will be discussed in the Discussion, along with the relationship to previous works. Model neurons have CRFs and preferred orientations that sample the visual space evenly. For each (discrete) CRF location i and preferred orientation 0 ≤ θ < 180°, there are two neurons with opposite preferred BOWNs; one indicating that the figure owning the contour segment at (i,θ) is to the left of the contour and the other that it is to the right (when one faces the direction θ). To represent BOWN graphically, we adopt a convention in which we show neurons with 360° tuning to direction rather than 180°, with values differing by 180° favoring the same orientation, but opposite BOWN. Thus, each neuron is shown as being tuned to direction θ spanning 0° to 360°, where θ = 0° is the three o’clock (east) direction, and θ increases counter-clockwise. In this representation, a neuron tuned to direction θ prefers orientation θ if θ < 180°, and θ − 180° otherwise, while its preferred figure side is always to the right of the contour segment (i,θ) when facing direction θ. Figure 2 shows the model elements and the way we will visualize them. A neuron is represented by a directed edge (plotted with or without an arrow) at its CRF location i and pointing in its preferred direction θ. This edge has a fin directed toward the side of the figure the cell assumes owns the border (Figure 2Aa). As mentioned, this is always the right side when facing θ. Thus, a cell preferring a vertical orientation, θ = 90°, could have preferred direction either 90° or 270°, depending on whether it prefers a figure to the east or west of the border. Model inputs are assumed to arise from population activity of topographically localized and orientation-tuned V1 output neurons, representing images of contour segments (see Figure 2Ac), i.e., short oriented bars. Each input signal Iiθ is a graded firing rate representing the strength (e.g., contrast) of a contour segment (i,θ). However, to answer whether generic contour information is sufficient to determine BOWNs through context, the model inputs are abstracted as not specifying whether the underlying contour segments are derived from luminance or disparity cues, or are simply contour lines (even though the actual V1 does provide some such information to higher visual areas). Most critically, the inputs are not explicitly biased for the BOWN of their contour segments. Hence, unless otherwise stated, equal input strengths Iiθ = Ii,θ + 180° are always directed to two model cells (i,θ) and (i,θ + 180°) preferring the two possible BOWNs given (i,θ). Figure 2Ac shows an example model input pattern for a square contour, where Iiθ is nonzero for the pairs of directed border segments (i,θ) on each side of the square, and zero for all other border segments. V2 responses have BOWN biases, with unequal response (pyramidal) outputs Oi,θ ≠ Oi,θ + 180° for border segments (i,θ) and (i,θ + 180°) of the same orientation and border location but opposite BOWN preference. This is visualized by a bar at location i and orientation θ, with a fin pointing to the dominant figure side. The thickness of the bars (i,θ) is proportional to max(Oi,θ, Oi,θ + 180°), the dominant output of the two pyramidals, and the length of the fin increases with|Oi,θ−Oi,θ+180∘|/max(Oi,θ,Oi,θ+180∘),the fractional difference between the two responses Oi,θ and Oi,θ + 180°. Figure 2Ad shows a possible V2 response pattern, preferring a square figure to a hole, to the V1 inputs shown in Figure 2Ac. The model neurons not sharing the same CRF location excite or suppress each other through monosynaptic excitation or disynaptic inhibition (via interneurons) through intracortical connections that are characteristic of V2 (Angelucci et al., 2002Angelucci A. Levitt J.B. Walton E.J. Hupe J.M. Bullier J. Lund J.S. Circuits for local and global signal integration in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8633-8646PubMed Google Scholar). The connections link nearby, and not necessarily overlapping CRFs. Their nature and strengths depend on the CRF locations and preferred orientations and BOWNs of the pre- and postsynaptic cells. Two neurons facilitate or suppress each other’s activities if the two corresponding border segments and BOWNs are consistent or inconsistent with being owned by a single figure surface. For example, if two neurons represent two nearby and coaligned contour segments, they facilitate each other if they prefer the same figure side (Figure 2Ba) and inhibit each other otherwise (Figure 2Bd). The connections also satisfy other Gestalt grouping principles. For instance, in the visual world, borders of figures tend to be convex relative to the figure, i.e., object surfaces tend to have rounded or oblique corners rather than spiky or acute corners. In other words, when walking along the border with the figure on the right side, the border tends to turn right toward the figure rather than turning left away from it. This convexity bias is represented in the model connections as stronger facilitation between neurons representing two border segments related to each other through a right turn (Figures 2Bb and 2C) than through a left turn. Neurons are connected inhibitorily if they represent border segments that could plausibly be part of two borders colliding toward each other at some point (Figure 2Be) or departing from each other at a point (Figure 2Bd). Furthermore, while the model does not have neurons explicitly detecting T junctions, two neurons for two border segments that are plausibly the top and stem, respectively, of a T junction facilitate each other if the neuron for the T top has a BOWN preference consistent with an occluding surface (Figure 2Bc), otherwise, suppressive connections are designed between the two neurons (Figure 2Bf). A consequence of this interaction is that cells should manifest end-stopping properties. Meanwhile, the connection strengths also decay with distances between linked cells. All these Gestalt grouping features of the connection patterns can be visualized in Figure 2C in an example input pattern. Finally, the connection strengths are such that, if there is no visual stimulus within the CRF of a neuron, no single contextual stimulus bar segment is sufficient to evoke any sustained responses from it. Note that the model connection structure requires many links between cells tuned to very different, e.g., orthogonal, orientations. This is in contrast to what is believed to be in V1, where interconnected neurons tend to prefer similar orientations. Indeed, it is easier to observe in V2 than in V1 correlated firings between neurons preferring very different orientations (Tamura et al., 1996Tamura H. Sato H. Katsuyama N. Hata Y. Tsumoto T. Less segregated processing of visual information in V2 than in V1 of the monkey visual cortex.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interactions between nearby, orthogonally oriented elements have also been seen psychophysically (Yu et al., 2002Yu C. Klein S.A. Levi D.M. Facilitation of contrast detection by cross-oriented surround stimuli and its psychophysical mechanisms.J. Vis. 2002; 2: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Popple, 2003Popple A.V. Context effects on texture border localization bias.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Since BOWN latency is diagnostic, the model has to address finite time conduction. A presynaptic neuron’s output arrives at its postsynaptic target after an axonal conduction latency or delay. The existing data from various experiments still leave much uncertainty about the true range of the conduction latency or velocity (Grinvald et al., 1994Grinvald A. Lieke E.E. Frostig R.D.

Time course and time-distance relationships for surround suppression in macaque V1 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7690-7701PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that the conduction velocity varies with the axon length (see Discussion). I henceforth assume in this paper that the conduction latency between the pre- and postsynaptic cells is randomly in the range of 8–10 ms (or, for neurons with a membrane time constant of 10 ms, between 80% and 100% of the membrane time constant), regardless of the distance between the connected cells (Girard et al., 2001Girard P.

Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1328-1331PubMed Google Scholar; see Discussion section for the data and considerations behind this assumption). Neural signal integration time at the postsynaptic cell is additionally modeled through the membrane time constant in the model neuron. The Experimental Procedures section lists all the model details and parameters necessary to reproduce the results, and the same model parameters are used in the simulations of all examples in this paper. Figure 3 demonstrates that the model responds in accordance with psychophysical observations. The model’s initial response (Figure 3B) reflects the feedforward visual input (Figure 3A), which contains no BOWN bias, and the random input noise perturbing each model neuron. Later, systematic differential responses to the two possible assignments of figure and ground emerge (Figure 3C) and grow toward an asymptotic level as the activities evolve (Figure 3D). Through intracortical interactions, border segments in the context of a given cell’s CRF bias its responses, in a way that depends on their preferred BOWNs. The cell’s response in turn influences the responses of the contextual segments. Physiologically (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar; T. Sugihara et al., 2003, Soc. Neurosci., abstract), the latency of the BOWN signal is defined by the time at which significant differences appear in the responses of a neuron to two border stimuli with the same local features in the CRF, but opposite BOWNs (such as the border within the oval in Figures 1B and 1F). In our model, the latency of the BOWN tuning is equivalently defined using a single stimulus, as follows. Given one border stimulus pattern, e.g., Figure 1B, we examine the temporal responses of the two neurons that prefer two opposite BOWNs but have the same CRF and preferred orientation matching the border, e.g., the oval in Figure 1B. The latency is defined by the time when the responses in these two neurons start to differ significantly. The strength of the BOWN signal may be seen as the difference between the two responses. The physiological data show that, for square figures, BOWN arises about 30 ms after the initial neuron responses (T. Sugihara et al., 2003, Soc. Neurosci., abstract), and this latency is the same for squares of sizes 3° and 8°. From anatomical data (Angelucci et al., 2002Angelucci A. Levitt J.B. Walton E.J. Hupe J.M. Bullier J. Lund J.S. Circuits for local and global signal integration in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8633-8646PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that 3° corresponds roughly to the longest length of lateral connections in V2. In our model, we examine responses to three squares whose sides are 1, 2, and 3 times as long as the longest intracortical connection length (which is 10 in grid units) in the model (Figure 3). For these squares, it is instructive to consider a border segment in the middle of a figure side, since this is furthest from the corners of the square, which is the only location in the image where there is any BOWN bias (arising from convexity). For the smallest square, the lateral connections link the middle border segment to the closest corners directly; for the largest square, no corner is within reach. Figures 3E–3G show that the BOWN signal arises roughly with the same latency, between two and three membrane time constants (i.e., 20–30 ms if membrane time constant is 10 ms) after stimulus onset or initial responses, for all three square sizes, even though the strengths of the BOWN signals are weaker (in the middle border segments) for larger squares, as observed physiologically (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Friedman H.S. von der Heydt R. Coding of border ownership in monkey visual cortex J.Neuroscience. 2000; 20: 6594-6611PubMed Google Scholar). Figures 3F and 3G show that, for larger squares, the BOWN signal increases more quickly with time initially for the corner border segments than the middle border segments, even though the two BOWN latencies are comparable. These simulation results suggest that top-down feedback is not necessary to create size-invariant latencies, at least within a range of figure sizes. This may seem counterintuitive, given the finite lengths of connections and the nonzero axonal conduction delays. However, note that the BOWN latency in the model is in any case about two to three times the axonal conduction delay and the membrane time constant. Within this temporal window, the contextual information at the corners of the figure surface could propagate to a distance up to two to three times as long as the longest intracortical connections. It does suggest, however, that the size invariance of BOWN latency may not hold for much larger figures, a prediction that could be physiologically tested (see Discussion). Figures 4A–4D demonstrate four other examples of the model’s response to inputs resembling those used in physiological experiments, including figure occlusion, a C-shaped figure, figure transparency, and four squares (see Figures 1C–1E and 1G–1I). Just as observed in physiology, the model exhibits appropriate BOWN tuning. In Figure 4A, the occluding square owns the occluding borders. That the two T junctions “1” and “2” provide the essential cue for the occlusion in cases such as this has led to suggestions that T junction detectors or labels are needed to determine figure-ground relationships. Indeed, this has been the basis of previous models (Finkel and Sajda, 1994Finkel L.H. Sajda P. Constructing visual perception.Am. Scientist. 1994; 82: 224-237Google Scholar; E. Craft et al., 2004, J. Vis., abstract). In our model, there is no explicit T junction detector, rather the information about T junctions is implicit in the lateral interactions. In Figure 4B, if the context of the borders “1,” “2,” “3” (the “]” shape) were to be removed, the BOWN responses to these three borders would be the opposite of that shown, due to the local convexity bias among the three borders. The intracortical interactions, though of limited range, are able to cooperatively or collectively process contextual information from all the other borders, even ones that are far away. In the simulation, the latencies (from initial responses) of the BOWN signals for these borders “1,” “2,” “3” are about twice as long as those of other borders whose ownership can more straightforwardly be determined. This is as if BOWNs for the ambiguous borders are determined after those of the less ambiguous ones. It is also apparent that the BOWN signal strength is weaker for the ambiguous borders. Figures 4C and 4D are responses to stimuli adapted from the stimulus patterns depicted in Figures 1I and 1E, which are like those used in physiological experiments (F.T. Qiu and R. von der Heydt, 2003, J. Vis., abstract). The two stimulus patterns differ only by a few contour segments, effectively rounding the corners of the four squares. Nevertheless, the perceived BOWNs of the central borders are dramatically different, leading to changes in surface perception. Figure 4C is a transparent rectangle on top of another one, and Figure 4D involves four identical square shapes with rounded corners. In"
https://openalex.org/W2021517743,"P2X7 receptors are ATP-gated ion channels primarily expressed on antigen-presenting immune cells where they play a role in the acute inflammatory response. These ion channels couple not only to influx of cations, including calcium, but also to rapid alterations in cell morphology (membrane blebbing, phosphatidylserine exposure, microvesicle shedding). These features resemble the extranuclear events associated with end stages of apoptosis but cell death does not occur if receptor activation is brief. Here we delineate two signaling pathways underlying these apoptotic-like processes. Loss of membrane asymmetry occurs within seconds, which directly triggers cytoskeletal disruption and zeiotic membrane blebbing; this is readily reversible and requires both calcium influx through P2X7 channels and mitochondrial calcium increase but is not associated with cytochrome c release. A slower, calcium-independent, ROCK-1-dependent cascade that does not involve rapid loss of membrane asymmetry but is associated with cytochrome c release is secondarily activated. The ROCK-1 pathway appears largely responsible for cell death, which occurs after prolonged stimulation of P2X7 receptors.

We have focused on alterations in cytoskeletal protein elements, changes in lipid asymmetry and mitochondrial function, and the dynamics of membrane blebbing because these are some of the most intensively studied extranuclear events associated with active cell death (i.e. apoptosis) (22Mills.

We find that plasma membrane PS flip and gross mitochondrial swelling with collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential both occur in less than 5–10 s with actin filament/microtubule network disruption and synchronous membrane blebbing occurring some 30– 60 s later. All of these events are fully reversible and not associated with cytochrome c release when receptor activation is less than 20–30 min. However, longer activation of this receptor leads to release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which is associated with inevitable cell death. Thus, it appears that P2X7 receptors couple to at least two distinct mechanisms: a calcium-dependent, PS flip-initiated pathway resulting in reversible cytoskeletal disruptions without subsequent cell death and a calcium-independent, ROCK-1-dependent pathway that may be primarily responsible for cell death following prolonged P2X7 receptor activation. Reagents—All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, except the following: Mitotracker Green (stock 1 mm in Me2SO4), Fura-2-AM, Rhod-2, JC-1 (all 2 mm stock in Me2SO4), rhodamine phalloidin (stock solution of 200 units ml-1 in methanol), and 2–6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The caspase inhibitor 1, zVAD-FMK (stock 100 mm in Me2SO4 used at a final concentration of 100 μm), anti-human α-tubulin monoclonal antibody, Y-27632 (supplied as a 5 mm stock solution in H2O and used at 5 μm final concentration), LY294002 (10 mm stock in Me2SO4, used at 10 μm final concentration), ML-9 (10 mm stock in Me2SO4, used at 10 μm final concentration), BAPTA-AM (10 mm stock in Me2SO4, used 1 μm), and cyclosporin A (1 mm in ethanol, used at 1 μm) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp (La Jolla, CA). Unless otherwise stated, normal extracellular saline contained (in mm) NaCl 147; KCl 2; Hepes 10; glucose 12; CaCl2 2; MgCl2 1; to pH 7.3 with NaOH. Ca2+-free saline contained NaCl 147; KCl 2; Hepes 10; glucose 12; MgCl2 1; EGTA 1 to pH 7.3 with NaOH. Microscopy—For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed (30 min) in suspension in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m PIPES buffer at pH 7.2 with 200 ml of 33% hydrogen peroxide per 10 ml of fixative. The cell suspension was centrifuged, the pellet was fixed for a further 30 min, and then washed in 0.1 m PIPES buffer for 1 h. Cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in PIPES buffer for 1 h then washed in 0.05 m maleate buffer over 1 h. The preparation was then bulk-stained in 1% uranyl acetate in maleate buffer for 12 h then dehydrated in graded alcohols, infiltrated in Spurr resin, and sectioned at 60 nm on a Riechert ultramicrotome. The sections were examined using a Philips CM 100 electron microscope. Standard video microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 with Fluar ×40 or ×100 objective, and a JVC TK-C1380 color video camera coupled with a VHS video recorder. Images were converted from analogue to digital images using the Formac Studio and ProTV software (Formac Electronics, Germany). Image J software (NIH) was used to time-compress videos, which were then saved as Quicktime Movies. To assess mitochondrial morphology, cells were loaded with 2 μm Mitotracker Green for 2–5 min at room temperature. Fluorescent images were collected using either a cooled CCD camera (IMAGO) or a laser scanning confocal microscope (Molecular Dynamics CLSM2010). In fluorescent imaging experiments, images were obtained using an oil immersion ×100 Fluar objective by a cooled CCD camera at 0.5–2 Hz, NBD labeling of plasma membrane was as described previously (10MacKenzie A.B. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 8: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (713) Google Scholar). A scanning monochromator selected excitation wavelengths under computer control. Digital images were analyzed using TILLvisION imaging software (Photonics, Planegg, Germany). Excitation/emission wavelengths were 480/488 nm for BTC-AM, 340/380 nm for Fura-2, 560/510 for JC-1, 500 for Rhod-2, and 560 nm for rhodamine phalloidin. Agonists were applied via a gravity-driven superfusion system. Confocal fluorescent imaging of mitochondria (Mitotracker Green) was carried out using the excitation wavelength 488 nm and emission collected via the 530-nm band pass filter (green channel). Images were acquired using an inverted microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective. All experiments were conducted at ambient room temperature 22–24 °C. Data are mean ± S.E. Immunohistochemistry—Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in Zamboni's Fixative (20 min), blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 (30 min), and then incubated with the primary antibody (mouse anti-human vinculin or anti-human α-tubulin) for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) at 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. For actin distribution, fixed cells were labeled with rhodamine phalloidin (filamentous actin/F-actin) or DNAse1 (monomeric actin/G-actin) either separately, together, or following labeling for vinculin. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed with Zambonis (10 min), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 (20 min), and incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (5 units ml-1) or FITC-DNAse1 for 1 h. For simultaneous labeling of vinculin and F-actin, cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (30 min) following labeling with secondary antibody. Analysis of Bleb Kinetics and Dimensions—Still images of blebbing cells were used for measurements. Because images were in two dimensions, we estimated the area of each bleb and of the cell itself by approximating each to a circle (drawing a circular region of interest around each) and calculating the area (πr2). For each image the sum of the areas of all blebs was expressed as a percent of the area of the cell. This protocol adjusted for differences in cell size and focal plane during video acquisition. Time to onset of membrane blebbing was taken as time when first fully protruding bleb was observed and is accurate to ± 4 s. All measurements were performed blind in terms of knowledge of the experimental condition applied. Curves following either onset of blebbing or extent of blebbing were fit by a least squares method using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software) in the form: Y = Ymin + [(Ymax - Ymin)/(1 + (V50/t)m)] where Y is response, t is time, V50 is half-maximal response, and m is slope of the line. The reversal of blebbing was fit only by a smoothing curve using Kaleidagraph. Cytochrome c Release—To determine cytochrome c release from mitochondria, cytosolic fractions were isolated as described (27Single B. Letst M. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells per sample, were exposed to 100 μm BzATP for various times or left untreated. The cells were then lysed under vigorous vortexing in PBS plus 500 mm sucrose containing protease inhibitors (Complete-TM, Roche Applied Science) and further incubated at room temperature for 60 s. Cytosolic fractions were quickly isolated and removed from organelles and cell debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. As reference for total cytochrome c content of the cells, organelle-comprising fractions of untreated cells were lysed in 20 mm dodecylmaltoside in PBS plus protease inhibitors for 2 h under vigorous shaking. The presence of the detergent allowed solubilization of membrane proteins that were then separated from cell debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized by Western blotting: SDS sample buffer was added, and proteins were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min. They were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immune-blot PVDF, Bio-Rad) membranes. PVDF membranes were rinsed in 10 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in TTBS: 10 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 0,1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, for 1 h at room temperature. After a wash with TTBS, a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c Ab (2 μg/ml, BD PharMingen clone 7H8.2C12) was added, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed twice in TTBS, and a 1:3000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-AP-conjugated Ab (Bio-Rad) was added in blocking solution. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature the membrane was washed three times and Immun-star substrate from Bio-Rad was applied for 5 min in the dark. Protein bands were revealed by standard photographic procedures. Densitometric semiquantitation of Western blot bands was obtained using the Gene Genius image system from Syngene. Images were acquired and analyzed from films using GeneSnap and Genetools software (Syngene). The reported data represent the ratio between the calculated density of each sample and a control untreated sample present on the same film (Fig. 7D) or relative to β-actin (Fig. 7, B and C) resolved on the same gel using rabbit β-actin polyclonal Ab (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). P2X7 Receptor-induced Membrane Blebbing and Cytoskeletal Rearrangements—HEK293 cells stably expressing the rat P2X7 receptor were used because previous electrophysiological and immunohistochemical studies have shown that virtually all cells exhibit uniform and approximately equal receptor density at the plasma membrane (10MacKenzie A.B. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 8: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 28Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The ATP analogue, BzATP, was used in most experiments, because it does not activate the endogenous metabotropic purinergic (P2Y) receptors in these cells (29Wilson H.L. Wilson S.A. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34017-34023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The time-to-initial onset of blebbing decreased with increasing agonist concentrations, from 48 ± 3 s (n = 144) at 10 μm to 23 ± 1s(n = 131) at 200 μm. As well, the proportion of cells undergoing blebbing was similarly concentration-dependent with 10 μm BzATP inducing blebs in <2% of cells whereas >97% of cells blebbed in response to 100 μm BzATP (Fig. 1, A and B). When these parameters were plotted as a function of the agonist concentration, they were well fit by standard sigmoidal dose-response equations (Fig. 1, C and D); half-maximal EC50 values for time-to-onset and percent total cells blebbed were 33 ± 2 μm and 72 ± 3 μm, respectively. These values are within the range of EC50 values (3–40 μm) for membrane current, dye uptake or calcium entry in these cells under identical conditions (10MacKenzie A.B. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E.

Sci. 1999; 868: 716-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and thus indicate that the signaling pathway(s) underlying these rapid morphological changes are engaged over the same range as that for activation of the P2X7 ion channel. Membrane blebs readily reversed within 5–15 min in all cells when BzATP (30, 100 μm) was washed out following applications of 1–10 min (Fig. 1, A and E and supplemental Movie 1). Upon washout of agonist, blebs were observed to resorb at a rate corresponding to the total level of blebbing that occurred; that is, smaller blebs reversed more quickly than larger blebs (Fig. 1E). Blebbing was a dynamic process even during washout of agonist, as new blebs appeared while others were resorbed until complete retraction occurred (supplemental Movie 1). This type of dynamic blebbing is termed “zeiotic” and has been associated with apoptotic but not necrotic cell death (31Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E91-E93Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat.

Biol. 2004; 75: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy showed that P2X7 receptor-induced blebs exhibited the same characteristics as classical apoptotic blebs (31Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E91-E93Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Barros L.F. Kanaseki T. Sabirov R. Morishima S. Castro J. Bittner C.X. Maeno E. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Okada Y. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar): they contained only amorphous cytosolic material and no organelles; the double nuclear membrane remained intact during activation for up to 10 min (longest time examined), although the chromatin appeared slightly more condensed when compared with unactivated cells (Fig. 2A). Because the actin cytoskeleton is the major factor dictating cell shape and movement, we studied the distribution of polymerized (F-actin) and monomeric (G-actin) actin after 2–10 min exposure to BzATP (Fig. 2). In unactivated cells, a dense network of F-actin fibers traversed the periphery of the cell directly under/at the plasma membrane whereas monomeric G-actin was diffusely localized throughout the cytosol (Fig. 2B, upper panel). One minute after exposure to BzATP (30 μm), membrane blebs were rich in monomeric G-actin but relatively devoid of F-actin (n = 8; Fig. 2B, lower panel). F-actin stress fibers are complexed to integrin receptors via focal adhesion sites, a complex of actin-binding proteins, and signal transduction elements such as tyrosine kinases (35Giancotti F.C.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Disassembly of focal adhesion complexes may account for formation of large blebs devoid of organelles caused by sudden loss of the membrane-cytoskeletal interaction (35Giancotti F.C.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 36Segundo C. Medina F. Rodriguez C. Martinez-Palencia R. Leyva-Cobian F. Brieva J.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the localization of the focal adhesion protein vinculin; an actin-binding protein, which forms part of the focal adhesion complex (37Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In control cells, vinculin was distributed at perinuclear regions and at punctate focal complexes at the termini of peripheral F-actin fibers (Fig. 2C, upper panel), but after P2X7 receptor activation for 2 min, vinculin had accumulated at the cell periphery and in the blebs (Fig. 2C, lower panel) Finally, because the microtubule network regulates contractile and propulsive actions of the actin cytoskeleton, with extensive cross-talk between these two structural elements particularly at the level of focal adhesions (35Giancotti F.C.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 37Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), we also examined α-tubulin distribution after P2X7 receptor-induced blebbing. In unactivated cells, microtubule filaments extended throughout the cell and terminated within lamellipodia (Fig. 2D, left panel), after 2-min BzATP stimulation, α-tubulin was seen to cluster at the leading edge of the bleb (Fig. 2D, middle panel). Distribution of α-tubulin had returned to normal within 20 min of agonist removal (Fig. 2D, right panel), by which time all blebs had retracted. A Calcium Influx Pathway and a Calcium-independent ROCK-1 Pathway Account for Two Types of Membrane Blebbing—Despite these dramatic cytoskeletal rearrangements, neither membrane blebbing nor its reversal were significantly altered by several agents that interfere with cytoskeletal proteins. Specifically, the following treatments were without effect on blebbing or reversibility of blebbing: cytochalasin D (n = 10), which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by preventing F-actin polymerization, the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-9 (n = 6), or the microtubule depolymerizer, nocodazole (n = 6; Fig. 3A). Because MAPK and Rho-dependent pathways are well known to be intimately involved with cytoskeletal function, we examined the following inhibitors of these pathways but did not observe any significant alterations in the kinetics or extent of P2X7 receptor-induced membrane blebbing: dominant negative and positive mutations of RhoA (N19Rho and L61Rho), the C3 exoenzyme Rho inhibitor, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, the p42/44 MAPK inhibitor PD98059, and LY294002, which is a relatively specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase at the concentrations used in this study (n = 3–9 for all compounds, final concentrations of compounds used are listed under “Material and Methods,” Fig. 3A). In contrast, the p160 ROCK-1 inhibitor, Y-27632, significantly increased the time to onset of membrane blebbing (Fig. 3A) but had no significant effect on the extent or type of membrane blebbing that occurred. More strikingly, removal of extracellular calcium (with 1 mm EGTA to ensure maximum calcium reduction), clearly altered the features of the blebs as well as increasing the time to onset of initial blebbing (Fig. 3B). The multiple blebbing around the cell circumference seen in control solutions (Fig. 1A and supplemental Movie 1) was replaced by many fewer (usually only 1 or 2) and much larger blebs, whose neck diameters were up to 10 μm (Fig. 3B and supplemental Movie 2). In contrast to the zeiotic nature of the blebbing observed in the presence of calcium, features of the calcium-independent blebs resembled those previously ascribed to necrotic blebs (33Barros L.F. Kanaseki T. Sabirov R. Morishima S. Castro J. Bittner C.X. Maeno E. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Okada Y. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additional pretreatment with BAPTA-AM to prevent changes in intracellular calcium caused a further reduction in numbers of blebs/cell with concomitant enlargement of individual blebs (Fig. 3B). Under these calcium-free conditions, pretreatment with Y-27632 now led to complete cessation of membrane blebbing (Fig. 3A). Calcium-independent Blebbing Occurs without Prior PS Flip—We have previously observed that, under normal conditions, PS flip precedes P2X7R-induced membrane blebbing, and, for brief agonist applications (<10 min), reverses within hours without concomitant cell death (10MacKenzie A.B. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 8: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (713) Google Scholar). We have extended these studies by examining more quantitatively the kinetics of P2X7R-induced PS flip. We also asked whether PS flip preceded and/or accompanied the calcium-independent membrane blebbing, and thus whether it may be an essential upstream signal for initiation of blebbing per se. We used annexin-V-FITC fluorescence to monitor PS flip; however, annexin V binds specifically to PS only in the presence of calcium, and annexin V binding itself blocks further PS translocation (10MacKenzie A.B.

Therefore, we carried out parallel experiments to measure separately at each time point membrane blebbing, annexin V-FITC fluorescence in the presence, or upon reintroduction, of calcium, as well as cell survival 12-h poststimulation (Fig. 4). In control solutions, virtually all cells showed annexin V labeling within 30 s of stimulation with BzATP; membrane blebbing lagged annexin V binding by some 30– 60 s (Fig. 4A). All blebs had retracted within 20 min following a 2-min application of BzATP (Fig. 4A). PS flip was reversed by 3 h following brief BzATP application because no annexin V binding was observed at this"

Tgl mutants can be transiently “stimulated” if brought into end-to-end contact with tgl + donor cells. By separating the stimulated recipient cells from donor cells, we found that Tgl protein was transferred from the donors to the rescued recipient cells. Mutants lacking CglB lipoprotein, which is part of a second gliding engine, could also be stimulated, and CglB protein was transferred from donor to recipient cells. The high transfer efficiency of Tgl and CglB proteins suggests that donor and recipient cells briefly fuse their outer membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2024378715,"Neurabin and spinophilin are homologous protein phosphatase 1 and actin binding proteins that regulate dendritic spine function. A yeast two-hybrid analysis using the coiled-coil domain of neurabin revealed an interaction with Lfc, a Rho GEF. Lfc was highly expressed in brain, where it interacted with either neurabin or spinophilin. In neurons, Lfc was largely found in the shaft of dendrites in association with microtubules but translocated to spines upon neuronal stimulation. Moreover, expression of Lfc resulted in reduction in spine length and size. Both the translocation and the effect on spine morphology depended on the coiled-coil domain of Lfc. Coexpression of neurabin or spinophilin with Lfc resulted in their clustering together with F-actin, a process that depended on Rho activity. Thus, interaction between Lfc and neurabin/spinophilin selectively regulates Rho-dependent organization of F-actin in spines and is a link between the microtubule and F-actin cytoskeletons in dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2161101543,"Olfaction is required at birth for survival; however, little is known about the maturation of olfactory cortical circuits. Here we show that in vivo sensory experience mediates the development of excitatory transmission in pyramidal neurons of rat olfactory cortex. We find a postnatal critical period during which there is an experience-dependent increase in the contribution of AMPARs versus NMDARs to transmission at primary sensory synapses but not associational inputs. The shift in receptors underlying transmission is mediated by a strong activity-dependent downregulation of NMDARs and modest increase in AMPARs. Sensory activity leads to a loss of “silent” NMDAR-only synapses and an increase in threshold for inducing long-term plasticity. These results indicate the importance of early olfactory experience in the establishment of cortical circuits and could reflect mechanisms governing early olfactory “imprinting.”"

https://openalex.org/W2034694727,"The structure of a synaptic intermediate of the site-specific recombinase γδ resolvase covalently linked through Ser 10 to two cleaved duplex DNAs has been determined at 3.4 angstrom resolution. This resolvase, activated for recombination by mutations, forms a tetramer whose structure is substantially changed from that of a presynaptic complex between dimeric resolvase and the cleavage site DNA. Because the two cleaved DNA duplexes that are to be recombined lie on opposite sides of the core tetramer, large movements of both protein and DNA are required to achieve strand exchange. The two dimers linked to the DNAs that are to be recombined are held together by a flat interface. This may allow a 180° rotation of one dimer relative to the other in order to reposition the DNA duplexes for strand exchange."

We describe here a structure in curium, Cm III, with monoclinic symmetry, space group C2/c, found at intermediate pressures (between 37 and 56 gigapascals). Ab initio electronic structure calculations agree with the observed sequence of structures and establish that it is the spin polarization of curium's 5f electrons that stabilizes Cm III. The results reveal that curium is one of a few elements that has a lattice structure stabilized by magnetism."
https://openalex.org/W1484201256,"Laminin-5-rich extracellular matrix derived from 804G cells (804G-ECM) engages β1 integrins to induce spreading, improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and increase survival of pancreatic beta cells. The present study examines whether 804G-ECM activates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the involvement of NF-κB in those effects of 804G-ECM on pancreatic beta cells. 804G-ECM induces nuclear translocation and the DNA binding activity of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. 804G-ECM-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was weak as compared with that induced by interleukin-1β. Transient 804G-ECM-induced DNA binding activity of NF-κB (peak at 2 h) and overexpression of NF-κB target genes IκBα and NF-κB1(p105) (peak at 4 h) were observed. When NF-κB was inhibited by an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation (Bay 11-7082) or by a recombinant adenovirus expressing the nonphosphorylatable form of IκBα, 804G-ECM-induced cell spreading and actin cytoskeleton organization were reduced. GSIS from cells on 804G-ECM was inhibited 5-fold, whereas cell survival was not affected. In summary, the results indicate that 804G-ECM induces a transient and moderate NF-κB activity. This study shows for the first time that ECM-induced NF-κB activity is necessary in maintaining GSIS, although it does not affect survival of pancreatic beta cells. The effects of ECM-induced NF-κB activity contrast with the deleterious effects of cytokine-induced NF-κB activity. It is proposed that transient and moderate NF-κB activity is essential for proper function of the pancreatic beta cell. Laminin-5-rich extracellular matrix derived from 804G cells (804G-ECM) engages β1 integrins to induce spreading, improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and increase survival of pancreatic beta cells. The present study examines whether 804G-ECM activates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the involvement of NF-κB in those effects of 804G-ECM on pancreatic beta cells. 804G-ECM induces nuclear translocation and the DNA binding activity of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. 804G-ECM-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was weak as compared with that induced by interleukin-1β. Transient 804G-ECM-induced DNA binding activity of NF-κB (peak at 2 h) and overexpression of NF-κB target genes IκBα and NF-κB1(p105) (peak at 4 h) were observed. When NF-κB was inhibited by an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation (Bay 11-7082) or by a recombinant adenovirus expressing the nonphosphorylatable form of IκBα, 804G-ECM-induced cell spreading and actin cytoskeleton organization were reduced. GSIS from cells on 804G-ECM was inhibited 5-fold, whereas cell survival was not affected. In summary, the results indicate that 804G-ECM induces a transient and moderate NF-κB activity. This study shows for the first time that ECM-induced NF-κB activity is necessary in maintaining GSIS, although it does not affect survival of pancreatic beta cells. The effects of ECM-induced NF-κB activity contrast with the deleterious effects of cytokine-induced NF-κB activity. It is proposed that transient and moderate NF-κB activity is essential for proper function of the pancreatic beta cell. Engagement of cells by cognate components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκBα, IκBβ, inhibitor of NF-κB; IκBαnp, nonphosphorylatable IκBa mutant; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; pLL, poly-l-lysine; PKB, protein kinase B; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; IL, interleukin. is crucial for various biological processes, including cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and gene induction (1Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). This engagement involves cell adhesion mediated by integrins, a family of heterodimeric molecules composed of an α and a β subunit, with a long extracellular domain binding to the ECM, and a short cytoplasmic domain associating with the actin cytoskeleton and affiliated proteins (2Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). ECM is an important component of the pancreatic islet microenvironment. It is a dynamic complex of different molecules that serve as a cellular scaffold regulating both differentiation and survival. Our group has reported recently (3Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that the laminin-5-rich ECM secreted by 804G cells (804G-ECM) induced increased spreading and improved insulin secretion in response to glucose in purified pancreatic beta cells. It was subsequently shown that this ECM has a beneficial effect on cell survival and that it activates intracellular signaling pathways involving the signaling proteins focal adhesion kinase, Akt/PKB, and ERK (4Hammar E. Parnaud G. Bosco D. Perriraz N. Maedler K. Donath M. Rouiller D.G. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has been shown that its effects on pancreatic beta cells (spreading, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and survival) are mediated by the engagement of β1 integrins to laminin-5 (3Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 4Hammar E. Parnaud G. Bosco D. Perriraz N. Maedler K. Donath M. Rouiller D.G. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 2G. Parnaud, unpublished results. Furthermore, it was found that plating pancreatic beta cells on 804G-ECM causes overexpression of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) (4Hammar E. Parnaud G. Bosco D. Perriraz N. Maedler K. Donath M. Rouiller D.G. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which is a well established NF-κB target gene. This finding led us to hypothesize that 804G-ECM might activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to the expression of a subset of genes, which might be involved in the effects of 804G-ECM on the pancreatic beta cell. Engagement of integrins to different ECM molecules (vitronectin, fibronectin, and laminin) has been shown to activate NF-κB (5Reyes-Reyes M. Mora N. Zentella A. Rosales C. J.

However, this has not yet been reported for the pancreatic beta cell nor indeed for primary, nondividing cells. NF-κB is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in many cellular responses to environmental changes, including control of the host immune and inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell migration, development, induction of proliferation, and differentiation (12Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 72-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB remains in the cytoplasm, where it is bound to and inactivated by inhibitory IκB subunits (14Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of the cell (with pro-inflammatory cytokines for example), signaling pathways lead to phosphorylation of the IκB proteins that are subsequently recognized by the ubiquitin ligase machinery and are targeted for degradation. The freed NF-κB heterodimers translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific sequences in the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 12Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB can then be down-regulated by multiple mechanisms, including the well characterized feedback pathway involving newly synthesized IκBα proteins (12Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar, 15Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the pancreatic beta cell, NF-κB is considered as an important transcription factor mediating IL-1β-induced signal transduction and regulating groups of genes contributing to death and dysfunction (17Donath M.Y. Storling J. Maedler K. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 455-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of NF-κB has been shown to protect against the deleterious effects of IL-1β in purified mouse islets (18Rehman K.K. Bertera S. Bottino R. Balamurugan A.N. Mai J.C. Mi Z. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9862-9868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), rat beta cells (19Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leemans R. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and human islets (20Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol.

Metab. 2004; 89: 5059-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given that NF-κB has thus been considered previously to be pro-apoptotic in the beta cell, the possibility that activation of NF-κB signaling by 804G-ECM may be beneficial for beta cell function and/or survival was quite intriguing. The aims of this study were to investigate whether 804G-ECM activates the NF-κB transcriptional activity in primary pancreatic beta cells, to study the kinetics of this activity, and to determine the involvement of this pathway on the effects of 804G-ECM on the pancreatic beta cell. Here we show that 804G-ECM induces transient nuclear translocation of NF-κB and its transcriptional activity in pancreatic beta cells, which is followed by overexpression of IκBα and NF-κB mRNAs. Blocking the MAP kinase ERK pathway with PD98059 inhibited the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and overexpression of IκBα, whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not. We report, for the first time, that long term blockage of NF-κB activity disrupts cytoskeleton remodeling, inhibits spreading induced by 804G-ECM, and reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, we show that induction of NF-κB activity by 804G-ECM is not involved in its control of pancreatic beta cell survival. Reagents and Antibodies—Bay 11-7082 (an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation) was purchased from BioMol Research Laboratories (Hamburg, Germany). PD98059 (a specific MEK1 inhibitor) and LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) were purchased from Calbiochem, and both were used at final concentration of 50 μm as described previously (4Hammar E. Parnaud G. Bosco D. Perriraz N. Maedler K. Donath M. Rouiller D.G. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies against the p65 subunit of NF-κB (C-20) and against the inhibitors of NF-κB(IκBα, C-21; IκBβ, C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-actin was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa Fluor® 546 phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes. Islet Isolation and Beta Cell Purification—All experiments were performed on primary pancreatic beta cells sorted from adult rat islet cells by autofluorescence-activated flow cytometry. Islets of Langerhans were isolated by collagenase digestion of pancreas from male Wistar rats (weighing 150-200 g), followed by Ficoll purification using a modification of procedures described previously (22Rouiller D.G. Cirulli V. Halban P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cell preparation was performed as described previously (3Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Pancreatic beta cells were then separated from non-beta cells by autofluorescence-activated sorting using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, FACStar-Plus (BD Biosciences), as described previously (22Rouiller D.G. Cirulli V. Halban P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This purification procedure yields a population consisting of >95% beta cells (3Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 804G-ECM Matrix Preparation—The 804G cells were the kind gift of Desmos (San Diego, CA). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5.6 mm glucose. At confluence, cells were rinsed and maintained for a further 3 days in the same medium in the absence of fetal calf serum. Conditioned medium (referred to hereafter as 804G-ECM) was collected, centrifuged at 120 × g for 10 min to remove any detached cells and debris, filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter, and frozen at -20 °C for later use. Coating of Plastic Dishes with pLL and 804G-ECM—Aliquots (60 μl) of pLL (0.1 mg/ml) or of 804G-ECM were layered at the center of 35-mm culture Petri dishes (adherent dishes for mammalian cell culture). Dishes were kept in a damp box at 37 °C for 18-20 h before being rinsed three times with sterile H2O and air-dried. Dishes coated with pLL were used as controls. Cell Culture—Sorted beta cells were washed twice in 10-15 ml of sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 11.2 mm glucose, 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 110 units/ml penicillin, 110 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 130 × g. Aliquots of 3 × 105 cells were seeded in nonadherent 100-mm diameter Petri dishes containing 9 ml of medium. Cells were then incubated for 20 h at 37 °C to allow full recovery of any cell surface molecules that may have been lost or damaged during islet isolation or cell purification. After recovery, cells were resuspended at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml, and aliquots of 50 μl were plated as droplets on plastic dishes coated with pLL or with 804G-ECM. NF-κB Activation—The cellular localization of NF-κB in various conditions was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (5 min, room temperature), and immunofluorescence for NF-κB was performed. The percentage of cells with dominant nuclear NF-κB staining was determined (five different fields were examined for each condition). DNA binding activity of NF-κB was quantified using an ELISA-based kit (Trans-AM NF-κB p65 from Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) using attached oligonucleotides corresponding to an NF-κB consensus site and detected by an anti-p65 subunit antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—To analyze IκBα and IκBβ protein expression, attached cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors and lysed in sample buffer 1× (62 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein concentrations were determined with the Amido Black method (23Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of total protein were loaded for SDS-PAGE. All samples, after separation on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody. An ECL protein detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a Kodak image station were used for visualization of the bands. Quantitative Real Time PCR—RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II (Invitrogen), using 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction volume. The double-stranded DNA-specific dye SYBR Green I (Eurogentech, Belgium) and fluorescein (Bio-Rad) were incorporated into the PCR buffer (qPCR core kit, Eurogentech) to allow for quantitative detection of the PCR product. The results were analyzed using the iCycler iQ System (Bio-Rad). The housekeeping gene L3 was used as an internal control. The primers used were as follows: NF-κB forward 5′ GTC TAG CAA TCA CGG CTG CA 3′, NF-κB reverse 5′ CTC AAG CCA CCA TAC CCC AA 3′; IκBα forward 5′ TGC TGA GGC ACT TCT GAA AGC 3′,IκBα reverse 5′ TCC TCG AAA GTC TCG GAG GTC 3′. Inhibition of NF-κB Activity—Two approaches were used to inhibit NF-κB activity as follows: use of recombinant adenoviruses expressing GFP (control virus) or mutated nondegradable IκBα (IκBαnp), and pharmacological inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation with Bay 11-7082 (24Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviruses were a kind gift from Dr. Wrede, University of Regensburg, Germany (19Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leemans R. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Cardozo A.K. Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Leeman R. Kutlu B. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48879-48886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The adenoviruses were titrated using Adeno-X™ Rapid Titer kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (105 cells/ml) were infected in suspension for 2 h at 37 °C with 2300 infectious units/ml, washed twice with culture medium, and left in suspension for 24 h before plating them on pLL or on 804G-ECM-coated dishes. To investigate the effect of the inhibition of NF-κB activity using Bay 11-7082, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 2.5 and 5 μm Bay 11-7082 before plating them on pLL- or on 804G-ECM-coated dishes. Me2SO was added to the controls at the same final concentration as used for the inhibitors. Cells were then cultured in the continued presence of the inhibitor. The analyses of the effects of IκBαnp-expressing virus and of Bay 11-7082 on NF-κB nuclear translocation, cell spreading, cell function (insulin secretion), and cellular death were performed in parallel. Measurement of Spreading of Cells—After 24 h of culture and treatment of cells as described above, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature) and stained with Evans Blue. Phase-contrast views of different fields were photographed, and spreading of cells was quantified using ScionImage™ software (Frederick, MD). F-actin Cytoskeleton Visualization—After 24 h of culture and treatment of cells as described above, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (4 min at room temperature). After blocking with PBS + 0.5% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor® 546 phalloidin (5 units/ml), subsequently rinsed, and mounted under glass coverslips. The preparations were observed with a confocal microscope. Analysis of Cell Death by TUNEL—Attached cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature). After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 (5 min, room temperature), the TUNEL assay (with fluorescein-dUTP detecting the free 3-OH strand breaks resulting from DNA degradation) was performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The preparations were then rinsed with PBS and incubated (15 min, room temperature) with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 to allow detection of nuclei and to facilitate the analysis. The quantification of dead cells was performed by using an Axiocam fluorescence microscope. Insulin Secretion Assay and Insulin Content—Cells were washed three times with a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH: 125 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 2.8 mm glucose and preincubated with this same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with KRBH containing 2.8 mm glucose (basal secretion), followed by 1 h at 37 °C with KRBH containing 16.7 mm glucose (stimulated secretion). The incubation buffer was recovered, and the cells were extracted with acid/ethanol. The buffer was centrifuged to remove any detached cells and debris. Aliquots were stored at -20 °C for subsequent insulin measurement performed by radioimmunoassay using the charcoal separation technique described previously (26Herbert V. Lau K.S. Gottlieb C.W. Bleicher S.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1965; 25: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). GSIS is expressed as secreted insulin upon glucose challenge (16.7 mm glucose, for 1 h), as a percentage of insulin content. Insulin content is expressed as the quantity of insulin extracted at the end of the stimulation test. The total protein levels after 24 h of culture in all conditions used were quantified using the Amido Black method (23Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar), as described above. Presentation of Data and Statistical Analysis—Unless stated otherwise, data are presented as mean ± S.E. for “n” independent experiments, and levels of significance for differences between groups were assessed by Student's t test for unpaired groups. 804G-ECM Induces NF-κB Nuclear Translocation—This study was performed with laminin-5-rich extracellular matrix derived from 804G rat bladder carcinoma cells (804G-ECM). 804G-ECM induces attachment and spreading of rat primary beta cells, because of engagement of β1 integrins by laminin-5 contained in this ECM (3Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 4Hammar E. Parnaud G. Bosco D. Perriraz N. Maedler K. Donath M. Rouiller D.G. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 804G-ECM is thus used as a validated model to study signaling pathways activated by this engagement. In the canonical NF-κB pathway, one of the first steps involved in NF-κB-dependent gene regulation is the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα)), leading to the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (RelA). To investigate a possible involvement of 804G-ECM in NF-κB transcriptional activity, the cellular localization of NF-κB after short term exposure (1 h) to 804G-ECM compared with control (pLL-coated dishes) was assessed by immunofluorescence for the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 1A). The number of cells with nuclear NF-κB localization was quantified (Fig. 1B). 804G-ECM induced a significant increase in the number of cells with nuclear NF-κB (19%) compared with control (less than 5%, Fig. 1B). The cytoplasmic staining for NF-κB was still apparent in all cells on 804G-ECM, suggesting that only a fraction of the total pool of cytoplasmic NF-κB is translocated into the nucleus in response to 804G-ECM (Fig. 1A). By contrast, treatment of cells for 20 min with 2 ng/ml IL-1β induced the nuclear translocation of p65 in all treated cells, and this was complete as there was no more cytoplasmic staining for NF-κB (not shown). 804G-ECM Induces NF-κB Transcriptional Activity—To assess whether DNA binding activity of NF-κB is induced by 804G-ECM, the amount of p65 complexes binding to oligonucleotides containing an NF-κB consensus binding site was quantified by ELISA. The DNA binding activity of NF-κB in cells cultured on 804G-ECM-coated dishes as compared with control was increased after 1 h of culture, and this increase was significant after 2 h of culture (Fig. 2). This activity was decreased after 4 h of culture suggesting that 804G-ECM-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity is transient. It is well established that activated NF-κB induces expression of IκBα. Newly synthesized IκBα binds to NF-κB, providing a negative feedback loop for the NF-κB signaling pathway (12Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB is also able to induce the expression of NF-κB1 (p105) in several systems (11de Fougerolles A.R. Chi-Rosso G. Bajardi A. Gotwals P. Green C.D. Koteliansky V.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Tian B. Brasier A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2003; 58: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate whether 804G-ECM is able to induce NF-κB transcriptional activity, IκBα and NF-κB1 mRNA levels were quantified by real time PCR in cells cultured on pLL- or on 804G-ECM-coated dishes. IκBα mRNA levels were increased after 2 h on 804G-ECM, and both IκBα and NF-κB1 mRNA levels were significantly increased by 804G-ECM after 4 and 8 h of culture to return to control (pLL) levels at 24 h (Fig. 3, A and B). The kinetics of 804G-ECM-induced IκBα and NF-κB1 gene expression thus correlate with those of NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 2). In summary, these data indicate that 804G-ECM induces NF-κB transcriptional activity transiently, most probably as a consequence of feedback inhibition resulting from increased expression of IκBα. Regulation of IκBα and IκBβ Protein Levels by 804G-ECM—To investigate whether 804G-ECM induces IκBα and/or IκBβ degradation, Western blots were performed with protein extracts from cells cultured for 1 h on pLL or on 804G-ECM-coated dishes. Quantification of the resulting bands normalized to actin showed that there was no significant decrease of IκBα and IκBβ protein levels on 804G-ECM as compared with pLL after 1 h of culture (Fig. 4). IκBα and IκBβ protein levels were also analyzed after 24 h of culture on pLL- or on 804G-ECM-coated dishes. Levels of IκBα protein were significantly increased on 804G-ECM after 24 h of culture as compared with pLL and as compared with 804G-ECM after 1 h of culture (Fig. 4). By contrast, IκBβ protein levels were not altered with time or by the substrate used. Although NF-κB induces expression of IκBα, it does not control expression of IκBβ (28Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that the 804G-ECM-induced IκBα overexpression occurs specifically through NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB Activity; Effects on Spreading and Actin Cytoskeleton Remodeling—To investigate the function of the 804G-ECM-induced NF-κB activity, Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation and thus of NF-κB nuclear translocation (24Pierce J.W.

Bay 11-7082 induced a dose-dependent decrease of 804G-ECM-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation, and a final concentration of 5 μm of Bay 11-7082 was necessary to induce a complete and significant decrease compared with control condition (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed when the effect of this inhibitor on 804G-ECM-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity was assessed by ELISA (not shown). Furthermore, Bay 11-7082 inhibited overexpression of IκBα mRNA induced by 804G-ECM, thus confirming that it inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (Fig. 8B). We have shown previously (3Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that 804G-ECM induces spreading of the pancreatic beta cell, and this effect is glucose-dependent.

First introduced into China in the 1980s, the nanoresearch movement has been picking up momentum there. As growth in this technical arena accelerates and the vast technological and commercial stakes become more apparent, China has been embracing and supporting its own efforts with ever more vigor. In his roles as a pioneer researcher in Chinese nanoscience and as a prominent and powerful voice in China9s scientific community, Chunli Bai has been instrumental in ushering his country into the front lines of this now global technical framework that some have likened to a modern-day industrial revolution. Although China has yet to invest as much in this coming nano era as have countries such as the United States and Japan, its researchers are contributing increasingly more consequential discoveries and advances. In time, predicts Dr. Bai, China will be among those countries most influential in determining how the coming era of nanoscience and nanotechnology unfolds.

https://openalex.org/W2032649908,"Arginine methylation can affect both nucleocytoplasmic transport and protein-protein interactions of RNA-binding proteins. These effects are seen in cells that lack the yeast hnRNP methyltransferase (HMT1), raising the question of whether effects on specific proteins are direct or indirect. The presence of multiple arginines in individual methylated proteins also raises the question of whether overall methylation or methylation of a subset of arginines affects protein function. We have used the yeast mRNA-binding protein Npl3 to address these questions in vivo. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry was used to identify 17 methylated arginines in Npl3 purified from yeast: whereas 10 Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) tripeptides were exclusively dimethylated, variable levels of methylation were found for 5 RGG and 2 RG motif arginines. We constructed a set of Npl3 proteins in which subsets of the RGG arginines were mutated to lysine. Expression of these mutant proteins as the sole form of Npl3 specifically affected growth of a strain that requires Hmt1. Although decreased growth generally correlated with increased numbers of Arg-to-Lys mutations, lysine substitutions in the N terminus of the RGG domain showed more severe effects. Npl3 with all 15 RGG arginines mutated to lysine exited the nucleus independent of Hmt1, indicating a direct effect of methylation on Npl3 transport. These mutations also resulted in a decreased, methylation-independent interaction of Npl3 with transcription elongation factor Tho2 and inhibited Npl3 self-association. These results support a model in which arginine methylation facilitates Npl3 export directly by weakening contacts with nuclear proteins.

Protein-arginine methylation by type I methyltransferases, which add one or two methyl groups to one of the guanidino nitrogens of arginine, has been shown to affect a number of eukaryotic processes including protein transport, transcription, and cell signaling (reviewed in Refs. 1Bedford M.T.

Although many substrates for arginine methyltransferases are RNA-binding proteins, to date methylation has been shown to have only relatively minor effects on the affinity of target proteins for RNA (4Rajpurohit R.

STKE. 2005; 2005: re2PubMed Google Scholar). The observation of both positive and negative effects of arginine methylation on protein-protein interactions has led to models for roles of arginine methylation in cell signaling and transcription, through the modification of histones, RNA-binding proteins, signaling proteins, and proteins involved in transcription (1Bedford M.T.

Karn J. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of hnRNPs and related messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins have revealed an intricate and evolving picture of nuclear mRNA metabolism from transcription to processing to nuclear export (10Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Methylation has been implicated in the movement of hnRNP proteins across the nuclear envelope. In mammalian cells, arginine methylation has been linked to nucleocytoplasmic distribution of hnRNPA2 (11Nichols R.C. Wang X.W. Tang J. Hamilton B.J. High F.A. Herschman H.R. Rigby W.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of the predominant arginine methyltransferase, termed Hmt1 or Rmt1, inhibits nuclear export of hnRNP-like proteins (12Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 13Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The molecular interactions underlying these effects of arginine methylation on protein transport, however, remain to be elucidated. The yeast hnRNP-like protein Npl3, a known Hmt1 substrate (14Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), provides an excellent system for exploring these mechanisms, because of its extensive arginine-glycinerich domain. Npl3 is a major yeast mRNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (16Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Paddy M.R. Swedlow J.R. Swanson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Flach J. Bossie M. Vogel J. Corbett A. Jinks T. Willins D.A. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8399-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although it is predominantly nuclear at steady state, Npl3 has been implicated in processes in both compartments, from linking transcription and mRNA export (18Lei E.P. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Yu M.C. Bachand F. McBride A.E. Komili S. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to acting as a translational repressor (20Windgassen M. Sturm D. Cajigas I.J. Gonzalez C.I. Seedorf M. Bastians H. Krebber H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10479-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Npl3 contains two central RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal domain rich in arginine (R) and glycine (G), including 15 RGG tripeptides that are likely targets for arginine methylation (21Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas a number of mutations within the RRMs of Npl3 block mRNA export (22Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the C terminus plays a role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of Npl3 (17Flach J. Bossie M. Vogel J. Corbett A. Jinks T. Willins D.A. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8399-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The initial discovery of a genetic interaction between the temperature-sensitive npl3-1 allele and a null allele of HMT1 (14Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), led to experiments showing that Hmt1 facilitates nuclear export of Npl3 (12Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction of Npl3 with two nuclear proteins, Npl3 itself and transcription elongation factor Tho2, is decreased by the presence of the arginine methyltransferase (19Yu M.C. Bachand F. McBride A.E. Komili S. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These interactions, combined with the recruitment of both Npl3 and Hmt1 to actively transcribed genes (18Lei E.P. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Yu M.C. Bachand F. McBride A.E. Komili S. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggest that Npl3 and Hmt1 may be involved in linking transcription and mRNA export. The export of mRNA from the nucleus is a critical step in gene expression and increasing evidence points to the coordination of numerous proteins and complexes to guide a pre-mRNA from the site of its transcription to the site of translation. For example, components of the THO complex (Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1, Thp2), which is implicated in transcription elongation (24Chavez S. Beilharz T. Rondon A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), interact with RNA-binding proteins Yra1 and Sub2 in a conserved protein complex named TREX (transcription-export), which has been linked to mRNA export (25Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Like the TREX components, Npl3 interacts with numerous nuclear proteins. In addition to self-associating and interacting with Tho2 in the absence of methylation, Npl3 isolated from wild-type cells co-purifies with the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC; Ref. 26Shen E.C. Stage-Zimmermann T. Chui P. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23718-23724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), RNA polymerase II (18Lei E.P. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), 3′-end processing factor Hrp1 (27Xu C. Henry M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10742-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a number of other proteins involved in mRNA metabolism (28Hurt E. Luo M.J. Rother S. Reed R. Strasser K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nuclear export of Hrp1 was recently shown to depend on the methylation of Npl3 (27Xu C. Henry M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10742-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). With a plethora of factors influencing mRNA export, a key question remains: how are intermolecular interactions controlled over the lifetime of an mRNA, first in the formation of appropriate mRNP complexes at the site of transcription and then in the remodeling of these complexes to facilitate mRNA processing and export. Initial studies investigating the role of Npl3 arginine methylation compared cells with wild-type HMT1 to cells either lacking HMT1 or expressing an inactive enzyme (12Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Yu M.C. Bachand F. McBride A.E. Komili S. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3128-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The intriguing phenotypes seen in such studies and the numerous targets for arginine methylation raise two questions. First, are the effects of removing the methyltransferase direct, through eliminating Npl3 methylation, or indirect, through eliminating methylation of other substrates? Second, given the presence of an extensive arginine-glycine-rich domain in Npl3, is overall methylation of the domain or methylation of a subset of arginines important for protein function? We have used mass spectrometry, mutagenesis and assays for Npl3 activity, transport, and protein-protein interactions to address these questions in vivo. Here we present mass spectrometric evidence for methylation of all arginines within RGG tripeptides and of two arginines in RG dipeptides, with variable levels of methylation detected for at least five locations. We present evidence that overall methylation is important for protein function through the introduction of systematic arginine-to-lysine mutations in RGG tripeptides followed by tests of Npl3 function in a yeast strain that requires Hmt1. We also describe experiments that suggest that arginine methylation has a direct effect on Npl3 export, its self-association and its interaction with Tho2, through the use of a mutant Npl3 protein with all RGG arginines changed to lysines (Npl3-RK1-15). These data support a model in which methylation directly affects Npl3 export by weakening contacts with nuclear proteins. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains were grown and genetic manipulations performed as previously described (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

YAM505 (npl3Δ cbp80Δ) was obtained by mating YAM159 (cbp80Δ) and PSY814 (npl3Δ). The strains used for mass spectrometric analysis, which express the protein A (PrA)-Npl3 fusion protein as the sole form of Npl3, were constructed by transforming the PrA-Npl3 plasmid pPS2389 into npl3Δ (PSY814) and npl3Δhmt1Δ (PSY1943), respectively, and selecting for loss of the URA3 maintenance plasmid, resulting in strains YAM569 and YAM570.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourcenup49-313MATα nup49::TRP1 ade2 ade3 ura3 leu2 his3 + pUN100-nup49ts-LEU2(62Doye V.

Oligonucleotides used for plasmid construction and sequencing were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. and are shown in Table III. Mutations that result in arginine-to-lysine substitutions within RGG tripeptides (RK mutations) were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). The seven oligonucleotide primer pairs that targeted RGG arginines 1–14 introduced two RK substitution mutations while the final pair (RK15, RK16) mutated the fifteenth RGG arginine. All primers also introduced silent base pair changes that resulted in restriction sites for identification of positive clones. The order of primer pairs used was RK9/10, RK7/8, RK5/6, RK 1/2, RK3a/RK4a, RK11/12, RK13/14, RK15/16. All mutations were verified after each round of mutagenesis by sequencing the 3′-end of NPL3 (including the entire RGG coding region and 3′-untranslated region); the entire NPL3 open reading frame was sequenced in the final npl3-RK1-15 plasmid, pAM409. The only additional mutation detected in this region was the insertion of an extra T in a stretch of 10 T nucleotides in the 3′-untranslated region in plasmids pAM407-pAM409. Given the identical growth phenotypes conferred by pAM407 and its precursor pAM406, this insertion is likely to be silent. In addition, removal of the additional T from pAM409 through subcloning resulted in a plasmid that expressed the same levels of PrA-Npl3-RK1-15 as pAM409. The GFP-npl3-RK15 plasmid, pAM420, was constructed by subcloning a 1-kb HindIII fragment from pAM409 into HindIII-digested pPS811.Table IIPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidFeaturesSourcepAM399CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK7-10 AmpRThis studypAM400CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK5-10 AmpRThis studypAM402CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK1-2,5-10 AmpRThis studypAM404CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK5-12 AmpRThis studypAM405CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK1-10 AmpRThis studypAM406CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK5-14 AmpRThis studypAM407CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK1-12 AmpRThis studypAM408CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK1-14 AmpRThis studypAM409CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK1-15 AmpRThis studypAM4202μ URA3 pGal GFP-npl3-RK1-15 AmpRThis studypAM421URA3 NPL3 integrating AmpRThis studypAM422URA3 npl3-RK1-15 integrating AmpRThis studypAM423URA3 NPL3-myc integrating AmpRThis studypAM424URA3 npl3-RK1-15-myc integrating AmpRThis studypAM431CEN LEU pNop-PrA-npl3-RK1-6 AmpRThis studypNOPPATACEN LEU pNop-PrA AmpR vector(36Hellmuth K.

This plasmid, containing the last 175 codons of the NPL3 open reading frame, was linearized by HindIII digestion and transformed into PSY3210 and PSY3211. Ura+ colonies (YAM538 and YAM540) were tested for proper integration by PCR and sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed either at the University of Maine at Orono DNA sequencing facility or GeneGateway. Similarly, the KpnI-BamHI fragment from pPS2389 was subcloned into pRS306 (resulting in pAM421), linearized with HindIII, and integrated into Myc-tagged THO2 strains to produce wild-type NPL3 control strains YAM537 and YAM539. Genomic Myc-tagged NPL3 and npl3-RK1-15 strains (YAM533-536) were produced by the same strategy with integrating plasmids pAM423 and pAM424. These plasmids were constructed by ligating the 481-bp KpnI-NsiI fragment from pPS2389 or pAM420 and the ∼300-bp NsiI-BamHI fragment from pPS430 (which contains a Myc tag inserted into the PmlI site at the 3′-end of the NPL3 open reading frame; (17Flach J.

Npl3 Purification for Mass Spectrometry—PrA-Npl3 was purified from HMT1 and hmt1Δ cells according to published protocols (31Siniossoglou S. Grandi P. Hurt E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 159-164Google Scholar). In brief, spheroplasts were prepared from either wild-type (YAM569) or hmt1Δ (YAM570) cells expressing PrA-Npl3, stored at –20 °C overnight and lysed by Dounce homogenization in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin). To affinity purify PrA-Npl3, IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with clarified lysates at 4 °C for 1.5–2 h and, after extensive washing, Npl3 was eluted using the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease or PrA-Npl3 was eluted with acetic acid. Npl3 protein was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (15%, v/v), resolved by SDS-PAGE and observed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or zinc staining (Bio-Rad zinc stain kit). Proteolytic Digests and MALDI-FTMS Analysis—PrA-Npl3 or Npl3 was excised from gels, destained with 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid (Coomassie Blue stain) or Bio-Rad zinc destain solution (according to the manufacturer's instructions) prior to proteolytic digestion. In-gel trypsin digests were performed according to the UCSF in-gel digest procedure 2UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility (2004) UCSF in-gel digest procedure. URL: donatello.ucsf.edu/ingel.html (accessed 7/27/2004). using 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Sigma) in 25 mm ammonium carbonate. Chymotryptic digests of purified protein (in-gel) or tryptic fragments were performed in 25 mm ammonium carbonate (pH ∼7.8) or in 100 mm Tris-HCl/10 mm CaCl2 with a 1:20 to 1:200 chymotrypsin (Sigma) to substrate ratio. Reactions were stopped by boiling digests or adding formic acid to a final total volume of 5%. Digests were incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C overnight. After incubation, each digest solution was removed, and the remaining peptides extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. Digest solutions and extracts were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at –20 °C. Some digests were further purified with C18 Zip Tips® (Millipore). For mass spectrometric analysis, dried peptides were diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile and loaded onto a MALDI probe tip with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix (1 m in 50% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) or 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (HPA) matrix (0.5 m in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Some DHB matrix solutions also contained 0.5 m fructose or fucose. Samples were analyzed using a HiResMALDI Fourier transform mass spectrometer (IonSpec, Lake Forest, CA) with a Cryomagnetics (Oak Ridge, TN) 4.7 Tesla actively shielded superconducting magnet using conditions that have been described previously (33Stemmler E.A. Provencher H.L. Guiney M.E. Gardner N.P. Dickinson P.S. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 3594-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples were calibrated by internal calibration techniques using polypropylene glycol 725 and 2000 (Sigma Aldrich), using a modified version (33Stemmler E.A. Provencher H.L. Guiney M.E. Gardner N.P. Dickinson P.S. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 3594-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of the internal calibration on adjacent samples (InCAS) technique (34O'Connor P.B. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5881-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The high resolution and internal calibration techniques permitted analysis of peptide methylation using single or multiple shifts of 14.01565 (monomethylation) or 28.03130 (dimethylation) mass units with respect to peaks in the spectrum of the unmethylated digested protein, or with respect to predicted peptide masses. The unique loss of dimethylamine (45.05785 Da) provided confirmation for an asymmetrically dimethylated arginine residue. The matrix HPA reduced metastable decay, and samples were analyzed using both matrices. Data were analyzed using peptide masses predicted using Protein Prospector MS-Digest (35Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), with exact mass calculations made using the IonSpec software and Microsoft Excel. Functional Analysis of Mutant Npl3 Proteins—npl3Δ (PSY814) and npl3Δcbp80Δ (YAM505) strains were transformed with the indicated PrA-Npl3 plasmids or with the pNOPPATA PrA vector plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W2152906228,"An important site of cellular damage in bacterial sepsis is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which we proposed is caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated by activation of signaling through specific toll-like receptors (TLR). In wild-type (Wt) mice injected with heat-inactivated E. coli, hepatic TLR4 and TLR2 proteins were up-regulated with TLR-dependent increases in transcript levels for tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6, nitric oxide synthase-II (iNOS), and NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2). The accompanying stress significantly depleted hepatic mtDNA despite eight- and fourfold increases in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) expression, respectively. The identical E. coli dose generated significantly less TNF-alpha, NO, and Nox2 in TLR4-/- and TLR2/4-/- but not in TLR2-/- mice. TLR4-/- and TLR2/4-/- compared with Wt mice were protected from mtDNA oxidation but showed no Tfam up-regulation and little copy number restoration. A critical role in the mtDNA damage was determined for TLR4-mediated iNOS transcription through the MyD88 pathway. In Wt mice, mtDNA depletion was avoided by selective iNOS blockade, and residual mtDNA loss was linked to NF-kappaB-dependent TNF-alpha expression. These data disclose the dual role of TLR4 in mtDNA damage and compensatory mitochondrial biogenic responses after innate immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2039988650,"In this study we showed that stimulation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) activates endogenous transient receptor potential-canonical, subtype 6 (TRPC6), channels in neuronal PC12D cells. Activation of TRPC6 channels is correlated with the formation of a multiprotein complex containing M1 mAChRs, TRPC6 channels, and protein kinase C (PKC). Formation of the M1 mAChR-TRPC6-PKC complex is transient, with highest levels reached ∼2 min after stimulation of M1 mAChRs. PKC in the complex phosphorylates TRPC6 on a conserved serine residue in the carboxyl-terminal domain (Ser768 in the TRPC6A isoform and Ser714 in the TRPC6B isoform). The immunophilin FKBP12, the phosphatase calcineurin, and Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin are also recruited to the M1 mAChR-TRPC6-PKC complex following activation of M1 mAChRs and remain stably associated with the TRPC6 channels after M1 mAChRs and PKC have disassociated. Binding of FKBP12, calcineurin, and calmodulin to TRPC6 channels is blocked by the following: 1) inhibition of PKC; 2) mutation of the PKC phosphorylation site (Ser7168/714) in the channels; or 3) pretreatment with FK506 or rapamycin, immunosuppressants that directly bind FKBP12. Inhibition of FKBP12 binding blocks the dephosphorylation of TRPC6 channels and the disassociation of M1 mAChRs, without affecting disassociation of PKC. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A also blocks the dephosphorylation of TRPC6 and prevents the disassociation of M1 mAChRs. Together, these results show that activated TRPC6 channels form the center of a dynamic multiprotein complex that includes PKC and calcineurin, which respectively phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the channels. Phosphorylation of the TRPC6 channels by PKC is required for the binding of FKBP12, which in turn is required for the binding of calcineurin and calmodulin. Subsequent dephosphorylation of the channels by calcineurin is required for the disassociation of M1 mAChRs.

Ca2+ channels that open in response to the depletion of ER Ca2+ stores are often referred to as store-operated channels (SOCs) (8Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In addition to SOCs, there are Ca2+-permeable channels that are activated by Gq-coupled receptors independently of the depletion of ER Ca2+ stores. There is currently wide interest in identifying the molecular components of both types of channels and determining the mechanisms by which they are activated and inhibited.During the last 10 years, cDNAs encoding seven mammalian homologs of Drosophila transient receptor potential and transient receptor potential-like channels have been isolated by molecular cloning (9Minke B.

We showed previously that Ca2+ influx and PKC activation are the major upstream intracellular events required for the activation of the immediate-early genes zif268 and c-fos in these cells (32Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate in more detail how M1 mAChRs regulate the influx of extracellular Ca2+.Our preliminary studies revealed that stimulation of M1 mAChRs activates Ca2+ influx via both Ca2+ store-dependent and -independent pathways. 2T.

Kim, and D. Saffen, submitted for publication.3L. Zhang, F. Guo, J. Y. Kim, and D. Saffen, submitted for publication. The Ca2+ store-dependent pathway is the major Ca2+ influx pathway activated by carbachol and is also activated by thapsigargin, which empties intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump. This influx pathway is mediated by as-yet-unidentified SOCs that are (i) permeable to Mn2+, (ii) impermeable to Ba2+, (iii) not inhibited by PKC, (iv) not activated by the DAG analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, (v) active for at least 30 min in the continuous presence of carbachol, and (vi) slow to inactivate following inhibition of M1 mAChR with the mAChR antagonist atropine. (The SOCs become inactive as the ER Ca2+ stores refill.) By contrast, the Ca2+-store independent pathway depends upon channels that are (i) impermeable to Mn2+, (ii) permeable to Ba2+, (iii) potently inhibited by PKC, (iv) activated by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, (v) active for only 2-3 min in the continuous presence of carbachol, and (vi) rapidly inactivated following inhibition of M1 mAChR with atropine. The Ca2+ store-independent channels, but not the SOCs, are blocked in PC12D cells expressing TRPC6 antisense RNA or a TRPC6 amino-terminal peptide, both shown previously (33Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to inhibit TRPC6 channels exogenously expressed in COS-7 cells.The goal of the experiments described in this paper was to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which M1 mAChRs regulate endogenous TRPC6 channels in PC12D cells. These studies show that activation of M1 mAChRs induces the transient formation of a multiprotein complex containing M1 mAChRs, TRPC6, and PKC. The immunophilin FKBP12, the phosphatase calcineurin, and the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin are also recruited into this complex but maintain an association with TRPC6 after M1 mAChRs and PKC disassociate. TRPC6 channels in the complex are sequentially phosphorylated by PKC and dephosphorylated by calcineurin during the first 5 min following activation of M1 mAChRs. Phosphorylation of the channels by PKC is required for the recruitment of FKBP12, calcineurin, and calmodulin to the complex. The recruitment of activated calcineurin is required for channel dephosphorylation and the disassociation of M1 mAChRs. These novel findings provide a new framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which TRPC6 channels are regulated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Carbamylcholine (carbachol), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), GF109203X (3-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-indolyl]-3(3-indolyl)-maleimide), and atropine were purchased from Calbiochem. FK506, cyclosporin A, and rapamycin were obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Rabbit anti-TRPC6 antibodies raised against a 12-amino acid peptide (788QGHKKGFQEDAE799) at the carboxyl terminus of rat TRPC6 were purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (33Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for conventional PKC-α, M1 mAChR, and calcineurin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate antibodies (specific for phosphoserine residues within proteins containing a hydrophobic amino acid at position +1 and arginine/lysine at positions -2 and/or +2) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-FKBP12 antibodies were from Pharmingen, and anti-calmodulin antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA).Cell Culture—PC12D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 0.16% sodium bicarbonate, 3.6 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 45 ng/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 as described previously (32Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Measurement of Ba2+ Influx—Fifty to 75% confluent PC12D cells were loaded with Fura 2-AM (Calbiochem; 2 μm in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES (KRH) buffer: 6 mm HEPES-NaOH, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 2 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 6 mm glucose (pH 7.4)) for 90 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells in individual wells were gently washed four times with nominally Ca2+-free KRH buffer and immediately used for Ba2+ influx measurements. Changes in intracellular fluorescence were measured in individual cells or small groups of cells using a calcium imaging system comprising a Leica DMIRB inverted microscope equipped with a Lambda G-4 xenon light source (175 watts) and Lambda 10-2 filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and Orca-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). Hardware and date collection were performed using OPENLAB 3 imaging software (Improvision, Lexington, MA) running on a Macintosh G4 computer. Fura-2-loaded cells were stimulated with 340 nm light at 0.5-s intervals, and fluorescence was recorded at 510 nm. Data processing and graphing were carried out using Microsoft Excel.Preparation of siRNAs and Transfection of PC12D Cells—Total cellular RNA from PC12D cells or rat brain was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For each siRNA preparation, 1 μg of purified RNA was treated with DNA-Free (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove genomic DNA prior to use as a template for cDNA synthesis using the reagents in the SuperScript One-step PCR kit (Invitrogen), according to the directions of the manufacturers. RT and PCR amplifications were carried out in the same tubes using a Bio-Rad Thermocycler. PCR primers were designed to amplify segments of the TRPC2 and TRPC6B cDNAs that lack sequence homology to each other and to rat TRPC1, -C3, -C4, -C5, and -C7 cDNAs. A T7 promoter sequence (underlined) 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ was included in each of the primers to allow the amplified PCR products to be used as templates for in vitro synthesis of double-stranded (ds) RNA. Primers designed to amplify cDNA segments encoding amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of TRPC6B were as follows: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTAAGAAATGGATGTCTGA-3′ (C6-N forward primer 1); 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCTTGTTTCGACTCTAAAGA-3′ (C6-N reverse primer 1); 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATGAAAACAGACTGACTCA-3′ (C6-C forward primer 2); and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAGCTGGATGGTTGAGAATA-3′ (C6-C reverse primer 2). Primers designed to amplify cDNA segments encoding amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of TRPC2 were as follows: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTCGCCCAACTGGACTGAGA-3′ (C2-N forward primer 1); 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCCAGGGCAATGTACTGAGG-3′ (C2-N reverse primer 1); 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCTGGGCAACAGACTGACAG-3′ (C2-C forward primer 2), and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCTTGGTCTCCAGATCTTC-3′ (C2-C reverse primer 2). Reaction mixes contained the following: 1× RT-PCR Reaction buffer, 1 μg of purified PC12D RNA, 200 nm forward primer, 200 nm reverse primer, 1 μl of RT/Platinum Taq Mix, and nuclease-free water added to obtain a final volume of 50 μl. The temperature cycling program for the RT and PCR steps was as follows: 1× (45 °C for 30 min; 94 °C for 2 min), 5× (94 °C for 15 s; 45 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 60 s), 35× (94 °C for 15 s; 50 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 60 s), 1× (72 °C for 10 min), and 1× (4 °C overnight). Following isolation by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 20 μl of nuclease-free water, the PCR products were used to generate siRNAs using reagents in the Dicer siRNA generation kit (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc, San Diego, CA), according to the directions of the manufacturer. Briefly, double-stranded RNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of PCRs product using T7 RNA polymerase, treated with DNase to remove the PCR templates, purified by precipitating with LiCl and washing with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. siRNAs were generated from the double-stranded RNAs by digestion with Dicer, purified using columns provided in the kit, and quantified by measuring the absorption at 260 nm.Plasmid Construction—Rat TRPC6B cDNA lacking a stop codon was obtained by PCR amplification from pEF-BOS-TRPC6B (33Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-ATGAGCCGGGGTAATGAAAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCTGCGGCTTTCCTCTTGTTT-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The TRPC6B insert was excised by EcoRI digestion and cloned in EcoRI-digested pCMV-Tag5A (Stratagene), which encodes a “Myc” tag downstream from the EcoRI restriction site. Digestion with HindIII was used to screen for correct insertions of the insert, yielding the plasmid pCMV-TRPC6B-myc. The codon for Ser714 was converted to GCT (encoding alanine) using the “QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit” (Stratagene) with the forward primer 5′-CCCTTCAATCTTGTGCCAGCTCCAAAGTGCCTGCTTTATCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGATAAAGCAGGGACTTTGGAGCTGGCACAAGATTGAAGGGG-3′. Briefly, 50 ng of pCMV-TRPC6B-myc was used as template for PCR amplification with 125 ng (each) forward and reverse primers and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1× (95 °C for 30 s) and 16× (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min). The reaction mix was cooled on ice for 2 min and treated with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. One μl of DpnI-treated DNA was introduced into transformation-competent DH5-alpha cells (Invitrogen) and kanamycin-resistant colonies isolated by culturing on agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Plasmids recovered from the bacteria were screened for the presence of the mutation by DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing of the entire TRPC6B-myc coding segment of pEF-CMV-TRPC6B-S714A confirmed that the sequence was identical to the wild-type TRPC6B isoform, except for the Ser714 codon (AGT), which was changed to a codon for alanine (GCT).Transfection of PC12D Cells—siRNAs were transfected into PC12D cells using Oligofectamine Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells cultivated to ∼50% confluency in Cellstar 6-well tissue culture plates (Greiner Bio-One, Inc., Longwood, FL) were transfected with 0.5 μg of siRNA, 50 ng of pEGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vector, pEGFP-N2; Clontech). Two or 3 days following transfections, the cells were loaded with Fura-2 as described above. Ba2+ influx measurements were carried out on EGFP-expressing cells identified visually using a fluorescein fluorescence filter cube.Coimmunoprecipitations—Approximately 90-95% confluent cultures of undifferentiated PC12D cells were used for all of the experiments. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors or vehicle at 37 °C for 10 (GF109203X) or 30 min (FK506, cyclosporin A, and rapamycin) prior to stimulation with water or carbachol at room temperature for the indicated times. Cells were then rinsed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by addition of 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40 (nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol), 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysed cells were collected in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and sonicated using a probe sonicator (Fisher model 100 sonic dismembrator; setting 2) 3× for 10 s with 10-s intervals on ice. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:100 dilutions of anti-M1 mAChR (sc-9106; 200 μg/ml), anti-TRPC6 (200 μg/ml), anti-PKC-α (sc-208; 200 μg/ml), anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate (2261), anti-FKBP12 (SS4091; 500 μg/ml), anti-calcineurin (sc-9070; 200 μg/ml), or anti-calmodulin (05-173; 500 μg/ml) antibodies. The next day, 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each sample, and samples were incubated for additional 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), and boiled for 5 min.Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide resolving gel, 5% stacking gel) and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL nitrocellulose, 0.2 μm, Amersham Biosciences). After the transfer, membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with TNT buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% powdered skim milk. The membranes were then exposed to anti-M1 mAChR (1:1000), anti-TRPC6 (1:2000), anti-PKCα (1:2000), anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate (1:2000), anti-FKBP12 (1:2000), anti-calcineurin (1:1000), or anti-calmodulin (1:500) antibodies at the indicated dilutions in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with TNT buffer and incubated in TNT buffer containing anti-rabbit IgG antibodies or anti-goat IgG antibody cross-linked with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSActivation of M1 mAChRs Activates Endogenous TRPC6 Channels in PC12D Cells—Fig. 1 shows that addition of carbachol to Fura-2-loaded PC12D cells in nominally Ca2+-free KRH buffer causes a transient increase in intracellular fluorescence, correlating with the release of Ca2+ from the ER and its rapid expulsion from the cells. Subsequent addition of 500 μm BaCl2 to the medium results in an increase in Fura-2 fluorescence due to the influx of Ba2+. Ba2+ is not a substrate for plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps and is therefore not expelled from the cells (34Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yamaguchi D.T. Green J. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 197-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ba2+-dependent increases in Fura-2 fluorescence reflect Ba2+ influx and accumulation only and not the balance of influx and efflux (as is the case for Ca2+). The release of Ca2+ from internal stores and Ba2+ influx are both mediated by M1 mAChRs, because both are blocked in cells pretreated with atropine.Based upon reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western blot analyses, we previously determined that PC12D cells express four TRPC channel subtypes: TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7. 3L. Zhang, F. Guo, J. Y. Kim, and D. Saffen, submitted for publication. The TRPC6 channel expressed in PC12D cells is the TRPC6B isoform, 3L. Zhang, F. Guo, J. Y. Kim, and D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Carbachol-stimulated Ba2+ influx in PC12D cells is blocked by exogenous expression of anti-TRPC6 mRNA or the amino-terminal domain of TRPC6B, 3L. Zhang, F. Guo, J. Y. Kim, and D. Saffen, submitted for publication. which may act in a dominant-negative manner to block TRPC6 channel assembly (36Groschner K. Hingel S. Lintschinger B. Balzer M. Romanin C. Zhu X. Schreibmayer W.

Fig. 2A shows that carbachol-stimulated Ba2+ influx, but not release Ca2+ from ER stores, is blocked in PC12D cells transfected with siRNA specific for rat TRPC6 mRNA. By contrast, transfection of PC12D cells with anti-TRPC2 siRNA does not block carbachol-stimulated Ba2+ influx. Fig. 2B shows that PC12D cells transfected with anti-TRPC6 siRNA are selectively depleted in TRPC6 protein, with no decrease in levels of TRPC3 or TRPC7 protein. By contrast, TRPC6 protein is not depleted in cells transfected with anti-TRPC2 siRNA.Fig. 2M1 mAChR-mediated stimulation of Ba2+ influx requires the expression of TRPC6 chan"

In the present study, we utilized rat Oatp1a1 (NM_017111) as a prototypical member of this family to examine the mechanism governing its subcellular trafficking. A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of rat Oatp1a1 was used to affinity-isolate interacting proteins from rat liver cytosol. Protein mass fingerprinting identified PDZK1 as the major interacting protein. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of an Oatp1a1-PDZK1 complex from cotransfected 293T cells as well as from native rat liver membrane extracts. Oatp1a1 bound predominantly to the first and third PDZ binding domains of PDZK1, whereas the high density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor B type I binds to the first domain. Although it is possible that PDZK1 forms a complex with these two integral membrane proteins, this did not occur, suggesting that as yet undescribed factors lead to selectivity in the interaction of these protein ligands with PDZK1. Oatp1a1 protein expression was near normal in PDZK1 knock-out mouse liver. However, it was located predominantly in intracellular structures, in contrast to its normal basolateral plasma membrane distribution. Plasma disappearance of the Oatp1a1 ligand [35S]sulfobromophthalein was correspondingly delayed in knock-out mice. These studies show a critical role for oligomerization of Oatp1a1 with PDZK1 for its proper subcellular localization and function.

Of note is the fact that all of the Oatps that have been examined have distinct plasma membrane distributions, except for the prostaglandin transporters in which intracellular localization appears to predominate (10Bao Y. Pucci M.L. Chan B.S. Lu R. Ito S. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Examination of their C-terminal sequences reveals that many of the known members of the Oatp family have PDZ consensus binding sites (see Table I). The prostaglandin transporters are among the group of Oatps that lack a putative PDZ binding domain (11Kanai N. Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L.

The PDZ consensus sites that are present in the hepatic Oatps are all of Class I, defined by the sequence X(S/T)XΦ, where X is any amino acid, and Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid (14Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). A relatively large number of PDZ proteins have been described (14Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 15Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), although there is as yet no way to predict which if any will bind a particular protein with a PDZ consensus binding site. In the present study, we utilized rat Oatp1a1 (NM_017111) as a prototypical member of the Oatp family to examine whether interaction with a PDZ domain-containing protein provides a mechanism governing its subcellular localization. Oatp1a1 is located on the basolateral plasma membrane of the hepatocyte (16Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L.

Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar) as well as on the apical plasma membranes of the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubule (16Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar, 17Angeletti R.H.

Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C882-C887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its terminal four amino acids (KTKL) are consistent with a type I PDZ binding motif (14Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). There is also a mouse homolog of this protein (NM_013797) that is 81% identical to the rat Oatp1a1, and the C-terminal 11 amino acids of these two proteins are identical. Antibodies and Reagents—The antibody against the N terminus of Oatp1a1 (MEETEKKIATQEGRC) linked to KLH was prepared in rabbits by Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA) as previously described (19Glavy J.S. Wu S.M. Wang P.J. Orr G.A. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1479-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes Oatp1a1 in rat and mouse liver and was used for immunoblots at a 1:1000 dilution. An antibody specific to rat Oatp1a1, used in immunoblots at a dilution of 1:2500, was raised in rabbits to a KLH-linked peptide corresponding to 13 amino acids near the C terminus of rat Oatp1a1 (aa 646–658) as described previously (16Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit antibody to Oatp1a4, used in immunoblots at a dilution of 1:10,000, was prepared to a KLH-linked peptide corresponding to the 11 C-terminal amino acids (aa 650–661) of the protein. Rabbit antibodies to scavenger receptor B type I (SR-BI) and PDZK1 were as previously described (20Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and were used in immunoblots at dilutions of 1:1000. A rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the mouse asialoglycoprotein receptor was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Stockert for immunofluorescence studies. ECL reagent for Western blot analysis was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) and were used in immunoblots at dilutions of 1:50,000 and 1:10,000, respectively. 293T cells were obtained from Dr. Robert Burk (21Mohan S. Burk R.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5270-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. All animal procedures were approved by the university committees on animal use. Preparation of C-terminal Peptide Affinity Gel—The peptides CHGSPQVENDGELKTKL corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of rat Oatp1a1 and CHGSPQVENDGEL in which the last 4 amino acids were deleted were synthesized in The Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis and Proteomics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. An additional cysteine residue was included at the N terminus to facilitate coupling to Ultralink Iodoacetyl Gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of Peptide-binding Proteins from Rat Liver Cytosol—The liver was surgically removed from a rat under pentobarbital anesthesia and was immediately infused through the portal vein with 30 ml of ice-cold PBS. It was quickly weighed and Dounce-homogenized in PBS (10 ml/3 g of liver) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, catalog # P-8340). After filtration through 3 layers of cheesecloth, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatant (5 ml) was mixed with 1 ml of the peptide-coupled gel in a column and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The gel was then washed successively with 200 ml of ice-cold PBS, 10 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, 10 ml of 1 m NaCl, and 20 ml of PBS. Proteins remaining bound to the washed gel were eluted with sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE after which they were identified by Coomassie Blue or silver-staining. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Coomassie Blue-stained bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, destained with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile, and reduced using 20 mm tris (2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine-HCl, and free cysteine residues were alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide. After digestion for 16 h at 37 °C with 25 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega), products were cleaned and concentrated using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore), mixed with 0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml 1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and applied onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) plate. Spectra were recorded with a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer operated in the reflection mode. The mass measurement accuracy with internal calibration was better than 100 ppm. The measured peptide masses were used for data base searching with ProFound algorithm (ProteoMetrics, NY) and Matrix Science (Mascot). For electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis, an APIQSTAR LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used. Fragment ion (tandem) mass spectra were obtained using collision-induced dissociation and analyzed using Matrix Science (Mascot) software. Immunoprecipitation of Rat Liver Membrane Extracts—Antiserum against the N-terminal peptide of Oatp1a1 was immunopurified with peptide coupled to Sulfolink-agarose (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This purified antibody was covalently coupled to immobilized protein A-agarose (Sigma) by incubating for 1 h at room temperature in 40 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) in 0.2 m triethanolamine buffer, pH 8.2. A 0.1 m Na2CO3 extracted rat liver pellet, highly enriched in Oatp1a1 (22Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mm pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% sodium azide). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of anti-Oatp1a1-protein A gel and washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and 200-μl fractions were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.3, directly into 1 m Tris-base to neutralize the pH. The eluates were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation of Oatp1a1 and PDZK1 after Coexpression in 293T Cells—Oatp1a1 cDNA was excised from pSPORT-Oatp1a1 using the KpnI and NotI multicloning restriction enzyme sites (23Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and cloned into pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). PDZK1 cDNA was cloned into pFLAG-CMV-5c (Sigma) after PCR amplification from a pCDNA3.1/hygro-PDZK1 plasmid (20Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), resulting in a plasmid encoding PDZK1 with FLAG at its N terminus. Transient co-transfection of 293T cells with pCDNA3.1-Oatp1a1 and pFLAG-CMV/PDZK1 was performed using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, washed with PBS, and incubated for 30–60 min on ice with PBS containing 1% CHAPS and protease inhibitors (Sigma #P-8340). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with Oatp1a1-protein A affinity gel or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) (25 μl of gel/4 × 106 cells). Each gel was washed with 1% CHAPS in PBS, incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis. A control study was also performed in which Oatp1a4 and FLAG-PDZK1 were cotransfected into 293T cells, which were then subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation as described above. For these studies, Oatp1a4 cDNA was excised from a pCR2.1-Oatp1a4 plasmid that was provided by Dr. Richard Kim (24Cvetkovic M. Leake B. Fromm M.F. Wilkinson G.R. Kim R.B. Drug Metab. Dispos.. 1999; 27: 866-871PubMed Google Scholar). The Oatp1a4 insert was excised using KpnI- and XhoI-multicloning restriction enzyme sites and cloned into the pCDNA3.1/Zeo(–) plasmid. Identification of Oatp1a1-interacting PDZK1 Domains—As previously described, PDZK1 has four independent PDZ binding domains (25Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K.

Murer H. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1746-1754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pGEX6p-1 glutathione S-transferase expression plasmids (Amersham Biosciences) containing cDNAs encoding each of these domains were prepared using the pCDNA3.1/hygro-PDZK1 plasmid as the PCR template. For amplification of intact PDZK1 a sense primer (5′-ACTTAAGGATCCACAGAAATGGCCTCCACCTTCAAC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ACGGGCCCTCTAGACTCGAG-3′) encoding BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, were used. For the first domain (aa 1–110) sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCCTCCACCTTCAACCCCAGAGAGTGT-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTACCTCTGGCTTTGATCCAGCTCTTTCAA-3′) primers encoding BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, were used, and for domains 2–4 (aa 113–235, 221–343, or 356–519, respectively) the sense and antisense primers encoded EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The primers used for domain 2 are 5′-CCGGAATTCGCTCTGAATGATAAGAAACCGGGCCCTGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACAAACTGGCTGTCTCCCTCTTGAATTGTGT-3′ (antisense). The primers used for domain 3 are 5′-CCGCAATTCAGTGAACAGAAGACACAATTCAAGAGGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTCTTGACTTTGGCAGTAAAGAAGTGGAGA-3′ (antisense). The primers used for domain 4 are 5′-CCGGAATTCATCCCTGCTCCTCTGGAGGCCACAGGCTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACATCTCCGTGTCTTCAGAGTTAGACGAAGA-3′ (antisense). The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α, Invitrogen) and affinity-purified using GSH-agarose gel (Sigma). Briefly, the bacteria were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB/ampicillin medium at 37 °C. The culture was then diluted into 50 ml of LB/ampicillin medium and grown at 37 °C until the A600 was 0.6–1 absorption units. Expression of fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) followed by an additional 4 h of incubation. The bacteria were harvested, resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 ml/50 ml bacterial culture) containing protease inhibitor (Sigma catalog #P-8340), and sonicated on ice. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge) for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was rotated with GSH-agarose gel overnight at 4 °C. The gel was washed several times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, resuspended in extracted rat liver membrane containing protease inhibitors as prepared above (5 mg membrane/15 μl of gel), and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The gel was washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS 5 times before the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Generation of PDZK1 Gene-targeted Mice—Mice in which exon 1 and part of intron 1 of the PDZK1 allele were replaced by the Neo cassette were prepared and bred in the Columbia University Transgenic Facility as described previously (27Lan D. Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23390-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Localization of PDZK1 in Liver—Male wild type or PDZK1 knock-out mice were anesthetized with ether, and the livers were removed and fixed by immersion for 3 h at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 7.5% sucrose and frozen sections (∼30 μm thick) were prepared (16Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were exposed overnight at 4 °C to anti-Oatp1a1, anti-asialoglycoprotein receptor, or anti-PDZK1 diluted 1:100 in PBS and, after rinsing in PBS, were exposed overnight at 4 °C to a 1:400 dilution of a Cy3-labeled donkey antibody to rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Controls included examination of sections for autofluorescence after exposure to nonspecific primary antiserum. Wide field immunofluorescence images were captured with a 60× Olympus objective (1.4 NA) on an Olympus IX71 microscope. Rhodamine fluorescence was excited with a DG-4 (Sutter Instruments) xenon light source, and digital images were recorded on a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ CCD camera controlled by Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp). For deconvolution, liver was optically sectioned every 0.25 μm using an MS-2000 automated piezoelectric x, y, z stage (Applied Scientific Instruments) for a total of 72 optical sections. Image stacks were deconvolved using the Metamorph “measured deconvolution” algorithm. For this, suboptical resolution fluorescent beads (PS-Spec, Molecular Probes) were sectioned in the z dimension under identical conditions as the liver. Bead stacks were assembled to generate a measured “point spread function,” and this point spread function was used to optically deconvolve the stacks of liver fluorescence images. [35S]BSP Plasma Disappearance—[35S]BSP (1000 μCi/μmol) was synthesized as previously described (4Kurisu H. Nilprabhassorn P. Wolkoff A.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Male wild type and PDZK1 knock-out mice were anesthetized with ketamine and injected retroorbitally with ∼140,000 cpm of [35S]BSP in 0.1 ml of PBS. Timed blood samples (∼40 μl) were obtained from the contralateral retroorbital sinus in heparinized capillary tubes, which were then centrifuged, and radioactivity in an aliquot of plasma was quantified. Plasma disappearance of radioactivity as a fraction of the injected dose was fit by a non-linear least squares algorithm (SigmaPlot v 6.1, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) to the single exponential equation C(t) = ae–bt, where C(t) is the fraction of injected [35S]BSP/ml plasma at time t, a is the fraction of injected [35S]BSP/ml plasma at time 0, and b is the fractional disappearance rate in s–1. The volume of distribution of [35S]BSP was calculated as 1/a, and the serum half-life of [35S]BSP (t½) was calculated as ln (2)/b. Isolation and Identification of Rat Liver Cytosolic Proteins That Bind to the C-terminal Tail of Oatp1a1—For these experiments, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of rat Oatp1a1 was covalently coupled to agarose gel. This peptide minus the last 4 amino acids that comprise the PDZ binding consensus domain was also coupled to agarose gel and used as a control. The columns were washed extensively with PBS as well as 1 m NaCl. Proteins bound to the washed gel were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and detected after SDS-PAGE by silver stain or staining with Coomassie Blue. A representative silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel is seen in Fig. 1a. A major protein band of ∼70 kDa was detected only in the material that was bound to the intact peptide (lane 1) and not to the peptide lacking the terminal 4 amino acids (lane 2). This band was visualized after Coomassie Blue staining of replicate gels and was excised. After reduction and alkylation, the gel slice was incubated overnight with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were identified by MALDI mass spectrometry. A representative MALDI mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 1b. Data base analysis revealed a high correspondence of the observed peptide masses to those that would be obtained by tryptic digestion of rat PDZK1. These 64 possible tryptic peptides are indicated in Fig. 1c by alternating shading that has been applied to the PDZK1 sequence. After analysis of multiple MALDI spectra, 50 peptides corresponding to 66% of the protein sequence of PDZK1 were identified as indicated by the solid underlines in Fig. 1c. Identification as PDZK1 was confirmed by tandem MS/MS analysis. A representative MS/MS spectrum is shown in Fig. 1d, in which the sequence corresponding to the fifth PDZK1 tryptic peptide was identified. Masses in this figure are annotated using standard nomenclature as described (28Addona T. Clauser K. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey2005Google Scholar). Utilizing tandem MS/MS, the sequences of 27 peptides corresponding to 54% of the PDZK1 sequence were identified and are indicated by the broken underlines in Fig. 1c. Together, the two methods identified 93% of the PDZK1 sequence (Fig. 1c). In addition, identification of this protein as PDZK1 was confirmed by immunoblot using a peptide-specific antibody (data not shown). Interaction of Oatp1a1 and PDZK1 in Cells and Rat Liver— These studies showed that the C-terminal four amino acids of Oatp1a1 are necessary for interaction with PDZK1. However, these results are not predictive as to whether this interaction between Oatp1a1 and PDZK1 actually occurs in vivo. Although several proteins have been shown to bind to PDZK1 under in vitro conditions, the functional significance of this interaction has not always been clear (29Kato Y. Yoshida K. Watanabe C. Sai Y. Tsuji A. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2004; 21: 1886-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Capuano P. Bacic D. Stange G. Hernando N. Kaissling B. Pal R. Kocher O. Biber J. Wagner C.A. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 449: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess whether the interaction found with the C-terminal peptide occurs with full-length proteins expressed in cells, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Oatp1a1 and FLAG-PDZK1. Immunoprecipitation was performed with FLAG antibody or an antibody raised to the N terminus of Oatp1a1 that would not be expected to interfere with interaction of the C terminus with PDZK1. Western blot analysis of the FLAG immunoprecipitate with anti-Oatp1a1 revealed the presence of Oatp1a1 (Fig. 2a, left panel), and Western blot analysis of the Oatp1a1 immunoprecipitate revealed the presence of FLAG-PDZK1 (Fig. 2a, right panel). There was no product detected in the immunoprecipitate after cotransfection of either expression plasmid with"

Dynamic motions of four ion pairs previously proposed to be important in thermal stability of adenylate kinase from the thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus were monitored during the simulation. One of the four ion pairs identified in the crystal structure, Lys180-Asp114, was not maintained in close contact suggesting that the ion pair does not contribute to thermal stability. Among the other three ion pairs, the ion pair Arg116-Glu198 was proposed to be the most important for stability. To predict behaviors of the ion pairs when engineered into a mesophilic homologue to increase stability, in silico mutants of adenylate kinase from the mesophile Bacillus subtilis were generated, and their molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. The ion pairs in the mutant simulations displayed similar behaviors to those in the simulation of the thermophilic protein. To validate the results of the simulations experimentally, the same mutants were produced in vitro and their thermal stabilities were measured using differential scanning calorimetry. In agreement with the simulations, the Lys180-Asp114 did not result in any increase in stability by itself or additive effect with other ion pairs, whereas a mutant with the Arg116-Glu198 exhibited the highest stability among the mutants having one of the four ion pairs. These results provide specific knowledge about stability in adenylate kinases and more generally suggest that molecular dynamics simulations can provide valuable information for identifying and engineering ion pairs.

Because proteins from organisms living at high temperatures generally have increased stability, they have drawn attention for both practical and fundamental reasons. From small scale experiments to large scale industrial processes, it is often required or advantageous to use proteins that are stable and function at high temperatures, and thermophilic proteins have been used in various fields directly or as models for protein engineering (1Rothschild L.J. Mancinelli R.L. Nature. 2001; 409: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 2Bruins M.E. Janssen A.E. Boom R.M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2001; 90: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). They also provide a unique opportunity to understand molecular basis of protein stability (3Jaenicke R. Böhm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 4Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and its relation to dynamics and function (5D'Amico S. Marx J.C. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7891-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 6Fields P.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 2001; 129: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To illustrate the molecular mechanism of increased stability of thermophilic proteins, numerous studies have been performed by comparing them with their mesophilic homologues. There is no unifying mechanism found for the increased stability. Rather, it is apparent that different thermophilic proteins have different strategies for temperature adaptation and use combinations of subtle intramolecular interactions to gain the enhanced thermal stability (7Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 8Szilágy A. Závodszky P. Structure. 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The principal interactions may include electrostatic interactions between charged residues (9Perl D. Mueller U. Heinemann U. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), hydrogen bonding (10Tanner J.J. Hecht R.M. Krause K.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2597-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and hydrophobic interactions (11Criswell A.R. Bae E. Stec B. Konisky J. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among these, electrostatic interactions have been of particular interest for various reasons. Although hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are relatively difficult to define, it seems easy to identify favorable electrostatic interactions in thermophilic proteins by detecting ion pairs (also called salt links or salt bridges) with a simple distance cutoff assuming that most stabilization results from attraction between two oppositely charged residues. With relatively simple models, it is also possible to find important residues in electrostatic stabilization by considering interactions with all the other charged residues, not only with oppositely charged residues within a certain distance cutoff (12Ibarra-Molero B. Loladze V.V. Makhatadze G.I. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8138-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Makhatadze G.I. Loladze V.V. Gribenko A.V. Lopez M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When engineering mesophilic proteins for increased stability, modifying the electrostatic interactions between charged residues has advantages over altering other interactions. Because charged residues are usually found on surface of proteins, but their interactions are able to contribute to overall stability, engineering electrostatic interactions by mutating surface residues can minimize unwanted effects such as disruption in structure or function, which is often found in protein mutagenesis, especially when mutating core residues. Furthermore, the decrease in the dielectric constant of water with increasing temperature enhances the importance of electrostatic interactions in thermostability. The same simple electrostatic model used for identifying important residues in thermal stabilization of thermophilic proteins can also be used in the process of engineering mesophilic proteins (14Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Makhatadze G.I. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 132-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using the model, residues involved in destabilizing interactions with the same charged residues can be selected and mutated to neutral or oppositely charged residues for removing destabilization or further stabilization. Although this strategy was successful in several studies (15Spector S. Wang M. Carp S.A. Robblee J. Hendsch Z.S. Fairman R. Tidor B. Raleigh D.P.

It is more desirable to create additional favorable interactions by introducing new charged residues.

Although they come from organisms in the same genus and have a high level of sequence identity (74%), they exhibit significant difference in stability (18Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Perrier V. Surewicz W.K. Glaser P. Martineau L. Craescu C.T. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9960-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the differences between them most probably result from temperature adaptation unlike other examples where pairs of proteins are evolutionarily distant and differences related to temperature may be substantially masked by random or other genetic drift. Their crystal structures have been solved and compared with each other to reveal the molecular mechanism for the increased stability of AKste (20Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 275-288Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Bae E. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28202-28208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thermophilic AKste seems to use additional favorable electrostatic interactions of charged residues, and four ion pairs in AKste were proposed as critical for stability enhancement by electrostatic attraction (21Bae E. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28202-28208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this work we used thermophilic AKste and mesophilic AKsub as models to analyze and engineer protein stabilization via electrostatic interactions of ion pairs. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the two adenylate kinases were performed to observe their dynamic behavior including the motions of the ion pairs. Based on the results of these MD simulations, AKsub mutants with added ion pairs were generated in silico, and their MD simulations were carried out to study ion pair engineering. Finally, the AKsub mutants were produced in vitro and tested for their thermal stability to compare the results with those from the MD simulations. System Setup—The crystal structures of AKste and AKsub (Protein Data Bank entries 1ZIO and 1P3J, respectively) were used as starting models for MD simulations. The five C-terminal residues not resolved in the AKsub structure were constructed based on those from the crystal structure of the homologous Bacillus globisporus adenylate kinase (AK-glo, Protein Data Bank entry 1S3G). The four crystallographic water molecules coordinating a magnesium ion in both structures were maintained in the models. The psfgen package of the program VMD (22Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35699) Google Scholar) was used to make mutations and to add hydrogen atoms. The wild type and mutant adenylate kinases were then solvated in a 51.4 × 58.2 × 63.3 Å3 box consisting of TIP3 water molecules (23Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28646) Google Scholar) and neutralizing ions (Na+ and Cl-) at physiological concentration using the solvate and autoionize packages of the VMD program (22Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35699) Google Scholar). Simulation Configuration—The MD simulations were carried out with the program NAMD (24Kalé L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comput. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2107) Google Scholar) and the CHARMM27 force field (25MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack J. R. L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J.

For the zinc binding site, partial charges and intramolecular force constants were taken from Eriksson et al. (26Eriksson M.A. Hard T. Nilsson L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 402-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the average bond lengths and angles in the three crystal structures (AKste, AKsub, and AKglo) were used as the equilibrium values. The interaction between the magnesium ion and its coordinating atoms was considered as a tight electrostatic attraction, and no covalent bond or angle was defined. A cutoff distance of 12 Å for van der Waals interactions was assumed with switching function starting at 10 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were used with a flexible cell. The particle mesh Ewald summation (27Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) was used to compute long range electrostatic interactions without a cutoff. An integration time step was 1 fs. A constant temperature (300 or 330 K) was maintained by performing Langevin dynamics (28Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, CT1992Google Scholar). The Nose-Hoover Langevin piston method (29Martyna G.J. Tobias D.J.

Phys. 1995; 103: 4613-4621Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar) was used to keep a constant pressure (1 atm). System Equilibration and Simulation—With the fixed crystallographic atoms, the systems were minimized for 1000 steps and equilibrated at 300 K for 20 ps. Another minimization (2000 steps) and equilibration at 300 K (100 ps) was then performed with all atoms free to move. For simulations at 330 K, the systems equilibrated at 300 K were further equilibrated at 330 K for 100 ps. A Langevin damping coefficient of 5 ps-1 was use during equilibration. The final equilibrated configurations at each temperature were used as starting points for simulations. All the simulations were then carried out for 1.2 ns with a damping coefficient of 1 ps-1. The computation of each 1.2 ns simulation took ∼8 days with a computer equipped with dual 2 GHz AMD Athlon processors. The coordinates were saved at every 500 time steps, and those of the last 1 ns were used for analysis. Analysis of Simulations—All analyses were done for residues 1-212 excluding the five highly disordered C-terminal residues. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions was used as a numerical measure of the differences between two structures. On the other hand, the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) is calculated as an indicator of flexibility. The RMSF is defined for each instantaneous structure in a trajectory. The reference structure used in computing RMSF is calculated by aligning and averaging all the instantaneous structures for the last 1 ns of the simulations. In each ion pair the shortest distance between oppositely charged atoms (amino nitrogen and carboxylic oxygen) was considered to be the distance of the ion pair. In Vitro Measurement of Thermal Denaturation Midpoint (Tm) of AKsub Mutants—To produce AKsub mutant genes, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using mismatched primers in polymerase chain reactions. The mutations were verified by sequencing the entire mutant genes. As described previously (21Bae E. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28202-28208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the mutant proteins overexpressed in Escherichia coli were purified by a two-step procedure involving affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and their Tms were measured by performing differential scanning calorimetry. Stability of Trajectories in the Simulations—The RMSD values between the final minimized structure and the starting crystal structure for AKste and AKsub were small, 0.37 and 0.46 Å respectively. This indicates that the force field is sufficiently accurate. The total and backbone RMSD values of the instantaneous structures during the 1.3 ns (0.1-ns equilibration and 1.2-ns simulation) from the final minimized structures are plotted in Fig. 1. The initial changes in the 300 K equilibrations were caused by heating the systems from 0 to 300 K. The changes in the 330 K were smaller and the RMSDs did not start from zero because the final equilibrated structures at 300 K were used as starting coordinates for equilibration at 330 K. All of the RMSD values seemed to stop increasing during the 100-ps equilibration, but they began to increase as the actual 1.2-ns simulations were started. This is probably because the Langevin damping coefficient was switched from 5 to 1 ps-1. However, it is clear that the systems reached equilibrium at 300 ps after which the trajectories were saved for analysis. The radii of gyration of AKste and AKsub were also stabilized after 300 ps. The average values for the last 1 ns of the simulations were 17.07 and 16.99 Å for AKste at 300 and 330 K, and 16.72 and 16.78 Å for AKsub at 300 and 330 K, respectively. Their standard deviations were all less than 0.1 Å. This indicates the stability of the overall dimensions of the proteins during the simulations. During the simulations the integrity of the zinc and magnesium binding sites was well maintained. The tetrahedral geometry in the zinc site was preserved. In AKsub the bidentate coordination of Asp153 to the zinc ion was also preserved. The octahedral coordination around the magnesium ion was stable indicating that treating the interaction between the magnesium ion and its coordinating atoms as a tight electrostatic interaction was suitable. To compare dynamics of the simulations with those in the crystal structures, the RMSF value of each residue during the last 1 ns was calculated and compared with crystallographic B factors. The calculated residual RMSF values correlate well with the experimental B factors. The linear correlation coefficients are 0.42, 0.56, 0.53, and 0.29 for AKste at 300 and 330 K and AKsub at 300 and 330 K, respectively. This shows that the simulations were fairly accurate in describing the dynamic feature of the systems. Overall Flexibility of the Systems during the Simulations—The average RMSF value during MD simulation is considered as a measure of the overall flexibility of the system. The total and backbone RMSF values were calculated during the last 1 ns of the simulations, and the average values are listed in Table I. The total RMSF values were always higher than those for the backbone atoms in each simulation. This result confirms the less flexible nature of the backbone atoms. For both AKste and AKsub, the simulations at 330 K displayed higher average RMSF values than those at 300 K indicating increased flexibility of both systems at the higher simulation temperature. AKste and AKsub had similar average RMSF values at 300 K. AKsub showed higher average RMSF than AKste at 330 K, but the difference was too small to conclude a higher flexibility of AKsub than AKste at 330 K.Table IAverage RMSF values (Å) during the last 1 ns of the simulationsAKsteAKsub300 K330 K300 K330 KTotal0.840.950.830.99Backbone0.630.710.630.75 Open table in a new tab Ion Pairs in the Simulations—From the structural comparison with mesophilic AKsub, it was suggested that electrostatic interactions of ion pairs in thermophilic AKste may contribute to its increased stability at high temperatures (21Bae E. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28202-28208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Among many ion pairs found in AKste with 4-Å distance cutoff, only four ion pairs were identified as critical ion pairs for thermostability based on the distance between two residues in the sequence and the comparison with AKsub. They are Lys19-Glu202, Arg116-Glu198, Arg131-Glu156, and Lys180-Asp114 (Fig. 2). They are all bridging the distant regions of a polypeptide (more than 10 residues), and their corresponding residues in AKsub do not form any ion pairs because at least one of the two residues is substituted. It is reasonable to choose ion pairs formed by residues from distant regions of a polypeptide because they are most likely not maintained when the protein is unfolded and thus contribute to stability by increasing free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states. The four critical ion pairs were monitored during the last 1 ns of the simulation at 330K. The 330K simulation was selected because ion pairs are known to contribute to protein stability mostly at elevated temperatures due to reduced desolvation penalty for formation of ion pairs at high temperatures. It is also expected that the difference between AKste and AKsub would become more obvious at 330 K than at 300 K because AKsub starts to be denatured and inactivated in between 300 and 330 K but AKste remains stable at 330 K (18Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Perrier V. Surewicz W.K. Glaser P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28202-28208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The distances of the four critical ion pairs over time are plotted in Fig. 3. The most striking finding is that a short distance for the ion pair Lys180-Asp114 was not maintained during the simulation. There were moments when the two residues came within a relatively short distance (less than 6 Å) during the simulation, but they fell apart eventually. This suggests that the ion pair Lys180-Asp114 may not be kept within a short distance in solution and thus not contribute to thermal stability of thermophilic AKste at high temperatures. Among the other three ion pairs maintained within short distances, the ion pair Arg116-Glu198 was maintained within 4 Å without any transient separation, whereas the two ion pairs Lys19-Glu202 and Arg131-Glu156 spent considerable times away from the short distances seen in the crystal structure, although the separations between the pairing residues were recovered during the simulation. This results in the higher average distances for the Lys19-Glu202 and Arg131-Glu156 ion pairs than that of the ion pair Arg116-Glu198 (Table II) and suggests that the Arg116-Glu198 may be more important for stability than the other two ion pairs.Table IIAverage distances (Å) of ion pairs during the last 1 ns of the simulations at 330 KLys19-Glu202Arg116-Glu198Arg131-Glu156Lys180-Asp114AKste3.182.693.8110.87AKsubm16.324.675.9111.67AKsubm24.023.054.89N/AAKsubm3N/AN/AN/A10.16AKsubm44.53N/AN/AN/AAKsubm5N/A4.51N/AN/AAKsubm6N/AN/A4.88N/A Open table in a new tab Simulations of AKsub Mutants—It is most likely that if the four ion pairs were engineered into AKsub, they would show similar behaviors to those in AKste considering the high structural similarity between AKste and AKsub, but this is not guaranteed. To test this proposition, an AKsub mutant (AK-subm1) having the four critical ion pairs was generated in silico, and its MD simulation was performed. The simulation was carried out as the same manner as the AKste and AKsub simulations and showed similar degrees of stability (data not shown). As expected, the four engineered ion pairs in AKsubm1 at 330K simulation displayed similarities to those in AKste (Table II). The two residues in the ion pair Lys180-Asp114 were clearly separated from each other during the simulation, whereas the other three ion pairs were maintained within relatively short distances. This suggests that the ion pair Lys180-Asp114 may not contribute to the stability of the AKsub mutant, and thus engineering only the other three ion pairs would be the more efficient way to increase thermostability of AKsub by introducing ion pairs. The three ion pairs would probably exhibit the same pattern when engineered in AKsub whether the ion pair Lys180-Asp114 exists with them or not. It is, however, possible that the Lys180-Asp114 pair and the other three ion pairs behave differently in the absence of each other. To exclude this possibility two more AKsub mutants were designed. The second AKsub mutant (AKsubm2) has only the three ion pairs that were kept in short distances. The third construct (AKsubm3) is a mutant with only Lys180-Asp114. Their simulations were performed and validated as for the others (data not shown). As shown in Table II, the maintenance of the short distance in the three ion pairs (Lys19-Glu202, Arg116-Glu198, and Arg131-Glu156) and the dissociation between Lys180 and Asp114 were independent. The three ion pairs were kept within a short distance when the Lys180-Asp114 was not with them, and the Lys180 and Asp114 were also separated without the other three ion pairs. In an attempt to further dissect which is more important in stability among the three ion pairs maintained within relatively short distances, the simulations of three more AKsub mutants (AKsubm4, AKsubm5, and AKsubm6) that have only one of the three ion pairs (Lys19-Glu202, Arg116-Glu198, and Arg131-Glu156, respectively) were carried out and validated (data not shown). As listed in Table II, each ion pair was maintained within short distances in each mutant. It also seemed that the ion pair Arg116-Glu198 was more closely maintained than the Lys19-Glu202 and Arg131-Glu156 ion pairs not only in the mutants having the multiple ion pairs but also in those having only one ion pair, although it was not as dramatic as in the case of the ion pair Lys180-Asp114. With the analysis of the ion pairs in all the mutant simulations, it is tempting to draw simple conclusions about direct influences between the four ion pairs. For example, it seems that the absence of the Lys180-Asp114 may tighten the other three ion pairs when comparing AKsubm1 and AKsubm2. However, in another simulation of AKsubm2 for verifying this, the average distances were 3.35, 4.17, and 5.98 Å for Lys19-Glu202, Arg116-Glu198 and Arg131-Glu156, respectively. It is not clear whether the Lys180-Asp114 is affecting the other three ion pairs or the differences are within the error range. Thus, it would be more appropriate to interpret the results of the MD simulations collectively rather than individually. Our hypothesis from the MD simulations is that Lys180 and Asp114 are not kept close to each other, and thus they do not increase thermostability by favorable electrostatic interaction, whereas the ion pair Arg116-Glu198 is the most tightly maintained among the other three ion pairs and is the most important in protein stability. In Vitro Measurement of Thermal Stability of AKsub Mutants—To verify the hypothesis generated from the simulations, in vitro experiments were performed. The six AKsub mutants studied in the simulations were produced and their Tms were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. In Table III, Tms of the six AKsub mutants are listed with differences from that of the wild type AKsub. Both AKsubm1 and AKsubm2 showed ∼5 °C increases of their Tms from AKsub, and the AKsubm3 had essentially the same Tm as AKsub. This clearly indicates that having the three ion pairs Lys19-Glu202, Arg116-Glu198, and Arg131-Glu156 is contributing to thermal stability, but the ion pair Lys180-Asp114 is not useful for engineering stability in agreement with the result from the MD simulations.Table IIIThermal denaturation midpoints (Tms) of mutants and their differences from that of wild type AKsubProteinsTmΔTm°C°CAKsubaRef. 2147.60AKsubm152.14.5AKsubm252.95.3AKsubm347.70.1AKsubm448.71.1AKsubm550.93.3AKsubm646.8–0.8a Ref. 21Bae E.

However, it is not clear that the reduced stability of AKsubm1 results from direct influence of the Lys180-Asp114 pair on electrostatic interactions of the other three ion pairs because the difference in Tm between AKsubm1 and AKsubm2 is not large enough to draw a definitive conclusion, and it is also possible that the destabilization may be caused by a more complicated indirect mechanism. Among the three AKsub mutants with one of the three ion pairs closely maintained in the MD simulations AKsubm5, having the ion pair Arg116-Glu198, showed the highest Tm, and this is consistent with the hypothesis from the MD simulations that the ion pair Arg116-Glu198 is the most tightly maintained in the three ion pairs and is the most important in stability. Surprisingly, AKsubm6 containing the ion pair Arg131-Glu156 did not display an increased Tm compared with the wild type AKsub. Although the inaccuracy of the MD simulations cannot be excluded as a source of the disagreement, it is possible that the ion pair is actually maintained but does not contribute to stability. In fact, it was found in the study of chimeras from AKste and AKsub that in certain areas of the adenylate kinases, residue substitutions from AKsub to AKste did not increase stability. 2E. Bae and G. N. Phillips, unpublished data. Rather, some of the substitutions decreased stability probably by disrupting complementary changes in AKsub because AKsub may have a different mechanism from AKste for local stabilization in the areas, and exchanging only one partner of cooperative interaction may result in destabilization. Engineering ion pairs in an attempt to increase protein stability is not a simple task. Having positively charged and negatively charged residues in spatial proximity does not always guarantee tight ion pairs. Because proteins have finely tuned three-dimensional structures, naïve mutations for introducing ion pairs may rather disrupt already optimized local or global structures resulting in destabilization or inactivation. Studying ion pairs in thermophilic proteins can be useful either directly by introducing their ion pairs to mesophilic homologues or as general lessons for engineering thermal stability. If a structure of a thermophilic homologue of a target mesophilic protein is available and has ion pairs that the target does not have, one can replace corresponding residues in the target with the residues of the ion pairs in the thermophilic homologue. By doing this, it becomes more easy to decide which residues to mutate. It is also expected that the engineered ion pairs would act as in the thermophilic protein because of high similarity between a target and its thermophilic homologue. It may seem easy to identify favorable ion pairs in thermophilic proteins. However, choosing ion pairs in thermophilic proteins with a simple distance cutoff from their static structures may be misleading. Because most thermophilic protein structures have been solved by x-ray crystallography, probably due to their easy crystallization and because ion pairs are composed of hydrophilic charged residues, the majority of ion pairs are found on the surface of protein structures, which makes the residues susceptible to contacts with neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice. Therefore it becomes unclear whether the formation of ion pairs is natural or affected by crystal packing. In fact, three of the four critical ion pairs in AKste (Arg116-Glu198, Arg131-Glu156, and Lys180-Asp114) have at least one residue whose side chain is contacting neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice within 4 Å. The flexible nature of the charged residues comprising ion pairs also makes the identification difficult. High solvent exposure and long side chains of charged residues often result in high flexibility and consequently ill-defined electron density with high B factors. However, it is not desirable to exclude residues having high B factors in search for true ion pairs because two residues can be flexible and form a tight ion pair at the same time by having concerted motions. MD simulation can provide insights to help solve these problems. Residues under the influence of crystal contacts can be relaxed during minimization and equilibration and likely mimic their behavior in solution during simulations. The flexibility issue is also overcome because it is possible to monitor motions of all the atoms all the time. It is therefore more straightforward to discern true ion pairs by selecting ones maintained during simulations rather than using a simple distance cutoff with average static structures. The results of MD simulations can also be beneficial to other approaches using the simple electrostatic models, because MD simulations can provide explicit information about geometry of charged residues (31de Bakker P.I.W. Hunenberger P.H. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1811-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although it becomes easier to identify true ion pairs in thermophilic homologues based on MD simulations, it is not always guaranteed that the ion pairs identified in the thermophilic proteins remain tight when engineered in the target proteins. It is also possible that the structures of thermophilic homologues may not be available, and residues to mutate in target proteins should be decided by less reliable methods. In both cases, MD simulations can be helpful to predict the consequence of the mutations. If a structure of a target is known and residues are selected for mutations to build ion pairs, in silico mutations of the target can produce a series of engineered protein structures with different combinations of ion pairs. MD simulations of the mutant structures can be performed and analyzed for dynamic motions of the engineered ion pairs. Consequently the mutants in which the engineered ion pairs remained tightly in MD simulations can be selected for in vitro mutagenesis. A major limitation of this strategy is that MD simulations only provide information about ion pair geometries, not about the overall stability of proteins, because it is not possible to accurately calculate protein stability in terms of thermodynamic quantities from results of MD simulations. It is in fact proposed that ion pairs can be tightly maintained without contributing to overall stability (32Makhatadze G.I. Loladze V.V. Ermolenko D.N. Chen X. Thomas S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1135-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that stability and flexibility of proteins are closely related (33Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1978; 9: 1-29Crossref Google Scholar). However, no definite correlations have been found between stability and overall flexibility in the MD simulations of thermophilic and mesophilic homologues (34Wintrode P.L. Zhang D. Vaidehi N. Arnold F.H. Goddard 3rd., W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Grottesi A. Ceruso M.A. Colosimo A. Di Nola A. Proteins Struct. Funct.

It is possible that the time scales of the simulations are too short or the force fields are not sufficiently accurate to describe the flexibilities of the proteins. Moreover, recent experimental studies suggest that flexibility adjustment for temperature adaptation may vary locally (37Liang Z.X. Tsigos I. Lee T. Bouriotis V. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14676-14683Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Butterwick J.A. Patrick Loria J. Astrof N.S. Kroenke C.D. Cole R. Rance M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 855-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, homologue proteins may not share similar global flexibility at their optimal temperatures and relations between stability and overall flexibility may not be expected. In our case, no clear correlation was observed between average RMSF and thermal stability for the pair of AKste and AKsub (Table I) or for the AKsub mutants (data not shown), and it was difficult to assess stability based on overall flexibility in MD simulations. Despite the limitation, it is clear that the strategy presented here can help identify critical ion pairs by explicitly monitoring motions of ion pairs or at least exclude false ion pairs, because a pair of separated residues can never contribute significantly to stability through electrostatic attraction. In our case, one of the four critical ion pairs selected from the static crystal structure of thermophilic AKste was suggested to be false based on its MD simulation. We were also able to propose that another ion pair is the most important in stability among the three ion pairs closely maintained in the simulation. Additional MD simulations of the AKsub mutants suggested similar behaviors of the ion pairs when engineered into the mesophile. From these results it was hypothesized that the Lys180-Asp114 would not contribute to thermal stability whereas Arg116-Glu198 would the most significantly in AKsub. This hypothesis was experimentally validated by producing the AKsub mutants in vitro and measuring their thermal stability by differential scanning calorimetry. This suggests that MD simulations can provide valuable information for identifying and engineering ion pairs and potentially replace substantial part of expensive and time consuming in vitro experiment. We thank E. J. Levine for helpful discussion about the program NAMD, R. M. Bannen for help in programming, and J. Kim for assistance in protein purification.

https://openalex.org/W2038054622,"Previous studies have suggested that thrombin interacts with integrins in endothelial cells through its RGD (Arg-187, Gly-188, Asp-189) sequence. All existing crystal structures of thrombin show that most of this sequence is buried under the 220-loop and therefore interaction via RGD implies either partial unfolding of the enzyme or its proteolytic digestion. Here, we demonstrate that surface-absorbed thrombin promotes attachment and migration of endothelial cells through interaction with αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins. Using site-directed mutants of thrombin we prove that this effect is mediated by the RGD sequence and does not require catalytic activity. The effect is abrogated when residues of the RGD sequence are mutated to Ala and is not observed with proteases like trypsin and tissue-type plasminogen activator, unless the RGD sequence is introduced at position 187–189. The potent inhibitor hirudin does not abrogate the effect, suggesting that thrombin functions through its RGD sequence in a non-canonical conformation. A 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of free thrombin grown in the presence of high salt (400 mm KCl) shows two molecules in the asymmetric unit, one of which assumes an unprecedented conformation with the autolysis loop shifted 20 Å away from its canonical position, the 220-loop entirely disordered, and the RGD sequence exposed to the solvent.

Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that plays key roles in blood coagulation and vascular development (1Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The procoagulant role unfolds upon cleavage of fibrinogen but also the activation of other clotting factors like fXIII, fVIII, fV, and fXI. The prothrombotic role depends on the cleavage of protease-activated receptors, which are also responsible for the signaling functions of the enzyme during embryonic development (2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar, 3Brass L.F. Chest. 2003; 124: 18S-25SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Finally, the anticoagulant role of the enzyme depends on the cleavage of protein C with the assistance of the cofactor thrombomodulin (4Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In addition to these well characterized roles that require catalytic activity, thrombin promotes chemotaxis even when its active site is blocked (5Bar-Shavit R. Kahn A. Wilner G.D. Fenton 2nd., J.W. Science. 1983; 220: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thrombin also promotes endothelial cell adhesion upon interaction with glypican (6Bar-Shavit R. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Vlodavsky I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) by exploiting its RGD (Arg-187, Gly-188, Asp-189) sequence (7Bar-Shavit R. Sabbah V. Lampugnani M.G.

Med. 1996; 334: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) that is not present in many other proteases. During evolution, the RGD sequence of thrombin was retained in almost all species, from hagfish to human (10Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Conservation of this sequence, however, may be due to other factors. Arg-187 makes an important ion-pair interaction with Asp-222 in the 220-loop to stabilize the Na+ binding environment that guarantees optimal catalytic activity (11Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A.

Savvides S.N. Tulinsky A. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Asp-189, on the other hand, defines the trypsin-like primary specificity of the enzyme (13Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The possible functional role of the RGD sequence in thrombin is called into question by the crystal structure where Arg-187 is exposed to the solvent, but Gly-188 and Asp-189 are almost completely buried under the 220-loop (14Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). As a possible solution to this conundrum, Bar-Shavit et al. (7Bar-Shavit R. Sabbah V. Lampugnani M.G.

J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have suggested that thrombin functions through its RGD sequence only after denaturation or proteolytic cleavage, either by thrombin itself (7Bar-Shavit R. Sabbah V. Lampugnani M.G. Marchisio P.C. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Vlodavsky I. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or plasmin (8Bar-Shavit R. Eskohjido Y. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Esko J.D. Vlodavsky I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that surface-absorbed thrombin, or its active site inhibited form, promote attachment, migration, and survival of endothelial cells via the ανβ3 integrin (15Tsopanoglou N.E. Andriopoulou P. Maragoudakis M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C1501-C1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Tsopanoglou N.E. Papaconstantinou M.E. Flordellis C.S. Maragoudakis M.E. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 846-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other studies have provided evidence that thrombin in solution can interact with ανβ3 integrin in a way that is inhibited by RGD mimetics (17Sajid M. Zhao R. Pathak A. Smyth S.S. Stouffer G.A. Am. J.

The thrombin mutant G188A (chymotrypsinogen numbering) was prepared in this study, and its kcat/Km values toward physiologic and synthetic substrates were found to be compromised up to 100-fold relative to wild type. All other thrombin mutants were characterized previously (11Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The trypsin mutant trypsin-RGD was made by replacing the 184a–188 sequence FLEGGK with the thrombin 184a–188 sequence YKPDEGKRG. The tPA mutant tPA-RGD was made by replacing the 184a–188 sequence DTRSGGPQANLH with the thrombin 186a–188 sequence YKPDEGKRG. The thrombin sequence was inserted in trypsin and tPA between Gly-184 and Asp-189 that are conserved and occupy spatially equivalent positions in all three proteases. The activity of trypsin-RGD toward chromogenic substrates was reduced 10-fold relative to wild type. The activity of tPA-RGD was significantly more compromised, reaching 10,000-fold toward the natural substrate plasminogen. Cell Attachment Assay—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Cell Applications, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Forty-eight-well plates were coated overnight with 1 μg/well wild-type or mutant thrombins, tPA, or trypsins. Coating was confirmed and quantified by protein determination (Bradford assay) after solubilization in NaOH. In control experiments with mutants defective for attachment, the amount of protein was increased up to 30 μg/well. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a reference. The wells were then blocked for 60 min with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. HUVECs were detached with 0.526 mm EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in serum-free medium containing 0.3% BSA (SFM-0.3% BSA) and incubated in the presence or absence of the GRGDSP peptide (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) or mouse monoclonal antibody against human ανβ3 integrin (clone LM609; Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). The GRGDSP peptide is used for the affinity purification of fibronectin receptor (α5β1 integrin), as it contains the RGD integrin recognition site of the fibronectin cell binding domain. It is also a potent inhibitor of cell attachment to fibronectin through interaction with α5β1 integrin. Cell suspensions (105/well) were then added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The nonadherent cells were aspirated and the number of the adhered cells was measured in triplicate wells by means of the endogenous enzyme hexosaminidase. In representative samples, endothelial cells attached on surface-absorbed proteins were fixed, stained, and photographed using an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) equipped with photometric CoolSNAP HQ camera in ×10 objective lens magnification. Cell Migration—Cell migration was studied using the modified Boyden chamber assay (Chemicon International Inc. kit: QCM™ 24-well colorimetric cell migration assay) where the upper and lower chambers are separated by 8-μm pore polycarbonate filters. In haptotactic cell motility assay, the undersurface of the membrane filter was precoated with 1 μg/well wild-type or mutant thrombins, tPA, or trypsin. In control experiments with mutants defective for migration, the amount of protein was increased up to 30 μg/well. BSA was used as a reference. To modulate the migration toward immobilized thrombin, lower chambers were filled with SFM-0.3% BSA containing the GRGDSP peptide or mouse monoclonal antibody against human αvβ3 integrin (clone LM609). Endothelial cells were added to the upper compartment of the chamber at a density of 103/μl in SFM-0.3% BSA and were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C allowing migration in the lower chamber. Cells on the filters that did not migrate (cells on upper surface) were removed by wiping with cotton swabs. Migrated cells were assessed according to the manufacturer's protocol. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Crystallization Studies—The R77aA mutant of thrombin, devoid of its site of autoproteolytic digestion (11Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), was crystallized to resolve the structure of thrombin bound to K+ and free of any inhibitors. The protein was concentrated to 5.6 mg/ml in 50 mm choline chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Crystallization was achieved at 25 °C by vapor diffusion against 20% polyethylene glycol 2000-monomethyl ether, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.6, and 400 mm KCl. Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution were mixed (2 μl each) to prepare the sitting drops. Diffraction quality crystals (∼0.3 × 0.06 × 0.06 mm) grew after 7 days. Crystals were cryoprotected in paratone oil prior to flash-freezing. Data were collected from a single crystal at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline 14-BM-C, Argonne National Laboratory) and processed using the HKL2000 package. The crystals were orthorhombic, in space group P212121 and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit (Table I). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the thrombin-PPACK complex (11Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J.

Open table in a new tab Recent studies have documented that surface-absorbed thrombin promotes endothelial cell attachment and migration via interaction with αvβ3 integrin (15Tsopanoglou N.E. Andriopoulou P. Maragoudakis M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C1501-C1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The effect appears to be mediated by the RGD sequence, but no direct demonstration could be provided in that or any previous studies (6Bar-Shavit R. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Vlodavsky I. J. Cell.

Haemost. 2004; 92: 846-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 documents the ability of immobilized wild-type thrombin to mediate the attachment of HUVECs. Inactivation of thrombin with the S195A mutation, which replaces the active site Ser with Ala, did not abrogate this property. This is in agreement with previous studies of thrombin inactivated at the active site with diisopropylphosphofluoridate (15Tsopanoglou N.E. Andriopoulou P. Maragoudakis M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C1501-C1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability to promote endothelial cell attachment was also retained by mutants significantly compromised in their cleavage of fibrinogen or PARs (e.g. E80A, Y225A, D221A, D222A) (19Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, mutants of the RGD sequence (R187A, G188A, and D189A) failed to support cell attachment (Figs. 1 and 2) even when the amount of protein used in the assay was increased 30-fold. The effect is highly selective because mutants of residues Lys-186d (K186dA) and Ala-190 (A190S) flanking the RGD sequence behaved like wild type. In a Boyden chamber assay, HUVECs readily migrated through a microporous membrane toward surface absorbed with wild-type thrombin or any mutant not carrying substitutions of the RGD sequence, but RGD mutants were ineffective in promoting cell migration (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Requirement of the RGD sequence of thrombin for attachment (black bars) and migration (gray bars) of endothelial cells. In cell attachment experiments, HUVECs were plated on wells coated with 1 μg/well wild-type or mutant thrombins, trypsins, or tPAs and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C. Trypsin-RGD and tPA-RGD refer to trypsin and tPA mutants containing the RGD sequence at position 187–189 as in thrombin. The effect of hirudin was studied by preincubating thrombin with the inhibitor (1:20 molar ratio) and then coating the wells with the complex (Hirudin-wt) or alternatively by adding hirudin (5 μg/ml) with the cells to the wells coated with wild-type thrombin (+Hirudin). The effect of integrin antagonists was studied by addition of LM609 (10 μg/ml) or GRGDSP (100 μm) with the cells to wells coated with wild-type (+LM609, +GRGDSP) or S195A mutant (S195A+LM609, S915A+GRGDSP) thrombin. The same reagents at the same concentrations were used to coat the undersurface of membrane filters in migration experiments, and cells were added to the upper compartment of the Boyden chamber. Values obtained in the presence of BSA were used as controls in both attachment and migration experiments to calculate the fold increase shown in the plot. In migration assays, cells on the lower surface were also counted manually under the microscope in six predetermined high magnification microscopic fields. The number per field ranged from 89 ± 14 for wild-type thrombin to 14 ± 7 for mutants of the RGD sequence, with 4 ± 3 measured in the control with BSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A striking demonstration of the involvement of the RGD sequence comes from experiments carried out with trypsin and tPA. These proteases are highly homologous to thrombin but do not possess the RGD sequence. Accordingly, they were unable to induce attachment and migration of HUVECs (Fig. 2). However, when residues 187 and 188 were replaced with Arg-Gly as found in thrombin (residue 189 is Asp in both trypsin and tPA), the mutants acquired the ability to induce attachment and migration of HUVECs as wild-type thrombin (Fig. 2). Need of the RGD sequence embedded in a proper protein scaffold is also demonstrated by the lack of activity of the thrombin peptide KRGDAC (Fig. 2), as opposed to the activity shown by the longer 23-amino acid thrombin peptide TP508 encompassing the RGD sequence (16Tsopanoglou N.E. Papaconstantinou M.E. Flordellis C.S. Maragoudakis M.E. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 846-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell attachment and migration toward immobilized wild-type or S195A mutant thrombin was found to depend on αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins. When endothelial cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml anti-αvβ3 antibody (LM609) or 100 μm GRGDSP peptide, which blocks the fibronectin receptor α5β1, attachment and migration of cells were significantly inhibited (Fig. 2). The effect was observed for both wild-type thrombin and the S195A mutant. To explore further the nature of thrombin conformation under the conditions employed in our cell attachment and migration assays, thrombin was challenged with the potent and highly selective inhibitor hirudin. Hirudin binds to thrombin in the femtomolar range (25Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and is an exceptionally good probe of the conformational state of the enzyme (26Mengwasser K.E. Bush L.A. Shih P. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26997-27003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) because it covers 20% of its solvent exposed surface area (27Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). When thrombin was preincubated with hirudin at a 1:20 ratio and the enzyme-inhibitor complex was surface-absorbed, endothelial cells could not attach and migrate (Fig. 2). On the other hand, when thrombin was first surface-absorbed and hirudin was added to the media with the cells, the inhibitor was unable to abrogate attachment or migration. These findings suggest that when thrombin is anchored to the support, it assumes a non-canonical conformation that exposes the RGD sequence and prevents hirudin binding. The inability to bind hirudin presages a drastic conformational rearrangement of the enzyme. Evidence that thrombin can indeed expose the RGD sequence through a drastic conformational transition comes from a serendipitous observation garnered from the crystal structure of the enzyme solved under experimental conditions never before explored. In an effort to understand the molecular basis of thrombin preference for Na+ versus K+ (28Di Cera E. C. R. Biol. 2004; 327: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the enzyme was crystallized free of any inhibitors in the presence of 400 mm KCl. The high concentration of K+ was made necessary by the significantly weaker affinity of this cation compared with Na+ (29Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a rotation of 173° (Fig. 3). Molecule-1 has K+ bound to the Na+ site and assumes a conformation similar to the Na+-bound F form (11Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The second molecule in the asymmetric unit, molecule-2, has no K+ bound to the Na+ site and assumes a conformation that has no counterpart in over 180 structures of thrombin currently deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Packing of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is quite different from that of the Na+-bound F form of thrombin and includes a second K+ bound at the interface. The intermolecular contacts are more extensive in the presence of KCl, with molecule-1 almost crushing molecule-2 in the contact region and squeezing the autolysis loop away from its canonical position (Fig. 3, blue). The entire segment from Asn-143 to Lys-149e comprising the autolysis loop (residues 144–149e) of molecule-1 is disordered and its electron density could not be traced, as typically found in thrombin structures (11Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this region could be traced for molecule-2 up to Thr-147 and from Gln-151 on (Fig. 3, blue). Remarkably, the proximal segment of the autolysis loop of molecule-2 overlaps that of the Na+-bound F structure of thrombin up to the Cα atom of Gly-140 and then repositions itself toward exosite I by making a sharp turn that dislodges the sequence around Glu-146 more than 20 Å away from its canonical position. The two backbone traces overlap again at the level of the backbone oxygen atom of Ser-153. One consequence of this sharp rearrangement of the autolysis loop of molecule-2 is the breaking of a key salt bridge between the side chains of Glu-146 and Arg-221a. At the other end of the interface, the entire 186-loop of molecule-2 is pulled and Pro-186 moves upward toward the 220-loop causing a total disorder in the region from Asp-221 to Gly-223 that cannot be traced in the electron density. These destabilizing interactions in the 186- and 220-loops are not seen in molecule-1, because the K+ bound in the cation site stabilizes the architecture of the region. The massive disruption of the cation binding site in molecule-2 is completed by a collapse of the β-strand from Gly-216 to Cys-220. The unprecedented structural changes in molecule-2 culminate in the exposure of the RGD sequence to the solvent (Fig. 4). The drastic changes in molecule-2 reported here are not triggered by the R77aA mutation that resides far from the intermolecular interface (Fig. 3) generated by the crystal packing. The changes are likely the result of the crystallization conditions, namely the absence of any inhibitor and the presence of high (400 mm) KCl. Thrombin can therefore assume a non-canonical conformation where the 220-loop is disordered and the RGD sequence is exposed to the solvent. This conformation would have little affinity toward hirudin, consistent with the results in Fig. 2, because of the massive disruption of the 220-loop hosting critical residues for hirudin recognition (26Mengwasser K.E. Bush L.A. Shih P. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26997-27003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The collapse of the primary specificity pocket would also compromise catalytic activity, which is, however, not required for RGD function (Figs. 1 and 2). We believe that exposure of the RGD sequence requires attachment to solid supports where thrombin is subject to constraints and forces not seen in solution. These conditions may be mimicked by surface-coating or crystallographic packing and may reproduce the crowded environment of the extracellular matrix where thrombin migrates upon vascular injury (6Bar-Shavit R.

Haemost. 2004; 92: 846-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have suggested that native thrombin in solution can interact with αvβ3 integrin in a way that can be inhibited specifically by RGD mimetics (17Sajid M. Zhao R. Pathak A. Smyth S.S. Stouffer G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1330-C1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Stouffer G.A. Smyth S.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that exposure of the RGD sequence may also occur independent of matrix attachment. The conformation of molecule-2 reported here likely captures thrombin in the act of completely unraveling the RGD sequence and the 220-loop region, which may be revealed in future studies of the free form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2146280046,"Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), alternatively named RNA helicase A, is involved in transcription and RNA processing. Here, we report that NDH II interacts with the Werner syndrome helicase WRN, an enzyme associated with premature aging and predisposition to tumorigenesis. NDH II was co-purified with WRN, DNA polymerase δ, and replication protein A (70 kDa) during several steps of conventional column chromatography. Co-immunoprecipitations revealed an association between NDH II, WRN, and polymerase δ. We demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between WRN and NDH II that is mediated by the N-terminal double-strand RNA-binding domain II and C-terminal RGG box of NDH II and the N-terminal exonuclease domain of WRN. WRN inhibited the DNA-dependent NTPase and DNA helicase activities of NDH II. On the other hand, the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of WRN was increased by the presence of NDH II. NDH II directly stimulated the exonuclease domain of WRN, whereas the exonuclease domain of WRN suppressed the DNA-dependent (but not RNA-dependent) ATPase activity of NDH II. These results suggest that the double-strand RNA-binding domain II and RGG box of NDH II together form a protein-protein interaction surface that contacts the exonuclease domain of WRN. Furthermore, NDH II enhanced the degradation of D-loop DNA by the WRN exonuclease. Taken together, these results suggest that NDH II plays a role in promoting the DNA processing function of WRN, which in turn might be necessary for maintaining genomic stability.

NDH II is homologous to the Drosophila maleless protein MLE, which participates in sex-specific dosage compensation by enhancing transcription from the single X chromosome of males (6Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition to transcription (6Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber R.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), NDH II has multiple physiological functions, such as in RNA processing and transport (8Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), in DNA repair (9Schlegel B.P. Starita L.M. Parvin J.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and also in tumorigenesis (10Abdelhaleem M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1704: 37-46PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, NDH II has been found to directly bind to histone γ-H2AX, which arises from the cellular response to DNA damage at stalled transcription sites (11Mischo H.E. Hemmerich P. Grosse F. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9586-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Also, NDH II is phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase family. Phosphorylation by DNA-dependent protein kinase might modify the multiple functions of NDH II in a still unknown manner (12Zhang S. Schlott B. Gorlach M. Grosse F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Werner syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder manifested by the symptoms of premature aging, such as atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type II, cataracts, and genomic instability with an increased incidence of tumor formation (13Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 213-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The molecular defect of the syndrome is a defective DNA helicase (WRN) that is homologous to the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase. Unique to all other members of the RecQ helicase family, WRN contains both a 3′ → 5′ helicase and a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity. WRN and the other human RecQ helicase homologs, i.e. Bloom syndrome helicase BLM and Rothmund-Thomson helicase RecQL4, are believed to be involved in DNA replication, repair, or recombination to sustain genomic stability. This might be achieved by, for example, facilitating recovery from stalled DNA replication forks, suppressing illegitimate recombination, or maintaining the telomere structure (14Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Potentially, WRN can fulfill these multiple roles based on both its exonuclease and helicase activities. Nevertheless, so far, there is no convincing evidence that demonstrates a coordination of these two enzymatic activities. Rather, WRN seems to cooperate with other proteins, such as the Ku antigens (15Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar), the telomeric repeat-binding factor TRF2 (16Machwe A. Xiao L. Orren D.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), BLM (17Von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L. Opresko P. Zeng X. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Here, we report that NDH II interacts with WRN and stimulates the exonuclease activity of this protein. This may indicate complementing or overlapping functions of these two helicases in DNA metabolism, possibly for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N terminus (amino acids (aa) 1-510) of human WRN (antibody 200) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C terminus (aa 1133-1432) of human WRN (H-300) and the goat polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal epitope of human WRN (C-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibody against the C terminus (aa 1291-1412) of human WRN was from BD Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against bovine NDH II was as described previously(2Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody against the 125-kDa subunit of DNA polymerase δ was obtained from M. Lee (New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY). Rat monoclonal antibodies against the 70-kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA) and the 55-kDa subunit of DNA polymerase δ were from H.-P. Nasheuer (National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland). The mouse monoclonal antibody against RNA polymerase II (8WG16) was from Covance Inc. (Princeton, NJ). Plasmid Vectors and Recombinant Proteins—Construction of a baculovirus vector for the expression of full-length wild-type WRN carrying a His6 tag at the N terminus and its purification from Sf9 insect cells through DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose P-11, and Ni-NTA-agarose were as described previously (19Shen J.C.

The N-terminal exonuclease domain (aa 1-256) and the middle helicase domain (aa 478-944) of WRN were constructed by PCR synthesis of the corresponding cDNA fragments and their insertion into plasmid pTrcHis2B (Invitrogen) at the XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. The plasmids were expressed in E. coli BL21 to yield a recombinant protein carrying a His6 tag and a Myc tag at the C terminus. Purification was on Ni-NTA-agarose. The full-length construct of NDH II carrying a His6 tag at the N terminus was inserted into the bacmid vector. The resulting baculovirus was expressed in Sf9 insect cells, and the corresponding protein was purified over Ni-NTA-agarose and a poly(rI)·poly(rC)-agarose as described previously (20Zhang S.

Partially deleted NDH II cDNAs containing N-terminal double-strand RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) I and II (aa 1-256), dsRBD I (aa 1-160), and dsRBD II (aa 161-256); the C-terminal regions from aa 953 to 1269 (with the RGG box), from aa 953 to 1160 (without the RGG box), and from aa 1161 to 1269 (the RGG box only); and the middle part from aa 257 to 1160 were produced as described previously (20Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and inserted into the pGEX-2T plasmid vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Co-purification of Human WRN and NDH II—A previously described protocol for the purification of bovine NDH II was followed to observe the possible co-purification of human NDH II and WRN (3Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extract was prepared from ∼100 g of cell pellet with 0.35 m NaCl in buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 10 mm Na2S2O5, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclear extracts were chromatographed on Bio-Rex 70 (50-ml bed volume), DEAE-Sepharose (10 ml), and phosphocellulose P-11 (2 ml), which were equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 10 mm Na2S2O5, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaCl. All columns were eluted with NaCl gradients from 50 to 500 mm. For chromatography on phosphocellulose, the column was first eluted with a NaCl gradient from 50 to 500 mm and then step-eluted with 500 mm NaCl. The fractions obtained were monitored by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies against bovine NDH II or WRN (antibody 200), both at a dilution of 1:1000. For Western blotting, proteins from the eluted fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry electroblotter. A biotinylated secondary antibody and a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (both at a dilution of 1:5000) were applied for immunodetection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Co-immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, HeLa cells (∼1 g of wet pellet) were suspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 15 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 5 μg/ml each of the proteinase inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The suspension was passed four times through a 25-gauge needle for cell opening, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the proteinase inhibitors listed above and then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min under rocking, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nucleoplasm) was divided into two equal parts and mixed with 10 μl of rabbit antiserum against bovine NDH II and the same amount of control rabbit serum or with 10 μg of goat (C-19) or rabbit (H-300) polyclonal antibody against human WRN (see above) and the same amount of control goat or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoprecipitation mixtures were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added to each mixture, followed by incubation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were finally collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed by recentrifugation three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the proteinase inhibitors listed above. Finally, the agarose pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer for Western blotting. Far-Western Blotting—Recombinant NDH II or WRN proteins were electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane as described above. The nitrocellulose membrane with immobilized proteins was incubated for 15 min in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl) containing 8 m urea. Ten subsequent dilution steps were used to remove the urea. Here, one-third of the buffer was replaced with one-third of Tris-buffered saline without urea; after each step, the membrane was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the nitrocellulose was incubated for 30 min in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). After washing the membrane three times with binding buffer for 5 min each, purified WRN protein or NDH II (∼0.2 μg/ml) was added to the binding buffer. After incubation with WRN or NDH II for 30 min, the binding of WRN to immobilized NDH II or vice versa was measured by immunodetection with the mouse monoclonal antibody against WRN or the rabbit antibody against NDH II at a dilution of 1:1000. ATPase Assay—The assay was performed in a mixture (10 μl) containing a given amount of WRN or NDH II (see Figs. 4 and 7); 0.2 mm ATP/[γ-32P]ATP or GTP/[γ-32P]GTP (∼50 cpm/pmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 120 μm (nucleotide) M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), activated calf thymus DNA, or poly(rI)·poly(rC) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 0.5% activated charcoal (Sigma) suspended in 0.3 m perchloric acid. After vigorously shaking the mixtures for 10 min, activated charcoal was spun down by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The 32Pi released in the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting.Fig. 7Interaction of NDH II with recombinant WRN-Exo. A, WRN-Exo binds to NDH II. Recombinant WRN proteins containing the exonuclease domain (WRN-Exo, aa 1-256) or the helicase domain (WRN-Hel, aa 478-944) were examined for binding to full-length NDH II by Far-Western blotting (see the legend to Fig. 3). B, WRN-Exo inhibits the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of NDH II. Panel a, WRN-Exo from bacterial extracts was purified on Ni-NTA-agarose, which was washed and eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole as indicated. Proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Panel b, increasing amounts of purified WRN-Exo were added to the assay mixtures to analyze the ATPase activity of NDH II in the presence of ssM13mp18 (•) or poly(rI)·poly(rC) (○). C, NDH II stimulates the exonuclease activity of WRN-Exo. Purified WRN-Exo was used for the exonuclease assay in the presence of increasing amounts of NDH II. nt, nucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Helicase Assay—The DNA unwinding activity of WRN or NDH II was measured with a partially hybridized M13mp18 ssDNA consisting of a DNA primer (45-mer) with 22 nucleotides in the duplex and 23 nucleotides as a 3′-non-complementary extension (3Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained a given amount of WRN or NDH II (see Fig. 5), 45 μm (nucleotide) DNA substrate with the primer labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 3 mm ATP or UTP (for NDH II) as described above for the ATPase assay. Unwinding was indicated by the displacement of the hybridized primer from M13mp18 ssDNA. This was observed after electrophoresis of the DNA through a nondenaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel (3Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactive signals were measured by ImageQuant after exposure of the gel to a Phosphor-Imager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Exonuclease Assay—The exonuclease activity of WRN was measured with the DNA substrate as described above for the DNA helicase assay. Alternatively, a “D-loop” substrate was constructed by three DNA oligonucleotides as depicted in Fig. 8A. The amounts of DNA substrates and the other reaction conditions were the same as those described for the helicase assay. DNA degradation was revealed by electrophoresis of the reaction products through a 7 m urea-14% polyacrylamide gel (20 × 40 cm) buffered with 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 1800 V for 90 min. Radioactive signals were scored by ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) as described above. Partial Co-purification of WRN with NDH II from Human Cells—Using the same method as described previously for the purification of NDH II from calf thymus (3Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4398-4407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed co-purification of WRN and NDH II from human cells (Fig. 1A). Human WRN displayed an overlapping elution peak with NDH II on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose (Fig. 1B). On phosphocellulose, WRN eluted at >500 mm NaCl, whereas the bulk of NDH II eluted at ∼200 mm (Fig. 1B). However, in addition to its elution at a lower salt concentration, there was a considerable amount of NDH II that co-purified with WRN in the high salt fractions on phosphocellulose (Fig. 1B). This result suggests a physical association between these two proteins. We also noticed that full-length recombinant WRN eluted from phosphocellulose at ∼200 mm NaCl (data not shown). The different elution of recombinant and native WRN on phosphocellulose might have been due to protein complex formation that altered the chromatography of WRN from nuclear extracts of human cells. To address this issue, we looked for other proteins and found that DNA polymerase δ and the ssDNA-binding protein RPA co-purified with WRN and NDH II and were also present in the high salt fractions of phosphocellulose (Fig. 1C). This supports the conclusion that both WRN and NDH II might form a nuclear protein complex that is involved in DNA replication and/or repair. WRN Co-immunoprecipitates with NDH II and DNA Polymerase δ—The physical association of WRN with NDH II was examined by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed to WRN or NDH II. As shown in Fig. 2A, WRN from HeLa nuclear extracts co-immunoprecipitated with NDH II. A similar result was also found when immunoprecipitations were carried out with an antibody against WRN (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we observed that the largest subunit (125 kDa) of DNA polymerase δ was present in the immunoprecipitates of WRN (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the finding that WRN co-purified with NDH II as well as with DNA polymerase δ (Fig. 1C). Full-length NDH II and Its N-terminal dsRBD II and C-terminal RGG Box Bind Directly to WRN—To confirm direct protein-protein interactions between WRN and NDH II, Far-Western blot experiments were performed. NDH II and WRN were expressed with recombinant baculoviruses and purified from infected insect cells. Recombinant WRN (Fig. 3A) bound to NDH II immobilized on nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE. This was not the case with bovine albumin used as a control (Fig. 3B). These results led to the conclusion that human WRN and NDH II may form physical contacts with each other. To map the parts of NDH II that support the physical interaction with WRN, we divided the NDH II cDNA into different fragments covering N-terminal dsRBDs I and II (aa 1-256), dsRBD I (aa 1-160), and dsRBD II (aa 161-256); the center of NDH II consisting of the helicase catalytic motifs (aa 257-1160); and the C-terminal regions with the RGG box (aa 953-1269), without the RGG box (aa 953-1160), and with the RGG box alone (aa 1161-1269) (Fig. 3C). These NDH II constructs were subcloned into plasmid pGEX-2T and expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria. The recombinant proteins obtained were utilized to examine binding to WRN by Far-Western blotting as described above. These experiments revealed two sites of the NDH II molecule that displayed a binding signal for WRN: one at the N terminus containing dsRBD II (aa 161-256) and the other at the C-terminal RGG box (aa 1161-1269). The combined dsRBDs I and II (aa 1-256) and the expanded C terminus including the RGG box (aa 953-1269) also displayed binding to WRN, in agreement with the presence of dsRBD II or the RGG box, whereas dsRBD I (aa 1-160) alone or the C-terminal region upstream of the RGG box (aa 953-1160) had no detectable affinity for WRN (Fig. 3C). Comparable results were obtained by pull-down experiments with purified GST fusion proteins containing dsRBD I (aa 1-160) or dsRBD II (aa 161-256) of NDH II. Here again, we observed binding of WRN to dsRBD II, but not to dsRBD I (Fig. 3D). WRN Inhibits the Nucleic Acid-dependent NTPase Activity of NDH II—Because of the physical interaction between WRN and NDH II, it was reasonable to ask whether these two proteins mutually affect each other as nucleic acid-dependent NT-Pases or helicases. This issue was first addressed by examining the nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity of NDH II and WRN. To this end, we measured the DNA-dependent ATPase levels in increasing amounts of WRN (0-2.1 pmol) in the absence or presence of NDH II (0.7 or 2.1 pmol) (Fig. 4A). This experiment showed that the absence or presence of NDH II did not significantly change the ATPase levels as measured for increasing amounts of WRN, suggesting that NDH II and WRN may not stimulate each other. Because WRN and NDH II both hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of DNA, the individual contribution of the two helicases to ATPase activity is difficult to determine. In our initial attempts to address this issue, we exploited the fact that NDH II is able to hydrolyze all four rNTPs or dNTPs (3Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas WRN uses only ATP or dATP. This difference between the two helicases enabled us to obtain evidence for inhibition of the nucleic acid-dependent GTPase activity of NDH II by WRN (data not shown). To further confirm this, we boiled WRN- or NDH II-containing solutions for 5 min and then observed the influence of heat-inactivated WRN on the DNA-dependent ATPase of native NDH II (Fig. 4B) or, conversely, the effect of heat-denatured NDH II on the DNA-dependent ATPase of native WRN (Fig. 4C). This demonstrated a striking inhibition of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of NDH II by denatured WRN, whereas no such effect could be detected by adding inactive NDH II to WRN in the DNA-dependent ATPase assay. These results led to the conclusion that heat-stable parts of WRN may interact with the nucleic acid-binding domains of NDH II and thereby decrease its NTPase activity. On the other hand, the NDH II-binding part of WRN is not necessary for its ATPase activity. NDH II-catalyzed DNA Unwinding Is Inhibited by the Presence of WRN—We next asked whether WRN might also suppress the helicase activity of NDH II as expected from the NTPase assays shown above. Using a partially hybridized double-stranded DNA as substrate, we could show that NDH II unwound DNA at an apparently lower rate compared with WRN (Fig. 5A). To further distinguish the effect of WRN on the DNA helicase activity of NDH II, we utilized UTP as a cofactor, which supports DNA unwinding catalyzed only by NDH II (3Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not by WRN. Under this condition, we observed that the presence of WRN diminished DNA unwinding by NDH II (Fig. 5B). This result is consistent with the above finding that WRN inhibited the DNA-dependent NTPase activity of NDH II. The Exonuclease Activity of WRN Is Stimulated by NDH II—In addition to its 3′ → 5′ helicase activity, WRN also carries 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity at its N terminus (19Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although we failed to observe stimulation or inhibition of the nucleic acid-dependent NTPase or helicase activity of WRN by NDH II, we asked whether NDH II affects the exonuclease activity of WRN. As expected, NDH II alone was devoid of any exonuclease activity, whereas under the same conditions, WRN degraded DNA in a 3′ → 5′ direction (Fig. 6A) (19Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, upon addition of NDH II to WRN, WRN exonuclease activity was significant stimulated (Fig. 6B). To identify the local region of WRN that is responsible for this functional interaction, we expressed recombinant WRN proteins containing its exonuclease domain (WRN-Exo, aa 1-256) or its helicase domain (WRN-Hel, aa 478-944). Far-Western blotting showed that the exonuclease domain (but not the helicase domain) of WRN displayed binding affinity for full-length NDH II (Fig. 7A). To examine the effect of the exonuclease domain of WRN on the enzymatic activity of NDH II, we purified WRN-Exo from bacterial extracts on Ni-NTA-agarose based on the presence of a His6 tag at its C terminus (Fig. 7B, panel a). Surprisingly, WRN-Exo inhibited the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of NDH II (Fig. 7B, panel b), similar to the already observed full-length (inactive) WRN enzyme (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the dsRNA-stimulated ATPase activity of NDH II was barely affected by WRN-Exo (Fig. 7B, panel b) or by full-length WRN (data not shown). Most important, NDH II also stimulated the exonuclease activity of WRN-Exo (Fig. 7C), as already observed for the exonuclease activity of full-length WRN (Fig. 6B). These results favor the conclusion that the exonuclease domain of WRN forms a direct contact with the dsRBD II and RGG box of NDH II and that this probably mediates the observed functional interactions between the two proteins. NDH II Promotes the Degradation of D-loop DNA by WRN—Next, we examined whether the stimulatory effect of NDH II on the WRN exonuclease is also observed for D-loop DNA reminiscent of a recombination intermediate occurring in vivo (Fig. 8A). WRN was indeed able to degrade the invading primer from the 3′-end within an unpaired D-loop region. Moreover, degradation was stimulated by the presence of NDH II (Fig. 8B). Also with this assay, we attempted to differentiate the contribution of a nucleic acid-binding domain from NDH II to D-loop degradation by WRN. Previously, we were able"
