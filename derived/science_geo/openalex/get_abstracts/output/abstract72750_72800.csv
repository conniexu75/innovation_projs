https://openalex.org/W1484967098,"Abstract Synaptosomes from guinea pig brain were incubated with 3H-methylcholine and then subjected to a chromatographic assay which distinguishes nonspecific entry from specific transport. Nonspecific entry of labeled choline into synaptosomes was linear with added substrate, but specific uptake exhibited saturation kinetics. Kt, the concentration for the half-maximal specific transport of choline into synaptosomes was 8.3 x 10-5 m. Under standard conditions the rate of specific transport of choline was linear with time and protein concentration, and there was a marked temperature dependence. The pH optimum was about 8.6. Choline transport did not require added monovalent nor divalent cations, some of which were potent inhibitors. Nucleotides did not have a specific effect. Choline uptake as measured in this system did not appear to be energy dependent. Reagents which attack sulfhydryl groups were effective inhibitors. Hemicholinium-3 was a competitive inhibitor of specific choline transport with a Ki of 4 x 10-5 m. Nonspecific uptake was unaffected by hemicholinium-3. After entry into synaptosomes, 60% of the radioactivity could be recovered as choline, 11% as phosphorylcholine, and 10% as betaine. Acetylcholine constituted less than 5% of the labeled cation. The conversion of 3H-choline to phosphorylcholine and betaine was largely abolished by hemicholinium-3."
https://openalex.org/W1862213828,"Abstract The substrate specificity of 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase from rat liver microsomes for both acylcoenzyme A and 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate has been determined at levels below the critical micelle concentrations of the substrates. The fatty acid of the acylglycerol 3-phosphate is not important, but for the acyl-CoAs the specificity is oleyl g palmitoleyl ≃ linoleyl ≃ palmityl g myristyl g stearyl g lauryl. 1-Acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase appears to work only with monomeric substrates. The Km for palmityl-CoA is less than 0.1 µm, while the Km values for the 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphates are in the low micromolar range (5 to 25 µm), but are difficult to measure accurately because micelles form at 4 to 8 µm 1-acylglycerol-3-P and the velocity ceases to increase. By contrast, acyl-CoA hydrolase appears to prefer micelles as substrate. This enzyme shows little activity at 3 µm acyl-CoA, and shows 8 times more activity with palmityl-CoA than with any other acyl-CoA tested. In order to plan the specificity studies, the critical micelle concentrations of the acyl-CoAs and 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphates used were determined by the dye adsorption technique with pinacyanol chloride. For acyl-CoAs in 6.7 mm phosphate, 10 mm K+, pH 6.9, the values were: lauryl, 9.5 µm; myristyl, 4 µm; palmityl, 3.6 (4 µm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 6 µm in deionized water); palmitoleyl, 2 µm; stearyl, 2 µm; oleyl, 4.5 µm; linoleyl, 5.5 µm. For 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphates in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, the values were: myristyl, 120 µm; palmityl, 35 µm; stearyl, 7 µm; oleyl, 23 µm; linoleyl, 34 µm; 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate prepared from egg lecithin (80% palmitic), 37 µm."

https://openalex.org/W1988640909,"Glutathione reductase of hemolyzates from clinically normal subjects is activated by the addition of flavin-adenine dinucleotide. One-half maximum stimulation could be achieved by approximately 0.02 micromolar flavin-adenine dinucleotide; prior addition of adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, or adenosine mnonophosphate prevented activation. Stimulation of glutathione reductase activity of red cells of normal subjects occurred when they were given 5 milligrams of riboflavin daily for 8 days. The degree of stimulation in vitro by flavin-adenine dinucleotide and in vivo by riboflavin was inversely proportional to dietary intake of riboflavin. The variety of clinical disorders which have been associated with glutathione reductase deficiency may have, as a common denominator, abnormalities in flavin-adenine dinucleotide formation."
https://openalex.org/W1507302564,"Abstract The transglutaminase-catalyzed hydrolysis and transfer reactions have been studied kinetically in the forward direction at pH 8 in the presence of a 0.1 m level of the activating metal ion, Ca++. Isotope exchange and product inhibition studies were also conducted. The initial velocity, product inhibition, and isotope exchange patterns are consistent with a ping pong mechanism in which (a) glutamine substrate binds to enzyme in a binary complex, (b) ammonia dissociates with the formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate, and (c) acyl group is transferred from enzyme either to acceptor amine to form γ-glutamyl-amine product (transfer), or to water to form glutamic acid product (hydrolysis). A gel filtration study that shows binding of amine to enzyme only in the presence of glutamine substrate complements this proposed ping pong mechanism. Values have been estimated for all except two of the Michaelis and dissociation constants involved in combination of substrates and products with the enzyme forms, i.e. free or acyl enzymes, with which they bind. The transfer reaction in the reverse direction has been shown chromatographically."
https://openalex.org/W1597414374,"Abstract The administration of δ-aminolevulinic acid-3,5-3H to immature male rats leads to the incorporation of radioactivity into the hemoprotein contained in the (steapsin-treated microsomes which do not contain cytochrome b5). A biphasic decrease in the radioactivity incorporated into the hemoprotein in both control and 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats was observed. Half-life determinations of the fast phase component (7 to 8 hours) and the slow phase component (46 to 48 hours) indicated that 3-methylcholanthrene treatment did not change the half-life of either hemoprotein fraction but did change the proportion of the fast phase component to the slow phase component from 3.8:1 to 1:1. Determination of the heme content of the CO-binding particles has indicated that treatment of rats with 3-methylcholanthrene leads to a 3- to 4-fold increase in the slow phase component, while not affecting the concentration of the fast phase component."
https://openalex.org/W2005230052,"The blood of a patient with a deficiency of hexokinase in the red cells and a decreased concentration of 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cells showed an increased affinity for oxygen, whereas a patient with a deficiency of pyruvate kinase and an elevated concentration of 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cells had blood with a decreased affinity for oxygen. Defects in red cell glycolysis may alter the oxygen affinity of blood by virtue of their effect on 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations in red cells."

https://openalex.org/W2025574426,Bilateral cuts between the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus in female rats consistently produced hyperphagia. Hyperphagia occurred slightly less reliably when one of the cuts entered the ventromedial hypothalamus and only infrequently if one entered the lateral hypothalamus. The results are consistent with other evidence that suggests that fibers originating medially stop eating by inhibiting cells in the lateral hypothalamus.

The fine structure of the liver cells from the first group appeared normal, except for an increase in the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In the second group, however, there were many cases with striking changes-altered shape, increase in size, and presence of paracrystalline inclusions-in the mitochondria. No significant correlation between mitochondrial changes and alterations in liver function was detected."
https://openalex.org/W2080466313,"Mammary glands were transplanted from donors treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene to untreated isologous recipients. Incidence of mammary tumors in mammary grafts from 56-day-old donors was significantly higher than that in grafts from 120-day-old donors, regardless of the age of the recipient hosts. When mammary glands were transplanted from untreated donors to isologous recipients that subsequently received 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, a similar difference in tumor incidence in the grafts was observed. In contrast to mammary glands of older females, mammary glands of young adult female rats are highly vulnerable to the carcinogenic effect of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene."

The terminal three-carbon residues arising from beta-oxidation of these acids are glucogenic and help to counteract the decreases in liver glycogen and serum glucose ordinarily induced by prolonged fasting.
https://openalex.org/W1625644948,The combination of pyridoxamine 5-phosphate with the apoprotein of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase has been followed by measuring the quenching of protein fluorescence associated with complex formation. The reaction takes place in two steps; an initial rapid decrease in protein fluorescence is followed by a slow quenching process which parallels the recovery of catalytic activity. Similar delay in fluorescence decrease has been observed when pyridoxamine 5-phosphate fluorescence was immediately recorded after addition of apoprotein. These studies suggest that the slow decrease in fluorescence is associated with a change in protein conformation which is required for the formation of active species in solution. The interaction between pyridoxine 5-phosphate and the apoprotein was also examined by fluorescence spectroscopy and the results were compared with the inhibitory action of pyridoxamine 5-phosphate on the reconstitution of the holoenzyme.

The amount of eating elicited by norepinephrine and by chlorpromazine is reliably correlated. These results suggest that endogenous norepinephrine mediates eating elicited by centrally injected chlorpromazine."

https://openalex.org/W1515846236,"Abstract Cell-free extracts of a number of mycobacteria catalyzed the synthesis of trehalose phosphate from either uridine diphosphate-d-glucose or guanosine diphosphate-d-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. A cell-free extract of Mycobacterium smegmatis was separated into two fractions by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Fraction 1 catalyzed trehalose synthesis from GDP-glucose but was relatively inactive with UDP-glucose. However, when Fraction 2 was added to Fraction 1, UDP-glucose was able to serve as an effective glucosyl donor for trehalose synthesis. Under these conditions, GDP-glucose was still active, but less so than with Fraction 1 alone. Fraction 2 had no detectable enzymatic activity and had the following properties. (a) It was heat-stable and gave a typical RNA ultraviolet absorption spectrum, (b) it was orcinol-positive and diphenylamine-negative, and was inactivated by incubation with RNase, (c) it was retained on a 50,000 molecular weight filter but passed through a 100,000 filter. Fraction 2 could be replaced by crude α-lactalbumin but not by purified lactalbumin, lysozyme, serum albumin, or a number of other proteins. The active component of crude lactalbumin, isolated by phenol extraction, was found to be susceptible to RNase. Although Fraction 2 was quite active in causing UDP-glucose utilization, it could be replaced to a greater or lesser extent by polyuridylic acid, the RNA fraction of α-lactalbumin, or the RNA fraction of M. smegmatis. The activity of each of these was destroyed by treatment with RNase. Purified yeast RNA, yeast transfer RNA, polyadenylic acid, UTP and UMP were all inactive or only slightly active when tested at various concentrations. UDP was somewhat active at high concentrations, apparently because of polynucleotide phosphorylase. The dephosphorylated products formed from either UDP-glucose-14C and Fractions 1 and 2, or GDP-glucose-14C and Fraction 1 were identified as α,α-trehalose since they were stable to alkali, had the same chromatographic mobility as trehalose in several solvents, were hydrolyzed to glucose by a specific trehalase, and their octaacetate derivatives cocrystallized to constant specific activity with authentic α,α-trehalose octaacetate."

Using mice it was found that after intraperitoneal stimulation with sheep erythrocytes the number of milk spots on the omentum was markedly increased1. These milk spots represent accumulations of varying numbers of lymphoid cells and macrophages. By a modification of the local haemolysis in gel technique it was shown that large milk spots produced haemolytic antibodies against sheep erythrocytes1. After repeated stimulation, clusters of plasma cells could be identified in the vicinity of relatively large milk spots. In some experiments the omenta were explanted into tissue culture, and continued to produce antibody in vitro for more than 60 days2."
