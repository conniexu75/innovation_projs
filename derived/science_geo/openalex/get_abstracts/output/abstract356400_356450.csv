https://openalex.org/W2157645703,"Tissue culture of immortal cell strains from diseased patients is an invaluable resource for medical research but is largely limited to tumor cell lines or transformed derivatives of native tissues. Here we describe the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patients with a variety of genetic diseases with either Mendelian or complex inheritance; these diseases include adenosine deaminase deficiency-related severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS), Gaucher disease (GD) type III, Duchenne (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), juvenile-onset, type 1 diabetes mellitus (JDM), Down syndrome (DS)/trisomy 21, and the carrier state of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Such disease-specific stem cells offer an unprecedented opportunity to recapitulate both normal and pathologic human tissue formation in vitro, thereby enabling disease investigation and drug development."

https://openalex.org/W4232123484,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for normal embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and cellular differentiation, but how miRNA gene expression is controlled by the key transcriptional regulators of ES cells has not been established. We describe here the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of ES cells that incorporates protein-coding and miRNA genes based on high-resolution ChIP-seq data, systematic identification of miRNA promoters, and quantitative sequencing of short transcripts in multiple cell types. We find that the key ES cell transcription factors are associated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed in ES cells and with promoters for a set of silent miRNA genes. This silent set of miRNA genes is co-occupied by Polycomb group proteins in ES cells and shows tissue-specific expression in differentiated cells. These data reveal how key ES cell transcription factors promote the ES cell miRNA expression program and integrate miRNAs into the regulatory circuitry controlling ES cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W1972618720,"The tumor suppressor p53 is activated upon genotoxic and oxidative stress and in turn inhibits cell proliferation and growth through induction of specific target genes. Cell growth is positively regulated by mTOR, whose activity is inhibited by the TSC1:TSC2 complex. Although genotoxic stress has been suggested to inhibit mTOR via p53-mediated activation of mTOR inhibitors, the precise mechanism of this link was unknown. We now demonstrate that the products of two p53 target genes, Sestrin1 and Sestrin2, activate the AMP-responsive protein kinase (AMPK) and target it to phosphorylate TSC2 and stimulate its GAP activity, thereby inhibiting mTOR. Correspondingly, Sestrin2-deficient mice fail to inhibit mTOR signaling upon genotoxic challenge. Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 therefore provide an important link between genotoxic stress, p53 and the mTOR signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1971999279,"At synapses between cortical pyramidal neurons and principal striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), postsynaptic D1 and D2 dopamine (DA) receptors are postulated to be necessary for the induction of long-term potentiation and depression, respectively-forms of plasticity thought to underlie associative learning. Because these receptors are restricted to two distinct MSN populations, this postulate demands that synaptic plasticity be unidirectional in each cell type. Using brain slices from DA receptor transgenic mice, we show that this is not the case. Rather, DA plays complementary roles in these two types of MSN to ensure that synaptic plasticity is bidirectional and Hebbian. In models of Parkinson's disease, this system is thrown out of balance, leading to unidirectional changes in plasticity that could underlie network pathology and symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2013142139,"Our ability to remember what we have seen is very limited. Most current views characterize this limit as a fixed number of items—only four objects—that can be held in visual working memory. We show that visual memory capacity is not fixed by the number of objects, but rather is a limited resource that is shared out dynamically between all items in the visual scene. This resource can be shifted flexibly between objects, with allocation biased by selective attention and toward targets of upcoming eye movements. The proportion of resources allocated to each item determines the precision with which it is remembered, a relation that we show is governed by a simple power law, allowing quantitative estimates of resource distribution in a scene."

https://openalex.org/W2117698690,"Evaluation of the therapeutic potential of RNAi for HIV infection has been hampered by the challenges of siRNA delivery and lack of suitable animal models. Using a delivery method for T cells, we show that siRNA treatment can dramatically suppress HIV infection. A CD7-specific single-chain antibody was conjugated to oligo-9-arginine peptide (scFvCD7-9R) for T cell-specific siRNA delivery in NOD/SCIDIL2rgamma-/- mice reconstituted with human lymphocytes (Hu-PBL) or CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (Hu-HSC). In HIV-infected Hu-PBL mice, treatment with anti-CCR5 (viral coreceptor) and antiviral siRNAs complexed to scFvCD7-9R controlled viral replication and prevented the disease-associated CD4 T cell loss. This treatment also suppressed endogenous virus and restored CD4 T cell counts in mice reconstituted with HIV+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, scFvCD7-9R could deliver antiviral siRNAs to naive T cells in Hu-HSC mice and effectively suppress viremia in infected mice. Thus, siRNA therapy for HIV infection appears to be feasible in a preclinical animal model."

Analysis of the assembled sequence unequivocally establishes that the Neandertal mtDNA falls outside the variation of extant human mtDNAs, and allows an estimate of the divergence date between the two mtDNA lineages of 660,000 ± 140,000 years. Of the 13 proteins encoded in the mtDNA, subunit 2 of cytochrome c oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain has experienced the largest number of amino acid substitutions in human ancestors since the separation from Neandertals. There is evidence that purifying selection in the Neandertal mtDNA was reduced compared with other primate lineages, suggesting that the effective population size of Neandertals was small.

Although it is well established that Neandertals are the hominid form most closely related to present-day humans, their exact relationship with modern humans remains a topic of debate (Hublin and Pääbo, 2006Hublin J.J.

Molecular genetic data first spoke to this issue in 1997, when a 379 base pair section of the hypervariable region I (HVRI) of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) was determined from the Neandertal-type specimen found in 1856 in Neander Valley, near Düsseldorf, Germany (Krings et al., 1997Krings M.

Since then, a total of 15 complete or partial Neandertal HVRI sequences, as well as two HVRII sequences (Krings et al., 1999Krings M. Geisert H. Schmitz R.W. Krainitzki H. Pääbo S.

Phylogenetic analyses of these suggest that Neandertal mtDNA falls outside the variation of modern human mtDNA. Since the mtDNA genome is maternally inherited without recombination, these results indicate that Neandertals made no lasting contribution to the modern human mtDNA gene pool (Krings et al., 1997Krings M.

High-throughput 454 sequencing techniques have recently been applied to ancient DNA (Green et al., 2006Green R.E. Krause J. Ptak S.E. Briggs A.W. Ronan M.T. Simons J.F. Du L. Egholm M. Rothberg J.M.

These methods open new possibilities for the retrieval of ancient DNA that has hitherto relied either on the cloning of random molecules in bacteria (Higuchi et al., 1984Higuchi R. Bowman B.

The main benefit of the 454 sequencing technique is the sheer volume of sequence data that make it practical to undertake genome-scale ancient DNA sequencing projects. This is particularly feasible for mitochondrial genomes (Gilbert et al., 2007Gilbert M.T. Tomsho L.P. Rendulic S. Packard M. Drautz D.I. Sher A. Tikhonov A. Dalen L. Kuznetsova T. Kosintsev P. et al.Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of mitochondria from ancient hair shafts.Science. 2007; 317: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), given their smaller size relative to the nuclear genome and their abundance in cells, where, typically, several hundred mtDNAs per nuclear genome exist. The 454 sequence data from ancient DNA have also allowed an increased understanding of DNA diagenesis (i.e., how DNA is modified during deposition in a burial context). In particular, they have allowed a quantitative model of how DNA degradation and chemical modification occurs, and how the effects of these processes interact with the molecular manipulations used to generate sequencing libraries (Briggs et al., 2007Briggs A.W. Stenzel U. Johnson P.L. Green R.E. Kelso J. Prufer K. Meyer M. Krause J. Ronan M.T. Lachmann M. Pääbo S. Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14616-14621Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Notably, although it was previously known that a high rate of cytosine deamination occurs in ancient DNA (Hofreiter et al., 2001Hofreiter M. Jaenicke V. Serre D. Haeseler Av A. Pääbo S. DNA sequences from multiple amplifications reveal artifacts induced by cytosine deamination in ancient DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4793-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), it has become clear that this is particularly prevalent in the ends of the ancient molecules, presumably because these are often single stranded (Briggs et al., 2007Briggs A.W. Stenzel U. Johnson P.L. Green R.E. Kelso J. Prufer K. Meyer M. Krause J. Ronan M.T. Lachmann M. Pääbo S. Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14616-14621Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Deamination of cytosine residues results in uracil residues that are read as thymine by DNA polymerases, leading to a high rate of C-to-T transitions. A high rate of G-to-A transitions observed near the 3′ ends of sequence reads is thought to be caused by deaminated cytosine residues on the complementary strands used as templates during the fill-in reaction to create blunt ends when sequencing libraries are constructed (Briggs et al., 2007Briggs A.W. Stenzel U. Johnson P.L. Green R.E. Kelso J. Prufer K. Meyer M. Krause J. Ronan M.T. Lachmann M. Pääbo S. Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14616-14621Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). By 454 sequencing, we have generated 34.9-fold coverage of the Neandertal mtDNA genome from a Neandertal bone (Vindija bone 33.16) excavated in 1980 from Vindija Cave, Croatia (Malez and Ullrich, 1982Malez M. Ullrich H. Neuere plaäanthropologische untersuchungen am material aus der höhle vindija.Palaeontologia Jugoslavia. 1982; 29: 1-44Google Scholar). It has been dated to 38,310 ± 2130 years before present (Serre et al., 2004Serre D. Langaney A. Chech M. Teschler-Nicola M. Paunovic M. Mennecier P. Hofreiter M. Possnert G. Pääbo S. No evidence of Neandertal mtDNA contribution to early modern humans.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e57https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020057Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Previously, the mtDNA HVRI sequence of this bone has been determined (Serre et al., 2004Serre D. Langaney A. Chech M. Teschler-Nicola M. Paunovic M. Mennecier P. Hofreiter M. Possnert G. Pääbo S. No evidence of Neandertal mtDNA contribution to early modern humans.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e57https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020057Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), as well as 2414 bp of mtDNA sequences by 454 sequencing (Green et al., 2006Green R.E. Krause J. Ptak S.E. Briggs A.W. Ronan M.T. Simons J.F. Du L. Egholm M. Rothberg J.M. Paunovic M. Pääbo S. Analysis of one million base pairs of Neanderthal DNA.Nature. 2006; 444: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Here, we present its complete mtDNA sequence, as well as the insights it allows into recent human and Neandertal mtDNA evolution. Three DNA extracts, each from 100–200 mg of a Neandertal bone (Vindija 33.16) were prepared in our cleanroom facility where several precautions against DNA contamination are implemented (Experimental Procedures). These include complete separation from other parts of the laboratories, direct delivery of all equipment and reagents to the facility, positive pressure generated with filtered air that excludes particles larger than 0.2 μm, and UV irradiation and bleach treatment of all surfaces. The bone surface was removed prior to extraction. However, the interior of bones is also often contaminated with modern human DNA, presumably due to past washing and other treatments of Neandertal bones. Thus, we analyzed each extract for contamination by extant human mtDNA by PCR with primers flanking positions in the HVRI that distinguish extant humans from Neandertals (Green et al., 2006Green R.E. Krause J. Ptak S.E. Briggs A.W. Ronan M.T. Simons J.F. Du L. Egholm M. Rothberg J.M. Paunovic M. Pääbo S. Analysis of one million base pairs of Neanderthal DNA.Nature. 2006; 444: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and amplify both types of mtDNA with similar efficiencies. Following amplification, we cloned the PCR product and sequenced 103–112 clones to determine the ratio of Neandertal to extant human mtDNA. The contamination rate in the three extracts ranged from 0%–0.9% (see Figure S1 available online). From these extracts, we generated a total of nine 454 libraries in the cleanroom facility with 454 adapters with a Neandertal-specific sequence key that is unique to this project, and thus unequivocally identifies each sequence determined as derived from the extract of a Neandertal bone (Briggs et al., 2007Briggs A.W. Stenzel U. Johnson P.L. Green R.E. Kelso J. Prufer K. Meyer M. Krause J. Ronan M.T. Lachmann M. Pääbo S. Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14616-14621Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This allows detection of any contamination that may be introduced in subsequent handling and sequencing steps outside the cleanroom. To maximize the library and sequence yield, we incorporate two modifications to the standard 454 protocol that reduce the need to perform titration runs of libraries (Meyer et al., 2008Meyer M. Briggs A.W. Maricic T. Hober B. Hoffner B. Krause J. Weihmann A. Pääbo S. Hofreiter M. From micrograms to picograms: quantitative PCR reduces the material demands of high-throughput sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e5https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and allow more molecules to be retrieved during library preparation (Maricic and Pääbo, unpublished results). From these libraries, we generated a total of 39 million sequence reads by 147 runs on the GS FLX sequencing platform. Bases were called with the standard 454 signal threshold and filtering criteria with minor modifications tailored for short, ancient sequence reads (Meyer et al., 2008Meyer M. Briggs A.W. Maricic T. Hober B. Hoffner B. Krause J. Weihmann A. Pääbo S. Hofreiter M. From micrograms to picograms: quantitative PCR reduces the material demands of high-throughput sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e5https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Neandertal sequences were identified within each run as described previously (Green et al., 2006Green R.E. Krause J. Ptak S.E. Briggs A.W. Ronan M.T. Simons J.F. Du L. Egholm M. Rothberg J.M. Paunovic M. Pääbo S. Analysis of one million base pairs of Neanderthal DNA.Nature. 2006; 444: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), with the chief criterion being sequence similarity to a primate genome. mtDNA sequences were identified from these with further criteria (see Experimental Procedures), including similarity to the human mtDNA at least as great as to any nuclear DNA sequence. While the total fraction of sequences that are identified as Neandertal varied across libraries and library pools, the ratio of putative Neandertal nuclear DNA sequences to mtDNA sequences varied little among these libraries, and averaged 171. This corresponds to ∼2100 mtDNA molecules per cell. In total, 8341 mtDNA sequences were identified. They are of an average length of 69.4 bp (SD = 26.4), with the shortest fragment identified being 30 bp (limited by the length cut-off in the analysis pipeline), and the longest fragment being 278 bp (limited by the flow cycles performed on the GS FLX instrument). Ancient DNA sequences present a challenge for DNA sequence assembly since they are typically short and exhibit high rates of nucleotide misincorporation. A further complication is that pyrosequencing (Ronaghi et al., 1998Ronaghi M. Uhlen M. Nyren P. A sequencing method based on real-time pyrophosphate.Science. 1998; 281: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), for example, as performed on the GS FLX platform, calls long polymers of the same base with reduced accuracy. With these issues in mind, we designed an assembly procedure for ancient DNA. In short, each sequence identified as mtDNA was aligned over its entire length to the human reference mtDNA sequence (UCSC build hg18). These alignments were then merged, and each alignment column was examined to determine the majority base, yielding an assembled mtDNA sequence. Homopolymer lengths at positions where the reference human carries ≥5 identical bases were determined by analysis of the raw signal distributions as described in the Supplemental Data. Following this examination, some problematic regions remained in the assembly. These include four regions of a total length of 20 bp, where no sequence coverage existed, eight other regions amounting to a total of 117 bp covered by only single reads, nine positions where no majority base existed due to low coverage, and 31 homopolymers for which the data were not sufficient to determine their length. These regions were amplified by PCR from a Vindija 33.16 bone extract in two-step multiplex PCRs (Krause et al., 2006Krause J. Dear P.H. Pollack J.L. Slatkin M. Spriggs H. Barnes I. Lister A.M. Ebersberger I. Pääbo S. Hofreiter M. Multiplex amplification of the mammoth mitochondrial genome and the evolution of Elephantidae.Nature. 2006; 439: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), cloned, and sequenced by Sanger technology in order to complete the assembly (Experimental Procedures). We then reapplied our mtDNA fragment detection pipeline to all Neandertal DNA sequences determined from the bone, but compared them to the assembled Neandertal mtDNA instead of the reference human mtDNA. This resulted in the detection of an additional 721 mtDNA sequences that were initially missed, since they have a higher similarity to the human nuclear genome than human mtDNA, and thus could only be identified with the assembled Neandertal mtDNA. Interestingly, 522 of these sequences were similar to a single nuclear mtDNA insertion on chromosome 1 (hg18, position 554,327–560,165). In total, 8341 mtDNA fragments totaling 578,733 nt yielded a final assembly of 16,565 nt, where no position has less than 9-fold sequence coverage. In order to estimate the level of human contamination among the mtDNA sequences determined from these libraries, we realigned the individual sequences to the assembled mtDNA and used a number of differences between the putative Neandertal and human mtDNAs as diagnostic markers. We then examined each alignment to determine if it contained a position that allowed it to be classified as of either Neandertal or extant human origin. First, we used three human-Neandertal differences in the HVRI: an A-to-T and a C-to-A transversion, and an insertion of an A where all Neandertal sequences determined to date, including Vindija 33.16 (Serre et al., 2004Serre D. Langaney A. Chech M. Teschler-Nicola M. Paunovic M. Mennecier P. Hofreiter M. Possnert G. Pääbo S. No evidence of Neandertal mtDNA contribution to early modern humans.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e57https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020057Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), differ from all 1865 contemporary human HVRI sequences available in the mtDB database (Ingman and Gyllensten, 2006Ingman M. Gyllensten U. mtDB: Human Mitochondrial Genome Database, a resource for population genetics and medical sciences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D749-D751Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Forty three sequences overlapped these HVRI positions, and all were of the Neandertal type (Figure 1). Second, we used four transversions between the putative Neandertal mtDNA and human mtDNAs that occur outside the HVRI and are neither adjacent to homopolymers nor polymorphic among the 1865 human mtDNA sequences. Among 192 sequences that overlapped these positions, 186 carried the base of the Neandertal assembly (Figure S2). Of the six sequences that did not, five were cases in which the observed base was T, the assembly base was C, and the modern human base was G or A. Thus, these are likely to be the result of deaminated cytosine residues that are common in ancient DNA (Hofreiter et al., 2001Hofreiter M. Jaenicke V. Serre D. Haeseler Av A. Pääbo S. DNA sequences from multiple amplifications reveal artifacts induced by cytosine deamination in ancient DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4793-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, Briggs et al., 2007Briggs A.W.

The alternative that these are contamination by a previously unknown modern human mtDNA sequence is unlikely because of the large number of modern human sequences available. One single sequence matches the human base at a diagnostic position. Interestingly, this sequence shows features commonly associated with ancient DNA (Figure S2) in that it begins with a C-to-T mismatch to the assembly, ends with two G-to-A mismatches, and is 65 nucleotides long, and thus relatively short. In spite of this, it may represent a contaminant, since modern DNA sequences retrieved from ancient specimens can carry such features (Sampietro et al., 2006Sampietro M.L. Gilbert M.T. Lao O.

In order to estimate contamination levels, we thus disregard the five C-to-T mismatches as uninformative and count the last sequence as a contaminant. This yields a total of 229 out of 230 sequences carrying Neandertal diagnostic positions, and an estimate of the contamination rate of 0.4% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.01%–2.4%. In order to maximize our power to detect contamination, we also used all positions in the Neandertal assembly that differ from extant humans and for which at least 99% of a panel of 311 worldwide modern human mtDNA sequences do not differ, ignoring positions that could be due to cytosine deamination. A total of 133 positions fulfilled these criteria and allowed 1963 fragments to be classified. Nine were of extant human origin, yielding a contamination estimate of 0.5% (95% CI = 0.21%–0.87%). We conclude that so few of the mtDNA sequences determined derive from extant humans that they will not compromise the assembly, which has a 35-fold average coverage. The assembled mtDNA sequence, therefore, represents a reliable reconstruction of the mtDNA that this Neandertal individual carried when alive. Alignment of the 16,565 nt Neandertal mtDNA to the 16,568 nt human revised Cambridge reference mtDNA sequence (rCRS) (Andrews et al., 1999Andrews R.M. Kubacka I. Chinnery P.F. Lightowlers R.N. Turnbull D.M. Howell N. Reanalysis and revision of the Cambridge reference sequence for human mitochondrial DNA.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) revealed 206 differences (195 transitions and 11 transversions). In the noncoding control region, the Neandertal sequence contains a deletion of four base pairs (CACA) at rCRS position 514 and a previously known insertion of one base pair (Serre et al., 2004Serre D. Langaney A. Chech M. Teschler-Nicola M. Paunovic M. Mennecier P. Hofreiter M. Possnert G. Pääbo S. No evidence of Neandertal mtDNA contribution to early modern humans.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e57https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020057Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) following position 16,263. The 13 protein-coding genes, the 22 tRNA genes, and two rRNA genes in the Neandertal mtDNA lack notable structural differences when compared to the human and chimpanzee mtDNAs (Table S2). Figure 2A shows the distribution of pairwise sequence differences among 53 humans from around the world (Ingman et al., 2000Ingman M. Kaessmann H. Pääbo S. Gyllensten U. Mitochondrial genome variation and the origin of modern humans.Nature. 2000; 408: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), between these and the Neandertal, and between the modern humans and the chimpanzee mtDNAs. Among the humans, the number of differences ranges from 2 to 118, and is bimodal. The peak with a mode around 99 differences contains comparisons that involve at least one member of deep clades containing sub-Saharan African mtDNA. The peak with a mode around 44 differences involves comparisons between individuals outside these clades. By contrast, the number of differences between human mtDNAs and the Neandertal mtDNA ranges from 201 to 234, and is unimodal. Thus, the Neandertal mtDNA falls outside the variation of extant humans, even when nucleotide differences, uncorrected for multiple substitutions, are counted. Notably, when the comparisons are restricted to only the HVRI or HVRII, the distributions of pairwise differences among extant humans and between humans and the Neandertal overlap, illustrating that multiple substitutions complicate the reconstruction of mtDNA relationships when only these regions are studied (Figures 2B and 2C). To further explore the evolutionary relationship between Neandertal and extant human mtDNAs, we estimated a phylogenetic tree with the complete mtDNA of Neandertal, 53 human mtDNAs, the human rCRS, and chimpanzee and bonobo mtDNAs as outgroups. Neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, parsimony, and a Bayesian approach (Supplemental Data) all indicated that the 54 extant humans formed a monophyletic group to the exclusion of the Neandertal, with complete support for each tree-building measure (100% bootstrap support; 1.0 posterior probability). Unsurprisingly, this topology is also found when analysis is restricted to various subsets of the sequence, such as protein-coding sequences and RNA-coding sequences (Supplemental Data). In order to estimate the date of the divergence of the Neandertal and extant human mtDNAs, we compared the Neandertal mtDNA to 10 divergent human mtDNAs (Figure 3A), and tested if we could reject a molecular clock assuming the topology of the Bayesian tree (see Supplemental Data). This was not the case, indicating no significant heterogeneity in evolutionary rates among the sequences. To allow divergences of mtDNA sequences to be transformed to calendar years, we assumed—based on the fossil record—that humans and chimpanzees diverged between six (Galik et al., 2004Galik K. Senut B. Pickford M. Gommery D. Treil J. Kuperavage A.J. Eckhardt R.B.

USA. 2008; 105: 3226-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This results is an estimate of the mean divergence time between Neandertal and extant human mtDNAs of 660,000, with a 95% credibility interval of 520,000–800,000 years ago (Figure 3B) (see also Supplemental Data), which overlaps with previous estimates based on HVRI and II sequences (Krings et al., 1997Krings M.

Since the width of the divergence credibility interval increases almost linearly with the posterior mean of the divergence estimate (Figure S5), further sequence data would be unlikely to decrease the width of the credibility interval (Yang and Rannala, 2006Yang Z.

However, if the estimated date of the divergence between humans and chimpanzees, or current assumptions about how the mtDNA evolves, were found to be incorrect, the estimates in calendar years of the divergence of the Neandertal and human mtDNAs would need to be revised. Next, we estimated the substitutions that occurred in each of the 13 mtDNA p"

However, our understanding of the molecular interaction of such flaviviruses with mammalian host cells is limited. WNV encodes only 10 proteins, implying that it may use many cellular proteins for infection. WNV enters the cytoplasm through pH-dependent endocytosis, undergoes cycles of translation and replication, assembles progeny virions in association with endoplasmic reticulum, and exits along the secretory pathway. RNA interference (RNAi) presents a powerful forward genetics approach to dissect virus-host cell interactions. Here we report the identification of 305 host proteins that affect WNV infection, using a human-genome-wide RNAi screen. Functional clustering of the genes revealed a complex dependence of this virus on host cell physiology, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular pathways for successful infection. We further demonstrate a requirement for the ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 in WNV internalization, a post-entry role for the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway in viral infection, and the monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT4 as a viral replication resistance factor. By extending this study to dengue virus, we show that flaviviruses have both overlapping and unique interaction strategies with host cells. This study provides a comprehensive molecular portrait of WNV-human cell interactions that forms a model for understanding single plus-stranded RNA virus infection, and reveals potential antiviral targets."

Distinct GABAergic connections within visual cortex determine the timing of the critical period for rewiring ocular dominance to establish visual acuity. We find that maturation of the parvalbumin (PV)-cell network that controls plasticity onset is regulated by a selective re-expression of the embryonic Otx2 homeoprotein. Visual experience promoted the accumulation of non-cell-autonomous Otx2 in PV-cells, and cortical infusion of exogenous Otx2 accelerated both PV-cell development and critical period timing. Conversely, conditional removal of Otx2 from non-PV cells or from the visual pathway abolished plasticity. Thus, the experience-dependent transfer of a homeoprotein may establish the physiological milieu for postnatal plasticity of a neural circuit.

Thus, the experience-dependent transfer of a homeoprotein may establish the physiological milieu for postnatal plasticity of a neural circuit. Neural circuits are shaped by experience in postnatal life. For example, inputs from the two eyes first converge in the primary visual cortex (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963Wiesel T.N. Hubel D.H. Single-cell responses in striate cortex of kittens deprived of vision in one eye.J. Neurophysiol. 1963; 26: 1003-1017PubMed Google Scholar), where competitive interactions determine which eye will eventually dominate both functionally and anatomically. From mouse to man, early monocular occlusion permanently reduces visual acuity (amblyopia) through the deprived eye (Daw, 1995Daw N. Visual Development.

Neurosci. 2003; 17: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unbalanced sensory experience leads to a rapid shift of neuronal spiking response in favor of the open eye (ocular dominance) concomitant with a rapid pruning of dendritic spines and later rewiring of thalamo-cortical afferents (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963Wiesel T.N.

Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Recently, the maturation of particular inhibitory connections within the neocortex has been shown to drive this sensitivity (Hensch, 2005Hensch T.K. Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the synaptic isoform of GABA-synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), fail to shift visual responsiveness (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N.

Both can be rescued by concurrent benzodiazepine treatment (to enhance GABAergic transmission). Raising animals in complete darkness from birth (dark-rearing) naturally delays the maturation of intracortical inhibition and ocular dominance plasticity (Mower, 1991Mower G.D.

Conversely, benzodiazepines (BDZ) induce a premature plasticity in young wild-type mice just after eye-opening (postnatal day, P13) (Fagiolini and Hensch, 2000Fagiolini M. Hensch T.K.

Optimization of somatic inhibition at critical period onset in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 805-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These are enriched at somatic synapses on pyramidal cells made by large-basket cells containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) (Klausberger et al., 2002Klausberger T. Roberts J.D. Somogyi P. Cell type- and input-specific differences in the number and subtypes of synaptic GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2513-2521PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other GABAergic interneurons, PV-cells emerge with a late postnatal timecourse in anticipation of critical period onset (del Rio et al., 1994del Rio J.A. de Lecea L. Ferrer I. Soriano E. The development of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity in the neocortex of the mouse.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 81: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) accelerates both PV-cell development and critical period timecourse (Huang et al., 1999Huang Z.J. Kirkwood A. Pizzorusso T. Porciatti V.

Huang Z.J. Tonegawa S. Stryker M.P. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor overexpression induces precocious critical period in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC40PubMed Google Scholar). Gradually with age, peri-neuronal nets (PNNs) of extracellular matrix molecules condense around PV-cells in parallel with the decline of critical period plasticity (Celio et al., 1998Celio M.R. Spreafico R. De Biasi S. Vitellaro-Zuccarello L.

Importantly, chondroitinase treatment to destroy these nets reactivates visual cortical plasticity in adult animals (Pizzorusso et al., 2002Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex.Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Moreover, the wide basket-cell axon plexus stretches horizontally across ocular dominance columns in the cat and is ideally situated to shape their final spacing through competitive mechanisms in development (Buzás et al., 2001Buzás P. Eysel U.T. Adorján P. Kisvárday Z.F. Axonal topography of cortical basket cells in relation to orientation, direction, and ocular dominance maps.J. Comp.

Columnar architecture sculpted by GABA circuits in developing cat visual cortex.Science. 2004; 303: 1678-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Due to these convergent lines of evidence, we explored transcription factors as a major determinant of cellular identity that might specify PV-cell function in particular as a trigger for plasticity in visual cortex (Butt et al., 2007Butt S.J. Cobos I. Golden J. Kessaris N. Pachnis V. Anderson S. Transcriptional regulation of cortical interneuron development.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11847-11850Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transcription factors have further been shown to mark distinct neuronal pathways, such as Phox2a/2b in the visceral nervous circuit (Brunet and Pattyn, 2002Brunet J.F. Pattyn A. Phox2 genes - from patterning to connectivity.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We focused on the homeodomain protein Otx2, which is normally required for embryonic head formation (Acampora et al., 2001Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Otx genes in brain morphogenesis.Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the protein is restricted to relay centers along the primary visual pathway at birth before PV-cells are evident (Nothias et al., 1998Nothias F. Fishell G. Ruiz i Altaba A. Cooperation of intrinsic and extrinsic signals in the elaboration of regional identity in the posterior cerebral cortex.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 459-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and cortex (V1). This is intriguing given the possibility that homeoproteins may be secreted and internalized (Joliot and Prochiantz, 2004Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Transduction peptides: from technology to physiology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Indeed, PV-cells receive the most potent direct thalamo-cortical input (Erisir and Dreusicke, 2005Erisir A. Dreusicke M. Quantitative morphology and postsynaptic targets of thalamocortical axons in critical period and adult ferret visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 485: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Cruikshank et al., 2007Cruikshank S.J. Lewis T.J. Connors B.W. Synaptic basis for intense thalamocortical activation of feedforward inhibitory cells in neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 462-468PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression of Otx2 in regions of the dorsal forebrain in rats is transient and lost by P13 (Frantz et al., 1994Frantz G.D. Weimann J.M. Levin M.E. McConnell S.K. Otx1 and Otx2 define layers and regions in developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5725-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), later expression with respect to the critical period for circuit plasticity (>P23) has not been examined (Fagiolini et al., 1994Fagiolini M. Pizzorusso T. Berardi N. Domenici L. Maffei L. Functional postnatal development of the rat primary visual cortex and the role of visual experience: dark rearing and monocular deprivation.Vision Res. 1994; 34: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, Gordon and Stryker, 1996Gordon J.A. Stryker M.P. Experience-dependent plasticity of binocular responses in the primary visual cortex of the mouse.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3274-3286PubMed Google Scholar). We find that non-cell-autonomous Otx2 coordinates postnatal PV-cell maturation and activates visual cortical plasticity. To address a postnatal role for homeoprotein transcription factors, we first identified the distribution of Otx2 protein in mouse visual cortex. Consistent with earlier reports in the rat (Frantz et al., 1994Frantz G.D. Weimann J.M. Levin M.E. McConnell S.K. Otx1 and Otx2 define layers and regions in developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5725-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little Otx2 protein was detected even at P19 when weak PV staining was visible prior to critical period onset (Figures 1A and 1B). Otx2 protein was increasingly concentrated within PV-cells by the peak of the critical period (P28-30) as PV expression intensified (Figures 1C and 1D), and persisted into adulthood (Figure 1E). Similar results were obtained with 6 antibodies recognizing different epitopes of Otx2. Otx2-positive cells were primarily GABAergic interneurons (Figures 1F and 1J; 93.1 ± 1.5%), a minority of which contained Calretinin (CR) (Figures 1G and 1J; 16.6 ± 1.0%). At high resolution, most Otx2-positive cells were PV-positive and vice versa (Figure 1J; 71.4 ± 0.5% and 78.9 ± 1.7%, respectively) exhibiting nuclear localization (Figures 1H and 1I). We examined the influence of visual experience by counting Otx2-positive cells at the natural critical period peak after two types of sensory deprivation: removal of the two eyes (enucleation) from eye-opening (P14) or dark-rearing from birth. Cortical Otx2 protein levels were reduced by P24 in binocularly-enucleated mice compared to those of intact animals (Figures 2A and 2B). This was matched by a weakened PV expression (Figures 2C and 2D). A robust loss of Otx2-positive cells (and reduced PV signal) was similarly observed at P28 simply by dark-rearing from birth (Figures 2E, 2G, and 2K; number of Otx2-positive cells/field: intact, 39.7 ± 4.7 versus enucleated, 14.0 ± 5.6, p < 0.05, t test; light-reared, 35.3 ± 3.5 versus dark-reared, 6.1 ± 1.8, p < 0.0001, t test). Consistent with previous reports (Tropea et al., 2006Tropea D. Kreiman G. Lyckman A. Mukherjee S. Yu H. Horng S. Sur M. Gene expression changes and molecular pathways mediating activity-dependent plasticity in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Katagiri et al., 2007Katagiri H. Fagiolini M. Hensch T.K. Optimization of somatic inhibition at critical period onset in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 805-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), dark-rearing thus delayed maturation of PV-positive inhibitory circuits. We therefore tested whether exogenous Otx2 would rescue PV-cell maturation in complete darkness by delivering human recombinant protein directly into the visual cortex. Laterally-directed flow from osmotic minipumps to treat one cortical hemisphere allowed the other side to serve as an internal control (Figure S1A available online). After 7 days of infusion in the dark (P21-23 to P28-30), Otx2 signal was found within PV-cells throughout the treated visual cortex (Figures 2F and 2H). Internalization of exogenous Otx2 into cortical neurons is consistent with previous observations of homeoprotein passage into cells in vitro (Joliot and Prochiantz, 2004Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Transduction peptides: from technology to physiology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Exogenous Otx2 increased the number of PV-positive cells in the treated side compared to that of the noninfused side in the same brain (Figures 2H and 2L; number of PV-cells/field: noninfused, 21.7 ± 3.1 versus infused, 33.6 ± 3.2 cells/field, p < 0.005, paired t test). Enrichment of PNNs enwrapping mature PV-cells is also delayed by dark-rearing (Pizzorusso et al., 2002Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex.Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Otx2 infusion increased the number of PNN-bearing cells compared to that of the noninfused side (Figures 2I, 2J, and 2L; number of net-bearing cells/field: noninfused, 33.9 ± 1.3 versus infused, 46.1 ± 2.1, p < 0.0005, paired t test). Thus, endogenous Otx2 may influence late PV-cell maturation by gradually re-emerging in response to sensory experience after eye-opening. We verified this idea by exogenous Otx2 infusion into immature visual cortex. After 5 days of infusion at P19 when endogenous Otx2 levels are low (Figure 1A), robust Otx2 signal was found within PV-cells throughout the treated visual cortex (Figure 3F). The premature localization of Otx2 accelerated PV expression in the treated side compared to that of the noninfused side in the same brain (Figures 3A–3D). The effects of Otx2 gain-of-function were PV-cell specific, as Calretinin expression was not affected by Otx2 infusion (Figure S1C). Quantification of signal intensity revealed a robust and statistically significant enhancement across multiple PV-cell markers: the Kv3.1 class of potassium channel that contributes to fast-spiking behavior (Rudy and McBain, 2001Rudy B. McBain C.J. Kv3 channels: voltage-gated K+ channels designed for high-frequency repetitive firing.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), GAD65 that synthesizes GABA, and the α1-subunit of the GABAA receptor (Gao and Fritschy, 1994Gao B.

Immunofluorescence for PV or Kv3.1 within PV-cell somata was intensified (Figures 3E and S1D; p < 0.05 pair-wise comparison across hemispheres of the same brain). Diffuse labeling of GAD65 and GABAAR α1-subunits was also increased (Figures S1E–S1G; p < 0.05 pair-wise comparison across hemispheres of the same brain). No change in cell number indicated an enhancement of pre-existing but immature PV-cells by exogenous Otx2 (Figure S1B; noninfused versus infused cells/field: 39.6 ± 3.3 and 36.8 ± 5.1 for PV; 40.0 ± 2.8 and 43.0 ± 1.6 for Kv3.1; 28.4 ± 4.7 and 29.2 ± 4.5 for Calretinin, respectively; p > 0.3, t test). Exogenous Otx2 thus promoted the maturation of a constellation of PV-cell molecular constituents. Pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic function by benzodiazepine agonists is sufficient to trigger plasticity onset (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P.

Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether the premature appearance of Otx2 in the visual cortex could also accelerate physiological ocular dominance plasticity using electrophysiological techniques. The spiking response to visual stimuli was measured in the binocular zone of anesthetized mice by extracellular single-unit recording and classified according to a traditional scale from group 1 (purely contralateral eye response) to group 7 (purely ipsilateral eye response) (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963Wiesel T.N.

Local GABA circuit control of experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Science. 1998; 282: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Unlike the contralaterally-biased distribution of normal mice, ocular dominance scores typically shift toward the open, ipsilateral eye following a brief monocular deprivation (MD) of the contralateral eye at P25. This is reflected in a reduction of contralateral bias index (CBI) from 0.7 to a more balanced value near 0.5 (Gordon and Stryker, 1996Gordon J.A. Stryker M.P. Experience-dependent plasticity of binocular responses in the primary visual cortex of the mouse.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3274-3286PubMed Google Scholar, Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M.

Local GABA circuit control of experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Science. 1998; 282: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Recombinant Otx2 protein or vehicle solution was infused early into the visual cortex from P17. Upon vehicle treatment, little plasticity occurred with brief MD just after eye-opening, and visual responses from the closed, contralateral eye remained strong (Figure 4A, top) as in nondeprived mice (Figure 4B). In contrast, during early Otx2 infusion, responsiveness shifted prematurely toward the open, ipsilateral eye after brief MD (Figure 4A, bottom). Moreover, the decline of critical period plasticity with age was also accelerated. At the natural peak of the critical period, vehicle-treated animals shifted responsiveness as expected toward the open, ipsilateral eye following brief MD (from P25), but mice treated earlier (at P17) with Otx2 no longer showed this plasticity (Figure 4C). The earlier profile of amblyopic effects was clearly seen in a scatter plot of CBI values from individual animals (Figure 4D). Overexpression of BDNF (Hanover et al., 1999Hanover J.L. Huang Z.J. Tonegawa S. Stryker M.P. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor overexpression induces precocious critical period in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC40PubMed Google Scholar) or early injection of benzodiazepines (Iwai et al., 2003Iwai Y. Fagiolini M. Obata K. Hensch T.K. Rapid critical period induction by tonic inhibition in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6695-6702PubMed Google Scholar) also triggers a rapid decline of critical period plasticity consistent with these Otx2 results. A well-documented measure of weak inhibition in vivo is the excessive spike firing by single cells after a visual stimulus has left the receptive field (prolonged discharge). This is typically prominent in GAD65 knockout (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F.

Fagiolini M. Obata K. Hensch T.K. Rapid critical period induction by tonic inhibition in mouse visual cortex.J.

Like benzodiazepine treatment (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F. Local GABA circuit control of experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Science. 1998; 282: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), early Otx2 infusion significantly reduced this immature property in vivo, indicating a rapid functional maturation of inhibitory circuits by this homeoprotein (Figure 4E). Other receptive field properties, such as low orientation bias at young ages, were not affected by early Otx2 infusion (Figure 4F and Table S1), consistent with a molecular dissociation of ocular dominance and orientation development as reported previously (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F.

USA. 2003; 100: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Taken together, Otx2 gain-of-function promoted critical period onset in conjunction with PV-cell maturation. To confirm whether Otx2 is required for PV-cell maturation and critical period plasticity, we next carried out Otx2 loss-of-function experiments. Due to the embryonic lethality of constitutive Otx2 deletion (Acampora et al., 2001Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Otx genes in brain morphogenesis.Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we turned to a conditional approach. Otx2 protein was detected within PV-cells at P28 in Otx2 flox/flox mice in which the Otx2 gene was flanked by LoxP sites (Tian et al., 2002Tian E. Kimura C. Takeda N. Aizawa S. Matsuo I. Otx2 is required to respond to signals from anterior neural ridge for forebrain specification.Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 204-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Figure 5A). In contrast, when one Otx2 allele was excised by Cre recombinase under the control of a postnatal α-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) promoter, cortical Otx2 signal was strongly reduced (Figure 5B). Strikingly, PV expression was also reduced when endogenous Otx2 was disrupted (Figures 5C and 5D), retaining an immature appearance (see Figure 1B). Immunofluorescence intensity within PV-cell somata was significantly decreased in the cumulative distribution or comparisons of average intensity for individual mice (Figure 5G). Loss of Otx2 also delayed PNN formation and reduced the number of cells labeled by WFA (Figures 5F and 5H; control, 43.9 ± 1.8 versus hetKO, 32.0 ± 1.8 cells/field at P28-30; control, 59.9 ± 1.7 versus hetKO, 44.6 ± 1.7 for adults, > P60, respectively; p < 0.0005, t test) or Cat-301-antigen (Figures S2F and S2G; control, 30.1 ± 1.9 versus hetKO, 15.6 ± 1.8 cells/field at P28-30; control, 56.8 ± 3.4 versus hetKO, 37.2 ± 2.7 for adults, > P60, respectively; p < 0.0005, t test). Moreover, PV-expressing cell number was also reduced by the loss of endogenous Otx2 (Figure S2D; control, 38.0 ± 4.4 versus hetKO, 28.6 ± 1.0 cells/field, p < 0.05, t test). These effects were specific to PV-cells since Calretinin-cells were not affected in expression level (Figures S2A–S2C) or number (Figure S2D; control, 18.5 ± 1.3 versus hetKO, 20.3 ± 2.3 cells/field, p > 0.5, t test). Postnatal Otx2 loss-of-function would then be expected to prevent plasticity if somatic inhibition is compromised (Katagiri et al., 2007Katagiri H. Fagiolini M. Hensch T.K. Optimization of somatic inhibition at critical period onset in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 805-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as for global GAD65 disruption (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F.

Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The frequency of miniature IPSCs, arising primarily from peri-somatic inputs (Soltesz et al., 1995Soltesz I. Smetters D.K. Mody I. Tonic inhibition originates from synapses close to the soma.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1273-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), was significantly reduced in slices from Otx2 KO mice (A. Scheuber and T.K.H., unpublished data). Ocular dominance plasticity failed to occur concomitant with immature PV expression (Figure 5D) in mice lacking even one Otx2 allele (Figures 5I, 5J, and 5L), which had no noticeable effect on other receptive field properties (responsiveness, orientation bias, habituation; Table S1). We then attempted to rescue plasticity in vivo using benzodiazepine agonists to enhance GABAA receptor currents. Ocular dominance shifts were restored by diazepam treatment during brief MD (Figures 5K and 5L) as in GAD65 KO mice (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F. Local GABA circuit control of experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Science. 1998; 282: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar).

An enzyme tuning strategy was implemented that identified activity differences between variants from different plants and determined optimal expression levels. By synthesizing both stereoisomer forms of reticuline and integrating enzyme activities from three plant sources and humans, we demonstrated the synthesis of metabolites in the sanguinarine/berberine and morphinan branches. We also demonstrated that a human P450 enzyme exhibits a novel activity in the conversion of (R)-reticuline to the morphinan alkaloid salutaridine.

Its receptors are heterodimers consisting of a ligand-specific alpha subunit and a betac subunit that is shared with the interleukin (IL)-3 and IL-5 receptors. How signaling is initiated remains an enigma. We report here the crystal structure of the human GM-CSF/GM-CSF receptor ternary complex and its assembly into an unexpected dodecamer or higher-order complex. Importantly, mutagenesis of the GM-CSF receptor at the dodecamer interface and functional studies reveal that dodecamer formation is required for receptor activation and signaling. This unusual form of receptor assembly likely applies also to IL-3 and IL-5 receptors, providing a structural basis for understanding their mechanism of activation and for the development of therapeutics."

Together, the cargo-Sec23-24 ternary complex interacts in an unknown fashion with Sec13-31, a heterotetrameric cytosolic protein complex that can self-assemble to form a cage-like oligomeric lattice (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M.

In addition to these basic components that are both necessary and sufficient for formation of vesicles from liposomes in vitro (Matsuoka et al., 1998Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y.

COPII-coated vesicle formation reconstituted with purified coat proteins and chemically defined liposomes.Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), a number of additional components are now recognized to facilitate budding, presumably contributing to initiation and/or stability of the assembling cargo-adaptor components and the Sec13-31 cage in vivo (Gurkan et al., 2006Gurkan C.

A variety of lipid absorption disorders are associated with mutations in the Sar1 GTPase (Shoulders et al., 2004Shoulders C.C. Stephens D.J. Jones B. The intracellular transport of chylomicrons requires the small GTPase, Sar1b.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD), a disease that results from defective collagen export from the ER, is a consequence of a mutation in the Sec23A subunit that leads to defective recruitment of Sec13-31 (Boyadjiev et al., 2006Boyadjiev S.A. Fromme J.C. Ben J. Chong S.S. Nauta C. Hur D.J. Zhang G. Hamamoto S. Schekman R.

The genetic basis of a craniofacial disease provides insight into COPII coat assembly.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The structural relationships between cargo, APC components, and cage components that allow for the creation of vesicles at ER exit sites have not been elucidated. Similarly, how vesicles of variable size that are capable of accommodating small cargo, such as membrane receptors, as well as very large cargo molecules, such as procollagen or chylomicron particles—exceeding the size of typical COPII vesicle observed in vivo—remains an enigma. To address these questions, we have solved the molecular structure of the complete COPII coat containing both Sec13-31 and Sec23-24. The structure reveals principles for the formation of vesicle coats, the organization of the adaptor layer, and provides an explanation for possible mechanisms that regulate vesicle size and functionality in response to cargo-adaptor assemblies that have been reported to be dysfunctional in disease. In order to study the structure of COPII particles containing both Sec23-24 and Sec13-31, it is necessary to self-assemble cages and coats in the absence of the lipid bilayer. Previously, we used overnight dialysis to slowly and efficiently promote self-assembly of the Sec13-31 cuboctahedron in vitro (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In this system, the biologically regulated processes occurring in vivo that drive the assembly of Sec13-31 are mimicked by the substitution of Cl− anions for CH3COO− anions. Because dialysis is not amenable to higher-throughput analysis of assembly under different conditions, we developed a new and more rapid approach (see Experimental Procedures). We followed assembly of COPII proteins in solution based on sedimentation in response to a rapid adjustment of the ionic environment of the incubation, referred to as a “salt shift.” In these experiments, large complexes that form can be pelleted at low speed (15,000 × g; referred to as the low-speed pellet [LSP]), whereas smaller complexes, such as Sec13-31 cuboctahedrons, can only be recovered by sedimentation at high speed (200,000 × g; referred to as the high-speed pellet [HSP]) as described previously (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). When incubations containing only Sec13-31 are salt shifted, we observe recovery of Sec13-31 in both the LSP and HSP, with roughly 16% of the Sec13-31 assembled into cuboctahedrons that are recovered in the HSP (Figure 1A, HSP lane). Interestingly, salt shift of incubations containing only Sec23-24 results in the complete recovery of Sec23-24 in the LSP (Figure 1A, HSP lane and Figure 1B, lanes 8–12), suggesting that Sec23-24 can also self-assemble into very large structures (Antonny et al., 2003Antonny B. Gounon P. Schekman R. Orci L. Self-assembly of minimal COPII cages.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using this simple approach for self-assembly, we looked at the sedimentation behavior of Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 when coincubated in solution. Mixing increasing amounts of Sec23-24 with a fixed amount of Sec13-31 followed by salt shift revealed two things. First, when substoichiometric amounts of Sec23-24 were added to Sec13-31 prior to salt shift, Sec23-24 appeared in the HSP containing the cuboctahedron (Figure 1B, lanes 2–4). This suggests that Sec23-24 can be incorporated into assembling Sec13-31 cuboctahedron-sized structures (Figure 1B, compare lanes 8–10 with lanes 2–4). Second, the addition of increasing amounts of Sec23-24 resulted in a progressive decrease in the amount of Sec13-31 recovered in the HSP (Figure 1B, lanes 2–6) and its complete recovery in the LSP (data not shown). This demonstrates that, when Sec23-24 is stoichiometric or greater, Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 coassemble into structures larger than cuboctahedrons under the same conditions that favor the formation of cuboctahedrons in the absence of Sec23-24. To rule out the possibility that the very large Sec23-24 assemblies that form under these conditions nonspecifically bring down Sec13-31 cuboctahedrons, we salt shifted Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 separately and then mixed them together. Under these conditions, Sec13-31 is recovered in the HSP (Figure 1B, compare lane 7 with lane 5), indicating that preformed Sec23-24 assemblies do not nonspecifically bind preformed Sec13-31 cuboctahedrons. Taken together, the above experiments demonstrate that Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 can coassemble into very large complexes that pellet at low speeds (15,000 × g). To investigate the morphological nature of the larger assemblies formed from Sec13-31 and Sec23-24, we performed negative-stain EM analysis. Unlike the cuboctahedral particles we observed with Sec13-31 alone that can only be recovered in the HSP (Figure 1C), the structures generated by incubation of limiting Sec13-31 and excess Sec23-24 contained an abundant number of coat-like particles that appeared considerably larger than cuboctahedrons (Figure 1D). These results suggest that defined salt conditions can promote in solution the rapid formation of Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 mixed-composition assemblies that may correspond to the complete coat structures that drive vesicle budding in vivo. We assembled in vitro COPII cage-like structures from purified full-length human Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 using dialysis into optimized acetate buffer conditions to improve the overall yield of mixed composition particles and characterized these assembled structures using cryo-EM and single-particle analysis (Antonny et al., 2003Antonny B. Gounon P. Schekman R. Orci L. Self-assembly of minimal COPII cages.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In these particle preparations, we observed at least three discrete sizes of assemblies with diameters ranging from 600 Å to 1000 Å (Figure 1E). The diameter of the smallest structures corresponds to the cuboctahedral geometry observed previously for the 30 Å resolution structure built from Sec13-31 alone (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The diameter of the intermediate-sized structures was ∼700 Å, and many appeared to have pentagonal shapes, in contrast to the cuboctahedral particles, which had square or hexagonal shapes. The largest and by far the most abundant particles in the Sec13-31/Sec23-24 assembly conditions were ∼1000 Å in diameter. These large particles had a very low signal-to-noise ratio that made them refractory to alignment and classification that is required for single-particle analysis. To overcome this limitation, we collected a larger data set of ∼12,000 of the large particles using moderate dose (30e−/Å2) and high defocus (10–12 μm under focus at 200 keV) (Figure S1A available online). When these particles were subjected to reference-free alignment and classification, this resulted in coherent class averages, some of which had 5-fold symmetry (Figures 1F and S1B). Based on the geometry of the cage generated by self-assembly of Sec13-31 alone, there are only two geometries that will form cages with a diameter of ∼1000 Å; these are the icosidodecahedron, which has icosahedral symmetry, and the small rhombicuboctahedron, which has octahedral symmetry (Figure 1G). Since icosahedral symmetry has a 5-fold symmetry axis and octahedral does not, we predicted that the new, large structures would be icosidodecahedrons. We performed a single-particle reconstruction to generate a three-dimensional (3D) model of the large cage structure. To minimize model bias, we took the best 5-fold reference-free class average, aligned it to the 5-fold axis of an icosahedron, and backprojected it with icosahedral symmetry to arrive at an initial model. We then refined this structure against the ∼12,000 particle data set to convergence. The final reconstruction has a resolution of 43 Å and forms an outer cage structure that corresponds to an icosidodecahedron (Figure 2A, Figure S1C). Although the resolution is relatively low given the icosahedral symmetry (likely reflecting the relatively high dose and high defocus that were required to solve the structure), we observed two strong similarities between the new reconstruction and the cuboctahedral structure. First, the structure of the icosidodecahedral edge, which consists of a Sec13-31 heterotetramer, has identical contours to that of the cuboctahedral structure (Figure 2B). The lengths of the edges are the same in both structures (∼300 Å), they both have characteristic lobes at the ends of the edges that are connected by a continuous curving area of density, and the two ends appear to be related by a 180° rotation, indicating that the edges have 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2B). Second, the asymmetric units, which are the Sec13-31 heterotetramers (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), are off-center with respect to the polyhedral edge (Figures 2A and 2B). In other words, one end is closer to the center of its corresponding vertex than that of the other end. We refer to these as the “plus” and “minus” ends of the edge (see below). The fact that the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron structures were solved completely independently and yet share many similarities provides a high level of confidence in the reconstruction. The new icosidodecahedron cage has 60 edges and 32 faces, of which 20 are triangles and 12 are pentagons (Figure 2A and Movie S1). As with the Sec13-31 cuboctahedron, the defining feature is not the geometry of the faces but the fact that the vertices are formed by the intersection of four edges. Thus, consistent with the LSP sedimentation properties observed during assembly of Sec13-31 in the presence of Sec23-24 following salt shift, we conclude that the larger particles observed in negative-stain EM (Figure 1D) correspond to the considerably larger COPII particles. In contrast to the cuboctahedron generated with Sec13-31 alone (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the icosidodecahedron structure appears to have three layers of density (Figures 2A, 2C, and S2). There is an outer layer that corresponds to the Sec13-31 cage (Figures 2A and 2C, green), followed by a second or middle layer (Figures 2A and 2C, yellow) and an innermost layer that is distributed through the center of the central cavity and lacks regular structure (Figures 2A and 2C, gray). Given that only two components are in the mixture, Sec13-31 and Sec23-24, we interpret the second layer to be Sec23-24 (see below), and the disordered innermost layer likely consists of unassembled Sec13-31 and/or Sec23-24 complexes that are captured during self-assembly (Figure S2C). The membrane proximal surface of Sec23-24 is highly positively charged (Bi et al., 2002Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and may interact in solution nonspecifically with unassembled coat components. The space inside of the Sec23-24 layer is large enough to accommodate a vesicle of about 67 nm in diameter, in line with the sizes observed in vivo (Matsuoka et al., 1998Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. COPII-coated vesicle formation reconstituted with purified coat proteins and chemically defined liposomes.Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We now refer to the multilayered structure that is self-assembled in a solution that contains both Sec13-31 and Sec23-24 as the COPII “coat,” with Sec13-31 forming the surrounding COPII “cage.” Crystal structures have recently been solved of the C-terminal domain of yeast Sec31 in complex with Sec13 and of the N-terminal domain of Sec31 in complex with Sec13 (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Combining these two structures together results in a model for the yeast Sec13-31 heterotetramer that is composed of two Sec13-31 monomers that dimerize through the α-solenoid domains of Sec31 (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The overall topology of the yeast heterotetramer structure agrees very well with that of the edge of the cryo-EM structure of the human Sec13-31 cuboctahedron (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J.

We found a similar result for the icosidodecahedron containing human Sec13-31 and Sec23-24, suggesting that generation of a larger cage structure in the presence of Sec23-24 does not alter the basic structural organization and dimensions of the Sec13-31 edge. The major difference in the crystal structure of the yeast Sec13-31 (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and the cryo-EM maps of the human COPII cage (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and the icosidodecahedron COPII coat (described herein) is observed at the middle of the Sec31 dimerization interface (Figure 3A). In both the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron cryo-EM structures, the dimerization region in the center of the heterotetramer creates an ∼135° angle in the edge (Figures 2A and 2B). However, in the crystal structure of yeast Sec13-31 (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), this angle is ∼165° (Figure 3A). This may reflect crystal packing (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), may be due to differences in the yeast and human Sec31 sequences, and/or may reflect the absence of nearly half of the Sec31 sequence in the yeast crystal structure (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), whereas the full-length human protein is used to generate both cryo-EM structures. Furthermore, it could reflect a conformational change that occurs during assembly of the COPII cage revealed by the cryo-EM structure (Figures 3C and 3D). The angle in the human heterotetramer was modeled using normal modes flexible fitting (Tama et al., 2004Tama F. Miyashita O. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Normal mode based flexible fitting of high-resolution structure into low-resolution experimental data from cryo-EM.J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) of the yeast crystal structure into an isolated edge from a new, higher-resolution (22 Å) cuboctahedron reconstruction (Figure 3B, Movie S2, and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The modeled heterotetramer was then fit as a rigid body into the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron structures. The modeled Sec13-31 atomic structure fits well into the cryo-EM density of both the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron (Figures 3C and 3D), providing detailed molecular descriptions of both the COPII cage and, now, the COPII coat. Whereas Sec13-31 forms an outer shell with icosidodecahedral geometry, we reasoned that the middle layer was Sec23-24. The mass of the middle layer corresponds to ∼120 Sec23-24 molecules. Thus, there are two Sec23-24 dimers per edge. When viewed down the 2-fold axis of symmetry of the coat (i.e., directly below a vertex), one observes a four-lobed structure with 2-fold symmetry (Figures 4A–4D). The crystal structure of Sec23-24 has a bowtie shape that resembles each of these lobes (Bi et al., 2002Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, Matsuoka et al., 2001Matsuoka K. Schekman R. Orci L. Heuser J.E. Surface structure of the COPII-coated vesicle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 13705-13709Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and we can dock four Sec23-24 dimers into this four-lobed structure (Figure 4B). The position of the four-lobed Sec23-24 structure in relationship to the Sec13-31 edge is more clearly seen in a surface rendering of the Sec23-24 (Bi et al., 2002Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and Sec13-31 (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) crystal structures in the context of the icosidodecahedron coat (Figures 4C and 4D). This demonstrates that Sec23-24 occupies two different positions relative to Sec13-31. One Sec23-24 in the asymmetric unit extends along the Sec13-31 edge, and the other extends out into the middle of the triangular face. While the 43 Å resolution of the reconstruction does not permit us to unambiguously determine the relative orientations of the four Sec23-24 dimers (Figures 4E and 4F), the COPII coat structure presented here demonstrates that Sec23-24 can form a regular complex consisting of four dimers now referred to as the Sec23-24 “tetramer cluster” (Sec23-24TC) that is oriented directly under each vertex. The middle Sec23-24 layer is disconnected from the outer Sec13-31 at moderate contour levels in our structure, though connections can be seen at low contour levels (Figure S2D). There are two likely reasons for the lack of observable density between the two layers. One possibility is that the connections between the layers are heterogeneous and, thus, are averaged out; the portion of Sec31 known to interact with Sec23 is in a proline-rich and, likely, unstructured region of the protein. Another possibility is that the resolution of the reconstruction is simply too low to resolve the slender connections between the layers. The COPII cuboctahedron cage (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gurkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and icosidodecahedron coat structures we have now generated share properties that illustrate the structural basis for vesicle assembly. First, it is now apparent that four edges combine to form a vertex. Second, as w"
https://openalex.org/W2064792413,"Argonaute proteins are a part of a larger RNA interference (RNAi) complex, RISC, in which they mediate cleavage of target mRNAs. In this study, Shi and colleagues show that Ago2 interacts with and is hydroxylated by type I collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase. When this activity is depleted in human or mouse cells, the level of Ago2 is reduced and siRISC activity mediated by the let-7 miRNA is affected. These results suggest that hydroxylation of Ago2, by affecting its stability, can influence the efficiency of RNAi. Human Argonaute (Ago) proteins are essential components of the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). Argonaute 2 (Ago2) has a P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI) domain, which folds like RNase H and is responsible for target RNA cleavage in RNA interference1. Proteins such as Dicer, TRBP, MOV10, RHA, RCK/p54 and KIAA1093 associate with Ago proteins and participate in small RNA processing, RISC loading and localization of Ago proteins in the cytoplasmic messenger RNA processing bodies1,2. However, mechanisms that regulate RNA interference remain obscure. Here we report physical interactions between Ago2 and the α-(P4H-α(I)) and β-(P4H-β) subunits of the type I collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase (C-P4H(I)). Mass spectrometric analysis identified hydroxylation of the endogenous Ago2 at proline 700. In vitro, both Ago2 and Ago4 seem to be more efficiently hydroxylated than Ago1 and Ago3 by recombinant human C-P4H(I). Importantly, human cells depleted of P4H-α(I) or P4H-β by short hairpin RNA and P4H-α(I) null mouse embryonic fibroblast cells showed reduced stability of Ago2 and impaired short interfering RNA programmed RISC activity. Furthermore, mutation of proline 700 to alanine also resulted in destabilization of Ago2, thus linking Ago2 P700 and hydroxylation at this residue to its stability regulation. These findings identify hydroxylation as a post-translational modification important for Ago2 stability and effective RNA interference."

Proteome-wide efforts to model protein-protein interaction or “interactome” networks have largely ignored this modular organization of proteins. We developed an experimental strategy to efficiently identify interaction domains and generated a domain-based interactome network for proteins involved in C. elegans early-embryonic cell divisions. Minimal interacting regions were identified for over 200 proteins, providing important information on their domain organization. Furthermore, our approach increased the sensitivity of the two-hybrid system, resulting in a more complete interactome network. This interactome modeling strategy revealed insights into C. elegans centrosome function and is applicable to other biological processes in this and other organisms."

Here, we show that cytoplasmic microtubules are mechanically coupled to the nuclear heterochromatin through proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope. This includes an integral outer nuclear membrane protein of the KASH family (Kms2) and two integral inner nuclear membrane proteins, the SUN-domain protein Sad1 and the previously uncharacterized protein Ima1. Ima1 specifically binds to heterochromatic regions and promotes the tethering of centromeric DNA to the SUN-KASH complex. In the absence of Ima1, or in cells harboring mutations in the centromeric Ndc80 complex, inefficient coupling of centromeric heterochromatin to Sad1 leads to striking defects in the ability of the nucleus to tolerate microtubule-dependent forces, leading to changes in nuclear shape, loss of spindle pole body components from the nuclear envelope, and partial dissociation of SUN-KASH complexes.

This work highlights a framework for communication between cytoplasmic microtubules and chromatin. To alter nuclear position, the cytoskeleton must exert sufficient force on the nucleus to drive its movement, while, simultaneously, the nucleus must buffer these forces so that its entire mass is efficiently propelled through the cytoplasm without affecting nuclear integrity. How the cytoskeleton and nuclear envelope (NE) interface to achieve this balance is poorly understood. The first molecular details of the proteins that form this interface have come from the identification and characterization of the conserved SUN and KASH domain-containing proteins (Figure 1A). In metazoa, integral outer nuclear membrane (ONM) proteins possessing KASH domains link the NE to all major classes of cytoskeletal elements (Starr and Fischer, 2005Starr D.A. Fischer J.A.

In turn, KASH domain proteins bind (in the NE lumen) to integral inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins containing the conserved SUN domain (Tzur et al., 2006Tzur Y.B. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. SUN-domain proteins: ‘Velcro’ that links the nucleoskeleton to the cytoskeleton.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, integral membrane proteins of the NE link the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton to the nuclear interior. Disruption of SUN-KASH interactions leads to expansion of the NE lumen, illustrating the importance of this complex in maintaining nuclear structure (Crisp et al., 2006Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. Coupling of the nucleus and cytoplasm: role of the LINC complex.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). However, given the large forces exerted on SUN-KASH complexes (potentially up to 100 pN during mammalian cell migration [Szabo et al., 2004Szabo B. Kornyei Z. Zach J. Selmeczi D. Csucs G. Czirok A. Vicsek T. Auto-reverse nuclear migration in bipolar mammalian cells on micropatterned surfaces.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar]), it is likely that additional macromolecules reinforce these NE-cytoskeletal connections. Candidates include additional NE membrane proteins, soluble proteins that reside in the NE lumen, and structural elements within the nucleus. In metazoa, the nuclear lamina, a meshwork of the intermediate filament lamins, provides one important structural scaffold to which SUN domain proteins are coupled (Crisp et al., 2006Crisp M. Liu Q.

We have chosen to further study the molecular linkages between the cytoskeleton and the NE in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Several aspects of S. pombe physiology are conserved with that of metazoans and are notably absent in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. First, the primary MTOC in S. pombe (termed the spindle pole body, or SPB), is tethered to the ONM during interphase (Figure 1B) (Ding et al., 1997Ding R. West R.R. Morphew D.M. Oakley B.R.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1461-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Second, S. pombe contain clear homologs of both SUN and KASH domain proteins. Tethering of the SPB to the ONM likely involves one or both S. pombe KASH domain proteins, named Kms1 and Kms2 (Miki et al., 2004Miki F. Kurabayashi A. Tange Y. Okazaki K. Shimanuki M. Niwa O.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and oscillates along the NE in a microtubule-dependent fashion, suggesting that it is coupled to the SPB (Tran et al., 2001Tran P.T. Marsh L. Doye V. Inoue S. Chang F. A mechanism for nuclear positioning in fission yeast based on microtubule pushing.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Importantly, although Sad1 colocalizes with SPB components at the level of the light microscope, Sad1 is an integral INM protein. Therefore, Sad1 defines a specific region of the NE to which the SPB is attached (Figure 1B). We call this discrete region of the NE the MTOC attachment site, or MAS. Because the MAS spans both the INM and ONM, its components include inner MAS proteins (Imas) and outer MAS proteins (Omas). In addition to the SPB, a second type of interface between the NE and microtubules (MTs) exists in S. pombe, called the interphase MTOC (iMTOC; Sawin and Tran, 2006Sawin K.E. Tran P.T. Cytoplasmic microtubule organization in fission yeast.Yeast. 2006; 23: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although poorly characterized, iMTOCs play important roles in regulating the interphase MT architecture and also contain the MAS protein Sad1 (Tran et al., 2001Tran P.T. Marsh L. Doye V. Inoue S. Chang F. A mechanism for nuclear positioning in fission yeast based on microtubule pushing.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the function of a previously uncharacterized integral membrane protein (Ima1) that resides at the inner face of the MAS and supports the buffering of MT forces at the NE. Surprisingly, Ima1 achieves this role by linking the MAS to heterochromatic regions within the nucleus. By examining cells lacking Ima1, we uncover a general role for the centromeric heterochromatin in buffering MT-dependent forces on the NE. This provides a framework for functional cooperation and communication between the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton and chromatin throughout the cell cycle. A proteomic approach in mammalian cells first suggested that Ima1 is a NE membrane protein (NET5; Schirmer et al., 2003Schirmer E.C. Florens L. Guan T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Gerace L. Nuclear membrane proteins with potential disease links found by subtractive proteomics.Science. 2003; 301: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). A single gene homologous to IMA1 is present in all metazoa and the fission yeast S. pombe (systematic name SPCC737.03c) but is absent in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Across species, an N-terminal cysteine-rich region is the most highly conserved domain of Ima1 (Figure S1 available online). Consistent with the expectation that Ima1 resides at the NE, a GFP fusion of Ima1 localizes specifically to the nuclear rim in S. pombe (Figure 1C). Using immunoelectron microscopy and antibodies directed against the GFP tag, we found that the majority of gold particles associated with the NE are found along the INM (90%, n = 40; Figure S1), suggesting that Ima1 resides at the inner face of the NE. The presence of the GFP antigen within the nucleus combined with glycosylation analysis (Figure S2) suggests that S. pombe Ima1 adopts the topology indicated in Figure S2. In all species, the C-terminal hydrophilic domain contains a nuclear localization signal, which likely promotes trafficking of Ima1 to the INM (Lusk et al., 2007Lusk C.P. Blobel G. King M.C. Highway to the inner nuclear membrane: Rules for the road.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At the nuclear rim, GFP-Ima1 is enriched in distinct regions of the NE (Figure 1C). Using time-lapse imaging of live cells, we found that GFP-Ima1-enriched regions of the NE are dynamic and oscillate along the NE largely parallel to the long axis of the cell (Movie S1). On average, Ima1 foci undergo one full oscillation (returning to the same location at the NE) in 189 ± 50 s (n = 25), with the average oscillation being 1.7 ± 0.7 μm in size. Such oscillations are reminiscent of the movement of the SPB as it is pushed by polarized MT bundles (Hagan et al., 1990Hagan I.M. Riddle P.N. Hyams J.S. Intramitotic controls in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe: The effect of cell size on spindle length and the timing of mitotic events.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1617-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Tran et al., 2001Tran P.T. Marsh L. Doye V. Inoue S. Chang F. A mechanism for nuclear positioning in fission yeast based on microtubule pushing.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), suggesting that GFP-Ima1 may enrich in the MAS. Consistent with this, such GFP-Ima1-rich regions frequently colocalize with the MAS protein, Sad1 (Figure 1C). To better illustrate the amplitude and path of GFP-Ima1 oscillations and investigate their association with the MAS, we created a single, composite image of GFP-Ima1 and Sad1-DsRed localization over 5 min by overlaying an entire time-lapse series (Figure 1D). Each individual oscillation is revealed in the side plots that display signal over time along the x and y axes. Here, it is evident that the brightest focus of GFP-Ima1 oscillates along the NE in conjunction with Sad1-DsRed. Oscillation of Ima1 is MT dependent, because GFP-Ima1 associated with the MAS remains static and colocalized with Sad1-DsRed if cells are treated with the MT-destabilizing agent carbandazim (MBC; Figure S3). Interestingly, GFP-Ima1 also accumulates in a second, discrete region of the NE that oscillates similarly to the SPB (asterisk, Figure 1D), which may represent its accumulation in the iMTOC. Consistent with this, in some cells GFP-Ima1 colocalizes with Sad1-DsRed (a known iMTOC component) at the NE in both the SPB and the iMTOC (Figure S3). To investigate the function of Ima1, we generated S. pombe cells lacking Ima1 by gene replacement. ima1Δ cells grow poorly on rich media compared to the WT control at all temperatures tested (Figure S4). We first investigated whether the absence of Ima1 affects the NE and/or the MAS. To facilitate this, we generated strains expressing a GFP fusion of the transmembrane nucleoporin Cut11 (West et al., 1998West R.R. Vaisberg E.V. Ding R. Nurse P. McIntosh J.R. cut11(+): A gene required for cell cycle-dependent spindle pole body anchoring in the nuclear envelope and bipolar spindle formation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2839-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Sad1-DsRed. WT cells undergo deformations of the NE at the MAS as the plus ends of MT bundles reach the poles of the cell and push back on the nucleus (Figure 2A) (Tran et al., 2001Tran P.T. Marsh L. Doye V. Inoue S. Chang F. A mechanism for nuclear positioning in fission yeast based on microtubule pushing.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Such deformations are transient and mildly affect the overall spherical shape of the nucleus. The dynamics of the NE in response to MT forces in ima1Δ cells are markedly different. First, deformations of the NE are more pronounced, often leading to large extensions of the NE (Figure 2A). To further visualize these deformations, we imaged ima1Δ cells expressing GFP-tubulin and an mCherry fusion of Heh1 as a NE marker. Heh1 (systematic name SPAC18G6.10) is an S. pombe paralogue of the S. cerevisiae Heh1 and Heh2 proteins, which localize specifically to the INM (King et al., 2006King M.C. Lusk C.P. Blobel G. Karyopherin-mediated import of integral inner nuclear membrane proteins.Nature. 2006; 442: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, a large extension of the NE takes place at the MT-NE interface as the MT bundle grows to the left and pushes on the right end of the cell. Thus, it appears that ima1Δ cells are poorly equipped to buffer MT forces exerted on the NE. We quantitated the failure of the NE to maintain its shape under MT force by creating overlays of SPB position and determining the range of SPB oscillations in size-matched cells (Figure 2C). In WT cells, the average amplitude of maximum SPB oscillation was 1.9 μm, compared to 3.2 μm for ima1Δ cells (Figure 2C). The ability of the SPB to undergo larger oscillations in ima1Δ cells reflects the greater deformation of the NE and its inability to counteract MT-driven forces. In addition, although many NE extensions appear to be led by the MAS and SPB (Figure 2A, arrows), others appear to extend from regions of the NE that are not associated with visible Sad1 (Figure 2A, asterisks), raising the possibility that MT forces are not coupled efficiently or specifically to the MAS. Importantly, these defects are not caused by aberrant formation of intranuclear MT bundles during interphase, nor do ima1Δ cells possess apparent changes in MT architecture (Figure S5). The defects in NE structure observed in ima1Δ cells are reflected by loss of spherical nuclear shape, as well as increases in NEs that appear “ruffled” (Figure 2D). To quantitate this effect, we measured the nuclear aspect ratio of interphase cells by determining the ratio of long to short axes of the nucleus. This ratio is 1 for a sphere, and increases as the nucleus takes on a more ovoid shape. As shown in Figure 2D, over 80% of interphase WT cells have aspect ratios of less than 1.2, and less than 3% have aspect ratios of greater than 1.4. In contrast, only a third of interphase ima1Δ cells had aspect ratios of less than 1.2, and a full third of cells had aspect ratios of greater than 1.4. We anticipated that the changes in NE shape seen in ima1Δ cells require active MT forces. Nearly 95% of WT cells have aspect ratios of less than 1.2 when MT forces are eliminated by addition of MBC (Figure 2D). Addition of MBC to ima1Δ cells leads to a substantial recovery of the nuclear shape defects apparent in untreated cells, suggesting that the NE distention seen in the absence of Ima1 involves MT-driven forces. Interestingly, this recovery is not complete, suggesting that some irreversible defects in NE structure also arise in ima1Δ cells. To investigate the specificity of this effect, we investigated whether similar defects are seen in cells lacking the INM protein Heh1. Defects in the NE that occur in heh1Δ cells are distinct from those observed in ima1Δ cells and are not manifested in changes in the spherical nature of the nuclei (Figure S6). Further heh1Δ cells do not display any unusual NE deformations (data not shown). In conjunction with changes in NE dynamics and shape, ima1Δ cells also accumulate cytoplasmic foci containing Cut11-GFP (over 45% of ima1Δ cells, Figures 2D and 2E) and/or Sad1-DsRed (25% of cells, Figure 2E and Figure S6), often specifically at the poles of the cell (Figure 2D, arrows). The separation of these foci from the NE is not reversible because they remain in the cytoplasm even after treatment with MBC. Like irrevocable effects on NE shape, we expect that these foci arise from failures of the NE structure under MT force drastic enough to cause fragments of NE to become separated from the nucleus. Since NE-MT interfaces are typically enriched in Sad1, it is not unexpected that we would observe foci containing both Cut11-GFP and Sad1-DsRed (Figure S6). We sometimes observe NE deformations that are not associated with visible Sad1 (Figure 2A, asterisks) but can be reversed by MBC. We hypothesized that the ability of MTs to produce NE extensions would require KASH domain proteins even if Sad1-DsRed is at low levels or is absent from these interfaces. Although Kms1 is dispensable for vegetative growth (Shimanuki et al., 1997Shimanuki M. Miki F. Ding D.Q. Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Horio T. Niwa O. A novel fission yeast gene, kms1+, is required for the formation of meiotic prophase-specific nuclear architecture.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we found that cells lacking Kms2 are almost completely inviable (M.C.K., unpublished data). GFP-Kms2 localizes specifically to one focus at the MAS, where it colocalizes and comigrates with Sad1 (Figure 3A). We do not detect GFP-Kms2 at iMTOCs. The distribution of GFP-Kms2 is profoundly altered in ima1Δ cells. Most obviously, Kms2 is found in several foci at the NE (Figure 3A). Further, the relative distribution of GFP-Kms2 and Sad1-DsRed varies greatly within these foci. For example, there are two Sad1-DsRed foci of approximately equal intensity that move together along the NE (Figure 3A, arrow and asterisk). Interestingly, only one of these foci (Figure 3A, arrow) colocalizes with GFP-Kms2. Conversely, the focus of greatest GFP-Kms2 intensity contains a relatively small fraction of Sad1-DsRed (Figure 3A, arrowhead). These observations suggest that the MAS is fragmented in ima1Δ cells, altering the normal stoichiometry of inner MAS proteins and outer MAS proteins. Fragmentation of the MAS in ima1Δ cells is also reflected in the number of MAS foci (the combined number of Sad1-DsRed and GFP-Kms2 foci) that accumulate at the NE (Figure 3B). Whereas over 90% of WT cells have a single MAS focus, over 50% of ima1Δ cells have multiple MAS foci. Further, 15% of ima1Δ cells have three or more MAS foci, a phenotype never observed in WT cells. Although there is an increase in the total fluorescence intensity of GFP-Kms2 and Sad1-DsRed in some ima1Δ cells, we did not detect a substantial increase in Sad1 levels in ima1Δ cells (Figure S7). Further, large NE deformations are often observed in cells that display normal levels of Sad1-DsRed and GFP-Kms2. Thus, it is unlikely that upregulation of Sad1 and Kms2 causes the defects we observe in ima1Δ cells. We next investigated the mechanism by which Ima1 contributes to the organization and/or integrity of the MAS. We envision that, in order to effectively buffer MT forces, the SUN-KASH complexes at the NE require additional associated factors to stabilize the MAS. Interestingly, centromeres (and proteins that bind to centromeric DNA) are clustered adjacent to the site of SPB attachment (Funabiki et al., 1993Funabiki H. Hagan I. Uzawa S. Yanagida M. Cell cycle-dependent specific positioning and clustering of centromeres and telomeres in fission yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), suggesting a link between chromatin and the cytoskeleton. Although little information about the potential importance of centromere localization to the MAS is available, it is clear that telomeres, which are clustered in place of centromeres at the MAS during meiotic prophase, are critical to MAS function during this period. Release of telomeres from the MAS (by deletion of their binding proteins) during meiosis leads to large NE extensions (Chikashige et al., 2006Chikashige Y. Tsutsumi C. Yamane M. Okamasa K. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Meiotic proteins bqt1 and bqt2 tether telomeres to form the bouquet arrangement of chromosomes.Cell. 2006; 125: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and accumulation of Sad1 foci in the cytoplasm (Tomita and Cooper, 2007Tomita K. Cooper J.P. The telomere bouquet controls the meiotic spindle.Cell. 2007; 130: 113-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because ima1Δ cells display similar phenotypes, we considered whether deletion of Ima1 might affect the interaction of centromeres with the MAS. This model predicts that Ima1 may itself interact with centromeres. We investigated whether Ima1 interacts with centromeric DNA by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). When we immunoprecipitated GFP-Ima1, we detected a 5-fold enrichment at the central region of the centromere (cnt1), with less enrichment over the outer centromeric regions, including the innermost (imr) and outer repeats (otr; dg and dh, Figure 4A). This distribution is different from that of heterochromatin-binding proteins such as Swi6, the S. pombe homolog of HP1 (Lorentz et al., 1994Lorentz A. Ostermann K. Fleck O. Schmidt H. Switching gene swi6, involved in repression of silent mating-type loci in fission yeast, encodes a homologue of chromatin-associated proteins from Drosophila and mammals.Gene. 1994; 143: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which enriches primarily in the repeat regions (Figure S8A). Thus, this finding supports the hypothesis that Ima1 serves to couple centromeric heterochromatin to the NE by interacting with the centromeric core. We next examined whether clustering of the centromeres at the MAS was disrupted in ima1Δ cells expressing LacI-GFP in which Lac operators were integrated into the centromeric region of chromosome II (GFP-Cen; Yamamoto and Hiraoka, 2003Yamamoto A. Hiraoka Y. Monopolar spindle attachment of sister chromatids is ensured by two distinct mechanisms at the first meiotic division in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2284-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In WT cells, GFP-Cen is usually found colocalized with or adjacent to the MAS (Sad1-DsRed; Figures 4B and 4C). In ima1Δ cells, centromeres continue to oscillate with the SPB (Figure 4D); however, we observe several defects in the association of centromeres with the MAS. The centromeres in ima1Δ cells often become physically separated from the Sad1-DsRed focus (the MAS, Figure 4D); GFP-Cen and Sad1-DsRed are found colocalized (completely or partially) in only about 25% of cells and are found completely separated in about half of all cells (Figure 4B and Figure S9). Further, we often observe that the two centromeres of the sister chromatids in ima1Δ cells break apart into separated foci (Figure 4D, asterisk) during oscillatory movement. Similar results were obtained when we imaged the total centromeric heterochromatin using a GFP-fusion of Swi6 (Figure S8). Together, these findings suggest that Ima1 supports the coupling of centromeric heterochromatin to the MAS directly by simultaneously binding centromeres and the NE. We suggest that the loss of tight coupling between centromeres and the MAS leads to the increased amplitude of SPB oscillation associated with NE deformations. Further, these results predict that force delivered by MTs to fragmented MAS components lacking associated centromeric heterochromatin may lead to large deformations of the NE. Indeed, in the absence of Ima1, we observe large deformations of the nucleus (visualized by nuclear LacI-GFP) led by an MAS fragment of Sad1-DsRed that is uncoupled from the centromeres (Figure 4D, arrow). Such deformations are MT dependent, because they are never observed in cells treated with MBC (data not shown). Taken together, these results are consistent with the possibility that heterochromatin supports the MAS—a role potentially carried out by centromeres during vegetative, interphase growth and by telomeres during meiotic prophase. A model in which centromeric heterochromatin supports the MAS predicts that release of centromeres from the MAS would be expected to cause defects that mimic those associated with loss of Ima1. To test this, we utilized a strain harboring a temperature-sensitive mutation in Nuf2, a component of the Ndc80 complex that is essential for the colocalization of centromeres with Sad1 during interphase (Appelgren et al., 2003Appelgren H. Kniola B. Ekwall K. Distinct centromere domain structures with separate functions demonstrated in live fission yeast cells.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To prevent mitotic defects associated with loss of kinetochore function, all results using this allele, nuf2-1 (Nabetani et al., 2001Nabetani A. Koujin T. Tsutsumi C. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. A conserved protein, Nuf2, is implicated in connecting the centromere to the spindle during chromosome segregation: A link between the kinetochore function and the spindle checkpoint.Chromosoma. 2001; 110: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were obtained at a permissive temperature of 25°C. We examined the state of the NE and MAS in nuf2-1 cells expressing Sad1-DsRed and Heh1-GFP. In WT cells, Heh1-GFP localizes to the NE, where it sometimes enriches in the MAS (Figure 5A). In nuf2-1 cells, we observed NE and MAS defects similar to those observed in ima1Δ cells. First, foci of Heh1-GFP and Sad1-DsRed accumulated in the cytoplasm of nuf2-1 cells (Figure 5B). The proportion of nuf2-1 cells with cytoplasmic Sad1-foci (22%, Figure 5B) is similar to that seen in ima1Δ cells (25%, Figure 2E). This suggests that compromising the interaction of centromeres with the MAS is sufficient to cause MAS and SPB dysfunction. Further, like ima1Δ cells, nuf2-1 cells have defects in nuclear shape (Figure 5C). Although the defect in nuclear shape is somewhat less pronounced than that seen in ima1Δ cells, nuf2-1 cells clearly deviate from WT cells, having aspect ratios of less than 1.2 in only 50% of cells and aspect ratios of more than 1.4 in over 10% of cells. Further, the NEs of nuf2-1 cells appear locally perturbed, with ruffles and invaginations (Figure 5C). Like ima1Δ cells, the defects in nuclear shape in nuf2-1 cells can be rescued by addition of MBC (Figure 5C). Thus, weakening the interaction of centromeres with the MAS is sufficient to cause defects in NE and MAS function. In S. pombe, there are three major regions of"

It is thus crucial to understand the relationships between genetic mutations, endogenous residual enzyme proteins (cross-reactive immunologic material), development of neutralizing antibodies and their impact on clinical outcomes of lysosomal storage diseases.

Cross-linking of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcɛRI) leads to degranulation and allergic inflammation; however, the regulatory mechanisms of IgE-dependent exocytosis remain unknown. We show here that IκB kinase (IKK) 2 in mast cells plays critical roles in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in vivo, and IgE-mediated degranulation in vitro, in an NF-kB-independent manner. Upon FcɛRI stimulation, IKK2 phosphorylates SNAP-23, the target membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE), and ectopic expression of a phospho-mimetic mutant of SNAP-23 partially rescued the impaired IgE-mediated degranulation in IKK2-deficient mast cells. These results suggest that IKK2 phosphorylation of SNAP-23 leads to degranulation and anaphylactic reactions. While this reaction is NF-kB-independent, we additionally show that IKK2 also regulates late-phase allergic reactions promoted by the release of proinflammatory cytokines in an NF-kB-dependent manner. The findings suggest that IKK2 is a central player in allergic reactions."

We used mutagenesis and suppressor analyses to identify the AHL-binding domain of LuxN and discovered LuxN mutants that confer both decreased and increased AHL sensitivity. Our analysis of dose-response curves of multiple LuxN mutants pins these inverse phenotypes on quantifiable opposing shifts in the free-energy bias of LuxN for occupying its kinase and phosphatase states. To understand receptor activation and to characterize the pathway signaling parameters, we exploited a strong LuxN antagonist, one of fifteen small-molecule antagonists we identified.

Although exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2/Fgf-2) is commonly used to expand adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in vitro, we do not yet understand the functional significance or the molecular regulation of Fgf-2 expressed endogenously by adult NSPCs. We previously demonstrated that methylated CpG binding protein 1 (MBD1/Mbd1) is a transcriptional repressor of Fgf-2 and is enriched in adult brains. Mbd1 deficiency in mice selectively affected adult neurogenesis and the differentiation of NSPCs. Here we show that an Mbd1 and DNA methylation-mediated epigenetic mechanism regulated the expression of stem cell mitogen Fgf-2 in adult NSPCs. Mbd1 bound to the Fgf-2 promoter and regulates its expression in adult NSPCs. In the absence of functional Mbd1, the Fgf-2 promoter was hypomethylated, and treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor resulted in increased Fgf-2 expression in adult NSPCs. We further demonstrated that both acute knockdown of Mbd1 or overexpression of Fgf-2 in adult NSPCs inhibited their neuronal differentiation, which could be responsible for the neurogenic deficits observed in Mbd1-deficient mice. These data indicate that intrinsic epigenetic mechanisms play critical roles in the regulation of adult NSPC functions."

https://openalex.org/W1973535211,"Eukaryotic Okazaki fragment maturation requires complete removal of the initiating RNA primer before ligation occurs. Polymerase delta (Pol delta) extends the upstream Okazaki fragment and displaces the 5'-end of the downstream primer into a single nucleotide flap, which is removed by FEN1 nuclease cleavage. This process is repeated until all RNA is removed. However, a small fraction of flaps escapes cleavage and grows long enough to be coated with RPA and requires the consecutive action of the Dna2 and FEN1 nucleases for processing. Here we tested whether RPA inhibits FEN1 cleavage of long flaps as proposed. Surprisingly, we determined that RPA binding to long flaps made dynamically by polymerase delta only slightly inhibited FEN1 cleavage, apparently obviating the need for Dna2. Therefore, we asked whether other relevant proteins promote long flap cleavage via the Dna2 pathway. The Pif1 helicase, implicated in Okazaki maturation from genetic studies, improved flap displacement and increased RPA inhibition of long flap cleavage by FEN1. These results suggest that Pif1 accelerates long flap growth, allowing RPA to bind before FEN1 can act, thereby inhibiting FEN1 cleavage. Therefore, Pif1 directs long flaps toward the two-nuclease pathway, requiring Dna2 cleavage for primer removal."

Malaria, caused by infections of the intracellular parasitic apicomplexans belonging to the genus Plasmodium, exerts a significant mortality, morbidity, and economic burden in the developing parts of the world. The Plasmodium life cycle involves a vertebrate host and a mosquito host during which period the malaria parasites, for several times, undergo a significant amount of cell division and population amplification. In a vertebrate host, depending on the Plasmodium species, within a period of 2-14 days in liver cells a single sporozoite may replicate into 10,000-40,000 asexual liver-form merozoites. The merozoites invade erythrocytes, and during each intraerythrocytic replication cycle, a uninucleated merozoite can produce between 18 and 36 blood form parasites in a 24-72-h period. A small sub-set of these asexual forms differentiate into nonreplicating sexual gametocytes, a stage absolutely critical for malaria transmission through mosquitoes. In mosquito, a zygote formed by fertilization between a male and a female gamete may give rise to ∼3000 infectious sporozoites. This ability to undergo abundant amplification cycles within a brief time span is critical for the survival and further transmission of malaria parasites. Although our knowledge regarding the cellular and molecular events involved in cell division in malaria parasites remains obscure, a few studies suggest that distinct cell division mechanisms regulate the multiplication of malaria parasites during different life cycle stages (1Arnot D.E. Gull K. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, during the nondividing phase in the cell cycle, microtubules are organized around a central organelle, termed centrosome, that is composed of a pair of centrioles. In most situations, centrosome duplication is critical for the formation of mitotic spindles and normal cell division (2Kramer A. Neben K. Ho A.D. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2002; 16: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Brinkley B.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 18-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Removal of centrosomes by micromanipulation techniques results in G1 phase cell cycle arrest and the inability to undergo cytokinesis (4Hinchcliffe E.H. Miller F.J. Cham M. Khodjakov A. Sluder G. Science. 2001; 291: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Khodjakov A. Rieder C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Among several species of algae and protozoans and in animal epithelial cells and sperm cells, centrosomes are called basal bodies that trigger the formation of flagella and cilia (6Dirksen E.R. Biol. Cell. 1991; 72: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies in erythrocytic form parasites suggest that Plasmodium parasites do not possess the well defined cell cycle events that are present in typical higher eukaryotes. Based on its unique characteristics, cell division in malaria parasites is classified as cryptomitosis (1Arnot D.E. Gull K. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Read M. Sherwin T. Holloway S.P. Gull K. Hyde J.E. Parasitology. 1993; 106: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) where throughout the cell division the nuclear membrane remains intact. Another characteristic feature in these parasites is the presence of a single centriolar plaque engaged in the pore of the nuclear membrane that gives rise to a half-spindle or hemispindle (8Schrevel J. Asfaux-Foucher G. Bafort J.M. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1977; 59: 332-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The centriolar plaque subsequently divides to give rise to two daughter hemispindles that move in opposite directions and form a complete spindle (1Arnot D.E. Gull K. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In recent years, significant progress has been made toward the understanding of the molecules and cellular processes that regulate centrosome duplication in higher eukaryotes. In this context, centrin, a low molecular weight protein that belongs to the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins has been found to be associated with centrioles, centrosomes, and mitotic spindle poles (9Baron A.T. Greenwood T.M. Salisbury J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In line with its Ca2+ binding characteristics, centrin-based fiber systems demonstrate Ca2+-induced contractile motion (10Salisbury J.L. Baron A. Surek B. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11Wright R.L. Salisbury J. Jarvik J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1903-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The critical role of centrin in the cell cycle is evident from the studies showing that experimentally induced mutations in the centrin gene in yeast, Chlamydomonas, mice, and humans results in failure of centrosome/basal body duplication and cell cycle arrest (12Baum P. Furlong C. Byers B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13r B. Schoppmeier J. Grunow A. Lechtreck K.F. J.

In trypanosomatid protozoans Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma brucei, centrins play a critical role in cell division (16Selvapandiyan A. Debrabant A. Duncan R. Muller J. Salotra P. Sreenivas G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43253-43261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In L. donovani, genetic deletion of centrin-1 results in specific failure of basal body duplication, arrested cytokinesis, and a severely impaired growth (16Selvapandiyan A. Debrabant A. Duncan R. Muller J. Salotra P. Sreenivas G. Salisbury J.L. Nakhasi H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25703-25710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RNA interference-mediated knockdown in the expression of the centrin-1 gene in T. brucei results in failure of organelle segregation and cytokinesis (19Selvapandiyan A. Kumar P. Morris J.C. Salisbury J.L. Wang C.C. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3290-3301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human HeLa cells knockdown of centrin-2 by RNA interference resulted in failure of centriole duplication during cell division (14Salisbury J.L. Suino K.M. Busby R. Springett M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1287-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These results clearly point toward the critical role of centrins in the regulation of the cell cycle probably mediated through its participation in centrosome/basal body duplication. In this communication, we report the biological characterization of Plasmodium falciparum centrin (PfCEN) 2The abbreviations used are: PfCEN, P. falciparum centrin; LdCEN, Leishmania donovani centrin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IEM, immunoelectron microscopy; KO, Gene knock-out; MTOC, microtubule organizing center; RAP1, Rhoptry-associated protein 1; WT, wild type; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. molecules, and by means of growth complementation studies in Leishmania parasites, we demonstrate their function in cell division. To this end, we have performed gene isolation, phylogenetic analysis, and determined the stage-specific expression and cellular localization of four centrin molecules in P. falciparum malaria parasites. We also determined the effect of episomal expression of P. falciparum centrin genes in growth-deficient L. donovani parasites that have deletion in their centrin-1 gene. Synchronized P. falciparum 3D7 parasite cultures were maintained in a temperature cycling incubator with a periodicity of 48 h (20Haynes J.D. Moch J.K. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 72: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar). Synchronously growing parasites were harvested at ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages of development. Gametocyte culture was set up as described previously, and cells were harvested on day 14 followed by Percoll gradient purification to enrich the gametocyte population. For P. falciparum oocysts, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were infected with gametocytes of P. falciparum by membrane feeding. Fed mosquitoes were maintained in the insectaries at 27 °C and at 70-80% relative humidity, and midguts were dissected on days 7-9 after infectious blood meals. Malaria genomic data base at PLASMODB was analyzed to search for the annotated P. falciparum centrin sequences. The primers used to isolate the centrin genes were designed based on the sequences from the data base and are shown in supplemental Table S1. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from P. falciparum asynchronized erythrocytic stages (mixture of ring, trophozoite, and schizont) using High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). A total of 2 μg of RNA from the blood stage parasites was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl volume. 5 μl of the reverse-transcribed product was subjected to PCR using PfCentrin-specific primers. The PCR product was cloned in pET 101/D-TOPO vector and transformed in TOP 10 electrocompetent cells as per the kit's instruction (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmids containing the four centrin genes were used to determine the DNA sequence. Sequence similarity searches of the protein sequence data bases were performed using the BLASTPGP program and those of the DNA sequence data bases using the TBLASTN and BLASTN programs. The initial differentiation of putative centrin homologs from those of other EF-hand proteins like calmodulin was carried out using reciprocal BLASTPGP searches against individual proteome data bases for each of the species included in our study. This was then followed by rigorous phylogenetic analysis to delineate the different orthologous groups and lineage-specific expansions. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was derived from a multiple sequence alignment of the centrins selected to include a diverse set of completely sequenced eukaryotic lineages, namely animals, fungi, plants, apicomplexans, ciliates, kinetoplastids, heterolobosans, parabasalids, and diplomonads. The multiple sequence alignment was constructed using the Kalign program (21Lassmann T. Sonnhammer E.L. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 298Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The among-site variation of rates for the alignment was modeled as a distribution with four discrete rate categories (because the alignment length is short), and the positions belonging to each rate category, rates, and the α-parameters of the distribution were estimated using the TreePuzzle 5.1 program with JTT matrix (22Schmidt H.A. Strimmer K. Vingron M. von Haeseler A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). This was used to infer the ML tree with PROML from the Phylip package, and bootstrap support was estimated using 500 replicates with the PHYML program (23Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14250) Google Scholar) and RELL-BP (10,000 replicates) with PROTML. A parallel neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the Mega4 package (24Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25581) Google Scholar) by using heterogeneous rates across sites modeled using different α-parameters. The α-parameter chosen for the final analysis was the one that reproduced the species tree consistently within different centrin orthologous groups. Four PfCENs were produced as recombinant proteins in BL21 E. coli. Following transformation of E. coli cells with recombinant plasmids, expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The histidine-tagged recombinant protein was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column as per the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). Antibodies to the four PfCENs were generated by immunizations in mice with recombinant centrins. Six- to 8-week-old female CD1 mice used in immunizations were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health manual “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.” Mice were immunized (five per group) subcutaneously with 10 μg of the purified protein in Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted 3 and 6 weeks later with 10 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Control mice received Freund's adjuvant only. Serum samples were collected at the time of each immunization and 10 days after the last immunization and stored at -20 °C. A mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used to stain the microtubule network (25Gerald N.J. Coppens I. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 962-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rat anti BiP antibody was used as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker (26Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Kumar N. Syin C.A. Carter R. Quakyi I. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6277-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-RAP1 monoclonal antibody (7H8/50) was used as a marker for rhoptries (28Schofield L. Bushell G.R. Cooper J.A. Saul A.J. Upcroft J.A. Kidson C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from P. falciparum synchronized erythrocytic (ring, trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte) and sporozoite stages using High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). A total of 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl volume. Quantitative real time PCR was carried out in triplicate using MyiQ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Gene-specific primers were designed using Beacon Designer4.0 software (supplemental Table S1). Each reaction was optimized to contain equal amounts of cDNA, 100 ng of gene specific primers, and 1× SYBR Green PCR mix (Bio-Rad). Cycle threshold (CT) values were determined by using iCycler software. Standard curves for each centrin gene were obtained by using different concentrations of wild type P. falciparum genomic DNA (102 to10-5 ng/μl) as template. The relative genomic equivalence of individual centrin genes was determined by using the respective CT values. The P. falciparum fructose-biphosphate aldolase gene was used to normalize the relative genomic equivalence for each centrin gene (29Salanti A. Staalsoe T. Lavstsen T. Jensen A.T. Sowa M.P. Arnot D.E. Hviid L. Theander T.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Spots of P. falciparum sporozoites, erythrocytic and gametocyte stage parasites were made on 12-well glass slides. Parasites were incubated with mouse anti-PfCEN antibody specific to PfCEN1, -2, -3, and -4, and centrin-antibodies complex was detected by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Slides were mounted using VectaShield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and evaluated using an Olympus BX-50 microscope equipped with Olympus DP71 digital camera (Olympus Imaging America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Images were transferred to the PC version of Adobe Photoshop 5.0 for labeling and printing. For oocyst-stage parasites, midguts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times for 10 min each in 1× PBS. Then the midguts were permeabilized in 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The midguts were incubated with mouse anti-PfCEN antibodies specific for PfCEN1, -2, -3, and -4 in permeabilization buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were washed with 1× PBS three times for 10 min each. Centrin-antibodies complex was detected by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h in permeabilization buffer. Midguts were mounted onto glass slides with VectaShield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories) and evaluated using an Olympus BX-50 microscope as described earlier. For confocal and widefield epifluorescence microscopy, P. falciparum asexual blood stage schizonts were fixed in 3% EM grade formaldehyde in PBS, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, for 30 min at room temperature and were allowed to settle onto lysine-coated coverslips. The infected red cells were permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed once in PBS for 5 min, and incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody (PfCEN3 and/or α-tubulin/or BiP/RAP1) was diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the samples for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed three times for 5 min in PBS and then incubated in a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen)) diluted in blocking solution for 1 h. For double labeling of PfCEN3 and tubulin, PfCEN3 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and tubulin was labeled with the Zenon® Alexa Fluor 680 Mouse IgG1 kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were washed once in PBS and then stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 10 min. Samples were washed for two additional times in PBS, swirled briefly in distilled water, and then mounted in VectaShield antifade reagent (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were obtained with a Leica TCS-AOBS/SP2 confocal microscope with a 100×, 1.3 NA, or a 63×, 1.4 NA objective with zoom setting 6-8. Widefield epifluorescence images were obtained with a 100×, 1.3NA objective and cooled CCD camera as described previously (25Gerald N.J. Coppens I. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 962-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Images were adjusted for contrast in Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems). Immunoelectron microscopy was carried out on in vitro cultured blood stage schizonts of P. falciparum and sporozoites isolated from infected mosquito salivary glands using 1:40 anti-PfCEN2 antibody by using a procedure described earlier (30Nguyen T.V.

To determine the functional role of centrin in malaria, PfCENs were transfected in centrin-1 deleted L. donovani null mutants (LdCEN1KO) (16Selvapandiyan A. Debrabant A. Duncan R. Muller J. Salotra P. Sreenivas G. Salisbury J.L. Nakhasi H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25703-25710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). P. falciparum centrin genes encoding for PfCEN1, -2, -3, and -4 were PCR-amplified using P. falciparum centrin containing TOPO plasmids as template. The primer sequences and restriction sites used to amplify the recombinant constructs are given in supplemental Table S1. The PCR-amplified centrin genes were initially cloned at the T/A cloning site of pCRII-TOPO cloning vector. The fidelity of the cloned sequences was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The centrin gene inserts were further cloned in BamHI restriction sites of the Leishmania expression plasmid PHLEO (31Freedman D.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resultant recombinant plasmids, pXG-PHLEO-PfCEN1, pXG-PHLEO-PfCEN2, pXG-PHLEO-PfCEN3, and pXG-PHLEO-PfCEN4 were transfected individually into the LdCEN1KO L. donovani promastigotes by electroporation of recombinant plasmid DNA. The detailed procedure for episomal transfection in L. donovani has been described previously (16Selvapandiyan A. Debrabant A. Duncan R. Muller J. Salotra P. Sreenivas G. Salisbury J.L. Nakhasi H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25703-25710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transfected promastigotes were initially selected in the presence of 10 μg/ml phleomycin (Sigma) and then after each culture cycle were grown in gradually increasing concentrations of phleomycin that finally reached 150 μg/ml. Finally, transfected Leishmania growing in the presence of 150 μg/ml of drug were used in subsequent experiments. The episomal expression of the hemagglutinin-tagged PfCENs in recombinant Leishmania lines was determined in an ECL-based Western blot. Briefly, 4.5 × 105 PfCENs-transfected amastigotes were resolved on 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE gel and transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-HA tag (1:1000) and anti-α-tubulin (1:8000) antibodies, and blots were developed using a chemiluminescence-linked Western blot kit (Western Light Tropix, Bedford, MA). To study whether transfection of P. falciparum centrins in the LdCEN1KO parasite line was able to reconstitute the loss of Leishmania centrin function, recombinant centrin-expressing promastigotes were moved into medium for axenic amastigote growth with phleomycin (150 μg/ml), and their growth rate was monitored along with the LdCEN1KO parasites and wild type (WT) parasites as controls. Identification and Cloning of PfCEN Genes—By sequence similarity searches using the BLASTPGP program, we identified the sequences of four P. falciparum centrin homologs. These molecules are located on chromosomes 1 (NP_703272), 10 (NP_700744), 11 (NP_700931), and 14 (NP_702332) and were annotated as PfCEN1 (chromosome 1), PfCEN2 (chromosome 14), PfCEN3 (chromosome 10), and PfCEN4 (chromosome 11). Further sequence searches in PlasmoDB has led us to identify two centrin homologs in Plasmodium vivax (Pv081420 and Pv111335), three in Plasmodium yoelii (XP_727858, XP_726416, ad XP_723980), and four each in Plasmodium berghei (PB000338.02.0, PB000363.00.0, PB000584.00.0, and PB001391.02.0) and Plasmodium knowlesi (PKH_020620, PKH_061200, PKH_090270, and PKH_125980). By using gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1), we amplified all four PfCEN genes from a cDNA library prepared from blood stage parasites. We found that for the centrins PfCEN3 and PfCEN4, the amplified gene products were smaller than their sizes as predicted in PlasmoDB. PfCEN3 amplified as a 540-bp gene instead of the expected 750 bp, and PfCEN4 amplified a 516-bp product instead of 618 bp. Amplification of PfCEN1 and PfCEN2 genes results in fragments of 507 bp each that matched their expected size (supplemental Fig. S1). We cloned these amplified products in pET 101/D-TOPO plasmid and transformed into TOP 10 cells and determined their nucleotide sequence. PfCEN1 and PfCEN2 sequences correspond to the original PlasmoDB data base sequences. For the PfCEN3 gene, our nucleotide sequence matched with the sequence predicted by FullPhat (chr10.phat_285) instead of the annotation presented by TIGR (PF10_0271) that shows the presence of three introns instead of the four introns present in our PfCEN3. Similarly, for PfCEN4 the gene annotation by TIGR designated as PF11_0066 shows the presence of one intron, whereas we find two introns as predicted by Genefinder chr11.gen_32. All four PfCEN genes have multiple exons as follows: six in PfCEN1, five in PfCEN3, and three each in PfCEN2 and -4 (supplemental Fig. S2), which is comparable with the multiple introns found in the centrin genes of other unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals (32Gavet O. Alvarez C. Gaspar P. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1818-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Gilbert W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum centrin genes PfCEN1, -2, -3 and -4 encode proteins of length 168, 168, 179, and 171 amino acids, respectively. Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis of Centrins—All the four PfCENs fit the expected pattern described for centrin molecules from other organisms in possessing four conserved EF-hand domains that are organized in the form of a pair of two EF-hand units connected by a flexible linker (34Kretsinger R.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The PfCENs display extensive sequence variability in the N-terminal regions (i.e. upstream of the first EF hand) and in the linker regions (Fig. 1). These N-terminal extensions in the PfCENs (∼20-30 amino acids long) contain predicted basic nuclear localization signals that direct the protein to the nucleus (35Christophe D. Christophe-Hobertus C. Pichon B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell.

In an EF-hand loop, the calcium ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration; six residues involved in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12. In this arrangement, t"
https://openalex.org/W2169182876,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (pX) is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis by an unknown mechanism. Employing the tetracycline-regulated pX-expressing 4pX-1 cell line, derived from the murine AML12 hepatocyte cell line, we demonstrate that pX induces partial polyploidy (>4N DNA). Depletion of p53 in 4pX-1 cells increases by 5-fold the polyploid cells in response to pX expression, indicating that p53 antagonizes pX-induced polyploidy. Dual-parameter flow cytometric analyses show pX-dependent bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation in 4pX-1 cells containing 4N and >4N DNA, suggesting pX induces DNA re-replication. Interestingly, pX increases expression of endogenous replication initiation factors Cdc6 and Cdtl while suppressing geminin expression, a negative regulator of rereplication. In comparison to a geminin knockdown 4pX-1 cell line used as DNA re-replication control, the Cdt1/geminin ratio is greater in 4pX-1 cells expressing pX, indicating that pX promotes DNA re-replication. In support of this conclusion, pX-expressing 4pX-1 cells, similar to the geminin knockdown 4pX-1 cells, continue to incorporate BrdUrd in the G2 phase and exhibit nuclear Cdc6 and MCM5 co-localization and the absence of geminin. In addition, pX expression activates the ATR kinase, the sensor of DNA re-replication, which in turn phosphorylates RAD17 and H2AX. Interestingly, phospho-H2AX-positive and BrdUrd -positive cells progress through mitosis, demonstrating a link between pX-induced DNA re-replication and polyploidy. Our studies high-light a novel function of pX that likely contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. Hepatitis B virus X protein (pX) is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis by an unknown mechanism. Employing the tetracycline-regulated pX-expressing 4pX-1 cell line, derived from the murine AML12 hepatocyte cell line, we demonstrate that pX induces partial polyploidy (>4N DNA). Depletion of p53 in 4pX-1 cells increases by 5-fold the polyploid cells in response to pX expression, indicating that p53 antagonizes pX-induced polyploidy. Dual-parameter flow cytometric analyses show pX-dependent bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation in 4pX-1 cells containing 4N and >4N DNA, suggesting pX induces DNA re-replication. Interestingly, pX increases expression of endogenous replication initiation factors Cdc6 and Cdtl while suppressing geminin expression, a negative regulator of rereplication. In comparison to a geminin knockdown 4pX-1 cell line used as DNA re-replication control, the Cdt1/geminin ratio is greater in 4pX-1 cells expressing pX, indicating that pX promotes DNA re-replication. In support of this conclusion, pX-expressing 4pX-1 cells, similar to the geminin knockdown 4pX-1 cells, continue to incorporate BrdUrd in the G2 phase and exhibit nuclear Cdc6 and MCM5 co-localization and the absence of geminin. In addition, pX expression activates the ATR kinase, the sensor of DNA re-replication, which in turn phosphorylates RAD17 and H2AX. Interestingly, phospho-H2AX-positive and BrdUrd -positive cells progress through mitosis, demonstrating a link between pX-induced DNA re-replication and polyploidy. Our studies high-light a novel function of pX that likely contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis.

Hwang L.Y. Lin C.C. Chien C.S. Lancet. 1981; 2: 1129-1133Abstract PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) by an unknown mechanism. In HBV-mediated HCC the rate of chromosomal aberrations is significantly increased in comparison to HCC associated with other risk factors (2Cougot D. Neuveut C. Buendia M.A. J Clin Virol. 2005; 34: S75-S78Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 3Marchio A. Meddeb M. Pineau P. Danglot G. Tiollais P. Bernheim A. Dejean A.

Isokawa O. Mita Y. Waguri N. Kuroiwa T. Igarashi M. Tsukada K. Mori S. Shimizu T. Suzuki Y. Abe Y. Takahashi T. Nomoto M. Asakura H.

Herein, employing the HBV X protein (pX) as the oncogenic signal, we investigate whether pX expression induces chromosomal abnormalities, resulting in HCC pathogenesis. The link between HBV-mediated HCC and pX is derived both from clinical evidence (8Su Q. Schroder C.H. Hofmann W.J. Otto G. Pichlmayr R. Bannasch P. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as well as animal and cell culture transformation studies (9Andrisani O.M. Barnabas S. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 373-379PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, integration of HBV DNA into the host genome occurs at early steps of clonal tumor expansion, with most tumors displaying sustained expression of pX (8Su Q. Schroder C.H. Hofmann W.J. Otto G. Pichlmayr R. Bannasch P. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Importantly, pX, which is essential for the viral life cycle (10Zoulim F. Saputelli J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a multifunctional protein inducing activation of the cellular mitogenic ras-raf-MAPK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38MAPK pathways (11Bouchard M.J. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12725-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and transcription of select viral and cellular genes (9Andrisani O.M. Barnabas S. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 373-379PubMed Google Scholar). These pX activities deregulate cellular gene expression, resulting either in unscheduled cell cycle progression (12Lee S. Tarn C. Wang W.H. Chen S. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8730-8740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or apoptosis (13Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), depending on the growth conditions. Specifically, pX expression sensitizes the less-differentiated 4pX-1 hepatocyte cell line (14Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to p53-mediated apoptosis only when X-expressing cells are challenged with additional pro-apoptotic stimuli (13Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Wang W.H. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25455-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By contrast, in optimal growth factor conditions, pX induces unscheduled cell cycle progression, a transient S phase pause, activation of the G2/M checkpoint, and eventual progression through the cell cycle (12Lee S. Tarn C. Wang W.H. Chen S. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8730-8740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies by others have demonstrated that overexpression of cyclin E, Cdc25A, and E2F1 leads to unscheduled entry into the S-phase and activation of the ATM/ATR kinases (16Bartkova J. Horejsi Z. Koed K. Kramer A. Tort F. Zieger K. Guldberg P. Sehested M. Nesland J.M. Lukas C. Orntoft T. Lukas J. Barted J. Nature. 2005; 434: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Likewise, overexpression of the cellular oncogene c-myc (17Pusapati R.V. Rounbehler R.J. Hong S. Powers J.T. Yan M. Kiguchi K. McArthur M.J. Wong P.K. Johnson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or expression of pX in apoptotic conditions activate ATM or ATR, respectively, leading to p53 activation and p53-mediated apoptosis (15Wang W.H. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25455-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pre-neoplastic human specimen exhibit markers of DNA damage and apoptosis, including phosphorylated ATM, Chk2, H2AX, and p53 (16Bartkova J. Horejsi Z. Koed K. Kramer A. Tort F. Zieger K. Guldberg P. Sehested M. Nesland J.M. Lukas C. Orntoft T. Lukas J. Barted J. Nature. 2005; 434: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar, 18Gorgoulis V.G. Vassiliou L.-V. F. Karakaidos P. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Liloglou T. Venere M. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Kastrinakis N.G. Levy B. Kletsas D. Yoneta A. Herlyn M. Kittas C. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2005; 34: 907-913Crossref Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). These results suggest that unscheduled S-phase entry induces via ATM/ATR the activation of p53, which acts as a barrier to cancer development. In agreement with these observations, our hypothesis is that in response to pX expression, the hepatocyte undergoes unscheduled S-phase entry, leading to replication stress and DNA damage, activation of ATR, and induction of p53-mediated apoptosis, thereby constraining oncogenesis. Conversely, deregulation of the G2/DNA damage checkpoint, inhibition of DNA repair, or inactivation of p53 would rescue infected hepatocytes from X-induced apoptosis, allowing the generation of genomic aberrations and progression to malignancy. In all cell types DNA replication and segregation of the chromosomes is a highly regulated process, ensuring that both daughter cells inherit a complete and intact complement of the genome (19Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 20Diffley J.F.X. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 778-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The process ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle is called replication licensing. Deregulation of replication licensing results in re-replication or partial replication of the genome, leading to chromosomal abnormalities characteristic of cancer (21Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2115-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Replication licensing involves assembly of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) at the origin of replication, comprised of the origin recognition complex, Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM2-7 proteins (19Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 23Prasanth S.G. Mendez J. Prasanth K.V. Stillman B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The binding of MCM2-7 proteins to pre-RC completes the process of replication licensing, limiting DNA replication to once per cell cycle. The functional licensing of the origin, i.e. the initiation of replication, occurs once cyclin-dependent kinases become active at the onset of S phase (22Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2115-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In metazoans, regulation of replication licensing or pre-RC assembly is mediated by down-regulating Cdt1 activity, required for the recruitment of the MCM2-7 proteins to the replication origin. Cdt1 is expressed in early G1 and is degraded at the late G1 and early S phase (24Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdt1 interacts directly with geminin, the main inhibitor of replication licensing in S and G2 phases (26Hodgson B. Li A. Tada S. Blow J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat.

Science. 2000; 290: 2271-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), resulting in dissociation of the MCM2-7 complex from chromatin (29Lee C. Hong B. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S. Kim Y. Cho Y. Nature. 2004; 430: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Geminin is absent in G1, accumulating during the S and G2/M phases. Geminin is degraded at the end of mitosis, consistent with being a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex (30McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), thus permitting the onset of a new round of replication (22Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2115-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinases also regulate replication licensing, demonstrated by the induction of re-replication after elimination of the mitotic Cdc2 kinase (27Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 31Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K.

Cyclin-dependent kinase inactivation promotes re-accumulation of Cdt1 on chromatin (34Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Mujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of both Cdt1 and Cdc6 in p53-negative cells induces re-replication and polyploidy (35Vaziri D. Saxena S. Geon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol.

Cells were analyzed by Cytomics FC-500 (Beckman-Coulter) at a flow rate of <1000 cells/s using WinList 5.0 software (Verity Software House). Calibration (not shown) was performed using chick erythrocytes for each assay. For live cell sorting, 4pX-1 cells were grown with and without tetracycline as described above, harvested by trypsin treatment, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, and stained with the Hoechst 33422 (500 ng/ml) 1 h before cell sorting. Cells were sorted for DNA content employing the Epics Altra cell sorter (Beckman-Coulter). For dual parameter flow cytometry, 4pX-1 cells grown as described above were incubated with 20 mm BrdUrd for 30 min before fixation in 70% ethanol, Triton X-100.

The second thymidine block was performed for an additional 16 h of incubation ± 5 μg/ml tetracycline. After release from the double thymidine block, cells were grown for 0-14 h and processed for flow cytometry, cell sorting, immunofluorescence microscopy, or whole cell extract (WCE) preparation. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min, washed 3 times in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 7 mm Na2HPO4, 3.5 mm NaH2PO4, 7.7 mm NaN3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1.0% Triton-X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% goat serum.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To understand how pX causes these chromosomal abnormalities, the tetracycline-regulated pX-expressing 4pX-1 cell line was synchronized by growth factor withdrawal as described (14Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); to re-enter the cell cycle, 4pX-1 cells were first treated for 10 h with 10% fetal calf serum followed by removal of tetracycline for 10 h to allow pX expression; nocodazole was added for the last 6 h of cell growth (Fig. 1A). Employing flow cytometry, we quantified that 20% of the cells were in the G2/M phase at 20 h after growth in 10% FCS in the presence of pX expression; nocodazole treatment for an additional 6 h increased the cell number in the G2/M phase to 45% (see the table in Fig. 1. Employing the growth protocol shown in the diagram of Fig. 1A, we quantified by flow cytometry the percent of cells progressing through the cell cycle (Fig. 1, table) and those displaying >4N DNA (Fig. 1A). pX expression increases by 2.5-fold the cell population containing >4N DNA, which we refer to as partially polyploid. Importantly, nocodazole treatment increased this pX-dependent polyploid cell population by 3-fold. Nocodazole acts as a mitotic stressor when used at low concentration by activating the p38MAPK pathway (39Kurata S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because pX also activates the p38MAPK pathway, which inhibits the Cdc25 phosphatase (40Tarn C. Zou L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9763-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) required for activation of the mitotic Cdc2 kinase (12Lee S. Tarn C. Wang W.H. Chen S. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8730-8740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway on pX-induced polyploidy. Treatment of 4pX-1 cells with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (41Nemoto S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 42Karahashi H. Nagata K. Ishii K. Amano F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) resulted in only a 1.6-fold increase in pX-induced polyploidy in the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 1A), an increase that is statistically insignificant (p < 0.1). We interpret these results to mean that pX expression together with nocodazole treatment synergistically activate the p38MAPK pathway, enhancing the pX-induced polyploidy. In supplemental Fig. 1 we show that nocodazole (250 ng/ml) increases the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr-15 in the presence of pX via a p38MAPK-dependent mechanism (supplemental Fig. 1a) without disrupting microtubule polymerization and mitotic spindle assembly (supplemental Fig. 1b). To further confirm the existence of the pX-induced polyploid cell population, we employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and isolated these pX-induced polyploid cells (Fig. 1B). The increased nuclear size of the sorted cells containing >4N DNA further demonstrates that these pX-expressing cells have aberrant DNA content (Fig. 1C). The integrity of the genome is maintained by activation of p53, which induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (43Fei P. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 2: 5774-5783Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because our results indicated that pX induces polyploidy, we examined the level of p53 in 4pX-1 cells. A pX-dependent induction in the p53 protein level is detected in 4pX-1 cells with or without nocodazole treatment, suggesting that this p53 increase is the cellular response to pX-induced polyploidy (Fig. 1D). p53 Antagonizes pX-mediated Polyploidy—To determine whether p53 negatively regulates pX-mediated polyploidy, we employed the 4pX-1-p53kd cell line displaying more than 80% depletion of endogenous p53 (Ref. 15Wang W.H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25455-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A) and quantified the polyploid cell population as a function of pX expression (Fig. 2"

Information on how PRC2 works is limited by lack of structural data on the catalytic subunit, Enhancer of zeste (E(Z)), and the paucity of E(z) mutant alleles that alter its SET domain. Here we analyze missense alleles of Drosophila E(z), selected for molecular study because of their dominant genetic effects. Four missense alleles identify key E(Z) SET domain residues, and a fifth is located in the adjacent CXC domain. Analysis of mutant PRC2 complexes in vitro, and H3-K27 methylation in vivo, shows that each SET domain mutation disrupts PRC2 histone methyltransferase. Based on known SET domain structures, the mutations likely affect either the lysine-substrate binding pocket, the binding site for the adenosylmethionine methyl donor, or a critical tyrosine predicted to interact with the substrate lysine ϵ-amino group. In contrast, the CXC mutant retains catalytic activity, Lys-27 specificity, and trimethylation capacity. Deletion analysis also reveals a functional requirement for a conserved E(Z) domain N-terminal to CXC and SET. These results identify critical SET domain residues needed for PRC2 enzyme function, and they also emphasize functional inputs from outside the SET domain.

Their widespread biological functions and striking evolutionary conservation establish PcG proteins as one of the premier models for deciphering chromatin mechanisms that perpetuate gene silencing during development.

Genetic studies show that individual components of each complex are required for Hox gene silencing in vivo, indicating that these complexes work together to maintain silent chromatin states. Although the integrated mechanisms by which PcG complexes execute gene silencing remain to be determined, subunit compositions and biochemical functions have been defined for individual purified complexes.

In addition, PRC2 and Lys-27 methylation are implicated in mammalian X chromosome inactivation (31Heard E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the Caenorhabditis elegans version of PRC2 methylates Lys-27 and functions in germ line silencing (32Bender L.B. Cao R.

Bishopp A. Roberts G. Doonan J. Jenuwein T. Goodrich J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4638-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This conservation across kingdoms indicates that PRC2 is part of an ancient strategy for chromatin silencing, which employs H3-K27 methylation as a repressive chromatin mark. To understand PRC2 function, it is important to dissect and define the subunit contributions of the enzyme complex. The core of the PRC2 active site is provided by the E(Z) SET domain, which is required for methyltransferase activity in vitro and Hox gene silencing in vivo (14Muller J. Hart C.M. Francis N.J.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Several additional inputs are also critically required for PRC2 function. Each of the three noncatalytic subunits is needed for full HMTase activity, with the most crucial contributions provided by the ESC and SU(Z)12 subunits, which both directly contact E(Z) in the enzyme complex (37Nekrasov M.

Thus, PRC2 is a highly collaborative enzyme complex with multiple subunit and domain inputs needed for robust activity. In light of these multiple inputs, it is important to define E(Z) functional interactions with its partner subunits, and with the nucleosome substrate, in molecular terms. However, relatively little is currently known about workings of the E(Z) SET domain because a three-dimensional structure has not yet been described. Information about functional residues within the E(Z) SET domain is equally limited by the paucity of Drosophila missense mutations that specifically alter this domain. Here we present molecular and biochemical analysis of five E(z) mutant alleles selected because their genetic properties suggest functionally altered versions of E(Z). Four of these are missense mutations that lie within the E(Z) SET domain. We find that each of these SET mutations disrupt H3-K27 methylation in vitro and in vivo, thereby defining SET domain residues critical for PRC2 activity. Based upon other SET domains with known structures, we suggest that these E(z) mutations affect motifs implicated in either the lysine-substrate binding pocket, the binding site for the adenosylmethionine methyl donor, or a critical tyrosine that may contact the reactive lysine ϵ-amino group. These missense alleles, together with additional site-directed substitutions, define requirements within the E(Z) SET domain for histone methyltransferase activity. In addition, deletion analysis reveals that E(Z) domain I is also needed for PRC2 enzyme function. Sequence Determination of Mutant Alleles—Genomic DNA was extracted from larvae or adult flies that were hemizygous for the E(z)son1, E(z)son2, E(z)son3, E(z)1, or E(z)62 alleles in trans to a deficiency of the E(z) chromosomal region. The E(z) genomic region was amplified by PCR and sequenced as described previously (48Carrington E.A. Jones R.S. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 4073-4083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Baculovirus Constructs, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Purification of Recombinant PRC2 Complexes—Full-length cDNAs encoding FLAG-ESC, HA-ESC, E(Z), SU(Z)12, and NURF-55 inserted into pFastBac1 were described previously (14Muller J.

N-terminal deletions of E(Z) were generated by PCR and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. FLAG tags were inserted at the N termini of E(Z)67–760 and E(Z)161–760, whereas E(Z)Δ86–152 was used in untagged form. Baculovirus expression of recombinant proteins was performed using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Anti-FLAG immunoaffinity purification of PRC2 complexes was performed as described (38Ketel C.S. Andersen E.F. Vargas M.L. Suh J. Strome S. Simon J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6857-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Complexes bearing E(Z) missense mutations or E(Z)Δ86–152 were purified via FLAG-ESC, whereas E(Z)67–760 and E(Z)161–760 complexes were purified via FLAG tags on the E(Z) subunit after coexpression with HA-ESC. Mutant complexes were prepared in parallel with a wild-type control and purified at least twice independently for each complex. Assembly of complexes was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-gel electrophoresis and, in the case of Fig. 5C, by Western blotting. Primary antibodies were anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-HA (Covance) mouse monoclonals used at 1:2,000 and 1:5,000, respectively. Anti-NURF55 was a rabbit polyclonal generated using a His6-NURF55 full-length fusion as immunogen, affinity-purified as described (47Wang L. Brown J.L. Cao R. Zhang Y. Kassis J.A. Jones R.S. Mol.

Polynucleosome substrate, consisting of 8–12-mers purified from HeLa cells, was prepared as described (38Ketel C.S. Andersen E.F. Vargas M.L. Suh J. Strome S. Simon J.A. Mol. Cell.

H3/H4 tetramers, which were also used as substrate in HMTase assays, were prepared after coexpression of Drosophila histone H3 and H4 in Escherichia coli (49Levenstein M.E. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8749-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The H3/H4 tetramers contained either wild-type or K27A mutant forms of H3. Generation of E(z) Mutant Embryos and Analysis of in Vivo Histone Methylation—Wild-type embryos were collected from stock yDf(1)w67c2 at 25 °C. E(z)61 mutant embryos were collected from a homozygous E(z)61 stock at 18 or 29 °C. E(z)mut/E(z)61 adults (where E(z)mut represents E(z)1, E(z)62, E(z)son1, E(z)son2, or E(z)son3) were generated at 18 °C, and their mutant embryo progeny were collected at 29 °C. Embryo extracts were prepared as described (38Ketel C.S. Andersen E.F. Vargas M.L. Suh J. Strome S. Simon J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6857-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Protran (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were blocked for at least 30 min in 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The dimethyl-H3K27 and trimethyl-H3K27 antibodies were used at 1:500. These antibodies have been described previously (50Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H.

A monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (DM-1A, Sigma) was used at 1:2,000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:5,000 and 1:2,000, respectively. Signals were developed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Lys-27-methylated Histone H3—HMTase assays were performed as described (38Ketel C.S.

The reaction products were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the histone H3 bands were excised. The H3 gel slices were destained, treated with propionic anhydride, and digested with trypsin as described (50Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L.

Peptides were then eluted, purified on a μC18 ZipTip (Millipore), and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems QSTAR pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization source. The observed masses (1602 Da for the unmodified H3 peptide, 1616 for the monomethylated peptide, 1574 for the dimethylated peptide, and 1588 for the trimethylated peptide) agree precisely with expected masses for each peptide species bearing the following modifications: unmethylated (H3 peptide 27–40 plus three propionyl groups), monomethylated (peptide 27–40 plus three propionyl groups plus one methyl group), dimethylated (peptide 27–40 plus two propionyl groups plus two methyl groups), and trimethylated (peptide 27–40 plus two propionyl groups plus three methyl groups). The identity of the unmethylated H3 peptide peak at 1601.9 m/z was also confirmed by manual MS/MS sequencing. E(z) Mutant Alleles with Dominant Phenotypes Distinct from E(z) Null—The PRC2 catalytic subunit, E(Z), contains multiple functional domains (Fig. 1A). Most of these domains were initially inferred by conservation among E(Z) homologs (51Laible G. Wolf A. Dorn R. Reuter G. Nislow C. Lebersorger A. Popkin D. Pillus L. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Definitive in vivo proof of domain contributions can be provided by mutant alleles that alter single residues. However, relatively few E(z) missense alleles have been molecularly characterized to date. Three recessive temperature-sensitive missense mutations, E(z)28, E(z)32, and E(z)61, provide evidence that domain II and the CXC domain are required for E(Z) function in vivo (3Jones R.S. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1990; 126: 185-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Carrington E.A. Jones R.S. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 4073-4083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Phillips M.D. Shearn A. Genetics. 1990; 125: 91-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The only other E(z) missense allele yet described molecularly is a gain-of-function E(z) mutation, called E(z)Trm, which is located in the C-terminal portion of the SET domain (53Bajusz I. Sipos L. Gyorgypal Z. Carrington E.A. Jones R.S. Gausz J. Gyurkovics H. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1135-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Trm mutant version of E(Z) retains PRC2 enzyme activity (20Kuzmichev A. Nishioka K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). 4C. Ketel, P. Joshi, and J. Simon, unpublished results. Many additional fly E(z) mutant alleles have been isolated, but their molecular lesions have not been determined. Because we are most interested in studying mutants that inactivate or alter specific domains rather than cause complete E(Z) loss, we sought E(z) mutants whose phenotypes are distinct from E(z) null. We selected five E(z) mutant alleles, E(z)1, E(z)62, E(z)son1, E(z)son2, and E(z)son3, because genetic studies established that each displayed one or more dominant phenotypes that are more severe than E(z) null or not observed with E(z) null (Table 1). For example, E(z)1 and E(z)62 are dominant modifiers of gene silencing by the zeste chromatin protein (3Jones R.S. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1990; 126: 185-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Wu C.T. Jones R.S. Lasko P.F. Gelbart W.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the E(z)son1, E(z)son2, and E(z)son3 alleles are dominant suppressors of nanos, which reflect E(Z) silencing of the embryonic patterning genes knirps and giant (55Pelegri F. Lehmann R. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Table 1 shows a compilation of phenotypes observed with these five mutants in seven different phenotypic tests. By these criteria, which also include lethal phase analysis and Hox patterning defects, these five mutants were determined to exert dominant effects stronger than a reference E(z) null, E(z)63, in o"
https://openalex.org/W2044340157,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a large membrane protein complex that performs the water oxidation reactions of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. The unusual redox reactions in PSII often lead to damage, degradation, and reassembly of this molecular machine. To identify novel assembly factors, high sensitivity proteomic analysis of PSII purified from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was performed. This analysis identified six PSII-associated proteins that are encoded by an operon containing nine genes, slr0144 to slr0152. This operon encodes proteins that are not essential components of the PSII holocomplex but accumulate to high levels in pre-complexes lacking any of the lumenal proteins PsbP, PsbQ, or PsbV. The operon contains genes with putative binding domains for chlorophylls and bilins, suggesting these proteins may function as a reservoir for cofactors needed during the PSII lifecycle. Genetic deletion of this operon shows that removal of these protein products does not alter photoautotrophic growth or PSII fluorescence properties. However, the deletion does result in decreased PSII-mediated oxygen evolution and an altered distribution of the S states of the catalytic manganese cluster. These data demonstrate that the proteins encoded by the genes in this operon are necessary for optimal function of PSII and function as accessory proteins during assembly of the PSII complex. Thus, we have named the products of the slr0144-slr0152 operon Pap (Photosystem II assembly proteins).

The active complex is a dimer consisting of 2 identical monomers with more than 20 proteins, identified through genetic, biochemical, and structural studies. In addition to its protein components, PSII also has a large number of cofactors including chlorophylls, pheophytins, plastoquinones, manganese atoms, calcium, chloride, non-heme iron, and heme groups (1Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2846) Google Scholar, 2Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Removal of these subunits or cofactors can slow or even completely halt water oxidation. The assembly of this crucial complex is an intricate process. The steps of protein assembly into the complex are ordered and well regulated (3Rokka A. Suorsa M. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Aro E.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). D2, cytochrome b559, and PsbI bind to form a receptor complex into which the D1 precursor protein (pD1) is inserted (4Zhang L. Aro E.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Muller B. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The CP47 protein then joins the pre-complex followed by the low molecular weight proteins PsbH, PsbM, and PsbTc. The C-terminal extension of pD1 is then processed by the lumenal protease CtpA into the mature D1 protein (4Zhang L. Aro E.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Next, the CP43 and PsbK proteins associate. At this point the soluble lumenal extrinsic proteins (PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ, PsbU, and PsbV) can also bind to the complex. These lumenal proteins are not essential for photosynthesis but are located in close proximity to the site of water oxidation, enhance oxygen evolution, and have roles in protecting the catalytic manganese cluster from damage (6Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 7Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The presence of some of these proteins can be viewed as an indicator of the functional state of the complex, as PsbQ is solely associated with dimerized complexes that are fully assembled and highly active (8Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Finally, the monomeric complex dimerizes. Fig. 1 shows a simplified schematic of PSII assembly in cyanobacteria. The steps involved in the association of cofactors with the functional complex are less defined. The mechanism of integration of some of these cofactors has been well documented, as is the case for the manganese cluster. It is known that after the incorporation of the CP43 protein, all of the ligands for the Mn4Ca1Clx cluster are present within the complex, and presumably integration of this catalytic center occurs. However the integration of other cofactors, including the insertion of chlorophyll into the chlorophyll-containing proteins D1, D2, CP47, and CP43, remains undefined. In addition to the initial assembly of the subunit proteins and cofactors into this large membrane complex, PSII is frequently damaged in the course of its natural function (9Keren N. Liberton M. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6548-6553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The D1 protein becomes irreversibly damaged, and the lumenal proteins and the catalytic manganese cluster must be dissociated so that the damaged D1 protein can be removed and a new copy inserted into the complex (10Andersson B. Aro E.M. Aro E.M. Andersson B. Regulation of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 377-394Google Scholar). Because many of the PSII cofactors would be highly detrimental in large quantities if free in the cell, it is likely there are chaperone proteins which sequester these cofactors before assembly and during the repair and degradation of the PSII complex. As an example, small CAB (chlorophyll A/B binding)-like proteins have recently been proposed to sequester chlorophylls from damaged PSII complexes until they are recycled into new complexes (11Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is likely that intermediaries may also hold other cofactors of the complex during complex repair. Thus, in addition to the complexity of its composition, PSII also has an intricate lifecycle of repair and degradation. Therefore, besides the stoichiometric components of the holocomplex necessary for enzyme activity, other accessory proteins must associate with PSII throughout its lifecycle to repair the protein components and recycle cofactors. Although high resolution crystal structures are available for cyanobacterial PSII (1Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2846) Google Scholar, 2Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), not all of the biochemically identified proteins and cofactors have been visualized in the current structures. Indeed the most comprehensive of these structures only displays 20 proteins and 77 cofactors per monomer (2Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Previous analysis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 utilizing the strain HT3, which contains a hexahistidine tag on the core membrane protein CP47 (12Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), has identified 31 polypeptides associated with active PSII complexes using denaturing electrophoretic separation followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MS) and N-terminal amino acid sequencing (13Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that there were non-characterized PSII-associated proteins that represent non-stoichiometric proteins that transiently associate with the complex as well as stoichiometric complex members not part of the crystallized complex. In this study we undertook a global proteomics analysis of isolated PSII complexes, comparing protein profiles of HT3 to those of ΔpsbV HT3, ΔpsbP HT3, and ΔpsbQ HT3 in Synechocystis 6803. These mutants contain PSII complexes that have been arrested at the currently understood end point of assembly (see Fig. 1). The sensitivity of these techniques allowed for identification of not only the stoichiometric components of active PSII complexes but also for the identification of proteins transiently associated with PSII throughout its lifecycle, such as assembly, repair, or degradation partners. From the results, we identified an operon of unknown function that contains binding domains for photosynthetic cofactors. This operon is syntenically conserved among cyanobacteria. Deletion of the operon shows that although it is not required for photoautotrophy, it does stabilize photosynthetic capacity, indicating a function in PSII-mediated activity. We have named the products of this operon Photosystem II assembly proteins (Pap). Growth Conditions—All chemicals used for media and other experiments are from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Synechocystis cultures were grown at 30 °C under 20 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 white fluorescent light in TES-buffered BG11 medium (14Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Stock cultures were maintained on solid medium (BG11 supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar) and used to inoculate liquid cultures for each experiment. When needed for mutants, growth medium was supplemented with 10 μg/ml spectinomycin, 2 μg/ml gentamycin, and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. To create a putative mass tag library, cultures were grown in complete BG11 as well as in media deplete of nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, or iron; media containing sodium chloride, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, or carbon dioxide or cultures were subjected to heat or cold shock. PSII Preparation—PSII was isolated from HT3, ΔpsbV HT3, ΔpsbQ HT3, and ΔpsbP HT3 strains as described previously (13Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). HT3 indicates the His6-tagged CP47 used to affinity purify the complex (12Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The final eluate from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) column was suspended in 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 25% glycerol with 0.04% dodecyl maltoside. Spectrophotometric Assays—Cell growth was monitored by measuring light scattering at 730 nm on a μQuant microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Toronto, Canada). Chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations were determined by methanol extraction and absorbance at 652 and 665 nm in a DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) (15Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4660) Google Scholar). Accurate Mass and Time (AMT) Tag Peptide Identification—To create the AMT tag library, cellular samples were digested with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) using a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) protease to protein sample for 4 h at 37 °C. Digests were desalted using Supelco Superclean SCX tubes (St. Louis, MO), and the pH of each digestion was adjusted to 3.5 using formic acid. The SCX resin was conditioned with acetonitrile followed by 1 m sodium formate. The column was washed 25% acetonitrile in 500 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, and re-equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.5. Peptide mixtures were loaded onto the resin and washed with 5% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.5. Peptides were eluted with 25% acetonitrile in 500 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, followed by 100% acetonitrile. Eluted peptides were concentrated via SpeedVac (ThermoSavant, San Jose, CA) to protein concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml, as determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Peptides were putatively identified using a capillary liquid chromatography (LC) system of a pair of model 100 ml 100DM syringe pumps (Teledyne-Isco, Lincoln, NE), a series D controller (Teledyne-Isco), and an in-house manufactured mixer, capillary column selector, and sample loop. Separations were achieved using a 5000 p.s.i. reversed-phase in-house-packed capillary (150-μm inner diameter, 360-μm outer diameter, 60 cm long; Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) by using an exponential gradient of 2 mobile-phase solvents consisting of 0.2% acetic acid and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile. Flow through the capillary high performance liquid chromatography column was ≈1.8 μl/min when equilibrated to 100% mobile-phase 0.2% acetic acid and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. For each sample, 10 μg was infused into a LCQ conventional ion trap MS (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) operating in a data-dependent MS/MS mode over a 400-2000 m/z range. For each cycle, the 3 most abundant ions from MC analysis were selected for MS/MS analysis by using a collision energy setting of 45%. Dynamic exclusion was used to discriminate against previously analyzed ions. The collision-induced dissociation spectra from the conventional ion trap mass spectrophotometer were analyzed using SEQUEST (16Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5420) Google Scholar) and the genome sequence of Synechocystis 6803 (17Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Putative mass tag identifications were made based on a SEQUEST cross correlation (Xcorr) score ≥2.0, regardless of charge or mass. Using the same LC conditions, 5 μg of sample analyzed in the ion trap was then analyzed in duplicate or triplicate by FTICR-MS. The FTICR mass spectrometers use ESI interfaced with an electrodynamic ion funnel assembly coupled to a radio frequency quadrupole for collisional ion focusing and highly efficient ion accumulation and transport to a cylindrical FTICR for cell analysis (18Harkewicz R. Belov M.E. Anderson G.A. Pasa-Tolic L. Masselon C.D. Prior D.C. Udseth H.R. Smith R.D. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The resultant FTICR data were processed using the PRISM Data Analysis system, software tools developed in-house. First the MS data were de-isotoped, giving the monoisotopic mass, charge, and intensity of the major peaks in each mass spectrum. Then the data were examined in a two-dimensional fashion to find groups of mass spectral peaks that were observed in sequential spectra. Each group, known as a unique mass class, has a median mass, central normalized elution time, and abundance estimate, computed by summing the intensities of the MS peaks that compromise the unique mass class. The identity of each unique mass class was determined by comparing the mass and normalized elution time of each unique mass class with the mass and normalized elution time of the 4423 putative mass tags in the Synechocystis 6803 AMT tag data base (generated using the peptides observed from 23 LC/MS/MS). Search tolerances were ±6 ppm for the mass and ±5% of the total run time for the elution time. PSII Proteomics—PSII preparations of ∼1 mg of protein were sent to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for protein identification. The PSII samples were denatured by the addition of equal volumes of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 1% CHAPS in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and then reduced with dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mm. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were digested and analyzed utilizing the LC/MS process as described for AMT peptide identification above. The peak matching process gives a list of peptide matches and observed abundance estimates for each of the samples. Because the samples were run in replicate (2-3 per sample), an average peptide abundance and corresponding S.D. was computed for each peptide across the replicates. An abundance estimate for each of the identified open reading frames (ORFs) was computed by averaging the peptide abundance estimates for the ORF using only those peptides whose intensities were ≥33% of the most abundant peptide for the given ORF. More than 200 top hits for peptides found in each of the PSII preparations were scanned for -fold changes across the samples. Statistical Analysis of Peptide Identification Data—A threshold of 0.18 units was applied to the peptide abundance data to discard all measurements below the chosen noise threshold. Replicate data for each peptide were averaged, and the average abundances were used to calculate log2 (mutant/wild type) ratios for each peptide. Peptides that were not present in at least two replicates for both wild type and mutant were discarded. The remaining peptides were then used to calculate average log2 ratios for their respective proteins. S.E. were calculated for the replicates. The results of this proteomics study have been deposited with NCBI under the accession number GSE9577. Protein Visualization—SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (19Kashino Y. Harayama T. Pakrasi H.B. Satoh K. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2007; 849: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using a gel with 18-24% acrylamide gradient and 6 m urea. After transfer to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose, PsbO and PsbQ were detected by using specific antiserum against each protein, and both were reacted with goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiserum (Pierce) developed in West Pico (Pierce) for 5 min. PsbV was visualized by reacting its cofactor with SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce). Blots were visualized in a Fujifilm LAS-1000plus imager (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT) for 1-5 min. Digital images were quantitated using ImageJ software (20Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from Synechocystis 6803 using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNA Clean-Up Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Single cDNA strands were synthesized (21Ogawa T. Bao D.H. Katoh H. Shibata M. Pakrasi H.B. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28981-28986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Four primers were used in separate reactions to create cDNA to different overlapping sections of the operon (5′-GGCATGCCAGTGTTGATGAE-3′,5′-AACAGGGGTTTTAATTTCCCG-3′,5′-GGTAACACCATGGCCACCT-3′, 5′-TCCTAGGGTCATCATTTCTGC-3′). A primer for RNase P(5′-ACCAAATTCCTCAAAGCG-3′) provided a positive control. The cDNA was then treated with RNase H (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C and amplified by PCR to create four overlapping products. PCR primers used 5′-GGCATGCCAGTGTTGATGAT-3′,5′-TGAGCAAACAGTAACTTCCCC-3′,5′-AACAGGGGTTTTAATTTCCCG-3′,5′-GTTGGGAAGCCCAAAAGC, 5′-GGTAACACCATGGCCACCT-3′,5′-TGCACTGATTAGCGTTTTG-3′,5′-TCCTAGGGTCATCATTTCTGC-3′, and 5′-CTGCCAAGCCAAACTGATTT-3′ to amplify slr0144-slr0152 operon and 5′-ACCAAATTCCTCAAAGCG-3′ and 5′-CAAACTTGCTGGGTAAC-3′ to amplify RNase P. slr0144-slr0152 Deletion Construction—The predicted ORFs of slr0144, slr0145, slr0146, slr0147, slr0148, slr0149, slr0150, slr0151, and slr0152 were replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance gene. The 430 bps upstream of the slr0144 ORF (PCR amplified using primers 5′-ACGTACGAGCTCACAAAGTTGGCCGGTCACTCC-3′ and 5′-CATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCAACGGGCAAATGCTCTGAAA-3′) and 460 bps downstream of the slr0152 ORF (PCR-amplified using primers 5′-ACGTACGCATGCATTTCTGGCTAGTCATGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGCATGCCAGTGTTGATGAT-3′ were cloned into flanking positions of the chloramphenicol resistance gene in a pUC18 derivative. The construct was transformed into Synechocystis 6803, and segregation of the mutation was confirmed by PCR. Knock-out construction and segregation of mutant are shown in Fig. 7. Fluorescence Measurements—Kautsky fluorescence induction and QA reoxidation were measured at room temperature using a FL100 flash kinetic fluorometer (Photon Systems, Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) with FluorWin software (Version 3.6.3.3). The Chl concentration for each sample was adjusted to 5 μg Chl/ml as measured on a DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). The samples were dark-adapted for 3 min before measuring. Steady State Oxygen Evolution—A Clarke-type electrode was used to determine the rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution (22Mannan R.M. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Oxygen evolution was measured for whole cells at a concentration of 5 μg Chl/ml in the presence of 0.5 mm 2.6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (Eastman Kodak Co.) and 1 mm K3FeCN6. Light intensity was adjusted by use of neutral density filters. Flash Yield Oxygen Evolution and Calculation of S-state Distribution—Flash yield oxygen evolution was measured on a bare platinum electrode (Artisan Scientific Co., Urbana, IL). Cells were incubated in the dark for 2 min before electrode polarization at 0.65 V for 10 s, and a series of 16 flashes was applied. Data points were collected at intervals of 10 μs during the flash train. These data were then analyzed utilizing the in-house software program Oxygen Revolution, and peak data for each sample were fit to a four-step homogenous model of manganese cluster S-state cycling (23Meunier P. Photosyn. Res. 1993; 36: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Model-fitting calculations were done using MathCad software (MathSoft Engineering and Education, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Creation of AMT Tag Library for Synechocystis 6803—To identify novel PSII components, we created an AMT tag library for Synechocystis 6803 (24Page J.S. Masselon C.D. Smith R.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Bogdanov B. Smith R.D. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 168-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cells were grown under a variety of conditions to induce differential gene expression. Samples were then globally digested with trypsin and separated by LC, and the peptides were identified using tandem MS (24Page J.S. Masselon C.D. Smith R.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Bogdanov B. Smith R.D. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 168-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The resulting library of unique signatures of LC elution time and MS m/z ratio provides identities for peptides without requiring secondary MS identification for subsequent samples. Additionally, this global approach allows for analysis of mixtures of proteins without initial separation by electrophoresis. The ensuing AMT tag library for Synechocystis 6803 represents ∼56% of the proteome. Identification of Greater than 200 PSII-associated Proteins with Differential Abundance in Lumenal Protein Mutants—To look for assembly intermediates, we compared the protein composition of HT3 PSII, and PSII isolated from the lumenal protein mutants ΔpsbV HT3, ΔpsbQ HT3, and ΔpsbP HT3 (7Thornton L.E.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The complexes were analyzed using LC/MS, and the component peptides were identified using the AMT tag library. This more sensitive global proteomic technique revealed more than 200 proteins differentially expressed in the lumenal protein mutants as compared with the wild type HT3 (supplemental Table 1). These additional proteins may represent factors that are not part of stable, mature complexes but are associated transiently at some point during the PSII lifecycle, such as assembly, repair, and degradation partners. Of those identified, 15 were proteins previously identified as PSII-associated proteins (D1, D2, CP43, CP47, PsbE, PsbF, PsbH, PsbL, PsbO, PsbV, PsbU, PsbQ, Psb27, Psb28, and Psb29). To confirm the validity of this proteomic analysis, we compared levels of PSII stoichiometric components as determined by this proteomics analysis and by established immunological methods. Previous studies have shown that loss of any of the lumenal proteins results in a destabilization of the entire luminal face of PSII and correlates with reduced levels of the other lumenal proteins (8Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Inoue-Kashino N. Kashino Y. Satoh K. Terashima I. Pakrasi H.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Levels of PsbO, PsbQ, and PsbV in the strains HT3, ΔpsbV HT3, ΔpsbQ HT3, and ΔpsbP HT3 were analyzed by comparative immunoblotting experiments. These experiments demonstrated the decrease of additional lumenal proteins in the mutants as compared with the HT3 strain. The band intensities were calculated using ImageJ (see supplemental Fig. S1 for linearity of band intensities across proteins concentrations). Comparison of the ratios of PsbO, PsbQ, and PsbV levels in the strains HT3, ΔpsbV HT3, ΔpsbQ HT3, and ΔpsbP HT3 observed from the AMT tag analysis to ratios determined using immunological assays showed that the data from both detection methods closely corresponded, confirming the AMT tag methodology for quantification of protein abundances (Fig. 2). Previously, the interactions of the extrinsic proteins have been analyzed by the genetic deletion or affinity tagging of individual PSII subunit and analyzing the corresponding changes in the polypeptide profiles of the complex. In contrast, this high throughput approach provides a comprehensive data set to analyze PSII interactions. For instance, analysis of PsbQ using affinity tagging has shown that PsbQ is found solely in fully assembled complexes (8Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Correspondingly levels of PsbQ in complexes from ΔpsbV HT3 and ΔpsbP HT3 mutants are decreased (Fig. 3). Similarly, mutant analysis of Psb27 has shown that this protein associates with PSII pre-complexes that do not contain the lumenal proteins PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, and PsbQ and are not capable of oxygen evolution activity (29Roose J.L.

A light-dependent (light-dependent Pchlide oxidoreductase (LPOR)) and an unrelated dark operative enzyme (dark operative Pchlide oxidoreductase (DPOR)) are known. DPOR plays an important role in chlorophyll biosynthesis of gymnosperms, mosses, ferns, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria in the absence of light. Although DPOR shares significant amino acid sequence homologies with nitrogenase, only the initial catalytic steps resemble nitrogenase catalysis. Substrate coordination and subsequent [Fe-S] cluster-dependent catalysis were proposed to be unrelated. Here we characterized the first cyanobacterial DPOR consisting of the homodimeric protein complex ChlL(2) and a heterotetrameric protein complex (ChlNB)(2). The ChlL(2) dimer contains one EPR active [4Fe-4S] cluster, whereas the (ChlNB)(2) complex exhibited EPR signals for two [4Fe-4S] clusters with differences in their g values and temperature-dependent relaxation behavior. These findings indicate variations in the geometry of the individual [4Fe-4S] clusters found in (ChlNB)(2). For the analysis of DPOR substrate recognition, 11 synthetic derivatives with altered substituents on the four pyrrole rings and the isocyclic ring plus eight chlorophyll biosynthetic intermediates were tested as DPOR substrates. Although DPOR tolerated minor modifications of the ring substituents on rings A-C, the catalytic target ring D was apparently found to be coordinated with high specificity. Furthermore, protochlorophyllide a, the corresponding [8-vinyl]-derivative and protochlorophyllide b were equally utilized as substrates. Distinct differences from substrate binding by LPOR were observed. Alternative biosynthetic routes for cyanobacterial chlorophyll biosynthesis with regard to the reduction of the C8-vinyl group and the interconversion of a chlorophyll a/b type C7 methyl/formyl group were deduced."

A distinctive feature of green bacteria compared with other photosynthetic microbes is that their genomes contain multiple homologs of the large subunit (BchH) of the magnesium chelatase which is a three-subunit enzyme complex (BchH, BchD, and BchI) that inserts magnesium into protoporphyrin IX as the first committed step of (bacterio)chlorophyll biosynthesis. There is speculation that the additional BchH homologs may regulate the biosynthesis of each type of chlorophyll, although the biochemical properties of the different magnesium chelatase complexes from a single species of green bacteria have not yet been compared. In this study, we investigated the activities of all three chelatase complexes from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum and interactions with the next enzyme in the pathway, magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (BchM). Although all three chelatase complexes insert magnesium into protoporphyrin IX, the activities range by a factor of 105. Further, there are differences in the interactions between the BchH homologs and BchM; two of the subunits increase the methyltransferase activity by 30–60%, and the third decreases it by 30%. Expression of the chelatase complexes alone and together with BchM in Escherichia coli overproducing protoporphyrin IX suggests that the chelatase is the rate-limiting enzyme. We observed that BchM uses protoporphyrin IX without bound metal as a substrate. Our results conflict with expectations generated by previous gene inactivation studies and suggest a complex regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis in green bacteria.

Bacteriochlorophyll c, the most abundant (B)Chl, is the primary pigment of the chlorosome, a light-harvesting antenna structure, whereas bacteriochlorophyll a and Chl a are the pigments involved in the primary electron transfer reactions in the photosynthetic reaction center complexes (3Frigaard N.U.

Both characteristics lead to self-assembling properties of bacteriochlorophyll c that extend the absorption properties of the supramolecular complex to longer wavelengths (8Balaban T.S. Tamiaki H.

Magnesium chelatase, a three-subunit (BchD, BchI, and BchH) enzyme, catalyzes the ATP-dependent insertion of Mg2+ to form magnesium protoporphyrin IX (MgPIX). The current model for the Mg-chelatase is that a hexameric ring of BchI subunits and a hexameric ring of BchD subunits interact with a single BchH subunit. ATPase activity is located on the AAA-type BchI subunit, and binding of PIX and metal insertion occurs on BchH (16Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. Vonwettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl.

When BchS is inactivated, bacteriochlorophyll c content is greatly reduced, whereas only a slight reduction in bacteriochlorophyll c content occurs when BchT is removed. No effect on bacteriochlorophyll c amounts is observed when BchH is not present. This has led to two suggestions for regulation of the amounts of each type of (B)Chl: 1) that the three subunits provide greater control over a positive feedback mechanism that controls biosynthetic flux and 2) that direct interaction between the Mg-chelatase and subsequent enzymes enhances production of specific types of molecules through a mechanism of substrate channeling (3Frigaard N.U. Chew A.G.M. Li H. Maresca J.A. Bryant D.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 78: 93-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Frigaard N.U. Bryant D. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the latter scheme, each BchH favors the biosynthesis of specific (B)Chl through interactions with methyltransferase BchM or cyclase BchE. Substrate channeling is the mechanism of rate enhancement that is gained because an intermediate molecule is passed between enzymes without being released into the bulk solvent (20Spivey H.O. Ovadi J. Methods. 1999; 19: 306-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 22Huang X.Y. Holden H.M.

Educ. 2003; 31: 228-233Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that an interaction between the Mg-chelatase and BchM may be involved in the regulation of (B)Chl biosynthesis (24Gorchein A. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Hinchigeri S.B. Hundle B. Richards W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Shepherd M.

Biol. 2005; 57: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with isolated BchM and BchH from Rhodobacter capsulatus (25Hinchigeri S.B. Hundle B. Richards W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (26Shepherd M. McLean S. Hunter C.N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4532-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that methyltransferase activity was stimulated by the presence of BchH. Physical interaction between methyltransferase and Mg-chelatase BchH was shown by yeast two-hybrid experiments with tobacco proteins (27Alawady A. Reski R. Yaronskaya E. Grimm B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the current paper, we report on the activity of the three BchH homologs and BchM from C. tepidum. Mg-chelatase subunits BchT, BchS, BchH, and BchM were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified for in vitro characterization. In addition, all three Mg-chelatase subunits (BchD, BchI, and BchH) were coexpressed with and without BchM in an engineered E. coli strain overproducing PIX (28Kwon S.J. de Boer A.L. Petri R. Schmidt-Dannert C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4875-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to study in vivo activities of the proteins. Our results show that the BchH subunits have different Mg-chelatase activities and interact to varying extents with BchM either to increase or to decrease the methyltransferase activity. Chemicals—PIX and MgPIX were purchased from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT) and were resuspended in 0.1% Tween 80 in water. PIX monomethylester (PIXME) was isolated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from recombinant E. coli cultures overexpressing PIX biosynthetic genes and methyltransferase BchM (see below). Concentrations were determined in 1.5 n HCl using the extinction coefficient of 297 mm-1 cm-1 at 408 nm (29Gunter E.W. Turner W.E. Huff D.L. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Other chemicals used were obtained from suppliers as described or from Sigma. Strains and Growth Conditions—All plasmid manipulations were performed in E. coli JM109 using standard molecular biological techniques (30Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). E. coli JM109 was used for protein expression when using the constitutive promoter on pUCmod (31Schmidt-Dannert C. Umeno D. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For protein expression using the T7 promoter, E. coli BL21 cells were used. Gene Cloning—The Mg-chelatase and monomethyl-ester methyltransferase genes from C. tepidum were amplified from genomic DNA obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA; ATCC 49652). Genes cloned in this study were bchH, bchS, and bchT (C. tepidum locus tags CT1295, CT1955, and CT1957; GenBank™ accession numbers NP_662183, NP_662832, and NP_662834), bchI (CT1297; NP_662185), bchD (CT1296; NP_662184), and bchM (CT1958; NP_662835). The forward primers contained the restriction endonuclease sequence for XbaI, an optimized Shine-Dalgarno and start codon sequence (5′-AGGAGGAGATCTACATATG-3′), and 15–18 nucleotides corresponding to the specific gene sequence; the reverse primers contained ∼15 nucleotides of the respective gene, a stop codon, and the sequence for the NotI restriction endonuclease. PCR amplification products of methyltransferase and Mg-chelatase subunits were cloned individually into the constitutive expression vector pUCmod (31Schmidt-Dannert C. Umeno D. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All gene sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing the three subunits of the Mg-chelatase were constructed for each of the three C. tepidum bchH homologs; these plasmids were named pBchDIT, pBchDIS, and pBchDIH. Each gene (bchH, bchS, bchT, bchI, and bchD) and its promoter was amplified by PCR from its pUCmod parent plasmids and subcloned into pUCmod to generate a single plasmid with three promoters and three genes. bchH, bchS, and bchT were cloned between the restriction sites XbaI and PacI, bchI was cloned between the PacI and EcoRI, and bchD was cloned within the single EcoRI site. bchM and its promoter were amplified from its pUCmod parent construct using primers outside the promoter region and sublconed into pCDF-Duet using the restriction enzyme AscI to obtain pCDF-BchMCT1958. Production of Porphryins in E. coli—To produce PIX and the initial intermediates in (B)Chl biosynthesis in E. coli, various genes were assembled together on four compatible plasmids derived from pUCmod, pACmod, pBBR1MCS-2 (28Kwon S.J. de Boer A.L. Petri R. Schmidt-Dannert C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4875-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and pCDFDuet™-1 (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). Previously, we described overproduction of PIX in aerobically grown E. coli transformants harboring plasmid pACmod expressing heme biosynthetic genes hemA, hemB, hemC, and hemD and plasmid pBBR1MCS-2 containing genes hemE and hemF (28Kwon S.J. de Boer A.L. Petri R. Schmidt-Dannert C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4875-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cultures of JM109 E. coli expressing various combinations of genes from the protoporphyrin and bacteriochlorophyll pathways were grown for 45 h with shaking in LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and 1 mm MgCl2. The cultures were centrifuged, and porphyrins were extracted from the cell pellet by the addition of N,N-dimethyl formamide/acetone/water (4:1:1) and incubated in a sonicating water bath at 4 °C for 2 h. The extracts were centrifuged briefly to remove suspended material before further analysis. The amounts of each porphryin were determined by comparison of integrated peak areas with authentic PIX and MgPIX standards. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography—Extracts were loaded on a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array detector. Porphyrins were separated by a 20-min linear gradient of 70–100% mobile phase B at 1 ml/min. The mobile phases were 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.1 (A), and methanol (B). For quantitation, standard curves were generated using known concentrations of PIX and MgPIX standards, and the peak areas were integrated using the Agilent ChemStation software. The peaks corresponding to PIX, MgPIX, and iron-PIX were assigned by comparison of retention times and UV-visible spectra to known standards. MgPIXME and PIX monomethylester were assigned by expected shifts in retention times and mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—LC-mass spectra were obtained using a LCQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with an LC system similar to the one described above using an isocratic condition of 80% mobile phase B and electrospray ionization interface. Isocratic conditions were required to obtain reproducible traces on both the HPLC (Agilent) and LC-mass spectrometry systems. After assignment of each of the peaks, the gradient conditions described above were used in subsequent HPLC analysis. The mass range m/z 200–800 was monitored in the positive ion mode using standard tuning parameters. Singly charged ions had m/z values as follows: PIX (563.3), MgPIX (585.2), PIX monomethylester (577.3), and MgPIXME (599.2). Methanol adducts predominated for MgPIX and MgPIXME. Protein Expression and Purification—To simplify protein purification, His6 tags were added to each of the genes. Initially, the histidine tags were placed on the N terminus of each gene; however, low binding affinities with the chelating resin were observed for BchS, BchD, and BchM, and subsequently, the histidine sequence was moved to the C terminus for these proteins. Several expression vectors were used to obtain sufficient amounts of recombinant protein. In most cases, the constitutive promoter on the pUCmod plasmid was sufficient; however, the stronger T7 promoter improved protein expression for BchS, BchD, and BchM. These proteins were subcloned into the pET-20b(+) vector (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) using the restriction endonucleases XbaI and NotI. Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 harboring plasmids with the histidine-tagged recombinant proteins were used to inoculate 0.2 liters of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced with 0.1–0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cultures reached an A600 of 0.4. The cultures were shaken at 300 rpm at 30 °C for ∼16 h and centrifuged at 2000 × g. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl) and sonicated to disrupt the cell membranes. The broken cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to obtain a clear lysate and a pellet. For the BchH, BchS, BchT, BchI, and BchM subunits, the cleared supernatants were mixed gently for 2 h at 4 °C with either Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) or BD TALON (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The slurry was poured into a small gravity column and washed with 20 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 5 mm imidazole; the protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. In general, the BchH, BchS, and BchT subunits had weaker affinity for the resin and the nickel matrix performed better, whereas the purity of the BchI subunit was optimal using the cobalt resin. For BchD, the majority of the recombinant protein was contained in inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were washed with 1 m NaCl, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 m urea), and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The solubilized inclusion bodies were mixed gently for 2 h at 4 °C with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and poured into a gravity column, washed with denaturing buffer, pH 7, and eluted with denaturing buffer, pH 5.5. The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol to remove urea and to refold the protein. After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove any misfolded or aggregated protein. The protein samples were concentrated using centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored in 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Final protein concentrations between 1 and 10 mg/ml were determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mg-chelatase Activity Assays—The rate of magnesium insertion into PIX was determined using a continuous fluorimetric assay based on the observation that the fluorescence shifts when metal binds PIX (or PIXME). The increase in MgPIX was monitored by following the emission at 595 nm after excitation of the Soret band at 410 nm. The assay mixtures were incubated at 34 °C and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1% Tween 80, 4 mm ATP, and MgCl2, PIX, and enzyme concentrations specified in the throughout. The significant lag time associated with the formation of the Mg-chelatase complex was diminished and nearly eliminated by preincubation of the three subunits for 30 min at 30 °C at concentrations 10–50-fold higher than in the subsequent assays (32Viney J. Davison P.A. Hunter N.C. Reid J.D. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12788-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme mixture at the appropriate concentration to the remaining components, and the fluorescence was monitored in black 96-well plates (Corning Glass) using a Spectra-Max Gemini XS microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A standard curve was used to determine the MgPIX concentrations. Kinetic parameters were determined with the assumption that the PIX dependence followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low concentrations. The Michaelis constant (KmPIX) and maximum velocity (Vmax) were determined from a Lineweaver-Burk plot and linear regression. For the MgCl2 substrate, Hill plots were constructed to determine the Mg-binding constant ( K0.5Mg). Methyltransferase Assays—Methyltransferase activity was measured using a stopped assay containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.5 mm AdoMet, and either MgPIX or PIX. For MgPIX, the reaction contained 50 nm BchM and was initiated by the addition of AdoMet. Aliquots were removed at 20, 40, 60, and 80 s and mixed with an equal volume of acetone (for higher MgPIX concentrations, the reaction times were increased to 240 s). For PIX, the reaction contained 200 nm BchM and was incubated for 16 h. To measure the stopped reactions directly by HPLC, the volume of the reactions increased as the substrate concentration decreased: 20, 50, 100, 250, 750, and 750 μl for substrate concentrations of >30, 30, 10, 3, 1, and 0.3 μm, respectively. The samples were centrifuged, and the porphryins were separated by HPLC. The absorbance at 420 nm for both MgPIX and MgPIXME and 405 nm for both PIX and PIXME were integrated for each time point to obtain the velocity of the reaction at each substrate concentration. The Lineweaver-Burk plots of three independent reactions were used to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters. Mg-chelatase and Methyltransferase Activities in E. coli Overproducing PIX—We previously showed that overexpression of the heme biosynthetic pathway in E. coli leads to high level production of several porphyrins, including PIX, the initial substrate for (B)Chl biosynthesis (28Kwon S.J. de Boer A.L. Petri R. Schmidt-Dannert C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4875-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The engineered PIX pathway was extended with Mg-chelatase complexes (subunits BchD, BchI, and BchH or BchS or BchT) alone and in combination with methyltransferase BchM to determine the in vivo activities of the C. tepidum proteins. PIX-overproducing E. coli expressing Mg-chelatase alone produced a new compound (Fig. 1 and Table 1), which was identified as MgPIX using retention time and mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1). The accumulation of MgPIX in E. coli, however, depends on whether the BchH, BchS, or BchT subunit is expressed. BchS is the most active subunit (shown in Fig. 1), followed by BchH, and no activity is observed for BchT. These results demonstrate that E. coli is able to express and assemble the multisubunit complex of at least two of the Mg-chelatases without additional factors specific to C. tepidum.TABLE 1Porphyrin accumulation in E. coli cells co-expressing PIX and (B)Chl biosynthetic genes E. coli transformants expressing genes hemA–hemF for PIX overproduction alone or in combination with the three-subunit Mg-chelatase complexes BchDIH and MgPIX methyltransferase BchM were grown for 45 h at 30°C prior to extraction of porphyrins from cell pellets.

The first peak is MgPIXME, the expected product of BchM. The second product has an absorption spectrum identical to PIX, and because it has a longer retention time than PIX, it appears to be PIXME. The reduction in MgPIX levels suggests that the limiting step in this set of reactions is the insertion of Mg2+ into PIX by the Mg-chelatase. The assignments of both MgPIXME and PIXME were confirmed by LC-mass spectrometry (Fig. S1). The formation of PIXME may arise in several ways: 1) through a degradative process of MgPIXME during extract"

https://openalex.org/W2054738623,"Background Identification of genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis is a major goal in cancer research. An estimated 10–20% of cancer-related gene mutations result in skipping of one or more exons in the encoded transcripts. Here we report on a strategy to screen in a global fashion for such exon-skipping events using PAttern based Correlation (PAC). The PAC algorithm has been used previously to identify differentially expressed splice variants between two predefined subgroups. As genetic changes in cancer are sample specific, we tested the ability of PAC to identify aberrantly expressed exons in single samples. Principal Findings As a proof-of-principle, we tested the PAC strategy on human cancer samples of which the complete coding sequence of eight cancer genes had been screened for mutations. PAC detected all seven exon-skipping mutants among 12 cancer cell lines. PAC also identified exon-skipping mutants in clinical cancer specimens although detection was compromised due to heterogeneous (wild-type) transcript expression. PAC reduced the number of candidate genes/exons for subsequent mutational analysis by two to three orders of magnitude and had a substantial true positive rate. Importantly, of 112 randomly selected outlier exons, sequence analysis identified two novel exon skipping events, two novel base changes and 21 previously reported base changes (SNPs). Conclusions The ability of PAC to enrich for mutated transcripts and to identify known and novel genetic changes confirms its suitability as a strategy to identify candidate cancer genes."

Eukaryotic Top1 (DNA topoisomerase I) is a highly conserved enzyme, which plays critical roles in cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome condensation (1Champoux J.J.

The enzyme first binds double-stranded DNA as a protein clamp and then transiently cleaves a single strand forming a 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage between the active site tyrosine and the nicked DNA. Torsional or flexural strain in the DNA then drives the rewinding or unwinding of the polynucleotide strands. In the subsequent transesterification reaction, the free 5′-OH acts as a nucleophile to resolve the phosphotyrosyl linkage and religate the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA. A random number of supercoils are removed in this process to effect changes in DNA linking number (5Koster D.A. Croquette V. Dekker C. Shuman S. Dekker N.H.

CPT intercalates into the protein-linked DNA complex, effectively displacing the 5′-OH and preventing DNA religation (10Chrencik J.E. Staker B.L. Burgin A.B. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Stewart L.

Although ternary CPT-Top1-DNA complexes form throughout the cell cycle, the interaction of these complexes with the replication machinery during S-phase converts the readily reversible intermediate into irreversible DNA lesions that trigger cell death. Our recent in vivo studies and single molecule nanomanipulations revealed that CPT selectively slows Top1 uncoiling of positive supercoils, thereby inducing the accumulation of positively supercoiled DNA in vivo (6Koster D.A.

These findings suggest a novel mechanism of Top1 poisoning by CPT, where the accumulation of positive supercoils in front of advancing replication forks acts as a physical barrier to induce fork collapse and/or DNA lesions (6Koster D.A. Palle K. Bot E.S. Bjornsti M.A. Dekker N.H. Nature. 2007; 448: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical data indicate that Top1 comprises four domains: a highly charged N-terminal domain, a conserved protein clamp, a pair of extended α-helices that form a positively charged linker domain, and a conserved C-terminal domain that contains the active site Tyr (12Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 13Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of human Topo70 (a C-terminal 70-kDa fragment of the nuclear human enzyme), complexed with DNA, demonstrate that a lone salt bridge between the loops of opposable “lips” completes Top1 clamping of the DNA (12Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 14Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The tight packing of DNA within the central pore of the enzyme indicated that substantial flexibility of the protein clamp would be necessary for protein binding of DNA and to allow for strand rotation upon covalent complex formation. These predictions were confirmed in studies of the Top1-clamp534 where cysteine residues, substituted for Gly365 and Ser534, formed a reversible disulfide bond (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Locking the Top1-clamp534 closed prevented DNA binding as well as strand rotation within the covalent complex. Surprisingly, these results contrasted with related studies, where distinct residues (His367 and Ala499) were changed to cysteine in the context of Topo70 (16Carey J.F. Schultz S.J. Sisson L. Fazzio T.G. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5640-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this case, herein referred to as Topo70-clamp499, a disulfide tether between the same upper “lip” as that of Top1-clamp534 and a lower protein loop more distal from the active site did not impede DNA rotation. Thus, seemingly subtle differences in enzyme architecture profoundly influenced enzyme catalysis. The N-terminal domain, which is missing in Topo70-clamp499, is dispensable for enzyme activity in vitro yet has been implicated in mediating Top1 interactions with other proteins and subcellular localization of the enzyme (1Champoux J.J.

Recently, we also demonstrated an interaction of the N-terminal and linker domains in regulating enzyme function in vivo. 5M. van der Merwe, C.M. Wright, and M.-A. Bjornsti, unpublished results. Previous studies of Top1 reconstituted from independently expressed protein domains and the Top1A653P mutant indicate that the physical integrity and flexibility of the linker domain are critical determinants of enzyme sensitivity to CPT (20Stewart L.

Molecular dynamic simulations and x-ray crystallographic data suggest that restrictions in linker domain flexibility coincide with CPT binding to the Top1-DNA complex (11Staker B.L. Hjerrild K.

Desideri A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43268-43275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Linker flexibility also impacts mutation-induced alterations in enzyme-catalyzed DNA cleavage/religation (24Losasso C. Cretaio E. Palle K. Pattarello L. Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9855-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, our recent studies suggest that a conserved Gly within the catalytic pocket of Top1 provides a flexible hinge to facilitate linker mobility (26van der Merwe M. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3305-3315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support a model whereby the orientation of the linker domain impacts enzyme active site architecture to affect enzyme catalyzed DNA cleavage and religation. Without structural information, it remains unclear what role, if any, the N-terminal domain has in coordinating Top1 protein domain movements with DNA transactions. Nevertheless, we wondered if the reported differences between Topo70-clamp499 and Top1-clamp534 (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 5640-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were in fact due to differences in global enzyme architecture rather than subtle changes in active site geometry. Taking advantage of these reversible disulfide bonds, we show that the N terminus also impacts the opening and closing of the Top1 protein clamp, whereas the composition of the N-terminal/linker domains affects Top1-clamp stability. Chemicals, Yeast Strains, and Plasmids—Camptothecin, anti-FLAG M2 affinity-agarose gel, FLAG peptide, and M2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. CPT was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 4 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains EKY3 (MATα, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1), MMY3 (EKY3, rad9Δ::hisG), MWY9 (EKY3, glr1Δ::his5+), and JCW28 (MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ, top2-4) have been described (15Woo M.H.

For regulated expression of yeast or human Top1, the indicated TOP1 allele was expressed from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter on an ARS/CEN, URA3 plasmid. In all cases, the Top1 proteins contained an N-terminal FLAG epitope indicated by the “e” prefix. For clarity, the “h” prefix has been dropped from the discussions of human Top1, with the exception of the chimeric enzymes. However, the “y” prefix has been retained for all discussions of yeast Top1. For the human TOP1, vectors YCpGAL1-eTOP1, YCpGAL1-etop1Y723F, YCpGAL1-etop1-clamp534, and YCpGAL1-etop1-clamp534Y723F were described (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Individual Top1-clamp499 mutations (H367C and A499C) were generated in human TOP1 cDNA restriction fragments (BamHI/SacII and SacII/ClaI, respectively) excised from YCp-GAL1-eTOP1 or YCpGAL1-etop1Y723F, ligated into vector pRS416, and mutagenized using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The DNA fragments were used to replace the corresponding wild-type sequences in the original vectors to yield YCpGAL1-etop1-clamp499 and YCpGAL1-etop1-clamp499Y723F. Topo70 constructs, which encode a C-terminal 70-kDa fragment of human Top1, were generated by two-step PCR to introduce a FLAG epitope (underlined in MDYKDDDDK) and a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) upstream of Met174 in human Top1, designated eTopo70. The NLS sequence used (PKKIKTED) spans human Top1 residues 149–156, which have previously been shown to be sufficient for nuclear localization (21Alsner J. Svestrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). YCpGAL1-eTOP1 was used as a substrate for the PCRs. The PCR products were then used as self-priming templates for five amplification cycles, followed by successive amplification reactions with flanking primers. A BamHI/SacII restriction fragment was then ligated into the corresponding sites in YCpGAL1-eTOP1 to yield YCp-GAL1-eTopo70. Similar strategies generated YCpGAL1-eTopo70Y723F, YCpGAL1-eTopo70-clamp499, YCpGAL1-eTopo70-clamp499Y723F, YCpGAL1-eTopo70-clamp534, and YCpGAL1-eTopo70-clamp534Y723F. The yeast TOP1 expression vectors, YCpGAL1eyTOP1 and YCpGAL1eytop1Y727F, were previously described (30Colley W.C. van der Merwe M. Vance J.R. Burgin Jr., A.B. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol.

To generate yeast Top1-clamp460 (which corresponds to human Top1-clamp534), G297C and S460C substitutions were introduced into pTP1-4 (17Bjornsti M.-A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8971-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. A BclI-SpeI DNA fragment was then used to replace the corresponding wild-type sequences in YEpGAL1eyTOP1 and YEpGAL1eytop1Y727F (31Woo M.H. Vance J.R. Marcos A.R. Bailly C. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3813-3822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to yield YEpG1eytop1-clamp460 and YEpG1eytop1-clamp460Y727F. BamHI-EagI fragments bearing the eytop1-clamp460 and eytop1-clamp460Y727F sequences were then used to replace the corresponding DNA sequences in YCpGAL1eyTOP1 to generate YCpGAL1-eytop1-clamp460 and YCpGAL1eytop1-clamp460Y727F, respectively. In plasmids YCpGAL1-(yN,yL)hTop1 and YCpGAL1-(hN,hL)yTop1, chimeric Top1 proteins comprising either the yeast N-terminal/linker domains embedded in the human core/C-terminal domains ((yN,yL)hTop1) or the human N-terminal/linker domains embedded in the yeast core/C-terminal domains ((hN,hL)yTop1) were expressed from the GAL1 promoter.5 A BamHI-ClaI fragment, excised from YCpGAL1-(yN,yL)hTop1, was ligated into pRS416. Following site-directed mutagenesis to introduce G365C and S534C, as previously described (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the (yN,yL)hTop1-clamp534 sequences in the BamHI-ClaI fragment were ligated into YCpGAL1eTOP1 to generate YCpGAL1-(yN,yL)hTop1-clamp534. The corresponding yTop1-clamp460 sequences were introduced into YCpGAL1-(hN,hL)yTop1 by homologous recombination in yeast (32van Waardenburg R.C. Duda D.M. Lancaster C.S. Schulman B.A. Bjornsti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4958-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified DNA sequences, which encode the eyTop1-clamp460 mutations, were co-transformed into yeast EKY3 (top1Δ) cells with YCpGAL1-(hN,hL)yTop1 DNA linearized with Bsu36I. Following selection for uracil prototrophs on synthetic complete media lacking uracil (SC-uracil) plates, the YCpGAL1-(hN,hL)yTop1-clamp460 plasmid DNA was recovered from individual transformants and amplified in bacteria. Yeast cells were transformed with URA3-marked vectors following treatment with lithium acetate (33Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics, 1994 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar), and transformants were maintained on SC-uracil, supplemented with 2% dextrose. In all cases, plasmid constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequencing. Primer sequences are available upon request. Yeast Cell Viability and Sensitivity to Camptothecin—To assess the viability and camptothecin sensitivity of cells expressing the indicated yeast/human top1 alleles, exponentially growing cultures of individual transformants were adjusted to an A595 = 0.3 and serially 10-fold diluted, and 5-μl volumes were spotted onto SC-uracil agar supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), a final 2% dextrose or galactose, and the indicated concentration of CPT in a final 0.125% Me2SO. Cell viability was assessed following incubation at 30 °C. To assess relative steady state levels of Top1 proteins in galactose-induced top1Δ cells, cultures were corrected for A595, lysed with NaOH/trichloroacetic acid as previously described (34Jacquiau H.R. van Waardenburg R.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23566-23575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the M2 α-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Top1 Protein Purification—Human enzymes (Top1, Top1Y723F, Top1-clamp534, Top1-clamp534Y723F, Top1-clamp499, and Top1-clamp499Y723F), yeast enzymes (yTop1, yTop1Y727F, and yTop1-clamp460), and chimeras ((hN/hL)y-Top1, (hN/hL)yTop1-clamp460, (yN/yL)hTop1, and (yN/yL)h-Top1-clamp534) were partially purified as described (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from galactose-induced cultures of top1Δ yeast cells, transformed with relevant YCpGAL1-etop1 vector. For homogenous protein preparations, Top1 proteins were applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and eluted with an excess of FLAG peptide in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl). To remove the peptide, fractions were applied to a phosphocellulose column, and homogeneous Top1 proteins were eluted in TEEG buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50% glycerol) plus 1.0 m KCl and protease inhibitors, diluted to a final 40% glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. Protein levels and integrity were assessed in immunoblots with the M2 α-FLAG antibody. Top1 Enzyme Activity Assays—Purified Top1 proteins or crude cell extracts, corrected for protein concentration, were serially 10-fold diluted and incubated in plasmid DNA relaxation assays in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT and the final KCl concentration indicated as described in Ref. 15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C for human proteins or 30 °C for yeast Top1 proteins, the reactions were terminated by adding 1% SDS, and the extent of plasmid DNA relaxation was assessed following agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. DNA Cleavage Assays—Top1 enzyme sensitivity to CPT was assessed in DNA cleavage assays with or without 10 mm DTT or 5 mm diamide, essentially as described (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After 30 min at 30 °C (yTop1) or 37 °C (human Top1), the reactions were terminated with 1% SDS at 75 °C, treated with proteinase K, and resolved in 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Cleavage products were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The Position of the Disulfide Bond That Locks the Top1-clamp Induces Distinct Effects on Enzyme Function—We previously reported that cysteine substitutions of Gly365 and Ser534 in full-length human Top1 form a reversible disulfide bond that locks the Top1-clamp534 closed and prevents DNA rotation within the covalent enzyme-DNA complex (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, cysteine residues substituted for His367 and Ala499 form a disulfide bond more distal to the active site tyrosine (see Fig. 1) that did not affect DNA rotation in the context of Topo70 (16Carey J.F. Schultz S.J. Sisson L. Fazzio T.G. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5640-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although subtle changes in enzyme active site architecture could impact enzyme catalysis, differences in the N-terminal composition of these enzymes might also alter the dynamics of Top1-clamp formation and DNA strand rotation. As defined by crystallographic data, the clamp domain spans residues 215–635 of nuclear human Top1 (12Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 14Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, the function of specific enzyme domains has largely been described by biochemical studies of Topo70, which begins at residue 175 (20Stewart L. Ireton G. Champoux J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that residues 175–190 have no discernible effect on enzyme catalysis; however, residues 191–206 play important roles in Top1 binding of DNA and in enzyme processivity (17Bjornsti M.-A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8971-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Lisby M. Olesen J.R. Skouboe C. Krogh B.O. Straub T. Boege F. Velmurugan S. Martensen P.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6170-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Structural data further demonstrate the interaction of hydrophobic residues spanning 205 with the flexible hinge presumed to regulate Top1 protein clamp dynamics (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, in considering the potential contribution of the N-terminal domain to the function of the Top1 clamp, we restricted our investigations to residues 1–174, which are deleted from Topo70. We began by engineering both sets of cysteine substitutions (comprising clamp534 and clamp499 as shown in Fig. 1) into full-length human Top1 and Topo70 and then assessing the activity of these clamps in vitro and in yeast cells deleted for the endogenous TOP1 gene. An NLS (human residues 149–156) (21Alsner J. Svestrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mo Y.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was also included to ensure the appropriate subcellular localization of the Top1 proteins. As previously reported (15Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), expression of Top1-clamp534 from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter induced yeast cell lethality, independent of camptothecin (Fig. 2). In a top1Δ, glr1Δ strain, where increased levels of oxidized glutathione favor the formation of disulfide bonds, the catalytically inactive Top1-clamp534Y723F clamp was also cytotoxic. Thus, locking the Top1-clamp534Y723F on DNA, in the absence of DNA cleavage, induced cell death. These results contrast with data obtained with the full-length Top1-clamp499 and the catalytically inactive Top1-clamp499Y723F. In the absence CPT, expression of either clamp had no effect on top1Δ or top1Δ, glr1Δ cell growth (Fig. 2). Although cells expressing Top1-clamp499 were sensitive to CPT (Fig. 2), 100-fold higher concentrations of drug were required to achieve the same level of cytotoxicity as that observed with wild-type Top1 (Fig. S1). Yet, under the same conditions, deletion of the Rad9 DNA damage checkpoint increased the CPT sensitivity of Top1-clamp499-expressing cells (Fig. S1). Th"
