https://openalex.org/W3217650182,"Students of the health sciences are the future frontliners to fight pandemics. The students’ participation in COVID-19 response varies across countries and are mostly for educational purposes. Understanding the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability is necessary for a successful vaccination program. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among health sciences students in Northwest Nigeria. The study was an online self-administered cross-sectional study involving a survey among students of health sciences in some selected universities in Northwest Nigeria. The survey collected pertinent data from the students, including socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception for COVID-19, and willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. A total of 440 responses with a median (interquartile range) age of 23 (4.0) years were included in the study. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was 40.0%. Factors that independently predict acceptance of the vaccine were age of 25 years and above (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.44–5.16; p = 0.002), instructions from heads of institutions (aOR, 11.71; 95% CI, 5.91–23.20; p &lt;0.001), trust in the government (aOR, 20.52; 95% CI, 8.18–51.51; p &lt;0.001) and willingness to pay for the vaccine (aOR, 7.92; 95% CI, 2.63–23.85; p &lt;0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among students of health sciences was low. Older age, mandate by heads of the institution, trust in the government and readiness to pay for the vaccine were associated with acceptance of the vaccine. Therefore, stakeholders should prioritize strategies that would maximize the vaccination uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3214780710,"Oral microbiome transplantation (OMT) is a novel concept of introducing health-associated oral microbiota into the oral cavity of a diseased patient. The premise is to reverse the state of oral dysbiosis, and restore the ecological balance to maintain a stable homeostasis with the host immune system. This study will assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and safety of OMT using an interdisciplinary approach.To find donors suitable for microbial transplantation, supragingival plaque samples will be collected from 600 healthy participants. Each sample (200μL) will subsequently be examined in two ways: 1) 100μL of the sample will undergo high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun sequencing to identify the composition and characterisation of a healthy supragingival microbiome, 2) the remaining 100μL of the plaque sample will be mixed with 25% artificial saliva medium and inoculated into a specialised in-vitro flow cell model containing a hydroxyapatite disk. To obtain sufficient donor plaque, the samples would be grown for 14 days and further analysed microscopically and sequenced to examine and confirm the growth and survival of the microbiota. Samples with the healthiest microbiota would then be incorporated in a hydrogel delivery vehicle to enable transplantation of the donor oral microbiota. The third step would be to test the effectiveness of OMT in caries and periodontitis animal models for efficacy and safety for the treatment of oral diseases.If OMTs are found to be successful, it can form a new treatment method for common oral diseases such as dental caries and periodontitis. OMTs may have the potential to modulate the oral microbiota and shift the ecological imbalances to a healthier state."
https://openalex.org/W3215007152,"Background Thousands of people worldwide are suffering the consequences of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and impulse oscillometry (IOS) and lung ultrasound (LUS) might be important tools for the follow-up of this population. Our objective was to prospectively evaluate abnormalities detected using these two methods in a cohort of COVID-19 survivors with respiratory symptoms. Methods In this follow-up study, 59 patients underwent clinical evaluations, spirometry, IOS and LUS in the 2nd (M1) and 5th (M2) months after diagnostic confirmation of COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Aeration scores were obtained from the LUS exams based on the following findings: B-lines &gt;2, coalescent B-lines, and subpleural consolidations. Results Fifty-nine (100%) participants had cough and/or dyspnea at M1, which decreased to 38 (64.4%) at M2 (p = 0.0001). Spirometry was abnormal in 26 (44.1%) and 20 (33.9%) participants at M1 and M2, respectively, although without statistical significance (p = 0.10). Normal examination, restrictive patterns, and obstructive patterns were observed in 33 (55.9%), 18 (30.5%), and 8 (13.6%) participants, respectively, at M1 and in 39 (66.1%), 13 (22%), and 7 (11.9%) participants at M2 (p = 0.14). Regarding IOS, considering changes in resistive and reactive parameters, abnormal exams were detected in 52 (88.1%) and 42 (71.2%) participants at M1 and M2, respectively (p = 0.002). Heterogeneity of resistance between 4 and 20 Hz &gt;20% was observed in 38 (64.4%) and 33 (55.9%) participants at M1 and M2, respectively (p = 0.30). Abnormal LUS was observed in 46 (78%) and 36 (61%) participants at M1 and M2, respectively (p = 0.002), with a reduction in aeration scores between M1 and M2 [5 (2–8) vs. 3 (0–6) points, p&lt;0.0001]. Conclusions IOS and LUS abnormalities are frequent in the first 5 months post-COVID-19 infection; however, when prospectively evaluated, significant improvement is evident in the parameters measured by these two methods."
https://openalex.org/W3215208655,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), caused by Neisseria meningitidis, can have a fatality rate as high as 10%, even with appropriate treatment. In the UK, penicillin is administered to patients in primary care whilst third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, are administered in secondary care. The first-choice antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is ciprofloxacin, followed by rifampicin. Immunocompromised individuals are often recommended antibiotic chemoprophylaxis and vaccination due to a greater risk of IMD. Resistance to antibiotics among meningococci is relatively rare, however reduced susceptibility and resistance to penicillin are increasing globally. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins is seldom reported, however reduced susceptibility to both cefotaxime and ceftriaxone has been observed. Rifampicin resistance has been reported among meningococci, mainly following prophylaxis, and ciprofloxacin resistance, whilst uncommon, has also been reported across the globe. The Public Health England Meningococcal Reference Unit receives and characterises the majority of isolates from IMD cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This study assessed the distribution of antibiotic resistance to penicillin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime among IMD isolates received at the MRU from 2010/11 to 2018/19 (n = 4,122). Out of the 4,122 IMD isolates, 113 were penicillin-resistant, five were ciprofloxacin-resistant, two were rifampicin-resistant, and one was cefotaxime-resistant. Penicillin resistance was due to altered penA alleles whilst rifampicin and ciprofloxacin resistance was due to altered rpoB and gyrA alleles, respectively. Cefotaxime resistance was observed in one isolate which had an altered penA allele containing additional mutations to those harboured by the penicillin-resistant isolates. This study identified several isolates with resistance to antibiotics used for current treatment and prophylaxis of IMD and highlights the need for continued surveillance of resistance among meningococci to ensure continued effective use."

This study aimed to determine the number of additional ICHs detected by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm and to evaluate reasons for erroneous results at a level I trauma center with teleradiology services.In a retrospective multi-center cohort study, consecutive emergency non-contrast HCT scans were analyzed by a commercially available ICH detection software (AIDOC, Tel Aviv, Israel). Discrepancies between AI analysis and initial radiology report (RR) were reviewed by a blinded neuroradiologist to determine the number of additional ICHs detected and evaluate reasons leading to errors.4946 HCT (05/2020-09/2020) from 18 hospitals were included in the analysis. 205 reports (4.1%) were classified as hemorrhages by both radiology report and AI. Out of a total of 162 (3.3%) discrepant reports, 62 were confirmed as hemorrhages by the reference neuroradiologist. 33 ICHs were identified exclusively via RRs. The AI algorithm detected an additional 29 instances of ICH, missed 12.4% of ICH and overcalled 1.9%; RRs missed 10.9% of ICHs and overcalled 0.2%. Many of the ICHs missed by the AI algorithm were located in the subarachnoid space (42.4%) and under the calvaria (48.5%). 85% of ICHs missed by RRs occurred outside of regular working-hours. Calcifications (39.3%), beam-hardening artifacts (18%), tumors (15.7%), and blood vessels (7.9%) were the most common reasons for AI overcalls. ICH size, image quality, and primary examiner experience were not found to be significantly associated with likelihood of incorrect AI results.Complementing human expertise with AI resulted in a 12.2% increase in ICH detection. The AI algorithm overcalled 1.9% HCT.German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00023593)."
https://openalex.org/W3215515036,"Equitable maternal healthcare service access and it's optimum utilization remains a challenge for many developing countries like Bangladesh, and different predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors affect the level of maternal healthcare use. The evidently poor maternal healthcare service utilization and disparities among groups in Bangladesh are concerning considering its effect on maternal health outcomes. The study aimed to identify the factors that influence maternal healthcare service (MHS) utilization in Bangladesh by adopting Andersen's behavior model of health service use as the theoretical framework.The 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey (2017-18 BDHS) data were used which is nationally representative. The survey study used two-stage stratified sampling to select study households, and data were collected through face-to-face interviews. The desirable, moderate, and undesirable maternal health service (MHS) package was developed based on antenatal, and delivery care services use during pregnancy and childbirth. Multinomial logistic regression and discriminant analysis were performed to analyze the factors that affect MHS use.Out of 5,011 ever-married women, only 31.2% of women utilized the desirable level of MHS. The likelihood of using the desirable level of MHS package, relative to the undesirable category, was 9.38 times (OR: 9.38, 95% CI: 4.30-20.44) higher for women with a higher level of education compared to illiterate women, and the same trend was noticed for husband's education. The wealth index had the highest standardized function coefficients (Beta coefficient: 0.49) in discriminatory function. Women with the richest wealth index were more than 23 times (OR: 23.27, 95% CI: 12.69-42.68) likely to have utilized desirable MHS than their poorest counterparts. The likelihood of service uses also varied according to the child's birth order, administrative regions, and area of residence (rural vs. urban).Policies and interventions directed towards poverty reduction, universal education, and diminishing geographical disparities of healthcare access might influence the desirable use of maternal healthcare services in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3216289848,"With increased uncertainty and instability worldwide, how to enhance the urban economy resilience effectively has become one main issue for urban economic development. Based on the measurement of the economic resilience of 241 cities at the prefecture level and above in China using the sensitive index method, we scrutinize the impact of industrial specialization agglomeration and diversification agglomeration on urban economic resilience. Results indicate that, during the impact resistance period, industrial diversification agglomeration, especially related industrial diversification agglomeration, can enhance urban economic resilience, whereas industrial specialization agglomeration has no positive effect. In contrast, during the period of recovery and adjustment, industrial specialization agglomeration can improve urban economic resilience, and industrial diversification agglomeration, especially related industrial diversification agglomeration, has no positive effect. Further analysis indicates that, under the interaction of specialization and diversification agglomerations, the effect of industrial agglomeration on urban economic resilience depends on the type of dual industrial agglomeration, showing remarkable heterogeneity. This study may provide useful references for policy makers concerned with urban resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3217291937,"Urban soil pollution with heavy metals is one of the environmental problems in recent years, especially in industrial cities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of geogenic and anthropogenic sources in the urban soil pollution in Yazd, Iran. For this purpose, 30 top-soil (0-10 cm) samples from Yazd within an area of 136.37 Km2 and population of nearly 656 thousand are collected, and the concentration of heavy elements is measured. To evaluate factors affecting the concentration of heavy elements in urban soils and determine their possible sources, Multivariate statistical analysis, including correlation coefficient, principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) are performed. Enrichment Factor (EF), Geo-accumulation index (Igeo), and Modified potential ecological Risk Index (MRI) are used to assess the level and extension of contamination. Results of this study suggest that As, Cd, Pb and Zn are affected by anthropogenic source, while the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Co, Cu and Cs have come from mostly natural geologic sources. As, Cd and Pb are considerably enriched in the area, provided moderately enriched for the elements Mn, Zn and Cu. However, the other heavy elements show minimal enrichment. Igeo reveal that Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn and Ni with negative values are unpolluted, Pb posed unpolluted to moderately polluted, and As and Cd represent high polluted. Based on the results of the ecological risk factor, the heavy metals of Mn, Ni, Cr, Zn and Cu have a low ecological risk level. More specifically, we find that Pb shows a moderated ecological risk in 39% of the urban soil in the studied area. As and Cd with respectively 100 and 72% contribution have considerable and very high ecological risk. According to the results of MRI, the area is in a very high ecological risk level, and appropriate management practice is essential to reduce the pollution of heavy elements in this area."
https://openalex.org/W3217526952,"We previously reported the diagnostic and prognostic performance of neurofilament light chain (NfL), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and total tau (t-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) biomarkers. The present study aimed to elucidate associations between clinical characteristics and the markers as well as mutual associations of the markers in ALS patients using the same dataset.NfL, TDP-43, and t-tau levels in CSF and plasma in 75 ALS patients were analyzed. The associations between those markers and clinical details were investigated by uni- and multivariate analyses. Correlations between the markers were analyzed univariately.In multivariate analysis of CSF proteins, the disease progression rate (DPR) was positively correlated with NfL (β: 0.51, p = 0.007) and t-tau (β: 0.37, p = 0.03). Plasma NfL was correlated with age (β: 0.53, p = 0.005) and diagnostic grade (β: -0.42, p = 0.02) in multivariate analysis. Plasma TDP-43 was correlated negatively with split hand index (β: -0.48, p = 0.04) and positively with % vital capacity (β: 0.64, p = 0.03) in multivariate analysis. Regarding mutual biomarker analysis, a negative correlation between CSF-NfL and TDP-43 was identified (r: -0.36, p = 0.002).Elevated NfL and t-tau levels in CSF may be biomarkers to predict rapid DPR from onset to sample collection. The negative relationship between CSF NfL and TDP-43 suggests that elevation of CSF TDP-43 in ALS is not a simple consequence of its release into CSF during neurodegeneration. The negative correlation between plasma TDP-43 and split hand index may support the pathophysiological association between plasma TDP-43 and ALS."

Fifty female rats were allocated into five groups (n = 10). Group I comprised sham-operated rats. The remaining groups underwent ovariectomy at the beginning of the experiment. Group II served as the ovariectomy-control group. Groups III, IV & V received thioacetamide (TAA; 300 mg/kg; i.p.) to induce liver injury 6 weeks after ovariectomy. Group III served as the TAA-control group. Groups IV & V received panax ginseng (100 and 300 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 6 weeks post TAA administration. All groups were investigated for liver function tests along with total antioxidant capacity (TAC), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Histopathological examination of liver tissues was performed followed by immunohistochemical staining for nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kβ p65) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Ovariectomized-rats showed a non-significant change in the measured parameters while TAA administration resulted in significant liver damage. Panax ginseng at both dose levels significantly improved the serum liver function tests and TAC along with decreasing the AGEs and TNF-α. It also restored the histopathological picture of liver tissue and decreased hepatic tissue inflammation via reduction of MPO and NF-kβ p65 immunoreactivity. The current study is the first to elucidate the effect of panax ginseng against TAA-induced liver injury in ovariectomized rats which mimic aged post-menopausal estrogen-deficient females. The study demonstrates the crosstalk between AGEs, NF-kβ and MPO in the modulation of inflammation. Panax ginseng possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."
https://openalex.org/W3214847105,"High grade glioma is one of the deadliest human cancers with a median survival rate of only one year following diagnosis. The highly motile and invasive nature of high grade glioma makes it difficult to completely remove surgically. Therefore, increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms glioma cells use to invade normal brain is of critical importance in designing novel therapies. It was previously shown by our laboratory that tumor-associated microglia (TAMs) stimulate glioma cell invasion and this process is dependent on CSF-1R signaling. In this study, we seek to identify pro-invasive factors that are upregulated in microglia in a CSF-1R-dependent manner. We assayed cDNA and protein from microglia treated with conditioned media from the murine glioma cell line GL261, and discovered that several EGFR ligands including amphiregulin (AREG) are strongly upregulated. This upregulation is blocked by addition of a pharmacological CSF-1R inhibitor. Using RNA interference, we show that AREG-depleted microglia are less effective at promoting invasion of GL261 cells into Matrigel-coated invasion chambers. In addition, an AREG blocking antibody strongly attenuates the ability of THP-1 macrophages to activate human glioma cell line U87 invasion. Furthermore, we have identified a signaling pathway which involves CSF-1 signaling through ERK to upregulate AREG expression in microglia. Interfering with ERK using pharmacological inhibitors prevents AREG upregulation in microglia and microglia-stimulated GL261 invasion. These data highlight AREG as a key factor in produced by tumor associated microglia in promoting glioma invasion."
https://openalex.org/W3217734540,"Thailand ranks near the top for the road accident fatality rate worldwide, and more and more vehicles are being registered in Thailand every year. Obtaining the opinions of road commuters may help us reduce road accidents in Thailand. This study seeks to understand damage value in road accidents for personal car drivers in Thailand, using the willingness to pay approach and establishing factors affecting willingness to pay with the theory of planned behavior (TPB). This study obtained data using questionnaires in face-to-face interviews with 1,650 personal cars drivers in Thailand. The average willingness to pay (WTP) for 50% fatality or injury reduction was 23.00 baht/person/50 km trip (US $0.74/person/50 km trip). We obtained the value of statistical life (VSL), assessing this to fall between US $815,385 and US $872,942, and the value of statistical injury (VSI), between US $150,059 and US $160,652. Overall, national damage was assessed at US $4,701,981,170 annually. According to the analysis of factors affecting WTP, TPB comprises four factors, namely, driver attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention. Analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) found all mentioned factors were relevant and positively influenced personal car drivers’ WTP in Thailand, with a statistical significance at a 99% confidence interval ( p &lt; 0.01). This study can develop recommendations for relevant organizations to analyze the results as part of considerations regarding budget allocation and developments on road safety policy due to driver attitude as important as environmental factors or any other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3214993108,"Foot arch structure contributes to lower-limb joint mechanics and gait in adults with obesity. However, it is not well-known if excessive weight and arch height together affect gait mechanics compared to the effects of excessive weight and arch height alone. The purpose of this study was to determine the influences of arch height and obesity on gait mechanics in adults. In this study, 1) dynamic plantar pressure, 2) spatiotemporal gait parameters, 3) foot progression angle, and 4) ankle and knee joint angles and moments were collected in adults with normal weight with normal arch heights (n = 11), normal weight with lower arch heights (n = 10), obesity with normal arch heights (n = 8), and obesity with lower arch heights (n = 18) as they walked at their preferred speed and at a pedestrian standard walking speed, 1.25 m/s. Digital foot pressure data were used to compute a measure of arch height, the Chippaux-Smirak Index (CSI). Our results revealed that BMI and arch height were each associated with particular measures of ankle and knee joint mechanics during walking in healthy young adults: (i) a higher BMI with greater peak internal ankle plantar-flexion moment and (ii) a lower arch height with greater peak internal ankle eversion and abduction moments and peak internal knee abduction moment (i.e., external knee adduction moment). Our results have implications for understanding the role of arch height in reducing musculoskeletal injury risks, improving gait, and increasing physical activity for people living with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3216044774,"Plasmodium falciparum parasites have evolved genetic adaptations to overcome immune responses mounted by diverse Anopheles vectors hindering malaria control efforts. Plasmodium falciparum surface protein Pfs47 is critical in the parasite's survival by manipulating the vector's immune system hence a promising target for blocking transmission in the mosquito. This study aimed to examine the genetic diversity, haplotype distribution, and population structure of Pfs47 and its implications on malaria infections in endemic lowlands in Western Kenya. Cross-sectional mass blood screening was conducted in malaria endemic regions in the lowlands of Western Kenya: Homa Bay, Kombewa, and Chulaimbo. Dried blood spots and slide smears were simultaneously collected in 2018 and 2019. DNA was extracted using Chelex method from microscopic Plasmodium falciparum positive samples and used to genotype Pfs47 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Thirteen observed haplotypes of the Pfs47 gene were circulating in Western Kenya. Population-wise, haplotype diversity ranged from 0.69 to 0.77 and the nucleotide diversity 0.10 to 0.12 across all sites. All the study sites displayed negative Tajima's D values although not significant. However, the negative and significant Fu's Fs statistical values were observed across all the study sites, suggesting population expansion or positive selection. Overall genetic differentiation index was not significant (FST = -0.00891, P > 0.05) among parasite populations. All Nm values revealed a considerable gene flow in these populations. These results could have important implications for the persistence of high levels of malaria transmission and should be considered when designing potential targeted control interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3216185969,"In actual farms, individual livestock identification technology relies on large models with slow recognition speeds, which seriously restricts its practical application. In this study, we use deep learning to recognize the features of individual cows. Alexnet is used as a skeleton network for a lightweight convolutional neural network that can recognise individual cows in images with complex backgrounds. The model is improved for multiple multiscale convolutions of Alexnet using the short-circuit connected BasicBlock to fit the desired values and avoid gradient disappearance or explosion. An improved inception module and attention mechanism are added to extract features at multiple scales to enhance the detection of feature points. In experiments, side-view images of 13 cows were collected. The proposed method achieved 97.95% accuracy in cow identification with a single training time of only 6 s, which is one-sixth that of the original Alexnet. To verify the validity of the model, the dataset and experimental parameters were kept constant and compared with the results of Vgg16, Resnet50, Mobilnet V2 and GoogLenet. The proposed model ensured high accuracy while having the smallest parameter size of 6.51 MB, which is 1.3 times less than that of the Mobilnet V2 network, which is famous for its light weight. This method overcomes the defects of traditional methods, which require artificial extraction of features, are often not robust enough, have slow recognition speeds, and require large numbers of parameters in the recognition model. The proposed method works with images with complex backgrounds, making it suitable for actual farming environments. It also provides a reference for the identification of individual cows in images with complex backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W3215888710,"In 2019, 144 million under-five-year-old children were stunted, and 47 million were wasted globally. In Ethiopia, approximately 350,000 children are estimated to die each year. Preschool aged children need focused attention because this age group not only has special needs, but also forms the platform for growth and development of all children. Under nutrition among preschool children is the result of a complex interplay of diverse elements, such as birth weight, household access to food, availability and use of drinking water. This study aimed at determining the anthropometric failures and associated factors using composite indictors.A community-based cross-sectional study design was used among randomly selected 588 caregivers with pre-school aged children. Under-nutrition of pre-school aged children was computed by using the composite index of anthropometric failure. A multi-stage sampling technique followed by a systematic random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. WHO Anthro software was used to calculate height for age, weight for age and weight for height. The overall prevalence of anthropometric failure (CIAF). Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with under-nutrition.The overall prevalence of under-nutrition among pre-school children was 50.8%, which was significantly associated with being a female (AOR = 1.51, CI: 1.076, 2.12), being from a large family (AOR = 1.78, CI: 1.19, 2.663), having acute respiratory infection (AOR = 1.767, CI: 1.216, 2.566), lack of improved source of drinking water (AOR = 1.484 CI: 1.056, 2.085) and poor dietary diversity score (AOR = 1.5, CI: 1.066, 2.112).The study area has a high prevalence of CIAF in pre-school aged children. The CIAF was found to be significantly associated with the sex of the child, family size, ARI within the last two weeks, and dietary diversity score. To promote the use of family planning and the prevention of infectious diseases, health education is required. The government should adapt CIAF as a metric for assessing children's nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W3216649800,"Cell counting is a frequent task in medical research studies. However, it is often performed manually; thus, it is time-consuming and prone to human error. Even so, cell counting automation can be challenging to achieve, especially when dealing with crowded scenes and overlapping cells, assuming different shapes and sizes. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based cell detection and quantification methodology to automate the cell counting process in the zebrafish xenograft cancer model, an innovative technique for studying tumor biology and for personalizing medicine. First, we implemented a fine-tuned architecture based on the Faster R-CNN using the Inception ResNet V2 feature extractor. Second, we performed several adjustments to optimize the process, paying attention to constraints such as the presence of overlapped cells, the high number of objects to detect, the heterogeneity of the cells' size and shape, and the small size of the data set. This method resulted in a median error of approximately 1% of the total number of cell units. These results demonstrate the potential of our novel approach for quantifying cells in poorly labeled images. Compared to traditional Faster R-CNN, our method improved the average precision from 71% to 85% on the studied data set."
https://openalex.org/W3217077791,"Many individuals with disabilities face barriers to meaningful employment. Legislation has been put in place to ensure employment equity for individuals with disabilities in Canada. However, little is known about the employment profile and experiences of people with seeing disabilities.The objectives of our research study were to explore the employment rates of people with seeing disabilities in Canada, the factors associated with being employed, and supports and barriers that affect their work participation.We used the nationally representative data from the Canadian Survey on Disability (CSD) 2017, collected by Statistics Canada. The CSD is a national cross-sectional survey of Canadians 15 years of age and above who face a functional limitation due to a health-related condition, representing more than 6 million (n = 6,246,640) Canadians. Our analyses focused on people who reported having a seeing disability. A subset of the complete dataset was created, focusing on individuals with a seeing disability. Weighted descriptive analyses were performed using SPSS. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted for individuals between 25-64 years of age to identify predictors of employment.Out of the estimated 892,220 working-age adults (25-64 years) with a seeing disability who were represented by the survey, 54% were employed, 6% were unemployed and 40% were not in the labour force. Early onset of seeing disability (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.32-1.35), less severe seeing disability (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.49-1.53), education above high school (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.97-2.02) and daily use of the internet (OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 2.41-2.51) were positively related with employment. The top three employment accommodations that were needed and were made available included: modified work hours (45%); work from home (38.5%) and a modified workstation (37%). The top three needed but least available accommodations were technical aids (14%), communication aids (22%) and a computer with specialized software or adaptation (27%). Overall, 26% reported that an accommodation was required but was not made available by the employer. While 75% of individuals with a seeing disability were out of the labour force due to their condition, the remaining identified barriers that prevented them from working which included (top 3): (i) too few jobs available (20%); (ii) inadequate training/experience (19%), (iii) past attempts at finding employment were unsuccessful (19%).Adults with seeing disability in Canada experience lower labour force participation than the general population. Rigorous programs are required to assist them with the job search, job retraining and workplace accommodations. It is important for governments to improve efforts towards inclusive education and develop strategies that promote digital literacy of employees and job seekers with visual impairments. Although accessibility legislations have been put in place, programs should be established that provide accessibility solutions for various employers, enabling them to hire individuals with different abilities."

Data was collected from 6,518 US adults through an online cross-sectional self-administered survey via social media platforms in April 2020. Linear regression was performed on COVID-19 knowledge and behavior scores, adjusted for sociodemographic factors. An interaction term between knowledge score and primary information source was included to observe effect modification by primary information source. Higher levels of knowledge were associated with increased self-reported engagement with protective behaviors against COVID-19. The primary information source significantly moderated the association between knowledge and behavior, and analyses of simple slopes revealed significant differences by primary information source. This study shows the important role of COVID-19 information sources in affecting people’s engagement in recommended protective behaviors. Governments and health agencies should monitor the use of various information sources to effectively engage the public and translate knowledge into behavior change during an evolving public health crisis like COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3215714800,"Fourteen proteins produced by three pathogenic Escherichia coli strains were identified using antibiotic induction, MALDI-TOF-TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and top-down proteomic analysis using software developed in-house. Host proteins as well as plasmid proteins were identified. Mature, intact protein ions were fragmented by post-source decay (PSD), and prominent fragment ions resulted from the aspartic acid effect fragmentation mechanism wherein polypeptide backbone cleavage (PBC) occurs on the C-terminal side of aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E) and asparagine (N) residues. These highly specific MS/MS-PSD fragment ions were compared to b- and y-type fragment ions on the C-terminal side of D-, E- and N-residues of in silico protein sequences derived from whole genome sequencing. Nine proteins were found to be post-translationally modified with either removal of an N-terminal methionine or a signal peptide. The protein sequence truncation algorithm of our software correctly identified all full and truncated protein sequences. Truncated sequences were compared to those predicted by SignalP. Nearly complete concurrence was obtained except for one protein where SignalP mis-identified the cleavage site by one residue. Two proteins had intramolecular disulfide bonds that were inferred by the absence of PBC on the C-terminal side of a D-residue located within the disulfide loop. These results demonstrate the utility of MALDI-TOF-TOF for identification of full and truncated bacterial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3216049491,"αB-crystallin (heat shock protein β5/HSPB5) is a member of the family of small heat shock proteins that is expressed in various organs of the human body including eye lenses and muscles. Therefore, mutations in the gene of this protein (CRYAB) might have many pathological consequences. A new mutation has recently been discovered in the α-crystallin domain of this chaperone protein which replaces aspartate 109 with alanine (D109A). This mutation can cause myofibrillar myopathy (MFM), cataracts, and cardiomyopathy. In the current study, several spectroscopic and microscopic analyses, as well as gel electrophoresis assessment were applied to elucidate the pathogenic contribution of human αB-crystallin bearing D109A mutation in development of eye lens cataract and myopathies. The protein oligomerization, chaperone-like activity and chemical/thermal stabilities of the mutant and wild-type protein were also investigated in the comparative assessments. Our results suggested that the D109A mutation has a significant impact on the important features of human αB-crystallin, including its structure, size of the protein oligomers, tendency to form amyloid fibrils, stability, and chaperone-like activity. Given the importance of aspartate 109 in maintaining the proper structure of the α-crystallin domain, its role in the dimerization and chaperone-like activity, as well as preserving protein stability through the formation of salt bridges; mutation at this important site might have critical consequences and can explain the genesis of myopathy and cataract disorders. Also, the formation of large light-scattering aggregates and disruption of the chaperone-like activity by D109A mutation might be considered as important contributing factors in development of the eye lens opacity."
https://openalex.org/W3216119276,"Background Cancer can cause physical changes and affect satisfaction with a persons’ physical appearance, which in turn can affect overall quality of life. Previous studies have primarily focused on women with breast cancer and few is known about body image in patients with other cancers and especially men. The present study compares satisfaction with body image of patients with different types of cancer with the general population and across sexes and identifies risk factors for diminished body image. Additionally, patients that were diagnosed within the last year and those living with cancer for longer are compared. Methods In this cross-sectional study, N = 531 cancer patients answered the German Self-Image Scale to assess body image. One sample t -tests are utilized to compare the body image of cancer patients with the general population. Stepwise regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with body image and ANOVAs with posthoc tests as well as t -tests were used to examine group differences. Results Cancer patients showed diminished body image compared to the general population. For men, higher relationship satisfaction and lower cancer-specific distress were associated with more positive body self-acceptance (SA), whereas younger age, higher relationship satisfaction, and lower cancer-specific distress resulted in better perceived partner-acceptance of one’s body (PA). In women, higher education, lower anxiety and cancer-specific distress were associated with more positive SA. Female cancer patients with breast/gynecological cancer reported better SA than those with visceral cancers. Higher relationship satisfaction and lower cancer-specific distress were found to be associated with more satisfactory PA in females. Time since diagnosis did not affect body image in this study. Conclusions Results indicate that cancer patients regardless of sex tend to have decreased body image satisfaction. Future research directions include examination of additional entities of cancer, deeper research in men and the role of time since diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3216453657,"Purpose Recent calls to improve transparency in peer review have prompted examination of many aspects of the peer-review process. Peer-review systems often allow confidential comments to editors that could reduce transparency to authors, yet this option has escaped scrutiny. Our study explores 1) how reviewers use the confidential comments section and 2) alignment between comments to the editor and comments to authors with respect to content and tone. Methods Our dataset included 358 reviews of 168 manuscripts submitted between January 1, 2019 and August 24, 2020 to a health professions education journal with a single blind review process. We first identified reviews containing comments to the editor. Then, for the reviews with comments, we used procedures consistent with conventional and directed qualitative content analysis to develop a coding scheme and code comments for content, tone, and section of the manuscript. For reviews in which the reviewer recommended “reject,” we coded for alignment between reviewers’ comments to the editor and to authors. We report descriptive statistics. Results 49% of reviews contained comments to the editor (n = 176). Most of these comments summarized the reviewers’ impression of the article (85%), which included explicit reference to their recommended decision (44%) and suitability for the journal (10%). The majority of comments addressed argument quality (56%) or research design/methods/data (51%). The tone of comments tended to be critical (40%) or constructive (34%). For the 86 reviews recommending “reject,” the majority of comments to the editor contained content that also appeared in comments to the authors (80%); additional content tended to be irrelevant to the manuscript. Tone frequently aligned (91%). Conclusion Findings indicate variability in how reviewers use the confidential comments to editor section in online peer-review systems, though generally the way they use them suggests integrity and transparency to authors."
https://openalex.org/W3214997572,"Aims The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis plays a key role in mediating cardiac and kidney injury. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has beneficial effects on cardiac dysfunction, but effects are less well quantified in the cardiorenal syndrome. This study investigated cardiac and kidney pathophysiology following permanent surgical ligation to induce myocardial infarction (MI) in hypertensive animals with or without mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism. Methods Hypertension was induced in adult male Cyp1a1Ren2 rats. Hypertensive animals underwent MI surgery (n = 6), and were then treated daily with spironolactone for 28 days with serial systolic blood pressure measurements, echocardiograms and collection of urine and serum biochemical data. They were compared to hypertensive animals (n = 4), hypertensive animals treated with spironolactone (n = 4), and hypertensive plus MI without spironolactone (n = 6). Cardiac and kidney tissue was examined for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results MI superimposed on hypertension resulted in an increase in interstitial cardiac fibrosis (p&lt;0.001), renal cortical interstitial fibrosis (p&lt;0.01) and glomerulosclerosis (p&lt;0.01). Increased fibrosis was accompanied by myofibroblast and macrophage infiltration in the heart and the kidney. Spironolactone post-MI, diminished the progressive fibrosis (p&lt;0.001) and inflammation (myofibroblasts (p&lt;0.05); macrophages (p&lt;0.01)) in both the heart and the kidney, despite persistently elevated SBP (182±19 mmHg). Despite the reduction in inflammation and fibrosis, spironolactone did not modify ejection fraction, proteinuria, or renal function when compared to untreated animals post MI. Conclusion This model of progressive cardiorenal dysfunction more closely replicates the clinical setting. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade at a clinically relevant dose, blunted progression of cardiac and kidney fibrosis with reduction in cardiac and kidney inflammatory myofibroblast and macrophage infiltration. Further studies are underway to investigate the combined actions of angiotensin blockade with mineralocorticoid receptor blockade."
https://openalex.org/W3215780450,"Right ventricular function is an important prognostic marker for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Native T1 mapping using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging can characterize the myocardium, but accumulating evidence indicates that T1 values of the septum or ventricular insertion points do not have predictive potential in pulmonary arterial hypertension. We aimed to elucidate whether native T1 values of the right ventricular free wall (RVT1) can predict poor outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.This retrospective study included 30 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (median age, 45 years; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 41±13 mmHg) and 16 healthy controls (median age, 43 years) who underwent native T1 mapping. RVT1 was obtained from the inferior right ventricular free wall during end systole.Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension had significantly higher native RVT1 than did controls (1384±74 vs. 1217±57 ms, p<0.001). Compared with T1 values of the septum or ventricular insertion points, RVT1 correlated better with the effective right ventricular elastance index (R = -0.53, p = 0.003), ventricular-arterial uncoupling (R = 0.46, p = 0.013), and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels (R = 0.65, p<0.001). Moreover, the baseline RVT1 was an accurate predictor of the reduced right ventricular ejection fraction at the 12-month follow-up (delta -3%). RVT1 was independently associated with composite events of death or hospitalization from any cause (hazard ratio = 1.02, p = 0.002).RVT1 was predictive of right ventricular performance and outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Thus, native T1 mapping in the right ventricular free wall may be an effective prognostic method for pulmonary arterial hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3216538193,"We conducted a mediation analysis of the provider team's role in changes to chronic condition medication adherence among cancer survivors.We used a retrospective, longitudinal cohort design following Medicare beneficiaries from 18-months before through 24-months following cancer diagnosis. We included beneficiaries aged ≥66 years newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer and using medication for non-insulin anti-diabetics, statins, and/or anti-hypertensives and similar individuals without cancer from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, 2008-2014. Chronic condition medication adherence was defined as a proportion of days covered ≥ 80%. Provider team structure was measured using two factors capturing the number of providers seen and the historical amount of patient sharing among providers. Linear regressions relying on within-survivor variation were run separately for each cancer site, chronic condition, and follow-up period.The number of providers and patient sharing among providers increased after cancer diagnosis relative to the non-cancer control group. Changes in provider team complexity explained only small changes in medication adherence. Provider team effects were statistically insignificant in 13 of 17 analytic samples with significant changes in adherence. Statistically significant provider team effects were small in magnitude (<0.5 percentage points).Increased complexity in the provider team associated with cancer diagnosis did not lead to meaningful reductions in medication adherence. Interventions aimed at improving chronic condition medication adherence should be targeted based on the type of cancer and chronic condition and focus on other provider, systemic, or patient factors."
https://openalex.org/W3216553008,"The influence of excess salt intake on acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been examined precisely except for some clinical data, unlike in chronic kidney disease. Here, we addressed the influence of high salt (HS) on AKI and its underlying mechanisms in terms of the activity of circulating apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM, also called CD5L) protein, a facilitator of AKI repair. HS loading in mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR) resulted in high mortality with advanced renal tubular obstruction and marked exacerbation in biomarkers of proximal renal tubular damage. This AKI exacerbation appeared to be caused mainly by the reduced AIM dissociation from IgM pentamer in serum, as IgM-free AIM is indispensable for the removal of intratubular debris to facilitate AKI repair. Injection of recombinant AIM (rAIM) ameliorated the AKI induced by IR/HS, dramatically improving the tubular damage and mouse survival. The repair of lethal AKI by AIM was dependent on AIM/ kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) axis, as rAIM injection was not effective in KIM-1 deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that the inhibition of AIM dissociation from IgM is an important reason for the exacerbation of AKI by HS, that AIM is a strong therapeutic tool for severe AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3216792550,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are often inappropriately treated with antibiotics. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed with the aim of improving antibiotic prescribing but uptake remains low. The aim of this study was to examine provider knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding RDT use and their relationship to antibiotic prescribing decisions across multiple clinical departments in an urban safety-net hospital.We conducted a mixed methods sequential explanatory study. Providers with prescribing authority (attending physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants) who had at least 20 RTI encounters from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Eighty-five providers completed surveys and 16 participated in interviews. We conducted electronic surveys via RedCap from April to July 2019, followed by semi-structured individual interviews from October to December 2019, to ascertain knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to RDT use and antibiotic prescribing.Survey findings indicated that providers felt knowledgeable about antibiotic prescribing guidelines. They reported high familiarity with the rapid streptococcus and rapid influenza tests. Familiarity with comprehensive respiratory panel PCR (RPP-respiratory panel PCR) and procalcitonin differed by clinical department. Qualitative interviews identified four main themes: providers trust their clinical judgment more than rapid test results; patient-provider relationships play an important role in prescribing decisions; there is patient demand for antibiotics and providers employ different strategies to address the demand and providers do not believe RDTs are implemented with sufficient education or evidence for clinical practice.Prescribers are knowledgeable about prescribing guidelines but often rely on clinical judgement to make final decisions. The utility of RDTs is specific to the type of RDT and the clinical department. Given the low familiarity and clinical utility of RPP and procalcitonin, providers may require additional education and these tests may need to be implemented differently based on clinical department."
https://openalex.org/W3215787023,"Countries are increasingly defining health benefits packages (HBPs) as a way of progressing towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Resources for health are commonly constrained, so it is imperative to allocate funds as efficiently as possible. We conducted allocative efficiency analyses using the Health Interventions Prioritization tool (HIPtool) to estimate the cost and impact of potential HBPs in three countries. These analyses explore the usefulness of allocative efficiency analysis and HIPtool in particular, in contributing to priority setting discussions.HIPtool is an open-access and open-source allocative efficiency modelling tool. It is preloaded with publicly available data, including data on the 218 cost-effective interventions comprising the Essential UHC package identified in the 3rd Edition of Disease Control Priorities, and global burden of disease data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. For these analyses, the data were adapted to the health systems of Armenia, Côte d'Ivoire and Zimbabwe. Local data replaced global data where possible. Optimized resource allocations were then estimated using the optimization algorithm. In Armenia, optimized spending on UHC interventions could avert 26% more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), but even highly cost-effective interventions are not funded without an increase in the current health budget. In Côte d'Ivoire, surgical interventions, maternal and child health and health promotion interventions are scaled up under optimized spending with an estimated 22% increase in DALYs averted-mostly at the primary care level. In Zimbabwe, the estimated gain was even higher at 49% of additional DALYs averted through optimized spending.HIPtool applications can assist discussions around spending prioritization, HBP design and primary health care transformation. The analyses provided actionable policy recommendations regarding spending allocations across specific delivery platforms, disease programs and interventions. Resource constraints exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic increase the need for formal planning of resource allocation to maximize health benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3215891445,"Several direct oral anticoagulants have been developed to prevent cardiogenic thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation, on the other hand, have the complication of bleeding. Since clinical course after bleeding with direct oral anticoagulant remains unclear, the present retrospective cohort study was to clarify the course after hemorrhage among patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants. Among all 2005 patients prescribed dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban between April 2011 and June 2017, subjects comprised 96 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who experienced relevant bleeding during direct oral anticoagulant therapy (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2 or above). The clinical course after hemorrhage was reviewed to examine whether rebleeding or thrombotic events occurred up to the end of December 2019. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most frequent cause of initial bleeding (57 patients, 59%). Rebleeding occurred in 11 patients (4.5%/year), with gastrointestinal bleeding in 10 and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1. All rebleeding occurred in patients who resumed anticoagulation therapy. Another significant factor related with rebleeding included past history of gastrointestinal bleeding. On the other hand, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events occurred in 6 patients older than 75 years old or more (2.5%/year), with systemic thrombosis in 4 and cardiac death in 2. All 4 patients with systemic thrombosis withheld anticoagulants after index bleeding, although only 10 patients withheld anticoagulation therapy. Rebleeding should be taken care of when anticoagulants are resumed after bleeding, particularly among patients who initially experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. Systemic thrombosis occurred at a high rate when anticoagulant therapy was withheld after bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W3215973249,"Optical DNA mapping (ODM) is based on fluorescent labeling, stretching and imaging of single DNA molecules to obtain sequence-specific fluorescence profiles, DNA barcodes. These barcodes can be mapped to theoretical counterparts obtained from DNA reference sequences, which in turn allow for DNA identification in complex samples and for detecting structural changes in individual DNA molecules. There are several types of DNA labeling schemes for ODM and for each labeling type one or several types of match scoring methods are used. By combining the information from multiple labeling schemes one can potentially improve mapping confidence; however, combining match scores from different labeling assays has not been implemented yet. In this study, we introduce two theoretical methods for dealing with analysis of DNA molecules with multiple label types. In our first method, we convert the alignment scores, given as output from the different assays, into p-values using carefully crafted null models. We then combine the p-values for different label types using standard methods to obtain a combined match score and an associated combined p-value. In the second method, we use a block bootstrap approach to check for the uniqueness of a match to a database for all barcodes matching with a combined p-value below a predefined threshold. For obtaining experimental dual-labeled DNA barcodes, we introduce a novel assay where we cut plasmid DNA molecules from bacteria with restriction enzymes and the cut sites serve as sequence-specific markers, which together with barcodes obtained using the established competitive binding labeling method, form a dual-labeled barcode. All experimental data in this study originates from this assay, but we point out that our theoretical framework can be used to combine data from all kinds of available optical DNA mapping assays. We test our multiple labeling frameworks on barcodes from two different plasmids and synthetically generated barcodes (combined competitive-binding- and nick-labeling). It is demonstrated that by simultaneously using the information from all label types, we can substantially increase the significance when we match experimental barcodes to a database consisting of theoretical barcodes for all sequenced plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W3216302407,"The long-tailed silverfish Ctenolepisma longicaudatum (Lepismatidae: Zygentoma) is a nuisance problem in buildings and a major concern in museums, libraries and archives where it cause damage to historical and priceless items. We used laboratory bioassays and two field studies of infested buildings to evaluate spatial and temporal elements of a poisoned bait strategy. In both laboratory experiments and field studies, the efficiency of poisoned bait with indoxacarb as the active ingredient was significantly improved by placing many small bait droplets evenly distributed along all edges of the treated area compared to more clustered distributions. Extended duration of bait presence and removal of competing food sources improved the control effect significantly in the laboratory bioassays. Bait-treated populations also showed a significant decline in the number of eggs deposited and emergence of new nymphs. The study supports poisoned bait as an efficient and low risk approach against the long-tailed silverfish in which extended duration of bait presence, wide distribution of bait droplets in combination with sanitation was crucial for control in the infested premises."
https://openalex.org/W3216446981,"Evaluation of the genetic diversity and an understanding of the genetic structure and relationships of chickpea genotypes are valuable to design efficient germplasm conservation strategies and crop breeding programs. Information is limited, in these regards, for Ethiopian chickpea germplasms. Therefore, the present study was carried out to estimate the genetic diversity, population structure, and relationships of 152 chickpea genotypes using simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Twenty three SSR markers exhibited polymorphism producing a total of 133 alleles, with a mean of 5.8 alleles per locus. Analyses utilizing various genetic-based statistics included pairwise population Nei's genetic distance, heterozygosity, Shannon's information index, polymorphic information content, and percent polymorphism. These analyses exemplified the existence of high genetic variation within and among chickpea genotypes. The 152 genotypes were divided into two major clusters based on Nei's genetic distances. The exotic genotypes were grouped in one cluster exclusively showing that these genotypes are distinct to Ethiopian genotypes, while the patterns of clustering of Ethiopian chickpea genotypes based on their geographic region were not consistent because of the seed exchange across regions. Model-based population structure clustering identified two discrete populations. These finding provides useful insight for chickpea collections and ex-situ conservation and national breeding programs for widening the genetic base of chickpea."
https://openalex.org/W3216667063,"There has been significant sea ice loss associated with climate change in the Pacific Arctic, with unquantified impacts to the habitat of ice-obligate marine mammals such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida). Ringed seals maintain breathing holes and excavate subnivean lairs on sea ice to provide protection from weather and predators during birthing, nursing, and resting. However, there is limited baseline information on the snow and ice habitat, distribution, density, and configuration of ringed seal structures (breathing holes, simple haul-out lairs, and pup lairs) in Alaska. Here, we describe historic field records from two regions of the eastern Chukchi Sea (Kotzebue Sound and Ledyard Bay) collected during spring 1983 and 1984 to quantify baseline ringed seal breeding habitat and map the distribution of ringed seal structures using modern geospatial tools. Of 490 structures located on pre-established study grids by trained dogs, 29% were pup lairs (25% in Kotzebue Sound and 33% in Ledyard Bay). Grids in Ledyard Bay had greater overall density of seal structures than those in Kotzebue Sound (8.6 structures/km2 and 7.1 structures/km2), but structures were larger in Kotzebue Sound. Pup lairs were located in closer proximity to other structures and characterized by deeper snow and greater ice deformation than haul-out lairs or simple breathing holes. At pup lairs, snow depths averaged 74.9 cm (range 37-132 cm), with ice relief nearby averaging 76 cm (range 31-183 cm), and ice deformation 29.9% (range 5-80%). We compare our results to similar studies conducted in other geographic regions and discuss our findings in the context of recent declines in extent and duration of seasonal cover of landfast sea ice and snow deposition on sea ice. Ultimately, additional research is needed to understand the effects of recent environmental changes on ringed seals, but our study establishes a baseline upon which future research can measure pup habitat in northwest Alaska."
https://openalex.org/W3216882649,"Corneal reshaping is a common medical procedure utilized for the correction of different vision disorders relying on the ablation effect of the UV pulsed lasers, especially excimer lasers (ArF) at 193 nm. This wavelength is preferred in such medical procedures since laser radiation at 193 nm exhibits an optimum absorption by corneal tissue. However, it is also significantly absorbed by the water content of the cornea resulting in an unpredictability in the clinical results, as well as the high service and operation cost of the commercial ArF excimer laser device. Consequently, other types of solid-state UV pulsed lasers have been introduced. The present work investigates the ablation effect of solid-state laser at 266 nm in order to be utilized in corneal reshaping procedures. Different number of pulses has been applied to Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and ex-vivo rabbit cornea to evaluate the ablation effect of the produced laser radiation. PMMA target experienced ellipse-like ablated areas with a conical shape in the depth. The results revealed an almost constant ablation area regardless the number of laser pulses, which indicates the stability of the produced laser beam, whereas the ablation depth increases only with increasing the number of laser pulses. Examination of the ex-vivo cornea showed a significant tissue undulation, minimal thermal damage, and relatively smooth ablation surfaces. Accordingly, the obtained 266-nm laser specifications provide promising alternative to the traditional 193-nm excimer laser in corneal reshaping procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3217142397,"Along with the growing geriatric population, the number of odontoid fractures is steadily increasing. However, the effectiveness of immobilizing geriatric odontoid fractures using a cervical collar has been questioned. The aim of the present study is to analyze the physiological and pathological motion in odontoid fractures and to assess limitation of motion in the cervical spine when applying a cervical collar.Motion analysis was performed with wireless motion tracker on unfixed geriatric human cadavers. First, a new geriatric type II odontoid fracture model was developed. In this model, the type II odontoid fracture is operated via a transoral approach. The physiological and pathological flexion and lateral bending of the cervical spine resulting from this procedure was measured. The resulting motion after external stabilization using a cervical collar was analyzed.The new geriatric type II odontoid fracture model was successfully established using seven unfixed human cadavers. The pathological flexion of the cervical spine was significantly increased compared to the physiological flexion (p = 0.027). Furthermore, the flexion was significantly reduced when a cervical collar was applied. In case of flexion the mean remaining motion was significantly reduced (p = 0.0017) from 41° to 14°. For lateral bending the mean remaining motion was significantly reduced (p = 0.0137) from 48° to 18°.In case of type II odontoid fracture, flexion and lateral bending of the cervical spine are increased due to spinal instability. Thus, if an odontoid fracture is suspected in geriatric patients, the application of a cervical collar should always be considered since external stabilization can significantly reduce flexion and lateral bending."
https://openalex.org/W3217259870,"Although anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy has achieved clinical success in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), definitive predictive biomarkers remain to be elucidated. In this study, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of pretreatment tumor tissue samples and pretreatment and on-treatment whole blood samples (WB) samples obtained from a clinically annotated cohort of NSCLC patients (n = 40) treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) monotherapy. Using a single-sample gene set enrichment scoring method, we found that the tumors of responders with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n = 20) are inherently immunogenic to promote antitumor immunity, whereas those with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, n = 18) have a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings suggested that nivolumab may function as a molecular targeted agent in LUAD and as an immunomodulating agent in LUSC. In addition, our study explains why the reliability of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells as a predictive biomarker for the response to nivolumab monotherapy is quite different between LUAD and LUSC."
https://openalex.org/W3217298374,"Centella asiatica is rich in medical and cosmetic properties. While physiological responses of C. asiatica to light have been widely reported, the knowledge of the effects of light on its gene expression is sparse. In this study, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the expression of the C. asiatica genes in response to monochromatic red and blue light. Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under blue light were up-regulated but those under red light were down-regulated. The DEGs encoded for CRY-DASH and UVR3 were among up-regulated genes that play significant roles in responses under blue light. The DEGs involved in the response to photosystem II photodamages and in the biosynthesis of photoprotective xanthophylls were also up-regulated. The expression of flavonoid biosynthetic DEGs under blue light was up-regulated but that under red light was down-regulated. Correspondingly, total flavonoid content under blue light was higher than that under red light. The ABI5, MYB4, and HYH transcription factors appeared as hub nodes in the protein-protein interaction network of the DEGs under blue light while ERF38 was a hub node among the DEGs under red light. In summary, stress-responsive genes were predominantly up-regulated under blue light to respond to stresses that could be induced under high energy light. The information obtained from this study can be useful to better understand the responses of C. asiatica to different light qualities."

Research evidence from developing countries consistently underscores Antenatal Care (ANC) among childbearing adolescents as important to reducing high maternal mortality. However, more than half of pregnant adolescents in Nigeria do not attend ANC. A major gap in literature is on the influence of family context in pregnant adolescent patronage of ANC services.The study utilized a cross-sectional survey with data collected among adolescent mothers in urban slums in three Nigerian states namely, Kaduna, Lagos, and Oyo. The survey used a multi-stage sampling design. The survey covered a sample of 1,015, 1,009 and 1,088 childbearing adolescents from each of Kaduna, Lagos, and Oyo states respectively. Data were analyzed at the three levels: univariate, bivariate and multivariate.Overall, about 70 percent of female adolescents in our sample compared with 75 percent in the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) had any antenatal care (ANC) visit. About 62 percent in our sample compared with 70 percent in the DHS had at least 4 ANC visits, and, about 55 percent in our sample compared with 41 percent of the DHS that had 4 ANC visits in a health facility with skilled attendant (4ANC+). Those who have both parents alive and the mother with post-primary education have higher odds of attending 4ANC+ visits. The odds of attending 4ANC+ for those who have lost both parents is almost 60% less than those whose parents are alive, and, about 40% less than those whose mothers are alive. The influence of mother's education on 4ANC+ attendance is more significant with large disparity when both parents are dead.The study concludes that identifying the role of parents and community in expanding access to ANC services among adolescent mothers is important in improving maternal health in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3215396239,"Inappropriate water and fertilizer management can lead to unstable crop yields. Excessive fertilization can potentially cause soil degradation and nitrogen (N) leaching. The aim of this study was to explore the optimal N application rate on two wheat varieties with different nitrogen responding under limited water irrigation at three experimental sites in the Piedmont plain of the Taihang Mountains, China. A two-year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of five N application rates (N0, N120, N180, N240, and N300) on winter wheat growth, leaf area index, aboveground biomass, grain yield, grain N accumulation, and net return. The results showed that N application rate significantly affected leaf area index, aboveground biomass, grain yield, and harvest index. Variety and variety × N rate interactions had a significant effect on few indicators. Compared with N0, N180 improved leaf area index, aboveground biomass, grain yield, and grain N accumulation. Compared with N240 and N300, N180 increased the harvest index and N harvest index, without significantly reducing grain yield or grain N accumulation, while enhancing a higher N use efficiency. Fertilizers applied in the ranges of 144.7-212.9 and 150.3-247.0 kg ha-1 resulted in the highest net return for the KN199 and JM585 varieties, respectively. Our study provides a sound theoretical basis for high-efficiency fertilizer utilization in sustainable winter wheat production in the Piedmont plains of the Taihang Mountains of China."
https://openalex.org/W3215603641,"Although sensorineural hearing loss (SHL) is relatively common, its cause has not been identified in most cases. Previous studies have suggested that viral infection is a major cause of SHL, especially sudden SHL, but the system that protects against pathogens in the inner ear, which is isolated by the blood-labyrinthine barrier, remains poorly understood. We recently showed that, as audiosensory receptor cells, cochlear hair cells (HCs) are protected by surrounding accessory supporting cells (SCs) and greater epithelial ridge (GER or Kölliker's organ) cells (GERCs) against viral infections. Here, we found that virus-infected SCs and GERCs induce HC death via production of the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Notably, the HCs expressed the TRAIL death receptors (DR) DR4 and DR5, and virus-induced HC death was suppressed by TRAIL-neutralizing antibodies. TRAIL-induced HC death was not caused by apoptosis, and was inhibited by necroptosis inhibitors. Moreover, corticosteroids, the only effective drug for SHL, inhibited the virus-induced transformation of SCs and GERCs into macrophage-like cells and HC death, while macrophage depletion also inhibited virus-induced HC death. These results reveal a novel mechanism underlying virus-induced HC death in the cochlear sensory epithelium and suggest a possible target for preventing virus-induced SHL."
https://openalex.org/W3216223249,"Maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are among the highest worldwide. As part of a quality improvement programme in a health zone in the DRC aimed at contributing to reduced maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, a three-pillar training intervention around childbirth was developed and implemented in collaboration between Swedish and Congolese researchers and healthcare professionals. The aim of this study is to explore contextual factors influencing this intervention.A qualitative research design was used, with data collected through focus group discussions (n = 7) with healthcare professionals involved in the intervention before and at the end (n = 9). Transcribed discussions were inductively analysed using content analysis.Three generic categories describe the contextual factors influencing the intervention: i) Incentives motivated participants' efforts to begin a training programme; ii) Involving the local health authorities was important; and (iii) Having physical space, electricity, and equipment in place was crucial.This study and similar ones highlight that incentives of various types are crucial contextual factors that influence training interventions, and have to be considered already in the planning of such interventions. One such factor is expectations of monetary incentives. To meet this in a small research project like ours would require a reduction of the scale and thus limit the implementation of new evidence-based knowledge into practice aimed at reducing maternal mortality and morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3216239390,"Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) is an emerging problem among People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The current study aimed at determining the risk of ASCVD among PLWHA using the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE) and the Framingham Risk score (FRS).A hospital-based study was carried out from January 2019 to February 2020 in PLWHA. The prevalence of ASCVD risk was determined in individuals aged between 20 to 79 and 40 to 79 years using the FRS and PCE as appropriate. Chi-square, univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were employed for analysis.The prevalence of high-risk ASCVD for subjects aged 20 and above using both tools was 11.5 %. For those aged 40 to 79 years, PCE yielded an increased risk (28%) than FRS (17.7%). Using both tools; advanced age, male gender, smoking, and increased systolic blood pressure were associated with an increased risk of ASCVD. Younger age (adjusted odds ratio, AOR) 0.20, 95%CI: 0.004, 0.091; P< 0.001), lower systolic blood pressure (AOR 0.221, 95%CI: 0.074, 0.605 P< 0.004), and lower total cholesterol (AOR 0.270, 95%CI: 0.073, 0.997; p<0.049) were found to be independent predictors of reduced risk of ASCVD. Likewise, younger age (40 to 64 years), female gender, and lower systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with lower risk of ASCVD among patients aged 40 to 79 years using both PCE and FRS.A considerable number of PLWHA have been identified to be at risk for ASCVD. ASCVD risk was significantly associated with advanced age, male gender, higher blood pressure, and smoking using both FRS and PCE. These factors should therefore be taken into account for designing management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3216840308,"We explore what researchers can gain or lose by using three widely used models for the analysis of discrete choice experiment data-the random parameter logit (RPL) with correlated parameters, the RPL with uncorrelated parameters and the hybrid choice model. Specifically, we analyze three data sets focused on measuring preferences to support a renewable energy programme to grow seaweed for biogas production. In spite of the fact that all three models can converge to very similar median WTP values, they cannot be used indistinguishably. Each model is based on different assumptions, which should be tested before their use. The fact that standard sample sizes usually applied in environmental valuation are generally unable to capture the outcome differences between the models cannot be used as a justification for their indistinct application."
https://openalex.org/W3217284649,"Beta cell failure is a critical feature of diabetes. It includes defects of insulin production, secretion, and altered numbers of hormone-producing cells. In previous work, we have shown that beta cell failure is mechanistically linked to loss of Foxo1 function. This loss of function likely results from increased Foxo1 protein degradation, due to hyperacetylation of Foxo1 from increased nutrient turnover. To understand the mechanisms of Foxo1-related beta cell failure, we performed genome-wide analyses of its target genes, and identified putative mediators of sub-phenotypes of cellular dysfunction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated a striking pattern of Foxo1 binding to the promoters of a cluster of aldo-ketoreductases on chromosome 13: Akr1c12, Akr1c13, Akr1c19. Of these, Akr1c19 has been reported as a marker of Pdx1-positive endodermal progenitor cells. Here we show that Akr1c19 expression is dramatically decreased in db/db islets. Thus, we investigated whether Akr1c19 is involved in beta cell function. We performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cultured beta cells and generated Akr1c19 knockout mice. We show that Foxo1 and HNF1a cooperatively regulate Akr1c19 expression. Nonetheless, functional characterization of Akr1c19 both using islets and knockout mice did not reveal abnormalities on glucose homeostasis. We conclude that reduced expression of Akr1c19 is not sufficient to affect islet function."
https://openalex.org/W3214739027,"In developing countries where point-of-care testing is limited, providers rely on clinical judgement to discriminate between viral and bacterial respiratory infections. We performed a cross-sectional cohort study of hospitalized Jordanian children to evaluate antibiotic use for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections.Admitting diagnoses from a prior viral surveillance cohort of hospitalized Jordanian children were dichotomized into suspected viral-like, non-pulmonary bacterial-like, and pulmonary bacterial-like infection. Stratifying by sex, we performed a polytomous logistic regression adjusting for age, underlying medical condition, maternal education, and region of residence to estimate prevalence odds ratios (PORs) for antibiotic use during hospitalization. Sensitivity and specificity of admission diagnoses and research laboratory results were compared.Children with a suspected viral-like admission diagnosis, compared to those with suspected non-pulmonary bacterial-like, were 88% and 86% less likely to be administered an empiric/first-line antibiotic (male, aPOR: 0.12; female, aPOR: 0.14; p-value = <0.001). There were slight differences by sex with males having a lower prevalence than females in being administered an expanded coverage antibiotic; but they had a higher prevalence of macrolide administration than males with non-pulmonary bacterial-like infection. Overall, children with RSV had a 34% probability (sensitivity) of being assigned to a suspected viral-like diagnosis; whereas RSV-negative children had a 76% probability (specificity) of being assigned to a suspected pulmonary bacterial-like diagnosis.Hospitalized children with a suspected viral-like admission diagnosis were less likely to receive an empiric/first-line and expanded coverage antibiotic compared to suspected non-pulmonary and pulmonary infections; however, when evaluating the accuracy of admission diagnosis to RSV-laboratory results there were considerable misclassifications. These results highlight the need for developing antibiotic interventions for Jordan and the rest of the Middle East."
https://openalex.org/W3215709652,"The PHQ-2 was recently recommended by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement as a form of initial perinatal screening, followed by the EPDS only for women with positive PHQ-2 score. However, the accuracy of the PHQ-2 in perinatal clinical practice has been barely researched, to date. In the present study, we aim to assess the accuracy of the PHQ-2 against the EPDS in a large sample of perinatal women.A total of 1155 consecutive women attending eleven primary or secondary health care centres throughout Italy completed the EPDS and the PHQ-2 during pregnancy (27-40-weeks) or postpartum (1-13-weeks). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, post-test probabilities and area under the curve (AUC) of the PHQ-2, using a cut-off of ≥ 3, were calculated.During pregnancy, PHQ-2 revealed low sensitivity (39.5%) and PPV (39.4%) but high specificity and NPV (97.5%). In postpartum, it revealed very low sensitivity (32.7%) and moderately high NPV (80.9%), but high specificity (99.3%) and PPV (94.4%). Given the low sensitivity despite the high specificity, the PHQ-2 demonstrated poor accuracy (AUC from 0.66 to 0.68).Initial screening by means of PHQ-2 failed to identify an acceptable number of perinatal women at-risk of depression in Italian clinical practice. The PHQ-2 performance suggested that it has insufficient sensitivity and discriminatory power, and may be inadequate as a screening tool for maternal depression."
https://openalex.org/W3215870140,"A migraine is more than head pain, and chronic migraine can dramatically impact a person and those around her/him/them. To better understand those effects it is important to study the experiences of persons with migraine and their caregivers, family, friends, and health and mental health providers. When they collaborate, stakeholders may improve outcomes for persons with chronic migraine. One type of stakeholder cooperation is Health Co-Inquiry, involving a person-centered approach, activation of persons toward collaboration and improved health, evidence-based practice, and integrated care. The current study investigated Health Co-Inquiry at online forums, blogs, and bulletin boards where people came together to discuss migraine. A “Bifurcated Method” was used to conduct inductive, thematic analyses, quantitize themes, and cross-check themes using a robot program, which crawled the Internet to gather data about stakeholder sites and posts related to migraine. Key themes in the online narratives of migraine stakeholders included seeking and providing advice, help, and information. In addition, giving personal stories and testimonials, selling computer applications and products, and providing misinformation were frequent. Differences in the types of posts by various stakeholder groups were identified and may inform researchers about their varied perspectives and goals. Remarkably, migraine is still migraine–before a pandemic and during it. As such, migraineur concerns remained stable across thematic analyses of blog and forum posts before and during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3216962582,"This study examines to what extent study design decisions influence the perceived efficacy of consensus messaging, using medicinal cannabis as the context. We find that researchers’ decisions about study design matter. A modified Solomon Group Design was used in which participants were either assigned to a group that had a pretest (within-subjects design) or a posttest only group (between-subjects design). Furthermore, participants were exposed to one of three messages—one of two consensus messages or a control message—attributed to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. A consensus message describing a percent (97%) of agreeing scientists was more effective at shifting public attitudes than a consensus message citing substantial evidence, but this was only true in the between-subject comparisons. Participants tested before and after exposure to a message demonstrated pre-sensitization effects that undermined the goals of the messages. Our results identify these nuances to the effectiveness of scientific consensus messaging, while serving to reinforce the importance of study design."
https://openalex.org/W4200244833,"Large cities are more productive and generate more output per person. Using data from the UK on energy demand and waste generation, we show that they are also more energy-efficient. Large cities are therefore greener than small towns. The amount of energy demanded and waste generated per person is decreasing in total output produced, that is, energy demand and waste generation scale sublinearly with output. Our research provides the first direct evidence of green urbanization by calculating the rate at which per capita electricity use and waste decrease with city population. The energy demand elasticity with respect to city output is 83%: as the total output of a city increases by one percent, energy demand increases less than one percent, and the Urban Energy Premium is therefore 17%. The energy premium by source of energy demand is from households (13%), transport (20%), and industry (16%). Similarly, we find that the elasticity of waste generation with respect to city output is 90%. For one percent increase in total city output, there is a less than one percent increase in waste, with an Urban Waste Premium of 10%. Because large cities are energy-efficient ways of generating output, energy efficiency can be improved by encouraging urbanization and thus green living. We perform a counterfactual analysis in a spatial equilibrium model that makes income taxes contingent on city population, which attracts more people to big cities. We find that this pro-urbanization counterfactual not only increases economic output but also lowers energy consumption and waste production in the aggregate."
