https://openalex.org/W4295049492,"Background Globally, healthcare workers (HCWs) were prioritised for receiving vaccinations against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Previous research has shown disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCWs based on ethnicity, job role, sex, age, and deprivation. However, vaccine attitudes underpinning these variations and factors influencing these attitudes are yet to be fully explored. Methods We conducted a qualitative study with 164 HCWs from different ethnicities, sexes, job roles, migration statuses, and regions in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviews and focus groups were conducted online or telephonically, and recorded with participants’ permission. Recordings were transcribed and a two-pronged analytical approach was adopted: content analysis for categorising vaccine attitudes and thematic analysis for identifying factors influencing vaccine attitudes. Findings We identified four different COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among HCWs: Active Acceptance, Passive Acceptance, Passive Decline, and Active Decline. Content analysis of the transcripts showed that HCWs from ethnic minority communities and female HCWs were more likely to either decline (actively/passively) or passively accept vaccination—reflecting hesitancy. Factors influencing these attitudes included: trust; risk perception; social influences; access and equity; considerations about the future. Interpretation Our data show that attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine are diverse, and elements of hesitancy may persist even after uptake. This has implications for the sustainability of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, particularly as new components (for example boosters) are being offered. We also found that vaccine attitudes differed by ethnicity, sex and job role, which calls for an intersectional and dynamic approach for improving vaccine uptake among HCWs. Trust, risk perception, social influences, access and equity and future considerations all influence vaccine attitudes and have a bearing on HCWs’ decision about accepting or declining the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on our findings, we recommend building trust, addressing structural inequities and, designing inclusive and accessible information to address hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W4295298761,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world over the past two years (2020-2021). One of the key questions about its future trajectory is the protection from subsequent infections and disease conferred by a previous infection, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the coronaviruses, a group of viruses the members of which are known for their ability to reinfect convalescent individuals. Bulgaria, with high rates of previous infections combined with low vaccination rates and an elderly population, presents a somewhat unique context to study this question.We use detailed governmental data on registered COVID-19 cases to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 reinfections in Bulgaria in the period between March 2020 and early December 2021.For the period analyzed, a total of 4,106 cases of individuals infected more than once were observed, including 31 cases of three infections and one of four infections. The number of reinfections increased dramatically during the Delta variant-driven wave of the pandemic towards the end of 2021. We observe a moderate reduction of severe outcomes (hospitalization and death) in reinfections relative to primary infections, and a more substantial reduction of severe outcomes in breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals.In the available datasets from Bulgaria, prior infection appears to provide some protection from severe outcomes, but to a lower degree than the reduction in severity of breakthrough infections in the vaccinated compared to primary infections in the unvaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W4295047886,"Objectives To explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccine uptake in immunosuppressed adults with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Methods Recruiting through national patient charities and a local hospital, participants were invited to take part in an in-depth, one-to-one, semi-structured interview with a trained qualitative researcher between November 2021 and January 2022. Data were analysed thematically in NVivo, cross-validated by a second coder and mapped to the SAGE vaccine hesitancy matrix. Results Twenty participants (75% female, 20% non-white) were recruited. Barriers and facilitators spanned contextual, individual/group and vaccine/vaccination-specific factors. Key facilitators to all vaccines were higher perceived infection risk and belief that vaccination is beneficial. Key barriers to all vaccines were belief that vaccination could trigger IMID flare, and active IMID. Key facilitators specific to COVID-19 vaccines included media focus, high incidence, mass-vaccination programme with visible impact, social responsibility, and healthcare professionals’ (HCP) confirmation of the new vaccines’ suitability for their IMID. Novel vaccine technology was a concern, not a barrier. Key facilitators of influenza/pneumococcal vaccines were awareness of eligibility, direct invitation, and, clear recommendation from trusted HCP. Key barriers of influenza/pneumococcal vaccines were unaware of eligibility, no direct invitation or recommendation from HCP, low perceived infection risk, and no perceived benefit from vaccination. Conclusions Numerous barriers and facilitators to vaccination, varying by vaccine-type, exist for immunosuppressed-IMID patients. Addressing vaccine benefits and safety for IMID-patients in clinical practice, direct invitation, and public-health messaging highlighting immunosuppression as key vaccination-eligibility criteria may optimise uptake, although further research should assess this."
https://openalex.org/W4295048274,"Ischemic heart disease represent a heavy burden for the medical systems irrespective of the methods used for diagnosis and treatment of such patients in the daily medical routine. The present paper depicts the protocol of a study whose main aim is to develop, implement and test an artificial intelligence algorithm and cloud based platform for fully automated PCI guidance using coronary angiography images. We propose the utilisation of multiple artificial intelligence based models to produce three-dimensional coronary anatomy reconstruction and assess function- post-PCI FFR computation- for developing an extensive report describing and motivating the optimal PCI strategy selection. All the relevant artificial intelligence model outputs (anatomical and functional assessment-pre- and post-PCI) are presented to the clinician via a cloud platform, who can then take the utmost treatment decision. The physician will be provided with multiple scenarios and treatment possibilities for the same case allowing a real-time evaluation of the most appropriate PCI strategy planning and follow-up. The artificial intelligence algorithms and cloud based PCI selection workflow will be verified and validated in a pilot clinical study including subjects prospectively to compare the artificial intelligence services and results against annotations and invasive measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4295048281,"NGOs utilise a range of programming to bring about desired changes. This study examines the advantages and limitations of the range of approaches used by one particular NGO sector: working equid welfare organisations, from the perspective of NGO staff. NGO staff hold a wealth of knowledge regarding the design and implementation of welfare improvement initiatives; however this knowledge is rarely systematically documented. Through 32 semi-structured interviews the experiences of staff across multiple organisations were explored. The nine most commonly utilised approaches within equid focussed NGO programming were discussed with participants. Many themes resulting from the interviews centred around the strengths and disadvantages of these individual approaches, implemented both historically and presently by different NGOs. The influences of the context in which initiatives took place and barriers to welfare improvement that existed across approaches were also examined. Striking a balance came through as a strong theme at many levels. Balancing top-down versus bottom-up approaches was a frequently voiced concern, as was balancing the utility of certain approaches against associated factors warranting caution. Combinations of approaches that were felt to be complementary provided a balance that drew on the strengths and mitigated for the weaknesses of different approaches. The need to tailor approaches to individual contexts was also raised and is especially relevant to INGOs working across multiple countries, cultures and political structures. The study provides an informed insight into potential factors to consider when designing future welfare initiatives. The collaborative pooling of experience across different NGOs could help make welfare initiatives more effective and provide a framework for NGOs in other fields to learn from each other’s collective knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4295048310,"Background COVID-19 vaccination is essential. However, no study has reported adverse events (AEs) after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). This study investigated the AEs within 30-days after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) in ESRD patients on HD. Methods and findings A total of 270 ESRD patients on HD were enrolled in this study. To determine the significance of vascular access thrombosis (VAT) post vaccination, we performed a self-controlled case study (SCCS) analysis. Of these patients, 38.5% had local AEs; local pain (29.6%), tenderness (28.9%), and induration (15.6%) were the most common. Further, 62.2% had systemic AEs; fatigue (41.1%), feverishness (20%), and lethargy (19.9%) were the most common. In addition, post-vaccination thirst affected 18.9% of the participants with female predominance. Younger age, female sex, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for AEs. Five patients had severe AEs, including fever (n = 1), herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation (n = 1), and acute VAT (n = 3). However, the SCCS analysis revealed no association between vaccination and VAT; the incidence rate ratio (IRR)-person ratio was 0.56 (95% CI 0.13–2.33) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.20–2.93) [IRR-event ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.15–4.10) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.20–4.93)] in the 0–3 months and 3–6 months period prior to vaccination, respectively. Conclusions Though some ESRD patients on HD had local and systemic AEs after first-dose vaccination, the clinical significance of these symptoms was minor. Our study confirmed the safety profile of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in HD patients and presented a new viewpoint on vaccine-related AEs. The SCCS analysis did not find an elevated risk of VAT at 1 month following vaccination. Apart from VAT, other vaccine-related AEs, irrespective of local or systemic symptoms, had minor clinical significance on safety issues. Nonetheless, further coordinated, multi-center, or registry-based studies are needed to establish the causality."
https://openalex.org/W4295048405,"Widespread mapping of coral thermal resilience is essential for developing effective management strategies and requires replicable and rapid multi-location assays of heat resistance and recovery. One- or two-day short-term heat stress experiments have been previously employed to assess heat resistance, followed by single assays of bleaching condition. We tested the reliability of short-term heat stress resistance, and linked resistance and recovery assays, by monitoring the phenotypic response of fragments from 101 Acropora hyacinthus colonies located in Palau (Micronesia) to short-term heat stress. Following short-term heat stress, bleaching and mortality were recorded after 16 hours, daily for seven days, and after one and two months of recovery. To follow corals over time, we utilized a qualitative, non-destructive visual bleaching score metric that correlated with standard symbiont retention assays. The bleaching state of coral fragments 16 hours post-heat stress was highly indicative of their state over the next 7 days, suggesting that symbiont population sizes within corals may quickly stabilize post-heat stress. Bleaching 16 hours post-heat stress predicted likelihood of mortality over the subsequent 3-5 days, after which there was little additional mortality. Together, bleaching and mortality suggested that rapid assays of the phenotypic response following short-term heat stress were good metrics of the total heat treatment effect. Additionally, our data confirm geographic patterns of intraspecific variation in Palau and show that bleaching severity among colonies was highly correlated with mortality over the first week post-stress. We found high survival (98%) and visible recovery (100%) two months after heat stress among coral fragments that survived the first week post-stress. These findings help simplify rapid, widespread surveys of heat sensitivity in Acropora hyacinthus by showing that standardized short-term experiments can be confidently assayed after 16 hours, and that bleaching sensitivity may be linked to subsequent survival using experimental assessments."
https://openalex.org/W4295049450,"Google and Apple's Exposure Notifications System (ENS) was developed early in the COVID-19 pandemic to complement existing contact tracing efforts while protecting user privacy. An analysis by the Associated Press released in December 2020 estimated approximately 1 in 14 people had downloaded apps in states one was available. In this study, we assessed the motivation and experience of individuals who downloaded ENS apps from the Google Play and Apple App Stores.We collected review text, star rating, and date of rating for all the reviews on ENS apps in the Google Play and Apple App stores. We extracted the relative frequency of single words and phrases from reviews and created an open vocabulary language, with themes categorized by the research team, to study the salient themes around reviews with high (3-5 stars), neutral (3 stars), and negative (1-2 stars) ratings using logistic regression.Of 7622 reviews obtained from 26 states between 04/07/2020 to 03/31/2021, 6364 were from Google Play Store, and 1258 were from Apple App Store. We obtained reviews for a total of 38 apps, with 25 apps from the Google Play Store and 13 apps from the Apple Play Store. 78% of the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars. Positive reviews were driven by ease of use, support for the state government in creating the app, and encouragement for others to download, as well as engage in other COVID-19 precautions. Negative and neutral reviews focused on issues with app functionality (i.e., installation and tracking errors).Uptake was the largest barrier to success for ENS apps, but states can use insight from app store reviews to better position themselves if they choose to develop further public health apps."
https://openalex.org/W4295047791,"Objective To analyze mortality trends in Switzerland in 2021, the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, we compared mortality in Switzerland in 2021 with that of previous years in terms of standardized weekly deaths, standardized (annual) mortality rates (overall and stratified by age and sex) and life expectancy. The latter is a well-known demographic concept defining the average lifespan of a hypothetical cohort living and dying according to the mortality rates of a given year. Results After a favorable first half of the year and a fairly standard second half in terms of mortality in Switzerland, the year 2021 ended with a wave of deaths of moderate intensity related to the 5th wave of COVID-19. Overall, and after a notable increase in mortality in 2020 (+9.2%, 95%CI: +8.0%; +10.3%, compared to 2019, and +5.1%, 95%CI: +4.3%; +6.0%, compared to 2015–19), the pre-pandemic mortality level was approximately recovered in 2021 (+0.8%, 95%CI: -0.3%; +0.8%, compared to 2019, and -2.9%, 95%CI: -3.7%; -2.2%, compared to 2015–19). Life expectancy, after declining by 10 months for men and 6 months for women in 2020 (i.e. men would have lost 10 months and women 6 months had they lived their entire lives with COVID-19 as it was in 2020), returned in 2021 to 2019 levels for women (85.6 years) and regained 2018 levels for men (81.6 years, still -0.3 years from 2019). The age group responsible for the small remaining loss for men was the 50–70 age group, which had similar mortality in 2020 and 2021. Conclusions The second year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland was characterized by an approximate return to pre-pandemic mortality levels, with a faster recovery for women than for men with respect to 2020."
https://openalex.org/W4295047799,"As the Latin name annua implies, the species Poa annua L. is thought to have an annual life cycle. Yet, there are many reports in literature of P. annua persisting as a perennial. Considering that P. annua senescence patterns do not align with other true annual species, we hypothesized that P. annua is similar to other perennial, C3 turfgrass species that are subject to a confluence of environmental factors that can cause mortality. Four experiments were conducted in Knoxville, TN with the objective of determining environmental factors lethal to P. annua. A field monitoring study assessed 100 P. annua plants across ten grassland micro-environments from May to October 2020. Forty plants survived the summer and confirmed the existence of perennial P. annua ecotypes. Analysis of environmental factors at the time of plant death indicated soil moisture, soil temperature, and pathogenic infection were associated with mortality. A series of glasshouse or field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of each factor on P. annua mortality. Soil moisture and soil temperature were not lethal to P. annua in the glasshouse, except under extreme conditions not typical in the field. A field study assessed mortality of plants from pathogenic infection and indicated that P. annua plants treated with fungicide throughout the summer survived year-round, whereas plants not receiving fungicide applications senesced. These findings support our hypothesis that P. annua is of a perennial life cycle, which can be influenced by environmental conditions. We suggest that the name P. annua is likely a misnomer based on its modern interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W4295049026,"Job advertisements are often worded in ways that might pose discrimination risks leading to the exclusion of certain groups of applicants, particularly in relation to their gender. Especially in male-dominated professions or leadership roles, the specific linguistic formulation of job postings acquires relevance if more women are to be attracted to apply. Various technologies have emerged that offer automated text screening, some of them even suggesting alternative formulations to increase gender inclusivity. In this study we analyze four software providers on the German market using a corpus of ∼160, 000 job ads from three different platforms. We identify the relevant social psychological research on gender and language that is at the scientific core of these technologies. We show that, despite sharing a common foundation, the four tools assess the potential for exclusion in job postings in a considerably divergent way on multiple levels of comparison. We discuss the levers in the software pipeline of all four technologies, as well as the potential effect of certain implementation decisions, such as string-based vs. semantic approaches to computational processing of natural language. We argue that the 'technological translation' of research is extremely involved and further studies of its use in practice are needed to assess the potential for more gender equality."
https://openalex.org/W4295424272,"The maternal care of cows can influence both the milk production and the performance of their calves, making this a topic of important relevance for the production industry that uses zebu cattle. The aims of this study were to 1) investigate the effects of parity on the behaviors of Gyr cows during the peripartum period; 2) characterize the maternal defensiveness of primiparous and multiparous cows towards handlers during the first handling of their calves; and 3) evaluate the relationships between cows' behaviors at the peripartum period and maternal defensiveness. Thirty-one Gyr cows (primiparous and multiparous), from Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária de Minas Gerais (Brazil), were used. The animals were placed in a maternity paddock monitored by video cameras. The behaviors of the animals were collected in four periods: Pre-calving, Post-calving, First handling of calf and Post-handling. Primiparous cows presented more pain signs, reflected in arched spine (P = 0.05), and tended to move more (P = 0.07) than the multiparous in the Pre-calving period. Trends were observed for both Maternal Composite Score (P = 0.06) and Maternal Protective Behavior score (P = 0.06), indicating that both primiparous and multiparous were protective, but only multiparous cows were aggressive toward the caretakers on the first handling of their calves. The most protective cows spent more time eating during the prepartum period (P = 0.03), while the least attentive cows spent more time lying down (P = 0.02) in the prepartum period. The cows who nursed and stimulated their calves more were also calmer (P = 0.02) and more attentive (P = 0.01). In conclusion, the peripartum behaviors of Gyr cows were related to maternal care and maternal defensiveness. Multiparous cows tended to be more aggressive than primiparous cows at the time of the first handling of their calves."
https://openalex.org/W4295427834,"T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction during chronic infection and cancer. Antibody-targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors to reverse T cell exhaustion is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. However, molecular mechanisms of T cell exhaustion remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed a transcriptome analysis by integrating seven exhaustion datasets caused by multiple diseases in both humans and mice. In this study, an overlap of 21 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes was identified in human and mouse exhausted CD8+ T cells. These genes were significantly enriched in exhaustion response-related pathways, such as signal transduction, immune system processes, and regulation of cytokine production. Gene expression network analysis revealed that the well-documented exhaustion genes were defined as hub genes in upregulated genes. In addition, a weighted gene co-expression analysis identified 175 overlapping genes that were significantly correlated with the exhaustion trait in both humans and mice. This study found that overlapping six genes were significantly upregulated and highly related to T cell exhaustion. Finally, we revealed that CD200R1 and ADGRG1, less described previously in exhaustion, contributed to T cell exhaustion. Overall, our findings reveal the mechanisms of T cell exhaustion and provide an important reference to the immunology community."
https://openalex.org/W4295027528,"Human pressures have been intensely modifying freshwater ecosystems worldwide. We assessed the effects of human pressure on habitat diversity and primary productivity to understand the consequences on fish fauna in 25 tropical and subtropical streams of two globally important ecoregions: Iguassu and Upper Paraná. We hypothesized that the increased human pressure (urbanization and agriculture) on stream environments, both at the local and catchment scales, directly decreases habitat diversity. We also hypothesized that increased human pressure triggers changes in primary productivity and fish fauna composition and structure. We evaluated the human pressure intensity using the Integrated Disturbance Index and the Rapid Habitat Diversity Assessment protocol, which combines information about land use, land cover and environmental characteristics of the stream catchment and sampling sites. Streams with increased human disturbance had lower habitat diversity, higher primary productivity, and high non-native species abundance. Fish compositional turnover was associated with increased human disturbance. Native and degradation-sensitive fish species, especially endemic ones, were associated with streams with higher habitat diversity and forested cover. Degradation-resistant fishes, mostly non-native species, were associated with streams with higher human disturbance and urban land use. Although human pressure did not affect species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson dominance, there were significant effects on numerical abundance and fish species equitability. In this study, human pressure directly affected habitat structure, with indirect consequences for fish fauna, increasing the potential for local extirpation of rare species."
https://openalex.org/W4295027612,"The effects of omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on cerebrovascular disease remain unsettled. However, most studies have focused on marine sourced n-3 PUFA rather than total n-3 PUFA, of which the majority in the American diet is plant derived. This study therefore intended to investigate these effects in a cohort for which the vegetarian diet was more prevalent than the general public.Cox proportional hazards with fatal stroke as the outcome was performed on the approximately 96,000 subject Adventist Health Study 2 prospective cohort. Stratification by race and sex was performed on models with a priori covariables, comparing 90th to 10th percentile daily intakes of energy-adjusted total n-3 PUFA, total n-6 PUFA, and the n-6 / n-3 PUFA ratio as variables of interest.For the main analytical group (78,335 subjects), the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for total n-3 PUFA was 0.65 (0.51-0.83), and for total n-6 PUFA was 1.37 (1.02-1.82), while adjusting for both fatty acids in the model. The n-6 / n-3 PUFA ratio was harmful with a HR of 1.40 (1.16-1.69), whereas the inclusion of total n-3 PUFA slightly attenuated the HR to 1.33(1.02-1.74). Effects were similar for the non-black sex-combined and sex-specific analyses.In most analytic groups, subjects with greater total n-3 PUFA intakes have lower risk of fatal stroke, and those with a higher n-6 / n-3 PUFA ratio had higher risk. However, the n-6 / n-3 PUFA ratio remains statistically significant even after adjusting for total n-3 PUFA or total n-6 PUFA, suggesting that the ratio is of epidemiologic interest for cerebrovascular disease research."
https://openalex.org/W4295047756,"The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and frailty in older Mexican Americans has not been previously studied. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between BMI and frailty among non-frail older Mexican Americans at baseline over 18 years of follow up.Longitudinal population-based study of 1,648 non-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged ≥ 67 years from the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (1995/96-2012/13). Frailty phenotype was defined as meeting three or more of the following: unintentional weight loss of >10 pounds, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow walking speed. BMI (kg/m2) was classified as underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-<25), overweight (25-< 30), obesity category I (30-<35), and obesity category II/morbid obesity (≥35). Covariates included socio-demographics, comorbidities, cognitive function, and depressive symptoms. Generalized Estimating Equation models were performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of frailty as a function of BMI category.Participants with underweight or obesity category II/ morbid obesity had greater odds of frailty over time compared to those with normal weight (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.29-4.44 and OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.07-2.44, respectively) after controlling for all covariates. Participants with BMIs in the overweight or category I obesity were at lower odds of frailty over time.Mexican American older adults with BMIs in the underweight or obesity category II/morbid obesity were at higher odds of frailty over time. This indicates that maintaining a healthy weight in this population may prevent future frailty."
https://openalex.org/W4295047780,"Objective To identify the prevalence of people with leg ulcers resulting from sickle cell disease, as well as to describe the clinical, social, economic, and demographic conditions of these people. Method Descriptive study, carried out at the Minas Gerais Hematology and Hemotherapy Center Foundation. The study population consisted of individuals over the age of 18 with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data collection was performed from August 2019 to April 2020 through interviews. For the prevalence calculation, a census was taken of 5,379 people over the age of 18 with sickle cell disease, 77 of whom had active leg ulcers. Descriptive data analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 20.0, Chicago, IL, USA). Results The prevalence of people with leg ulcers in Minas Gerais, Brazil was 1.4%. Of the 72 respondents, the average age was 39 years (range 18–64 years), 41.7% were single, 48.6% said they were black, 84.7% lived in their own house, 38.9% were retired, 61.1% had an income of one minimum wage. The median years of education was 10.5, 50% cited the church as a place for leisure activities, 79.2% denied smoking. Regarding pain, the median score was 3, the median baseline hemoglobin was 7.7 g/dL, and 91.7% had the HbSS genotype. The median age of the first ulcer was 18 years, 77.8% of active ulcers were recurrent, and 59.7% had only one active ulcer. The median time of existence of the ulcer was 3 years. The ulcer prevented 80.6% of people from doing some activity. Prejudice was experienced by 48.6% of the participants. Conclusion The estimated prevalence of leg ulcers was lower than what it reported in the literature, however, the recurrence and the duration of ulcers were high. These findings bring reflection about the assistance to people with leg ulcer."
https://openalex.org/W4295048059,"Chronic inflammation and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are key pathological hallmarks of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Major drivers of these pathologies include pro-inflammatory stimuli such as prostaglandins, which are produced in the central nervous system by the oxidation of arachidonic acid in a reaction catalyzed by the cyclooxygenases COX1 and COX2. Monoacylglycerol lipase hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid signaling lipid 2-arachidonyl glycerol, enhancing local pools of arachidonic acid in the brain and leading to cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin production and neuroinflammation. Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitors were recently shown to act as effective anti-inflammatory modulators, increasing 2-arachidonyl glycerol levels while reducing levels of arachidonic acid and prostaglandins, including PGE2 and PGD2. In this study, we characterized a novel, highly selective, potent and reversible monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (MAGLi 432) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced blood-brain barrier permeability and in both human and mouse cells of the neurovascular unit: brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. We confirmed the expression of monoacylglycerol lipase in specific neurovascular unit cells in vitro, with pericytes showing the highest expression level and activity. However, MAGLi 432 did not ameliorate lipopolysaccharide-induced blood-brain barrier permeability in vivo or reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Our data confirm monoacylglycerol lipase expression in mouse and human cells of the neurovascular unit and provide the basis for further cell-specific analysis of MAGLi 432 in the context of blood-brain barrier dysfunction caused by inflammatory insults."
https://openalex.org/W4295048206,"Objectives To explore patients’ experiences and recommendations for discussions about their prognosis and end of life with their physicians. Methods Patients with advanced cancer or advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were enrolled in qualitative interviews, which were analyzed with a phenomenological and thematic approach. Results During interviews with fourteen patients (median age 64 years), we identified the following themes for discussion about prognosis and the end of life: topics discussed, the timing, the setting, physician–patient relationship, responsibilities for clinicians, and recommendations. Patients preferred the physician to initiate such discussion, but wanted to decide about its continuation and content. The discussions were facilitated by an established physician–patient relationship or attendance of relatives. Patients with cancer had had discussions about prognosis at rather clear-cut moments of deterioration than patients with COPD. Patients with COPD did not consider end-of-life discussions a responsibility of the pulmonologist. Patients recommended an understandable message, involvement of relatives or other clinicians, sufficient time, and sensitive non-verbal communication. Conclusions Patients appreciated open, sensitive, and negotiable discussions about prognosis and the end of life. Practice implications Patients’ recommendations could be used for communication training. Possible differences in the need for such discussions between patients with cancer or COPD warrant further research."

Design Prospective cohort study Setting Australia r sample A total of 7770 women participating in the 1973–1978 cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Women’s Health. Methods Linear regression models were used to estimate (1) prospective associations between parity and mode of birth with eight subscale and two summary scores of the SF36, assessed after a mean follow-up of 11 years., and (2) differences between SF36 scores at follow up for women in different parity and mode of birth categories. Main outcome measure Quality of Life as measured by the SF36 Results Women experiencing no births (parity 0) and one birth (parity 1) had lower scores on all the physical health measures, and on some mental health measures, than women who had 2 births (parity 2) (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Parity and mode of birth may have long-term implications for women’s physical and mental health. Both childless and women with only one child had poorer physical and mental health than their peers with two children. Women with only caesarean section(s) also had poorer health than women who had vaginal birth/s."

In this task, volunteers are given the opportunity to manipulate the presence or absence of a potential cause in order to explore its possible influence over the outcome. Responses provided are assumed to reflect both the participants' information interpretation strategies as well as their information search strategies. Following a previous study investigating the association between causal illusion and the presence of paranormal beliefs, we expected that the association between causal illusion and pseudoscientific beliefs would disappear when controlling for the information search strategy (i.e., the proportion of trials in which the participants decided to present the potential cause). Volunteers with higher pseudoscientific beliefs also developed stronger causal illusions in active contingency detection tasks. This association appeared irrespective of the participants with more pseudoscientific beliefs showing (Experiment 2) or not (Experiment 1) differential search strategies. Our results suggest that both information interpretation and search strategies could be significantly associated to the development of pseudoscientific (and paranormal) beliefs."
https://openalex.org/W4295048411,"This paper evaluates the impact of China’s fiscal decentralization reform, namely the “Province-Managing-County” (PMC) fiscal reform, on local governments’ regional development strategy using county-level data in China covering 2000 to 2013. Surprisingly, after implementing the PMC fiscal reform, local governments will adjust their strategy of supporting zombie firms and attracting new firms, indicating that fiscal decentralization has changed the regional development strategies of local governments. We perform a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis and find that the PMC fiscal reform materially induces an average rise of 0.131 in newly added firms, an average decline of 0.383 in zombie firms, and no significant change in other firms. There is a pronounced substitution effect between zombie firms and newly added firms. We also find evidence supporting this argument: the government’s subsidy, tax treatment, and financial support. Our study provides empirical evidence that local governments’ regional development strategies can be affected by fiscal decentralization."
https://openalex.org/W4295048419,"The sea cucumber Holothuria (Metriatyla) scabra, known as sandfish, is a high-value tropical echinoderm central to the global bêche-de-mer (BDM) trade. This species has been heavily exploited across its natural range, with overharvesting and ineffective fishery management leaving stocks in the Pacific region heavily depleted. In Fiji, sandfish stocks have not recovered since a 1988 harvest ban, with surveys reporting declining populations and recruitment failure. Therefore, to inform fishery management policy for the wild sandfish resource and to guide hatchery-based restocking efforts, a high-resolution genomic audit of Fijian populations was carried out. A total of 6,896 selectively-neutral and 186 putatively-adaptive genome-wide SNPs (DArTseq) together with an independent oceanographic particle dispersal model were used to investigate genetic structure, diversity, signatures of selection, relatedness and connectivity in six wild populations. Three genetically distinct populations were identified with shallow but significant differentiation (average Fst = 0.034, p≤0.05), comprising (1) Lakeba island (Lau archipelago), (2) Macuata (Vanua Levu), and (3) individuals from Yasawa, Ra, Serua island and Kadavu comprising the final unit. Small reductions in allelic diversity were observed in marginal populations in eastern Fiji (overall mean A = 1.956 vs. Lau, A = 1.912 and Macuata, A = 1.939). Signatures of putative local adaptation were also discovered in individuals from Lakeba island, suggesting that they be managed as a discrete unit. An isolation-by-distance model of genetic structure for Fijian sandfish is apparent, with population fragmentation occurring towards the east. Hatchery-based production of juveniles is promising for stock replenishment, however great care is required during broodstock source population selection and juvenile releases into source areas only. The successful use of genomic data here has the potential to be applied to other sea cucumber species in Fiji, and other regions involved in the global BDM trade. While preliminary insights into the genetic structure and connectivity of sandfish in Fiji have been obtained, further local, regional and distribution-wide investigations are required to better inform conservation efforts, wild stock management and hatchery-based restocking interventions for this valuable invertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W4295048437,"Physical activity is associated lower risk for a broad range of non-communicable diseases and early mortality, and even small changes in daily activity levels could have a profound effect on public health at the population level. The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped daily life for United States (US) adults resulting in reductions in physical activity early in the pandemic, but its longer-term effects on daily activities are unknown. To examine the longer-term impact of the pandemic on daily activity levels, we conducted a nationwide longitudinal study of 1,635 adults (20-75 years) in AmeriSpeak. Previous-day recalls of time-use, sedentary time, and physical activity were completed on randomly selected days in Fall 2019 (pre-pandemic) and Fall 2020. Overall, US adults reported less time in transportation (-0.47 hrs/d), more total discretionary time (0.40 hrs/d), but no changes in total sedentary time (0.10 hrs/d) or leisure-time physical activity (-0.06 hrs/d). Women reported significantly less total activity (-0.36 hrs/d) and participants with children < 13 yrs reported more sedentary time (0.60 to 0.82 hrs/d) and less moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity (-0.84 to -0.72 hrs/d). Adults without children reported no changes in sedentary time (0.02 hrs/d) or moderate-vigorous intensity activity (-0.06 hrs/d). Adults who started working from home reported no changes in physical activity, but they were among the most sedentary and least active population groups at both timepoints. Our findings describe the complex inter-play between competing behaviors as time-use demands have changed in response to the pandemic, particularly for adults with younger children. Many US adults are likely to continue working from home; therefore, implementation of evidence-based approaches to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time in this growing population subgroup appears warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4295048797,"In immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), Cox regression analysis can select independent prognostic variables for renal functional decline (RFD). However, the correlation of the selected histological variables with clinical and/or treatment variables is unknown, thereby making histology-based treatment decisions unreliable. We prospectively followed 946 Japanese patients with IgAN for a median of 66 mo. and applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to identify direct and indirect effects of histological variables on RFD as a regression line of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) via clinical variables including amount of proteinuria, eGFR, mean arterial pressure (MAP) at biopsy, and treatment variables such as steroid therapy with/without tonsillectomy (ST) and renin-angiotensin system blocker (RASB). Multi-layered correlations between the variables and RFD were identified by multivariate linear regression analysis and the model's goodness of fit was confirmed. Only tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (T) had an accelerative direct effect on RFD, while endocapillary hypercellularity and active crescent (C) had an attenuating indirect effect via ST. Segmental sclerosis (S) had an attenuating indirect effect via eGFR and mesangial hypercellularity (M) had accelerative indirect effect for RFD via proteinuria. Moreover, M and C had accelerative indirect effect via proteinuria, which can be controlled by ST. However, both T and S had additional indirect accelerative effects via eGFR or MAP at biopsy, which cannot be controlled by ST. SEM identified a systemic path links between histological variables and RFD via dependent clinical and/or treatment variables. These findings lead to clinically applicable novel methodologies that can contribute to predict treatment outcomes using the Oxford classifications."

This is a qualitative study with an interpretative phenomenological design in which 16 women participated-4 through interviews and 12 through stories. The data obtained were analyzed using the Colaizzi approach. The results were structured into 3 themes according to how the women interpreted their experiences. The themes were physical consequences: visible traces; psychological consequences: stormy days and sunny days; and social consequences: from loneliness to a new world. In conclusion, the women in this study considered all those (very diverse) physical pathologies to be important. They encompassed a series of psychological disorders that lasted over time, causing considerable suffering and complicating the participants' ability to relate to the rest of society, especially men. Similarly, the participants identified a series of positive consequences when they left the traumatic situation empowered after overcoming gender-based violence."
https://openalex.org/W4295027339,"Gene expression is regulated through cis-regulatory elements (CREs), among which are promoters, enhancers, Polycomb/Trithorax Response Elements (PREs), silencers and insulators. Computational prediction of CREs can be achieved using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods combined with different feature space formulations. Although Python packages for DNA sequence feature sets and for machine learning are available, no existing package facilitates the combination of DNA sequence feature sets with machine learning methods for the genome-wide prediction of candidate CREs. We here present Gnocis, a Python package that streamlines the analysis and the modelling of CRE sequences by providing extensible APIs and implementing the glue required for combining feature sets and models for genome-wide prediction. Gnocis implements a variety of base feature sets, including motif pair occurrence frequencies and the k-spectrum mismatch kernel. It integrates with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for state-of-the-art machine learning. Gnocis additionally implements a broad suite of tools for the handling and preparation of sequence, region and curve data, which can be useful for general DNA bioinformatics in Python. We also present Deep-MOCCA, a neural network architecture inspired by SVM-MOCCA that achieves moderate to high generalization without prior motif knowledge. To demonstrate the use of Gnocis, we applied multiple machine learning methods to the modelling of D. melanogaster PREs, including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), making this the first study to model PREs with CNNs. The models are readily adapted to new CRE modelling problems and to other organisms. In order to produce a high-performance, compiled package for Python 3, we implemented Gnocis in Cython. Gnocis can be installed using the PyPI package manager by running 'pip install gnocis'. The source code is available on GitHub, at https://github.com/bjornbredesen/gnocis."

Screening tools can help to identify high-risk patients in primary care settings for spirometry and may be helpful in the early detection in COPD and management. This study aims to validate the PUMA questionnaire for use in Chinese primary care settings. This cross-sectional study recruited participants (≥40 years old, current or former smoker with ≥10 packs of cigarette per year) in primary health care clinics in Hong Kong. The Chinese version of the PUMA questionnaire was administered by trained research staff to participants awaiting consultation. COPD diagnosis was confirmed by spirometry (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70). A total 377 patients were recruited of which 373 completed the spirometry. The percentage of participants diagnosed with COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70) was 27.1%. A higher PUMA score was more likely to have an advanced stage of GOLD classification ( P = 0.013). The area under the ROC curve of the PUMA score was 0.753 (95%CI 0.698–0.807). The best cut-point according to Youden’s index for PUMA score was ≥6 with sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 63.3% and negative predictive value (NPV) 63.3%. A cut-off point of PUMA score ≥5 was selected due to higher sensitivity of 91.2%, specificity of 42.6% and high NPV of 92.7%. PUMA score performed better than CDQ and COPD-PS in the area under the ROC curve (0.753 versus 0.658 and 0.612 respectively), had higher sensitivity than COPD-PS (91.2% versus 61%) and had higher specificity than CDQ (42.6% versus 13.1%). The use of PUMA as a screening tool was feasible in Chinese primary care and can be conducted by trained staff and health professionals. The validation results showed high sensitivity and high NPV to identify high risk patient with COPD at cut-off point of ≥5. It can be useful for early detection and management of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W4295029027,"The number of ventilator-dependent patients is rapidly increasing globally. As a result, long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV) patients face the choice of receiving health care in respiratory care wards (RCWs) rather than at home. In this study, we applied Andersen's behavioral theoretical model (ABM) to investigate the determinants of the health care service decisions of patients receiving LTMV.A cross-sectional research design and cluster random sampling were used to select 365 participants from nine RCWs and eight home care facilities in northern Taiwan. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire.Of the predisposing factors, advanced age and an education level of at least junior high school influenced the choice to use RCW services. Being married, living with extended family, and medium or higher socioeconomic status were associated with the decision to use home care services. Of the enabling factors, patients with more caregivers, those whose family caregivers held strong beliefs about providing care, and those who perceived greater social support from health care providers were more likely to choose home care services. Of the need factors examined, poor cognitive function and higher dependence on assistance for activities of daily living (ADL) increased the probability of patients choosing RCW services. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis indicated that our final model accounted for 44.8% of the observed variance in health care service choice.ABM enables an improved understanding of the health care service choices of LTMV patients. Our findings also highlight the importance of rigorously assessing patient needs and helping patients choose the most appropriate health care service."

We sought to characterize factors associated with PrEP uptake and persistence among a cohort of women at risk of HIV infection during the early stages of PrEP scale-up in Kenya. HIV-negative women ≥18 years with ≥2 sexual partners in the past 4 weeks were recruited as part of an ongoing cluster randomized trial of an HIV self-testing intervention. PrEP use was assessed at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Between June 2017 and August 2018, 2,086 were enrolled and had complete baseline data. 138 (6.6%) reported PrEP use during the first year of the study. Although PrEP use increased, persistence on PrEP was low, and less than half of individuals reported continuing PrEP at follow-up visits. In multivariate analyses, PrEP use was associated with recent STIs, having an HIV-positive primary partner, having regular transactional sex in the past 12 months, and being a female sex worker. In the early stages of PrEP scale-up in Kenya, uptake increased modestly among women with risk factors for HIV infection, but overall uptake and persistence was low."

The sample is illuminated with two-dimensional sinusoidal patterns with various orientations and lateral phase shifts generated using a digital micromirror device (DMD). SIM reconstruction is carried out in frequency space using parallel CUDA kernel functions. Furthermore, a general purpose toolbox for the parallel image reconstruction algorithm and an infrastructure that allows all users to perform parallel operations on images without developing any CUDA kernel code is presented. The developed image reconstruction algorithm was run separately on a CPU and a GPU. Two different SIM reconstruction algorithms have been developed for the CPU as mono-thread CPU algorithm and multi-thread OpenMP CPU algorithm.

https://openalex.org/W4295047711,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing which refers to the fact that machines can analyze and recognize emotions through logical reasoning and mathematical operations after learning multimodal emotional features. For the problem of how to consider the effective fusion of multimodal data and the relevance of multimodal data in multimodal sentiment analysis, we propose an attention-based mechanism feature relevance fusion multimodal sentiment analysis model (AFR-BERT). In the data pre-processing stage, text features are extracted using the pre-trained language model BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers), and the BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the internal information of the audio. In the data fusion phase, the multimodal data fusion network effectively fuses multimodal features through the interaction of text and audio information. During the data analysis phase, the multimodal data association network analyzes the data by exploring the correlation of fused information between text and audio. In the data output phase, the model outputs the results of multimodal sentiment analysis. We conducted extensive comparative experiments on the publicly available sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experimental results show that AFR-BERT improves on the classical multimodal sentiment analysis model in terms of relevant performance metrics. In addition, ablation experiments and example analysis show that the multimodal data analysis network in AFR-BERT can effectively capture and analyze the sentiment features in text and audio."
https://openalex.org/W4295047747,"FastCloning, a reliable cloning technique for plasmid construction, is a widely used protocol in biomedical research laboratories. Only two-step molecular manipulations are required to add a gene (cDNA) of interest into the desired vector. However, parallel cloning of the gene into multiple vectors is still a labor-intensive operation, which requires a range of primers for different vectors in high-throughput cloning projects. The situation could even be worse if multiple fragments of DNA are required to be added into one plasmid. Here, we describe a high-throughput FastCloning (HTFC) method, a protocol for parallel cloning by adding an adaptor sequence into all vectors. The target gene and vectors were PCR amplified separately to obtain the insert product and linear vectors with 18-base overlapping at each end of the DNAs required for FastCloning. Furthermore, a method for generating polycistronic bacterial constructs based on the same strategy as that used for HTFC was developed. Thus, the HTFC technique is a simple, effective, reliable, and low-cost tool for parallel cloning."

The genome of CQ16Z1 is 2.6 Mb. Sequence analysis between genomes showed that the two strains are Companilactobacillus futsaii. The unique genes of CQ16Z1 and YM0097 are 217 and 267, which account for 9% and 11% of the whole genomes, respectively. According to unique gene annotation, the results showed that genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism, environmental information processing, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, phage and drug resistance are significantly different. The results of the drug resistance experiment showed that YM0097 had different degrees of resistance to 13 antibiotics, while CQ16Z1 was sensitive to more than half of them. YM0097 contains 9 prophage regions and CQ16Z1 contains 3 prophage regions. The results of the open field test showed that the time (P = 0.005; P = 0.047) and distance (P < 0.010; P = 0.046) of the central area of Y97 group and CQ group are significantly different from the control group. The results of the elevated plus maze test showed that compared with the control group, Y97 group had significant differences in the number of entries to the open arms and the percentage of open arms entry times (P = 0.004; P = 0.025), while the difference between the CQ group and the control group was not significant. YM0097 has a more obvious effect on the exploratory behavior of mice. The effects of YM0097 and CQ16Z1 on the intestinal flora of mice are also different. YM0097 may be more beneficial to the intestinal flora of the host. And LC/MS also showed that the metabolic effects of the two strains on the host are different. Finally, we believe that YM0097 is more suitable for application research as a psychobiotics."

The first wave of data was collected in summer 2020, when the virus was on the retreat. The second wave was collected in autumn, at the peak of the second pandemic wave (November 2020). We investigated how Schwartz's higher-order values changed over the two waves of the study, using economic condition as a predictor of change. We also examined whether value change predicted subsequent value-expressive behavior. Results showed no mean-level change for self-enhancement, self-transcendence, conservation, and openness to change values, but significant interindividual differences in the amount of change for each of the four values. Economic condition emerged as a significant predictor of change in conservation values: Individuals with a decreasing income since the beginning of the pandemic were more likely to increase the importance assigned to these values with respect to individuals whose economic well-being has remained unchanged. Moreover, an increase in conservation and openness to change values predicted behaviors that are mostly expressive of these values, above and beyond value importance at Time 1. Results and their implications for the study of values are discussed."

This study examines the effects of medication treatment and genetic etiology on stigmatizing attitudes toward a relatively new and controversial disorder–Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). Participants (159 parents, 225 non-parents) completed a vignette study on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in which a child displayed behaviors consistent with DMDD. The child was described as either taking psychiatric medication or not, and the vignette described the child’s condition as either genetic or did not mention etiology. Participants who were parents reported greater stigma when the etiology (genetic prime vs. no prime) matched the perceived appropriate treatment (medication vs. no medication). Among parents, a child treated with medication who had a genetic disorder, and a child who was not treated with medication and for whom genetic etiology was not primed, were most stigmatized. No differences emerged among non-parents. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors (parental status, congruence between treatment and perceived disorder etiology) when investigating mental health stigma and underscore the need to further investigate such nuances to inform anti-stigma interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4295047783,"In vivo rodent behavioral and physiological studies often benefit from measurement of general activity. However, many existing instruments necessary to track such activity are high in cost and invasive within home cages, some even requiring extensive separate cage systems, limiting their widespread use to collect data. We present here a low-cost open-source alternative that measures voluntary wheel running activity and allows for modulation and customization, along with a reproducible and easy to set-up code pipeline for setup and analysis in Arduino IDE and R. Our robust, non-invasive scalable voluntary running activity tracker utilizes readily accessible magnets, Hall effect sensors, and an Arduino microcontroller. Importantly, it can interface with existing rodent home cages and wheel equipment, thus eliminating the need to transfer the mice to an unfamiliar environment. The system was validated both for accuracy by a rotating motor used to simulate mouse behavior, and in vivo. Our recorded data is consistent with results found in the literature showing that the mice run between 3 to 16 kilometers per night, and accurately captures speed and distance traveled continuously on the wheel. Such data are critical for analysis of highly variable behavior in mouse models and allow for characterization of behavioral metrics such as general activity. This system provides a flexible, low-cost methodology, and minimizes the cost, infrastructure, and personnel required for tracking voluntary wheel activity."

A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to reveal the relationships between e-cigarette use and cigarette quitting behaviors (e.g., current quitting status, past quit attempts, intention to quit, and duration of quitting) and all stages in smoking cessation, with adjustment for sociodemographic and smoking-related factors.E-cigarette use was positively related to past quit attempts, while not having quit, intention to quit, and longer duration of quitting. Based on the cessation stages, current and former e-cigarette users were significantly more likely to be in the 'Precontemplation' and 'Contemplation' stages than never users, while not to be in the 'Preparation' and 'Action' stages. Current users were particularly less likely to be in the 'Maintenance' stage compared to never users.E-cigarette use was closely linked with early-stage behavior than late-stage behavior in the smoking cessation process. E-cigarettes might promote quit attempts and short-term quitting in some smokers, but the negative role of inducing smokers to continue cigarette smoking with no immediate quit-intention for future attempts is dominant in the real world."

Such children are at heightened risk of maladaptive outcomes if early intervention does not occur. A need exists to identify strategies that promote resilience. Objectives Identify barriers and facilitators that families experience in family-child engagement activities across the community, culture, outdoors, and home settings to inform a cultural-sensitive and community-relevant study aimed at quantifying positive family-child engagement activities as a resilience factor in this population. Methods Biological parents and caregivers to children, ages 0–3 years old with or without prenatal drug exposure (N = 15) were recruited from the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to participate in an in-person semi-structured interview. Data analysis consisted of research yarning and directed content analysis to collect unique stories and to identify common activities, barriers, supports and positive outcomes to families, respectively. Results Attending multiple powwows/celebrations, swimming, and reading were the most mentioned activities. Cost and transportation were common barriers. The most common support mechanism provided was having family or friends present to participate in activities. Cultural knowledge and bonding were common positive outcomes for a child engaging in activities. A collection of stories identified both familial barriers to traditional ways of knowing and participation in community, and community-implemented efforts to bridge that gap among families with a history of drug and alcohol use. Conclusions This study identifies potential resilience factors specific to families to children with prenatal drug exposure that reside in Indigenous communities."

Secondary endpoints included adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and C. difficile infection (CDI) within 30 days.Of the 343 patients included in the study, treatment failure occurred in 54/338 (16.0%) patients and was similar between oral CPs and FQs (35/229 [15.3%] vs. 19/109 [17.4%]). A higher percentage of treatment failures were observed for third generation (3GC) and first generation (1GC) CPs compared to second generation CPs (2GC) (3GC: 15/65 [23.4%]; 1GC: 11/49 [22.4%]; 2GC: 9/115 [7.8%]).

https://openalex.org/W4295048095,"Alcohol use disorder is a medical condition that impacts millions of individuals worldwide. Although there are a few pharmacotherapeutic options for alcohol-dependent individuals; there is a need for the development of novel and more effective therapeutic approaches. Alcohol and nicotine are commonly co-abused, and there is evidence that neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a role in both alcohol and nicotine dependence. Desformylflustrabromine (dFBr), a positive allosteric modulator of the α 4 β 2 nAChRs has been shown to reduce nicotine intake, compulsive-like behavior and neuropathic pain in animal models. dFBr has also been previously shown to cross the blood-brain-barrier. We have recently shown that dFBr can attenuate the response to an acute, hypnotic dose of ethanol, via β 2 nAchR. Here, we have investigated the effect of dFBr in modulating ethanol consumption using the intermittent access two-bottle choice (IA2BC) model of voluntary ethanol consumption in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. We show that dFBr selectively reduced ethanol but not sucrose consumption in the IA2BC model. Furthermore, dFBr decreased preference for ethanol in both male and female rats. No rebound increase in ethanol intake was observed after the washout period after dFBr treatment. The ability of dFBr to decrease ethanol consumption, along with its previously demonstrated ability to decrease nicotine self-administration in rodents, suggest that dFBr is an attractive therapeutic candidate to target both nicotine and alcohol abuse."

This study aims to develop and evaluate a multi-component health promotion programme for a healthy lifestyle to ultimately prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes among adult women in Kisantu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial whereby two groups of three healthcare centres each, matched by population size coverage and geographical area, will be randomised to an intervention or a comparison group. Adult women of reproductive age (18-49 years), non-pregnant or first-trimester pregnant, will be recruited from the healthcare centres. 144 women in the intervention centres will follow a 24-month multi-component health promotion programme based on educational and motivational strategies whereas the comparison centres (144 participants) will be limited to a basic educational strategy. The programme will be delivered by trained peer educators and entails individualised education sessions, education and physical activity group activities, and focus groups. Topics of an optimal diet, physical activity, weight management and awareness of type 2 and gestational diabetes will be covered. The primary outcome is the adherence to a healthy lifestyle measured by a validated closed-ended questionnaire and secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, clinical parameters, diet diversity and the level of physical activity. Participants from both groups will be assessed at baseline and every 6 months by trained health professionals from the recruiting healthcare centres. Data will be summarised by measures of central tendency for continuous outcomes, and frequency distribution and percentages for categorical data. The primary and secondary outcomes will be quantified using statistical mixed models.This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp in Belgium (IRB/RR/AC/137) and the Ethical Committee of the University of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (ESP/CE/130/2021).

Chemical composition analysis of plants can lead to a new method to understand relationship among comparable plants along with biological classification such as genetic and anatomical method. In this study, the chemical diversity of nine different Lauraceae species was investigated, and the plant samples were chemically analyzed and classified. Multivariate analysis methods, such as PLS-DA, were used to select important metabolites distinguishing the nine Lauraceae species. The selected metabolites were identified through preparative LC-MS or MS/MS fragment pattern analysis. In addition, the chemical dendrogram for the nine Lauraceae species was interpreted through molecular network analysis and compared with the genetic dendrogram. This approach enabled us to compare the complete chemical compositions of multiple plant samples to identify relationships among plants."
https://openalex.org/W4295048432,"In order to study the effect of the rainfall infiltration on water migration in compacted loess, a model device was developed for testing water migration in the soil under rainfall conditions. In this study, the volumetric water content and resistivity of soil were introduced into the model test device. This model test device was applied to the study of water migration characteristics in compacted loess under different rainfall conditions. The results show that the resistivity decreases with the increase of the volumetric water content at the same depth of the loess column. In this way, the characteristics of the water migration can also be reflected from the change of the resistivity. There is an intimate relationship between the resistivity and volumetric water content, dry density. The volumetric water content and dry density are normalized by saturation of loess, arriving the equation of saturation against the resistivity. The characteristics of rainfall infiltration in compacted loess show a particular pattern, which demonstrates that, with the increase of dry density of the loess column, the rainfall infiltration line present “Y”, “D” and “Λ” shape distribution respectively, under light rain, heavy rain and rainstorm."
https://openalex.org/W4295048443,"Background Several innovative drugs liable to lead to changes in healthcare organization are or soon will be available for the management of hemophilia. Analyzing their implementation can shed further light on healthcare decision-making, to anticipate changes and risk of breakdown in the patient’s care pathway. Methods Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), based on ISPOR recommendations, was used to assess the organizational impact of innovation in hemophilia care management. The MCDA process designed for this specific context involved ten French experts in hemophilia care management (physicians, nurses, pharmacist, physiotherapist and psychologist) in the hemophilia care center of Chambéry, in the Rhône-Alpes Region of France. This pilot study involved seven steps: (i) defining the decision problem; (ii) selecting and structuring criteria; (iii) assessing the relative weight of each criterion with software-assisted simulation based on pairwise comparisons of different organizational change scenarios; (iv) measuring the performance of the selected innovations; (v) scoring alternatives; (vi) calculating aggregate scores; (vii) discussion. The endpoint was to determine the expected overall organizational impact on a 0–100 scale. Results Seven organizational criteria were selected. ""Acceptability for patient/caregiver/association"" was the most heavily weighted. Factor VIII by subcutaneous route obtained the highest aggregate score: i.e., low impact on care organization (88.8 out of 100). The innovation with strongest organizational impact was gene therapy (27.3 out of 100). Conclusion This approach provided a useful support for discussion, integrating organizational aspects in the treatment decision-making process, at healthcare team level. The study needs repeating in a few years’ time and in other hemophilia centers."
https://openalex.org/W4295048444,"The ""Magude project"" aimed but failed to interrupt local malaria transmission in Magude district, southern Mozambique, by using a comprehensive package of interventions, including indoor residual spraying (IRS), pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and mass-drug administration (MDA). Here we present detailed information on the vector species that sustained malaria transmission, their association with malaria incidence and behaviors, and their amenability to the implemented control interventions. Mosquitoes were collected monthly between May 2015 and October 2017 in six sentinel sites in Magude district, using CDC light traps both indoors and outdoors. Anopheles arabiensis was the main vector during the project, while An. funestus s.s., An. merus, An. parensis and An. squamosus likely played a secondary role. The latter two species have never previously been found positive for Plasmodium falciparum in southern Mozambique. The intervention package successfully reduced vector sporozoite rates in all species throughout the project. IRS was effective in controlling An. funestus s.s. and An. parensis, which virtually disappeared after its first implementation, but less effective at controlling An. arabiensis. Despite suboptimal use, LLINs likely provided significant protection against An. arabiensis and An. merus that sought their host largely indoors when people where in bed. Adding IRS on top of LLINs and MDA likely added value to the control of malaria vectors during the Magude project. Future malaria elimination attempts in the area could benefit from i) increasing the use of LLINs, ii) using longer-lasting IRS products to counteract the increase in vector densities observed towards the end of the high transmission season, and iii) a higher coverage with MDA to reduce the likelihood of human infection. However, additional interventions targeting vectors that survive IRS and LLINs by biting outdoors or indoors before people go to bed, will be likely needed to achieve local malaria elimination."
https://openalex.org/W4295066486,"The Saudi Arabian higher education system is yet to address specific issues concerning language planning and policy. Policies concerning English language use in Saudi academia remain ungoverned, thus leading to implicit personal policies (i.e., self-directed policies). Such freedom in language use may generate concerns among stakeholders, especially if differences emerge between men and women in the same workplace. Current literature does not offer insights into how English is used by each gender in academic settings or outside the classroom in Saudi Arabia; this study seeks to address this gap. A six-item online survey was distributed among higher education English language departments in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was completed by 210 faculty members (67 men and 143 women). Responses from men and women were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The main findings include significant differences in language use between the two genders, suggesting different levels of commitment to English use. These findings imply that future English language policies may need to incorporate divergent views between the two genders. The recommendations include the need for micro-level policies and the involvement of both genders in designing policies to ensure their successful application."
https://openalex.org/W4295299037,"Some mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) studies suggest that allelic variations of Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) play a role in infant HIV-1 acquisition, but findings are inconsistent. To address the limitations of previous studies, the present study investigates the association between perinatal HIV-1 transmission and FcγR variability in three cohorts of South African infants born to women living with HIV-1.This nested case-control study combines FCGR genotypic data from three perinatal cohorts at two hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. Children with perinatally-acquired HIV-1 (cases, n = 395) were compared to HIV-1-exposed uninfected children (controls, n = 312). All study participants were black South Africans and received nevirapine for prevention of MTCT. Functional variants were genotyped using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay, and their representation compared between groups using logistic regression analyses.FCGR3A gene duplication associated with HIV-1 acquisition (OR = 10.27; 95% CI 2.00-52.65; P = 0.005) as did the FcγRIIb-232TT genotype even after adjusting for FCGR3A copy number and FCGR3B genotype (AOR = 1.72; 95%CI 1.07-2.76; P = 0.024). The association between FcγRIIb-232TT genotype and HIV-1 acquisition was further strengthened (AOR = 2.28; 95%CI 1.11-4.69; P = 0.024) if adjusted separately for FCGR2C c.134-96C>T. Homozygous FcγRIIIb-HNA1a did not significantly associate with HIV-1 acquisition in a univariate model (OR = 1.42; 95%CI 0.94-2.16; P = 0.098) but attained significance after adjustment for FCGR3A copy number and FCGR2B genotype (AOR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.01-2.38; P = 0.044). Both FcγRIIb-232TT (AOR = 1.83; 95%CI 1.13-2.97; P = 0.014) and homozygous FcγRIIIb-HNA1a (AOR = 1.66; 95%CI 1.07-2.57; P = 0.025) retained significance when birthweight and breastfeeding were added to the model. The common FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms did not associate with HIV-1 acquisition.Collectively, our findings suggest that the FcγRIIb-232TT genotype exerts a controlling influence on infant susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. We also show a role for less studied variants-FCGR3A duplication and homozygous HNA1a. These findings provide additional insight into a role for FcγRs in HIV-1 infection in children."
https://openalex.org/W4295428717,"Non-infectious pulmonary complications including idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), which are clinical and diagnostic manifestations of lung chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cause significant mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Increasing evidence suggests that alloantigen reactions in lung tissue play a central role in the pathogenesis of IPS and BOS; however, the mechanism is not fully understood. Several clinical and experimental studies have reported that intra-bone marrow (IBM)-SCT provides high rates of engraftment and is associated with a low incidence of acute GVHD. In the present study, allogeneic SCT was conducted in mouse models of IPS and BOS, to compare intravenous (IV)-SCT with IBM-SCT. Allogeneic IBM-SCT improved the clinical and pathological outcomes of pulmonary complications compared to those of IV-SCT. The mechanisms underlying the reductions in pulmonary complications in IBM-SCT mice were explored. The infiltrating lung cells were mainly CD11b+ myeloid and CD3+ T cells, in the same proportions as in transplanted donor cells. In an in vivo bioluminescence imaging, a higher proportion of injected donor cells was detected in the lung during the early phase (1 h after IV-SCT) than after IBM-SCT (16.7 ± 1.1 vs. 3.1 ± 0.7 × 105 photons/s/animal, IV-SCT vs. IBM-SCT, P = 1.90 × 10-10). In the late phase (5 days) after SCT, there were also significantly more donor cells in the lung after IV-SCT than after IBM-SCT or allogeneic-SCT (508.5 ± 66.1 vs. 160.1 ± 61.9 × 106 photons/s/animal, IV-SCT vs. IBM-SCT, P = 0.001), suggesting that the allogeneic reaction induces sustained donor cell infiltration in the lung during the late phase. These results demonstrated that IBM-SCT is capable of reducing injected donor cells in the lung; IBM-SCT decreases donor cell infiltration. IBM-SCT therefore represents a promising transplantation strategy for reducing pulmonary complications, by suppressing the first step in the pathophysiology of chronic GVHD."
