https://openalex.org/W2519419350,"Alport syndrome results from mutations in the COL4A5 (X-linked) or COL4A3/COL4A4 (recessive) genes. This study examined 754 previously- unpublished variants in these genes from individuals referred for genetic testing in 12 accredited diagnostic laboratories worldwide, in addition to all published COL4A5, COL4A3 and COL4A4 variants in the LOVD databases. It also determined genotype-phenotype correlations for variants where clinical data were available. Individuals were referred for genetic testing where Alport syndrome was suspected clinically or on biopsy (renal failure, hearing loss, retinopathy, lamellated glomerular basement membrane), variant pathogenicity was assessed using currently-accepted criteria, and variants were examined for gene location, and age at renal failure onset. Results were compared using Fisher's exact test (DNA Stata). Altogether 754 new DNA variants were identified, an increase of 25%, predominantly in people of European background. Of the 1168 COL4A5 variants, 504 (43%) were missense mutations, 273 (23%) splicing variants, 73 (6%) nonsense mutations, 169 (14%) short deletions and 76 (7%) complex or large deletions. Only 135 of the 432 Gly residues in the collagenous sequence were substituted (31%), which means that fewer than 10% of all possible variants have been identified. Both missense and nonsense mutations in COL4A5 were not randomly distributed but more common at the 70 CpG sequences (p<10-41 and p<0.001 respectively). Gly>Ala substitutions were underrepresented in all three genes (p< 0.0001) probably because of an association with a milder phenotype. The average age at end-stage renal failure was the same for all mutations in COL4A5 (24.4 ±7.8 years), COL4A3 (23.3 ± 9.3) and COL4A4 (25.4 ± 10.3) (COL4A5 and COL4A3, p = 0.45; COL4A5 and COL4A4, p = 0.55; COL4A3 and COL4A4, p = 0.41). For COL4A5, renal failure occurred sooner with non-missense than missense variants (p<0.01). For the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes, age at renal failure occurred sooner with two non-missense variants (p = 0.08, and p = 0.01 respectively). Thus DNA variant characteristics that predict age at renal failure appeared to be the same for all three Alport genes. Founder mutations (with the pathogenic variant in at least 5 apparently- unrelated individuals) were not necessarily associated with a milder phenotype. This study illustrates the benefits when routine diagnostic laboratories share and analyse their data."
https://openalex.org/W2520734402,"Dysregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) signaling through amplifications, mutations, and gene fusions has been implicated in a broad array of cancers (e.g. liver, gastric, ovarian, endometrial, and bladder). ARQ 087 is a novel, ATP competitive, small molecule, multi-kinase inhibitor with potent in vitro and in vivo activity against FGFR addicted cell lines and tumors. Biochemically, ARQ 087 exhibited IC50 values of 1.8 nM for FGFR2, and 4.5 nM for FGFR1 and 3. In cells, inhibition of FGFR2 auto-phosphorylation and other proteins downstream in the FGFR pathway (FRS2α, AKT, ERK) was evident by the response to ARQ 087 treatment. Cell proliferation studies demonstrated ARQ 087 has anti-proliferative activity in cell lines driven by FGFR dysregulation, including amplifications, fusions, and mutations. Cell cycle studies in cell lines with high levels of FGFR2 protein showed a positive relationship between ARQ 087 induced G1 cell cycle arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis. In addition, ARQ 087 was effective at inhibiting tumor growth in vivo in FGFR2 altered, SNU-16 and NCI-H716, xenograft tumor models with gene amplifications and fusions. ARQ 087 is currently being studied in a phase 1/2 clinical trial that includes a sub cohort for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients with confirmed FGFR2 gene fusions (NCT01752920)."
https://openalex.org/W2520586353,"Animals make choices about where to spend their time in complex and dynamic landscapes, choices that reveal information about their biology that in turn can be used to guide their conservation. Using GPS collars, we conducted a novel individual-based analysis of habitat use and selection by the elusive and endangered giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). We constructed spatial autoregressive resource utilization functions (RUF) to model the relationship between the pandas' utilization distributions and various habitat characteristics over a continuous space across seasons. Results reveal several new insights, including use of a broader range of habitat characteristics than previously understood for the species, particularly steep slopes and non-forest areas. We also used compositional analysis to analyze habitat selection (use with respect to availability of habitat types) at two selection levels. Pandas selected against low terrain position and against the highest clumped forest at the at-home range level, but no significant factors were identified at the within-home range level. Our results have implications for modeling and managing the habitat of this endangered species by illustrating how individual pandas relate to habitat and make choices that differ from assumptions made in broad scale models. Our study also highlights the value of using a spatial autoregressive RUF approach on animal species for which a complete picture of individual-level habitat use and selection across space is otherwise lacking."
https://openalex.org/W2518806148,"Scientific findings have suggested a two-fold structure of the cognitive process. By using the heuristic thinking mode, people automatically process information that tends to be invariant across days, whereas by using the explicit thinking mode people explicitly process information that tends to be variant compared to typical previously learned information patterns. Previous studies on creativity found an association between creativity and the brain regions in the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the default mode network and the executive network. However, which neural networks contribute to the explicit mode of thinking during idea generation remains an open question. We employed an fMRI paradigm to examine which brain regions were activated when participants (n = 16) mentally generated alternative uses for everyday objects. Most previous creativity studies required participants to verbalize responses during idea generation, whereas in this study participants produced mental alternatives without verbalizing. This study found activation in the left anterior insula when contrasting idea generation and object identification. This finding suggests that the insula (part of the brain’s salience network) plays a role in facilitating both the central executive and default mode networks to activate idea generation. We also investigated closely the effect of the serial order of idea being generated on brain responses: The amplitude of fMRI responses correlated positively with the serial order of idea being generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is part of the central executive network. Positive correlation with the serial order was also observed in the regions typically assigned to the default mode network: the precuneus/cuneus, inferior parietal lobule and posterior cingulate cortex. These networks support the explicit mode of thinking and help the individual to convert conventional mental models to new ones. The serial order correlated negatively with the BOLD responses in the posterior presupplementary motor area, left premotor cortex, right cerebellum and left inferior frontal gyrus. This finding might imply that idea generation without a verbal processing demand reflecting lack of need for new object identification in idea generation events. The results of the study are consistent with recent creativity studies, which emphasize that the creativity process involves working memory capacity to spontaneously shift between different kinds of thinking modes according to the context."
https://openalex.org/W2509712787,"Coping with scarcity of labeled data is a common problem in sound classification tasks. Approaches for classifying sounds are commonly based on supervised learning algorithms, which require labeled data which is often scarce and leads to models that do not generalize well. In this paper, we make an efficient combination of confidence-based Active Learning and Self-Training with the aim of minimizing the need for human annotation for sound classification model training. The proposed method pre-processes the instances that are ready for labeling by calculating their classifier confidence scores, and then delivers the candidates with lower scores to human annotators, and those with high scores are automatically labeled by the machine. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of this method in two practical scenarios: pool-based and stream-based processing. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach requires significantly less labeled instances to reach the same performance in both scenarios compared to Passive Learning, Active Learning and Self-Training. A reduction of 52.2% in human labeled instances is achieved in both of the pool-based and stream-based scenarios on a sound classification task considering 16,930 sound instances."
https://openalex.org/W2520463455,"The effects of sarcopenic obesity, the co-existence of sarcopenia and obesity, on mood disorders have not been studies extensively. Our objective was to examine the association of depressive symptoms with sarcopenia and obesity status in older Japanese adults. We analyzed data from 1731 functionally-independent, community-dwelling Japanese adults aged 65 years or older (875 men, 856 women) randomly selected from the resident register of Kashiwa city, Chiba, Japan in 2012. Sarcopenia was defined based on appendicular skeletal muscle mass, grip strength and usual gait speed. Obesity was defined as the highest sex-specific quintile of the percentage body fat. Depressive symptoms were defined as a Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item score ≥ 6. Multiple logistic regression was employed to examine the association of depressive symptoms with four groups defined by the presence/absence of sarcopenia and obesity. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 10.1% and the proportions of sarcopenia/obesity, sarcopenia/non-obesity, non-sarcopenia/obesity, non-sarcopenia/non-obesity were 3.7%, 13.6%, 16.9% and 65.8%, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, sarcopenia/obesity was positively associated with depressive symptoms compared with non-sarcopenia/non-obesity, whereas either sarcopenia or obesity alone was not associated with depressive symptoms. The association was particularly pronounced in those aged 65 to 74 years in age-stratified analysis. We conclude that our findings suggest a synergistic impact exerted by sarcopenic obesity on the risk of depressive symptoms, particularly in those aged 65 to 74 years."
https://openalex.org/W2520799412,"Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was previously used to ameliorate wound healing following major surgery and counteract diclofenac toxicity. To resolve the increasing early risks following major massive small bowel resectioning surgery, diclofenac combined with nitric oxide (NO) system blockade was used, suggesting therapy with BPC 157 and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS substrate) L-arginine, is efficacious. Immediately after anastomosis creation, short-bowel rats were untreated or administered intraperitoneal diclofenac (12 mg/kg), BPC 157 (10 μg/kg or 10 ng/kg), L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 5 mg/kg), L-arginine (100 mg/kg) alone or combined, and assessed 24 h later. Short-bowel rats exhibited poor anastomosis healing, failed intestine adaptation, and gastrointestinal, liver, and brain lesions, which worsened with diclofenac. This was gradually ameliorated by immediate therapy with BPC 157 and L-arginine. Contrastingly, NOS-blocker L-NAME induced further aggravation and lesions gradually worsened. Specifically, rats with surgery alone exhibited mild stomach/duodenum lesions, considerable liver lesions, and severe cerebral/hippocampal lesions while those also administered diclofenac showed widespread severe lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, cerebellar nuclear/Purkinje cells, and cerebrum/hippocampus. Rats subjected to surgery, diclofenac, and L-NAME exhibited the mentioned lesions, worsening anastomosis, and macro/microscopical necrosis. Thus, rats subjected to surgery alone showed evidence of deterioration. Furtheremore, rats subjected to surgery and administered diclofenac showed worse symptoms, than the rats subjected to surgery alone did. Rats subjected to surgery combined with diclofenac and L-NAME showed the worst deterioration. Rats subjected to surgery exhibited habitual adaptation of the remaining small intestine, which was markedly reversed in rats subjected to surgery and diclofenac, and those with surgery, diclofenac, and L-NAME. BPC 157 completely ameliorated symptoms in massive intestinal resection-, massive intestinal resection plus diclofenac-, and massive intestinal resection plus diclofenac plus L-NAME-treated short bowel rats that presented with cyclooxygenase (COX)-NO-system inhibition. L-arginine ameliorated only L-NAME-induced aggravation of symptoms in rats subjected to massive intestinal resection and administered diclofenac plus L-NAME."
https://openalex.org/W2520864376,"The RpoE σ factor is essential for the viability of Escherichia coli. RpoE regulates extracytoplasmic functions including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation and some of its non-stoichiometric modifications. Transcription of the rpoE gene is positively autoregulated by EσE and by unknown mechanisms that control the expression of its distally located promoter(s). Mapping of 5′ ends of rpoE mRNA identified five new transcriptional initiation sites (P1 to P5) located distal to EσE-regulated promoter. These promoters are activated in response to unique signals. Of these P2, P3, and P4 defined major promoters, recognized by RpoN, RpoD, and RpoS σ factors, respectively. Isolation of trans-acting factors, in vitro transcriptional and gel retardation assays revealed that the RpoN-recognized P2 promoter is positively regulated by a QseE/F two-component system and NtrC activator, whereas the RpoD-regulated P3 promoter is positively regulated by a Rcs system in response to defects in LPS core biosynthesis, overproduction of certain lipoproteins, and the global regulator CRP. Strains synthesizing Kdo2-LA LPS caused up to 7-fold increase in the rpoEP3 activity, which was abrogated in Δ(waaC rcsB). Overexpression of a novel 73-nucleotide sRNA rirA (RfaH interacting RNA) generated by the processing of 5′ UTR of the waaQ mRNA induces the rpoEP3 promoter activity concomitant with a decrease in LPS content and defects in the O-antigen incorporation. In the presence of RNA polymerase, RirA binds LPS regulator RfaH known to prevent premature transcriptional termination of waaQ and rfb operons. RirA in excess could titrate out RfaH causing LPS defects and the activation of rpoE transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2520143316,"Several technical indicators have been proposed to assess the impact of authors and institutions. Here, we combine the h-index and the PageRank algorithm to do away with some of the individual limitations of these two indices. Most importantly, we aim to take into account value differences between citations-evaluating the citation sources by defining the h-index using the PageRank score rather than with citations. The resulting PR-index is then constructed by evaluating source popularity as well as the source publication authority. Extensive tests on available collections data (i.e., Microsoft Academic Search and benchmarks on the SIGKDD innovation award) show that the PR-index provides a more balanced impact measure than many existing indices. Due to its simplicity and similarity to the popular h-index, the PR-index may thus become a welcome addition to the technical indices already in use. Moreover, growth dynamics prior to the SIGKDD innovation award indicate that the PR-index might have notable predictive power."
https://openalex.org/W2519018863,"Background and Aims Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been proposed as a cardiometabolic and hepatic fibrosis risk factor in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of EAT in NAFLD by analyzing 1) the association between EAT, the other metabolic parameters and the severity of steatosis 2) the relationship between cardiovascular (cIMT, cplaques, E/A), liver (presence of NASH and significant fibrosis) damage and metabolic risk factors including EAT 3) the relationship between EAT and genetic factors strongly influencing liver steatosis. Methods In a cross-sectional study, we considered 512 consecutive patients with NAFLD (confirmed by biopsy in 100). EAT, severity of steatosis, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaques were evaluated by ultrasonography and results analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression models. Variables independently associated with EAT (mm) were female gender (p = 0.003), age (p = 0.001), BMI (p = 0.01), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.009), steatosis grade 2 (p = 0.01) and 3 (p = 0.04), fatty liver index (p = 0.001) and statin use (p = 0.03). Variables independently associated with carotid IMT were age (p = 0.0001), hypertension (p = 0.009), diabetes (p = 0.04), smoking habits (p = 0.04) and fatty liver index (p = 0.02), with carotid plaques age (p = 0.0001), BMI (p = 0.03), EAT (p = 0.02),) and hypertension (p = 0.02), and with E/A age (p = 0.0001), diabetes (p = 0.005), hypertension (p = 0.04) and fatty liver index (p = 0.004). In the 100 patients with available liver histology non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was independently associated with EAT (p = 0.04) and diabetes (p = 0.054) while significant fibrosis with EAT (p = 0.02), diabetes (p = 0.01) and waist circumference (p = 0.05). No association between EAT and PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms was found. Conclusion In patients with NAFLD, EAT is associated with the severity of liver and vascular damage besides with the known metabolic risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2520688954,"This study explored the antifungal potential of perillyl alcohol (PA), a natural monoterpene alcohol, against most prevalent human fungal pathogen C. albicans, its clinical isolates and four non-albicans species of Candida. To resolve the potential mechanisms, we used whole genome transcriptome analyses of PA treated Candida cells to examine the affected cellular circuitry of this pathogen. The transcriptome data revealed a link between calcineurin signaling and PA as among the several categories of PA responsive genes the down regulation of calcineurin signaling gene CNB1 was noteworthy which was also confirmed by both molecular docking and susceptibility assays. We observed that PA treated Candida phenocopied compromised calcineurin pathway stress responses and turned sensitive to alkaline pH, ionic, membrane, salinity, endoplasmic reticulum and serum stresses. Indispensability of functional calcineurin was further confirmed as calcineurin mutant was hypersensitive to PA while constitutively expressed calcineurin strain remained resistant. We explored that PA leads to perturbed membrane integrity as depicted through depleted ergosterol levels and disrupted pH homeostasis. Moreover, PA caused cell wall damage which was evident from hypersensitivity against cell wall perturbing agents (congo red, calcoflour white), SEM and enhanced rate of cell sedimentation. Furthermore, PA inhibited potential virulence traits including morphological transition, biofilm formation and displayed diminished capacity to adhere both to the polystyrene surface and buccal epithelial cells. The study also revealed that PA leads to cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial dysfunction in C. albicans. Together, the present study provides enough evidence for further work on PA so that better strategies could be employed to treat Candida infections."
https://openalex.org/W2520943469,"GILZ (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper) is inducible by glucocorticoids and plays a key role in their mode of action. GILZ attenuates inflammation mainly by inhibition of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation but does not seem to be involved in the severe side effects observed after glucocorticoid treatment. Therefore, GILZ might be a promising target for new therapeutic approaches. The present work focuses on the natural product curcumin, which has previously been reported to inhibit NF-κB. GILZ was inducible by curcumin in macrophage cell lines, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. The up-regulation of GILZ was neither associated with glucocorticoid receptor activation nor with transcriptional induction or mRNA or protein stabilization but was a result of enhanced translation. Because the GILZ 3′-UTR contains AU-rich elements (AREs), we analyzed the role of the mRNA-binding protein HuR, which has been shown to promote the translation of ARE-containing mRNAs. Our results suggest that curcumin treatment induces HuR expression. An RNA immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that HuR can bind GILZ mRNA. In accordance, HuR overexpression led to increased GILZ protein levels but had no effect on GILZ mRNA expression. Our data employing siRNA in LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages show that curcumin facilitates its anti-inflammatory action by induction of GILZ in macrophages. Experiments with LPS-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type and GILZ knock-out mice demonstrated that curcumin inhibits the activity of inflammatory regulators, such as NF-κB or ERK, and subsequent TNF-α production via GILZ. In summary, our data indicate that HuR-dependent GILZ induction contributes to the anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin.

https://openalex.org/W2520284636,"Neuroendocrine (NE) prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly aggressive subtype of prostate cancer associated with resistance to androgen ablation therapy. In this study, we used LNCaP prostate cancer cells cultured in a serum-free medium for 6 days as a NE model of prostate cancer. Serum deprivation increased the expression of NE markers such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and βIII tubulin (βIII tub) and decreased the expression of the androgen receptor protein in LNCaP cells. Using cDNA microarrays, we compared gene expression profiles of NE cells and non-differentiated LNCaP cells. We identified up-regulation of 155 genes, among them LAMP2, a lysosomal membrane protein involved in lysosomal stability and autophagy. We then confirmed up-regulation of LAMP2 in NE cells by qRT-PCR, Western blot and confocal microscopy assays, showing that mRNA up-regulation correlated with increased levels of LAMP2 protein. Subsequently, we determined autophagy activity in NE cells by assessing the protein levels of SQSTM/p62 and LC3 by Western blot and LC3 and Atg5 mRNAs content by qRT-PCR. The decreased levels of SQSTM/p62 was accompanied by an enhanced expression of LC3 and ATG5, suggesting activation of autophagy in NE cells. Blockage of autophagy with 1μM AKT inhibitor IV, or by silencing Beclin 1 and Atg5, prevented NE cell differentiation, as revealed by decreased levels of the NE markers. In addition, AKT inhibitor IV as well as Beclin1 and Atg5 kwockdown attenuated LAMP2 expression in NE cells. On the other hand, LAMP2 knockdown by siRNA led to a marked blockage of autophagy, prevention of NE differentiation and decrease of cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that LAMP2 overexpression assists NE differentiation of LNCaP cells induced by serum deprivation and facilitates autophagy activity in order to attain the NE phenotype and cell survival. LAMP2 could thus be a potential biomarker and potential target for NE prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2477476234,"Bulb onion (Allium cepa) is the second most widely cultivated and consumed vegetable crop in the world. During winter, cold injury can limit the production of bulb onion. Genomic resources available for bulb onion are still very limited. To date, no studies on heritably durable cold and freezing tolerance have been carried out in bulb onion genotypes. We applied high-throughput sequencing technology to cold (2°C), freezing (-5 and -15°C), and control (25°C)-treated samples of cold tolerant (CT) and cold susceptible (CS) genotypes of A. cepa lines. A total of 452 million paired-end reads were de novo assembled into 54,047 genes with an average length of 1,331 bp. Based on similarity searches, these genes were aligned with entries in the public non-redundant (nr) database, as well as KEGG and COG database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using log10 values with the FPKM method. Among 5,167DEGs, 491 genes were differentially expressed at freezing temperature compared to the control temperature in both CT and CS libraries. The DEG results were validated with qRT-PCR. We performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of all DEGs and iPath interactive analysis found 31 pathways including those related to metabolism of carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy, cofactors and vitamins, other amino acids and xenobiotics biodegradation. Furthermore, a large number of molecular markers were identified from the assembled genes, including simple sequence repeats (SSRs) 4,437 and SNP substitutions of transition and transversion types of CT and CS. Our study is the first to provide a transcriptome sequence resource for Allium spp. with regard to cold and freezing stress. We identified a large set of genes and determined their DEG profiles under cold and freezing conditions using two different genotypes. These data represent a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies of Allium spp."

Nature has developed a profusion of enzymes to produce, modify, and degrade carbohydrates. These enzymes usually outcompete chemical approaches for carbohydrate conversions as they are highly selective and effective. Enzymes involved in carbohydrate modifications are thoroughly studied as they can be handy biocatalytic tools in developing new biotechnological applications. Especially with the growing research efforts with the aim to develop efficient biorefinery processes, it is attractive to have a well equipped toolbox of enzymes active on carbohydrates (1.van Hellemond E.W.

The electrons obtained through the oxidation of the carbohydrates are used by the enzyme to reduce molecular oxygen, thereby generating hydrogen peroxide. These redox reactions are facilitated by an FAD flavin cofactor that is covalently tethered to the enzymes via two covalent linkages. Detailed studies on GluO and ChitO have revealed that these oxidases accept a wide range of mono- and oligosaccharides but are most efficient with oligosaccharides. Furthermore, they are able to discriminate between different types of oligosaccharides. For example, ChitO is very selective in oxidizing chitooligosaccharides, whereas it only poorly accepts a limited number of other oligosaccharides. Elucidation of the structures of GluO and LaO and model-inspired engineering of ChitO have revealed the molecular basis for the observed oligosaccharide selectivities of these oxidases. The structures display a rather open active site close to the surface, which allows binding of large oligosaccharides (7.Huang C.-H. Lai W.-L. Lee M.-H. Chen C.-J. Vasella A. Tsai Y.-C. Liaw S.-H. Crystal structure of glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Acremonium strictum: a novel flavinylation of 6-S-cysteinyl, 8α-N1-histidyl FAD.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38831-38838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a result of the open character of the active site, the redox-active isoalloxazine moiety of the flavin cofactor is relatively solvent-exposed. This provides an explanation for why these flavoproteins have the flavin cofactor covalently anchored via two amino acids (8.Heuts D.P. H.M. Scrutton N.S. McIntire W.S. Fraaije M.W. What's in a covalent bond? On the role and formation of covalently bound flavin cofactors.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3405-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Through the bicovalent linkage, the cofactor can still be positioned for catalyzing oxidations, whereas in other flavoproteins, the amino acids are used to bind and position the cofactor. The open active site architecture in oligosaccharide oxidases is different from carbohydrate oxidases that preferentially act on monosaccharides. For example, glucose oxidase and pyranose oxidase have very occluded active sites (9.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. Structural basis for substrate binding and regioselective oxidation of monosaccharides at C3 by pyranose 2-oxidase.J. Biol.

Crystal structure of glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger refined at 2.3 Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 153-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Still, the nature and positioning of a number of residues that form the carbohydrate binding groove dictate which oligosaccharides can bind in such a way that the flavin cofactor is able to oxidize the substrate. The role of these residues in substrate acceptance was clearly demonstrated by engineering ChitO: by replacing three residues, an efficient lactose oxidase could be generated from ChitO (11.Ferrari A.R. Lee M. Fraaije M.W. Expanding the substrate scope of chitooligosaccharide oxidase from Fusarium graminearum by structure-inspired mutagenesis.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015; 112: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This shows that the nature of the amino acids lining the carbohydrate binding groove in oligosaccharide oxidases determines the substrate specificity. In this study, we report on the discovery, characterization, and crystal structures of a novel flavoprotein oxidase belonging to the VAO family, which is primarily active toward xylooligosaccharides (XOS): xylooligosaccharide oxidase (XylO) from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1. By determining the kinetic and catalytic properties and elucidating its crystal structure, our study provides detailed insight into the distinctive enzyme properties of XylO. The results also show that XylO can be used for generating XOS-based aldonic acids. We have recently identified a stretch of conserved residues that correlates with the presence of a bicovalently bound FAD in flavoprotein sequences that belong to the VAO flavoprotein family (12.Kopacz M.M. Fraaije M.W. Turning a monocovalent flavoprotein into a bicovalent flavoprotein by structure-inspired mutagenesis.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2014; 22: 5621-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As all currently known oligosaccharide oxidases contain FAD bound via a similar unique bicovalent attachment, we used this motif as a filter in a PHI-BLAST search. We decided to search specifically the predicted proteome of M. thermophila C1 using the ChitO sequence as query. The targeted fungus is a rich source of thermostable and biocatalytically interesting enzymes (13.Kolbusz M.A. Di Falco M. Ishmael N. Marqueteau S. Moisan M.-C. Baptista C.daS. Powlowski J. Tsang A. Transcriptome and exoproteome analysis of utilization of plant-derived biomass by Myceliophthora thermophila.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2014; 72: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thirteen putative bicovalent flavoprotein sequences were found in the predicted proteome of this fungus, and through multiple sequence alignment, two of them were found to cluster with ChitO, GluO, and LaO. One of these two putative oxidases (GenBank accession number KX139007), which shared 41, 44, and 47% protein sequence identity with ChitO, GluO, and LaO, respectively, was selected for further studies. The corresponding gene encodes for a 497 amino acids protein whose first 16 amino acids encode for a signal sequence identifying the putative oxidase as an extracellular protein. The presence of the conserved FAD linking residues, His94 and Cys155 (Fig. 1), strongly suggests that the respective protein contains a bicovalently bound FAD. From 50 ml of concentrated fermentation supernatant, ∼80 mg of yellow-colored XylO was purified after three steps of purification. Purified XylO runs as one single band on SDS-PAGE at ∼60 kDa. This does not agree with the predicted size of 53 kDa, which suggests that the protein has undergone post-translational modifications, potentially glycosylations. The protein displayed clear fluorescence when, upon SDS-PAGE, the polyacrylamide gel was illuminated by UV light. The fluorescence was more intense when incubating the gel for 5 min in 5% acetic acid, which confirmed the presence of covalently bound FAD. The purified enzyme displays a typical flavin spectrum, with absorbance maxima at 442 and 387 nm (Fig. 2). Upon the addition of 0.1% SDS, the flavin spectrum undergoes changes similar to the ones observed for unfolded berberine bridge enzyme (14.Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. Biochemical evidence that berberine bridge enzyme belongs to a novel family of flavoproteins containing a bi-covalently attached FAD cofactor.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which also contains a bicovalently bound FAD cofactor. To establish the substrate profile of XylO, 23 carbohydrates (glucose, galactose, fructose, mannose, xylose, l-arabinose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, sucrose, maltose, lactose, sorbitol, xylitol, raffinose, cellobiose, cellotetraose, α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, arabitol, chitosan, chitin, starch, maltotetraose, and glycerol) were tested as substrates at 50 and 5 mm (for cyclodextrins, cellotetraose, and maltotetraose, the concentrations tested were 1 and 0.5 mm) using the HRP-based assay. After a 1-min incubation at 25 °C with 1 μm XylO, oxidase activity could be clearly observed for xylose, cellobiose, lactose, and arabinose through the formation of a clear pink color. A weak signal could also be detected for galactose, maltose, and cellotetraose. Interestingly, although l-arabinose did show some activity, 1,5-α-l-arabinobiose did not. Based on the observed substrate profile, the steady state kinetics parameters were determined for xylose, cellobiose, and lactose (Table 1). Intriguingly, although the kcat values are in the same order of magnitude when compared with other known oligosaccharide oxidases (3.Heuts D.P. H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W.

All oligosaccharide flavoprotein oxidases are known to perform better on oligosaccharides when compared with the monosaccharides. This is probably due to their more open active site on the surface and the presence of an oligosaccharide binding groove (3.Heuts D.P. H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W.

Because XylO displayed very poor activity on cellobiose and no detectable activity on maltotetraose, and because xylose had the lowest Km value among the tested carbohydrates (which did not include xylose-based oligosaccharides), as a next step, several XOS (xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose) were tested as substrates. This revealed that XylO is a highly efficient oxidase for XOS (Table 1). Although the kcat values were similar for all identified XylO substrates, the Km values dramatically decreased for all tested XOS. Although for xylose a Km of ∼400 mm was found, the Km values for xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose were ∼3 orders of magnitude lower (Table 1). With kcat values of 11.0–11.5 s−1 and Km values in the (sub)millimolar range, XylO displays similar kinetic properties as those reported for ChitO and GluO in combination with their best oligosaccharide substrates (3.Heuts D.P.

This sets XylO apart from all other known oligosaccharide oxidases (16.Kiryu T. Nakano H. Kiso T. Murakami H.

By analyzing oxygen depletion curves, a Km for oxygen of 0.13 mm could be determined. This shows that at standard atmospheric conditions (0.24 mm dioxygen in buffer solution), XylO is operating below the saturation of the electron acceptor. Having identified efficient substrates for XylO, we determined several enzyme properties by using xylobiose as substrate. To determine the pH optimum for activity, oxidase activity over a pH range from 4 to 8 was measured (supplemental Fig. S3). This revealed that XylO is most active at pH 7, whereas it is still quite active at pH 6 (80%) and moderately active at pH 8 (33%). M. thermophila strains are able to survive and replicate at temperatures higher than 45 °C (21.Karnaouri A. Topakas E. Paschos T. Taouki I. Christakopoulos P.

Technol. 2012; 119: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, many enzymes from this fungus have to tolerate relatively high temperatures. The thermostability of XylO was tested with the Thermofluor assay using SYPRO Orange as unfolding reporter dye (24.Ericsson U.B. Hallberg B.M. Detitta G.T. Dekker N. Nordlund P. Thermofluor-based high-throughput stability optimization of proteins for structural studies.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The apparent melting temperature was found to be 65 °C, which indicates that it is indeed a thermostable enzyme. The temperature optimum for activity was also determined between 20 and 60 °C using an excess of HRP to compensate for the loss of activity of this enzyme at higher temperatures (supplemental Fig. S4). The optimal temperature for enzyme activity is 30 °C, whereas it still displays 50% activity at 60 °C. For determining the site of oxidation by XylO, the product formed upon conversion of xylobiose was determined. For product identification, NMR and GC methods were used. The NMR spectra revealed the presence of a disaccharide as product. The two monosaccharide units were labeled A and B according to the decreasing chemical shift values of their protons. The region (δ 4.6–3.0) in the 1D 1H NMR spectrum contained 11 well resolved signals (Fig. 3, Table 2). Based on observed 1H chemical shifts and 3J1,2 coupling constant values, residue A (3J1,2 8.5 Hz) was assigned to have the β-anomeric configuration. The 2D COSY spectrum also allowed the assignment of the sequential order of the chemical shifts belonging to residue A and residue B. All 13C chemical shifts could be assigned using a 2D 13C-1H HSQC spectrum in combination with 2D COSY (Fig. 3). The downfield shift of B-4 (δ 83.6) is indicative for 4-substitution of residue B. Further evidence for the interpretation of the HSQC spectrum and the determination of the glycosidic linkage is available in the HMBC spectrum, where intra-residual two- and three-bond 1H-13C couplings and inter-residual three-bond connectivities over the glycosidic linkages could be assigned (Fig. 3). The absence of anomeric signals for residue B fits with a xyluronic acid residue. The NMR data are fully consistent with the formation of xylobionic acid as oxidation product.TABLE 2Observed 1H and 13C chemical shifts (ppm) for the product formed upon conversion of xylobiose by XylO (D2O, 25 °C)ResidueH-1 C-1H-2 C-2H-3 C-3H-4 C-4H-5a C-5H-5bA (monosaccharide at non-reducing end)4.5053.3043.4143.5963.9233.257104.875.578.271.667.567.5B (monosaccharide at reducing end)4.1534.0573.8753.8573.73873.973.883.662.862.8 Open table in a new tab The structure of the xylobionate was further confirmed by GC-MS analysis. The GC chromatogram of the intact xylobionate shows one major peak, and the respective MS spectrum showed a fragmentation pattern fitting xylobionate (supplemental Fig. S1). After methanolysis, the GC chromatogram of trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives showed four peaks, which were also identified by MS (supplemental Fig. S2). One minor peak corresponded with TMS derivatives of the methyl glycoside of α- and β-xylofuranosides, two peaks corresponded with the methyl glycosides of α- and β-xylopyranosides, and one peak corresponded with the methylated xyluronic acid. The GC data confirm that XylO oxidizes xylobiose into xylobionic acid by C1 oxidation of the reducing end. In the literature, only a few studies report on using carbohydrate oxidases to oxidize complex polysaccharide substrates, i.e. LaO (4.Xu F. Golightly E.J. Fuglsang C.C. Schneider P. Duke K.R. Lam L. Christensen S. Brown K.M. Jørgensen C.T. Brown S.H. A novel carbohydrate:acceptor oxidoreductase from Microdochium nivale.Eur. J.

Oxidation of polysaccharides by galactose oxidase.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As XylO was found to act on XOS, we tested the oxidase with various complex carbohydrate-containing mixtures that vary in xylan content: beechwood xylan, wheat arabinoxylan, oat flour, rye whole grain flour, and barley flakes. The targeted mixtures (1% w/v) were first separated into soluble and insoluble fractions, and each of them was tested in duplicate. Using the HRP-based assay, specific activities toward the different potential substrate could be determined (Table 3). No activity was detected on insoluble substrates, suggesting the necessity for the reducing ends of the poly- or oligosaccharides to be in solution. Testing the soluble fractions of oat flour and barley flakes did not yield any oxidase activity, whereas the soluble fractions of the xylans and rye flour revealed significant oxidase activity. The observed preference is in line with the fact that, when compared with barley and oat, rye grains are relatively rich in arabinoxylan. In contrast, oat and barley are relatively rich in glucans (26.Theander O. Westerlund E. Åman P. Graham H. Plant cell walls and monogastric diets.Anim. Feed Sci. Technol. 1989; 23: 205-225Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27.Knudsen K.E.B. Carbohydrate and lignin contents of plant materials used in animal feeding.Anim. Feed Sci. Technol. 1997; 67: 319-338Crossref Google Scholar). Thus the observed activities are in agreement with the above reported substrate profile for XylO. To further probe the use of XylO for oxidizing xylan-derived XOS, we prepared hydrolyzed wheat arabinoxylan, which comprises a population of XOS of different lengths substituted with 2-,3- or 2,3-linked arabinose residues. The observation that hydrolysis of wheat arabinoxylan resulted in a 32-fold increase in XylO activity suggests that XylO is also able to accept arabinose-decorated XOS.TABLE 3Oxidation activity of XylO on the soluble and insoluble fractions of complex natural substratesSpecific activity (units/mg)SolubleInsolubleBeechwood xylan0.50 ± 0.06NDWheat arabinoxylan0.43 ± 0.08NDHydrolyzed wheat arabinoxylan13.8 ± 0.85NTOat flourNDNDRye whole grain flour1.03 ± 0.15NDBarley flakesNDND Open table in a new tab To understand the molecular basis by which XylO specifically accepts xylooligosaccharides, we set out to elucidate the crystal structure of XylO.

https://openalex.org/W2519885308,"Background Accurate calculation of ventricular stress and strain is critical for cardiovascular investigations. Sarcomere shortening in active contraction leads to change of ventricular zero-stress configurations during the cardiac cycle. A new model using different zero-load diastole and systole geometries was introduced to provide more accurate cardiac stress/strain calculations with potential to predict post pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) surgical outcome. Methods Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data were obtained from 16 patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot prior to and 6 months after pulmonary valve replacement (8 male, 8 female, mean age 34.5 years). Patients were divided into Group 1 (n = 8) with better post PVR outcome and Group 2 (n = 8) with worse post PVR outcome based on their change in RV ejection fraction (EF). CMR-based patient-specific computational RV/LV models using one zero-load geometry (1G model) and two zero-load geometries (diastole and systole, 2G model) were constructed and RV wall thickness, volume, circumferential and longitudinal curvatures, mechanical stress and strain were obtained for analysis. Pairwise T-test and Linear Mixed Effect (LME) model were used to determine if the differences from the 1G and 2G models were statistically significant, with the dependence of the pair-wise observations and the patient-slice clustering effects being taken into consideration. For group comparisons, continuous variables (RV volumes, WT, C- and L- curvatures, and stress and strain values) were summarized as mean ± SD and compared between the outcome groups by using an unpaired Student t-test. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential morphological and mechanical predictors for post PVR surgical outcome. Results Based on results from the 16 patients, mean begin-ejection stress and strain from the 2G model were 28% and 40% higher than that from the 1G model, respectively. Using the 2G model results, RV EF changes correlated negatively with stress (r = -0.609, P = 0.012) and with pre-PVR RV end-diastole volume (r = -0.60, P = 0.015), but did not correlate with WT, C-curvature, L-curvature, or strain. At begin-ejection, mean RV stress of Group 2 was 57.4% higher than that of Group 1 (130.1±60.7 vs. 82.7±38.8 kPa, P = 0.0042). Stress was the only parameter that showed significant differences between the two groups. The combination of circumferential curvature, RV volume and the difference between begin-ejection stress and end-ejection stress was the best predictor for post PVR outcome with an area under the ROC curve of 0.855. The begin-ejection stress was the best single predictor among the 8 individual parameters with an area under the ROC curve of 0.782. Conclusion The new 2G model may be able to provide more accurate ventricular stress and strain calculations for potential clinical applications.

Five tertiary hospitals in Beijing, China implemented UZMDP in 2012. Its impacts on these hospitals are unknown. We described the effects of UZMDP on a participating hospital, Jishuitan Hospital, Beijing, China (JST).This retrospective longitudinal study examined the hospital-level data of JST and city-level data of tertiary hospitals of Beijing, China (BJT) 2009-2015. Rank-sum tests and join-point regression analyses were used to assess absolute changes and differences in trends, respectively.In absolute terms, after the UZDMP implementation, there were increased annual patient-visits and decreased ratios of medicine-to-healthcare-charges (RMOH) in JST outpatient and inpatient services; however, in outpatient service, physician work-days decreased and physician-workload and inflation-adjusted per-visit healthcare charges increased, while the inpatient physician work-days increased and inpatient mortality-rate reduced. Interestingly, the decreasing trend in inpatient mortality-rate was neutralized after UZDMP implementation. Compared with BJT and under influence of UZDMP, JST outpatient and inpatient services both had increasing trends in annual patient-visits (annual percentage changes[APC] = 8.1% and 6.5%, respectively) and decreasing trends in RMOH (APC = -4.3% and -5.4%, respectively), while JST outpatient services had increasing trend in inflation-adjusted per-visit healthcare charges (APC = 3.4%) and JST inpatient service had decreasing trend in inflation-adjusted per-visit medicine-charges (APC = -5.2%).Implementation of UZMDP seems to increase annual patient-visits, reduce RMOH and have different impacts on outpatient and inpatient services in a Chinese urban tertiary hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2519036216,"Valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known antiepileptic drug that exhibits antitumor activities through its action as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. CD133 is considered to be a cancer stem cell marker in several tumors including neuroblastoma. CD133 transcription is strictly regulated by epigenetic modifications. We evaluated the epigenetic effects of treatment with 1mM VPA and its influence on the expression of CD133 in four human neuroblastoma cell lines. Chemoresistance and cell cycle of CD133+ and CD133− populations were examined by flow cytometry. We performed bisulfite conversion followed by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting analysis to assess the methylation status of CD133 promoters P1 and P3. Our results revealed that VPA induced CD133 expression that was associated with increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4. On treatment with VPA and cytostatics, CD133+ cells were mainly detected in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and they showed less activated caspase-3 compared to CD133− cells. UKF-NB-3 neuroblastoma cells which express CD133 displayed higher colony and neurosphere formation capacities when treated with VPA, unlike IMR-32 which lacks for CD133 protein. Induction of CD133 in UKF-NB-3 was associated with increased expression of phosphorylated Akt and pluripotency transcription factors Nanog, Oct-4 and Sox2. VPA did not induce CD133 expression in cell lines with methylated P1 and P3 promoters, where the CD133 protein was not detected. Applying the demethylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine to the cell lines with methylated promoters resulted in CD133 re-expression that was associated with a drop in P1 and P3 methylation level. In conclusion, CD133 expression in neuroblastoma can be regulated by histone acetylation and/or methylation of its CpG promoters. VPA can induce CD133+ cells which display high proliferation potential and low sensitivity to cytostatics in neuroblastoma. These results give new insight into the possible limitations to use VPA in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2519403883,"CD4+ T helper 9 (Th9) cells are a newly discovered Th cell subset that produce the pleiotropic cytokine IL-9. Th9 cells can protect against tumors and provide resistance against helminth infections. Given their pivotal role in the adaptive immune system, understanding Th9 cell development and the regulation of IL-9 production could open novel immunotherapeutic opportunities. The Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1; gene name Slc9α1)) is critically important for regulating intracellular pH (pHi), cell volume, migration, and cell survival. The pHi influences cytokine secretion, activities of membrane-associated enzymes, ion transport, and other effector signaling molecules such as ATP and Ca2+ levels. However, whether NHE1 regulates Th9 cell development or IL-9 secretion has not yet been defined. The present study explored the role of NHE1 in Th9 cell development and function. Th cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and pHi was measured using 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) dye. NHE1 functional activity was estimated from the rate of realkalinization following an ammonium pulse. Surprisingly, in Th9 cells pHi and NHE1 activity were significantly higher than in all other Th cell subsets (Th1/Th2/Th17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTregs)). NHE1 transcript levels and protein abundance were significantly higher in Th9 cells than in other Th cell subsets. Inhibition of NHE1 by siRNA-NHE1 or with cariporide in Th9 cells down-regulated IL-9 and ATP production. NHE1 activity, Th9 cell development, and IL-9 production were further blunted by pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase Akt1/Akt2. Our findings reveal that Akt1/Akt2 control of NHE1 could be an important physiological regulator of Th9 cell differentiation, IL-9 secretion, and ATP production.

All major intracellular processes such as glycolysis-dependent ATP production or protein synthesis require tight regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) (36.Harguindey S. Arranz J.L. Polo Orozco J.D.

Diabetol. 2014; 13: 134PubMed Google Scholar). However, to which extent pHi and NHE activity govern Th9 cell development and function is incompletely understood. In this study, we explored pHi and NHE1 activity in various Th cell subsets. We found that Th9 cells potently up-regulate pHi and NHE1 activity compared with other Th cell subsets. Furthermore, we show that regulation of NHE1 activity is dependent on Akt. Finally we reveal that, NHE1 controls the development and function of Th9 cells. In summary our data describe a novel role of NHE1 in the development and IL-9 production of Th9 cells. To characterize different Th cell subsets, naive CD4+ T cells were differentiated into Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and iTregs in the presence of defined recombinant cytokine proteins and antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm differentiation, the respective cytokines and transcription factors of particular Th cell subsets and iTregs, were measured by flow cytometry (data not shown). The results were further supported by q-RT-PCR. Th1 cells produce IFN-γ transcripts and Th2 cells produce IL-4 transcripts (data not shown). Th9 cells are the major producer of IL-9 transcripts. IL-9 transcripts were also produced, albeit to a lower extent, by Th2 and iTregs. Th17 cells mainly produced IL-17 transcripts. Induction of Foxp3 transcripts were only associated with iTregs. These results confirmed that our naive T cells were correctly differentiated into various Th cell subsets and iTregs. Transcript levels of NHE1 were quantified in Th cell subsets and iTregs by q-RT-PCR. NHE1 mRNA transcript levels were significantly higher in Th9 cells than in Th0, other Th cell subsets (Th1, Th2, and Th17), and iTregs (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting revealed that the differences in NHE1 transcript levels were paralleled by differences in NHE1 protein abundance (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Again, Th9 cells expressed the highest amount NHE1 protein. To test whether enhanced NHE1 expression in Th9 cells resulted in enhanced Na+/H+ exchanger activity and pHi, cytosolic pHi was estimated from (2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) fluorescence using fluorescence optics. We found that Th0, Th2, and iTregs had similar pHi values (Fig. 2, A and B). To our surprise, Th1 cells had the lowest pHi when compared with all other Th cell subsets including iTregs (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, Th9 had significantly higher pHi than all other Th cell subsets (Fig. 2, A and B). Na+/H+ exchanger activity was measured utilizing the ammonium pulse technique. In this method, addition of 20 mm NH4Cl (replacing NaCl in the superfusate) was followed by NH3 entry into the cells with subsequent transient cytosolic alkalinization due to binding of H+ to NH3 thus forming NH4+. Subsequent removal of NH4Cl was followed by cytosolic acidification due to NH3 exit with cytosolic dissociation of NH4+ and retention of H+. In the absence of Na+, realkalinization was negligible in all Th cell subsets. Thus, none of the Th cell subsets expressed an appreciable Na+-independent H+ extruding transport system. However, the subsequent addition of Na+ was followed by rapid cytosolic realkalinization, an observation pointing to Na+/H+ exchanger activity (Fig. 2, A and C). Na+/H+ exchanger activity was significantly higher in Th9 cells than in any other Th cell subsets (Fig. 2, A and C). Na+/H+ exchanger activity in Th9 cells was abrogated in the presence of the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggested NHE1 could be involved in development or function of Th9 cells. Elevated pHi is implicated in neoplastic transformation in response to overexpression of proton transporters and different oncogenes. Oncogenes take advantage of NHE-1-induced cellular alkalinization to produce a unique cancer-specific regulation (36.Harguindey S. Arranz J.L. Polo Orozco J.D. Rauch C. Fais S. Cardone R.A.

The patients included 527 with sinus rhythm, 32 with persistent AF (duration >7 days, n = 32) and 28 with paroxysmal AF (duration <7 days, n = 28).Patients with AF were older and had a greater prevalence of heart failure than patients in sinus rhythm.

In more than half of these patients, the hearing loss is associated with genetic causes. In Japan, genetic testing for the patients with SNHL using the Invader assay to screen for 46 mutations in 13 deafness genes was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for inclusion in social health insurance coverage in 2012. Furthermore, from August 2015, this genetic testing has been expanded to screen for 154 mutations in 19 deafness genes using targeted genomic enrichment with massively parallel DNA sequencing combined with the Invader assay and TaqMan genotyping. For this study we analyzed 717 unrelated Japanese hearing loss patients. The total allele frequency of 154 mutations in 19 deafness genes was 32.64% (468/1434) and the total numbers of cases associated with at least one mutation was 44.07% (316/717). Among these, we were able to diagnose 212 (30%) patients, indicating that the present screening could efficiently identify causative mutations in hearing loss patients. It is noteworthy that 27 patients (3.8%) had coexistent multiple mutations in different genes. Five of these 27 patients (0.7%, 5/717 overall) were diagnosed with genetic hearing loss affected by concomitant with responsible mutations in more than two different genes. For patients identified with multiple mutations in different genes, it is necessary to consider that several genes might have an impact on their phenotypes."

We found that working memory is impaired in forebrain-specific Perk knockout and pharmacologically PERK-inhibited mice. Moreover, inhibition of PERK in wild-type mice mimics the fear extinction impairment observed in forebrain-specific Perk knockout mice. Our findings reveal a novel role of PERK in cognitive functions and suggest that PERK regulates both Ca2+ -dependent working memory and protein synthesis-dependent memory flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2519436393,"Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) is a leading cause of diarrhea. The disease is triggered by pathogen invasion into the gut epithelium. Invasion is attributed to the SPI-1 type 3 secretion system (T1). T1 injects effector proteins into epithelial cells and thereby elicits rearrangements of the host cellular actin cytoskeleton and pathogen invasion. The T1 effector proteins SopE, SopB, SopE2 and SipA are contributing to this. However, the host cell factors contributing to invasion are still not completely understood. To address this question comprehensively, we used Hela tissue culture cells, a genome-wide siRNA library, a modified gentamicin protection assay and S. TmSipA, a sopBsopE2sopE mutant which strongly relies on the T1 effector protein SipA to invade host cells. We found that S. TmSipA invasion does not elicit membrane ruffles, nor promote the entry of non-invasive bacteria ""in trans"". However, SipA-mediated infection involved the SPIRE family of actin nucleators, besides well-established host cell factors (WRC, ARP2/3, RhoGTPases, COPI). Stage-specific follow-up assays and knockout fibroblasts indicated that SPIRE1 and SPIRE2 are involved in different steps of the S. Tm infection process. Whereas SPIRE1 interferes with bacterial binding, SPIRE2 influences intracellular replication of S. Tm. Hence, these two proteins might fulfill non-redundant functions in the pathogen-host interaction. The lack of co-localization hints to a short, direct interaction between S. Tm and SPIRE proteins or to an indirect effect."

In detail, we show that the expression of ppGalNAc-T13 was dramatically up-regulated during early neurogenesis in mouse embryonic brains. Similar changes were also observed in cell models of neuronal differentiation by using either primary mouse cortical neural precursor cells or murine embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. Knockout of ppGalNAc-T13 in P19 cells suppressed not only neural induction but also neuronal differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2520932666,"Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase M (Endo-M), an endoglycosidase from the fungus Mucor hiemalis, is a useful tool for chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycoconjugates, including glycoprotein-based therapeutics having a precisely defined glycoform, by virtue of its transglycosylation activity. Although Endo-M has been known to act on various N-glycans, it does not act on core-fucosylated N-glycans, which exist widely in mammalian glycoproteins, thus limiting its application. Therefore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on Endo-M to isolate mutant enzymes that are able to act on mammalian-type core-α1,6-fucosylated glycans. Among the Endo-M mutant enzymes generated, those in which the tryptophan at position 251 was substituted with alanine or asparagine showed altered substrate specificities. Such mutant enzymes exhibited increased hydrolysis of a synthetic α1,6-fucosylated trimannosyl core structure, whereas their activity on the afucosylated form decreased. In addition, among the Trp-251 mutants, the W251N mutant was most efficient in hydrolyzing the core-fucosylated substrate. W251N mutants could act on the immunoglobulin G-derived core-fucosylated glycopeptides and human lactoferrin glycoproteins. This mutant was also capable of transferring the sialyl glycan from an activated substrate intermediate (sialyl glyco-oxazoline) onto an α1,6-fucosyl-N-acetylglucosaminyl biotin. Furthermore, the W251N mutant gained a glycosynthase-like activity when a N175Q substitution was introduced and it caused accumulation of the transglycosylation products. These findings not only give insights into the substrate recognition mechanism of glycoside hydrolase family 85 enzymes but also widen their scope of application in preparing homogeneous glycoforms of core-fucosylated glycoproteins for the production of potent glycoprotein-based therapeutics."

So far, the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has hardly been reported. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death in children worldwide and a substantial proportion of childhood CAP is caused by viruses. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of virus infection is important for the clinical management of CAP. In this study, we explored the GeXP assay for simultaneous detection of 20 types/subtypes of viruses in hospitalized children with CAP. A total of 1699 nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and viral nucleic acid was extracted and assayed. Using viral genomic DNA or RNA as template, we showed that at the concentration of 104 copies of DNA or RNA of each virus/μl, all 20 target viruses were simultaneously identified by the GeXP assay. Fifteen control microorganisms, in contrast, failed to be amplified by the assay. About 65% of cases tested in this study had viral infection, with patients aged <3 years having a 70% positive rate, significantly higher than that in patients aged > 3 years (40%). The most frequently detected virus was RSV followed by PIV3, HRV, ADV and HBoV. Seasonal distribution analysis revealed that RSV was the most predominant in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages. One hundred twenty randomly-chosen samples tested by the GeXP assay were re-evaluated by mono-RT-PCR, the results showed 97.5% diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods. Our findings suggest that the GeXP assay could be a valuable diagnostic tool for virus infection in pediatric patients with CAP."

We use data from a population-based study of colorectal cancer (CRC), where we have previously shown associations between TL and TERT and CRC, to test associations between TL and miRNA expression and TERT and miRNA expression. To gain insight into functions of miRNAs associated with TERT we tested linear associations between miRNAs and their targeted gene mRNAs. An Agilent platform that contained information on over 2000 miRNAs was used. TL was measured using a multiplexed quantitative PCR (qPCR). RNAseq was used to assess gene expression. Our sample consisted of 1152 individuals with SNP data and miRNA expression data; 363 individuals with both TL and miRNA; and 148 individuals with miRNA and mRNA data. Thirty-three miRNAs were directly associated with TL after adjusting for age and sex (false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05). TERT rs2736118 was associated with differences in miRNA expression between carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa for 75 miRNAs (FDR <0.05). Genes regulated by these miRNAs, as indicated by mRNA/miRNA associations, were associated with major signaling pathways beyond their TL-related functions, including PTEN, and PI3K/AKT signaling. Our data support a direct association between miRNAs and TL; differences in miRNA expression levels by TERT genotype were observed. Based on miRNA and targeted mRNA associations our data suggest that TERT is involved in non-TL-related functions by acting through altered miRNA expression."

Two groups of participants were recruited: one group of participants who regularly practised sports activities (active group, n = 17), and one group of participants who did not practise physical and/or sports activities (non-active group, n = 17). They were compared in a reference condition (i.e bipedal stance with eyes open) and four vestibular manipulation condition (i.e. GVS at 0.5 mA and 3 mA, in accordance with two designs) lasting 20 seconds. The centre of foot pressure displacement velocities were compared between the two groups. The main results indicate that the regular practice of sports activities counteracts postural control disruption caused by GVS. The active group demonstrated better postural control than the non-active group when subjected to higher vestibular manipulation. The active group may have developed their ability to reduce the influence of inaccurate vestibular signals. The active participants could identify the relevant sensory input, thought a better central integration, which enables them to switch faster between sensory inputs."

https://openalex.org/W2520525758,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i (LGMD2i) affects thousands of lives with shortened life expectancy mainly due to cardiac and respiratory problems and difficulty with ambulation significantly compromising quality of life. Limited studies have noted impaired gait in patients and animal models of different muscular dystrophies, but not in animal models of LGMD2i. Our goal, therefore, was to quantify gait metrics in the fukutin-related protein P448L mutant (P448L) mouse, a recently developed model for LGMD2i. The Noldus CatWalk XT motion capture system was used to identify multiple gait impairments. An average galloping body speed of 35 cm/s for both P448L and C57BL/6 wild-type mice was maintained to ensure differences in gait were due only to strain physiology. Compared to wild-type mice, P448L mice reach maximum contact 10% faster and have 40% more paw surface area during stance. Additionally, force intensity at the time of maximum paw contact is roughly 2-fold higher in P448L mice. Paw swing time is reduced in P448L mice without changes in stride length as a faster swing speed compensates. Gait instability in P448L mice is indicated by 50% higher instances of 3 and 4 paw stance support and conversely, 2-fold fewer instances of single paw stance support and no instance of zero paw support. This leads to lower variation of normal step patterns used and a higher use of uncommon step patterns. Similar anomalies have also been noted in muscular dystrophy patients due to weakness in the hip abductor muscles, producing a Trendelenburg gait characterized by ""waddling"" and more pronounced shifts to the stance leg. Thus, gait of P448L mice replicates anomalies commonly seen in LGMD2i patients, which is not only potentially valuable for assessing drug efficacy in restoring movement biomechanics, but also for better understanding them."
https://openalex.org/W2520100905,"In resting platelets, the integrin αIIbβ3 is present in a low-affinity ""bent"" state. During platelet aggregation, intracytoplasmic signals induce conformational changes (inside-out signaling) that result in a ""swung-out"" conformation competent to bind ligands such as fibrinogen. The cytoskeleton plays an essential role in αIIbβ3 activation. We investigated the role of the actin interacting protein Wdr1 in αIIbβ3 activation. Wdr1-hypomorphic mice had a prolonged bleeding time (> 10 minutes) compared to that of wild-type mice (2.1 ± 0.7 minutes). Their platelets had impaired aggregation to collagen and thrombin. In a FeCl3 induced carotid artery thrombosis model, vessel occlusion in Wdr1-hypomorphic mice was prolonged significantly compared to wild-type mice (9.0 ± 10.5 minutes versus 5.8 ± 12.6 minutes (p = 0.041). Activation-induced binding of JON/A (a conformation-specific antibody to activated αIIbβ3) was significantly less in Wdr1-hypomorphic platelets at various concentrations of collagen, indicating impaired inside-out activation of αIIbβ3, despite a normal calcium response. Actin turnover, assessed by measuring F-actin and G-actin ratios during collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, was highly impaired in Wdr1-hypomorphic platelets. Furthermore, talin failed to redistribute and translocate to the cytoskeleton following activation in Wdr1-hypomorphic platelets. These studies show that Wdr1 is essential for talin-induced activation of αIIbβ3 during platelet activation."

We selected three chemotherapy drugs, including methotrexate, mitomycine C and vincristine to inhibit the proliferation of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells in S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle respectively. These chemotherapy drugs showed significant toxicity and growth inhibition to the cancer cells measured by MTT assay. After treated with a 50% inhibitory dosage for 48 hours, these cancer cells showed significant accumulation of cardiolipin (CL), which was a reverse trend of the nutritional deficiency induced arrest at G1 phase. The quantity of each CL species was further semi-quantitated by HPLC-ion trap mass spectrometer. Methotraxate treatment caused unique increases of acyl chain length on CL, which were the opposite of the serum starvation, mitomycine C and vincristine treatments. Although mitomycine C and vincristine have different mechanisms to induce cell cycle arrest, these two drugs displayed similar effects on decreasing chain length of CL. Continuation of CL synthesis during cell cycle arrest indicated the chemotherapy drugs resulting in the discoordination of the mitochondrial life cycle from the cell cycle and thus caused the accumulation of CL. These finding reveals that the pre-remodeling nascent CL accumulates during the methotraxate induced arrest; however, the post-remodeling mature CL accumulates during the mitomycine C and vincristine induced arrest after the synthesis phase."
https://openalex.org/W2519525375,"MicroRNAs constitute a major post-transcriptional mechanism for controlling protein expression, and are emerging as key regulators during T cell development and function. Recent reports of augmented CD8 T cell activation and effector differentiation, and aberrant migratory properties upon ablation of Dicer/miRNAs in naïve cells have established a regulatory role of miRNAs during priming. Whether miRNAs continue to exert similar functions or are dispensable during later stages of CD8 T cell expansion and memory differentiation remains unclear. Here, we report a critical role of Dicer/miRNAs in regulating the balance of long-lived memory and short-lived terminal effector fates during the post-priming stages when CD8 T cells undergo clonal expansion to generate a large cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pool and subsequently differentiate into a quiescent memory state. Conditional ablation of Dicer/miRNAs in early effector CD8 T cells following optimal activation and expression of granzyme B, using unique dicerfl/fl gzmb-cre mice, led to a strikingly diminished peak effector size relative to wild-type antigen-specific cells in the same infectious milieu. Diminished expansion of Dicer-ablated CD8 T cells was associated with lack of sustained antigen-driven proliferation and reduced accumulation of short-lived effector cells. Additionally, Dicer-ablated CD8 T cells exhibited more pronounced contraction after pathogen clearance and comprised a significantly smaller proportion of the memory pool, despite significantly higher proportions of CD127Hi memory precursors at the effector peak. Combined with previous reports of dynamic changes in miRNA expression as CD8 T cells differentiate from naïve to effector and memory states, these findings support distinct stage-specific roles of miRNA-dependent gene regulation during CD8 T cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2519272107,"“Predecisional information distortion” occurs when decision makers evaluate new information in a way that is biased towards their leading option. The phenomenon is well established, as is the method typically used to measure it, termed “stepwise evolution of preference” (SEP). An inadequacy of this method has recently come to the fore: it measures distortion as the total advantage afforded a leading option over its competitor, and therefore it cannot differentiate between distortion to strengthen a leading option (“proleader” distortion) and distortion to weaken a trailing option (“antitrailer” distortion). To address this, recent research introduced new response scales to SEP. We explore whether and how these new response scales might influence the very proleader and antitrailer processes that they were designed to capture (“reactivity”). We used the SEP method with concurrent verbal reporting: fifty family physicians verbalized their thoughts as they evaluated patient symptoms and signs (“cues”) in relation to two competing diagnostic hypotheses. Twenty-five physicians evaluated each cue using the response scale traditional to SEP (a single response scale, returning a single measure of distortion); the other twenty-five did so using the response scales introduced in recent studies (two separate response scales, returning two separate measures of distortion: proleader and antitrailer). We measured proleader and antitrailer processes in verbalizations, and compared verbalizations in the single-scale and separate-scales groups. Response scales did not appear to affect proleader processes: the two groups of physicians were equally likely to bolster their leading diagnosis verbally. Response scales did, however, appear to affect antitrailer processes: the two groups denigrated their trailing diagnosis verbally to differing degrees. Our findings suggest that the response scales used to measure information distortion might influence its constituent processes, limiting their generalizability across and beyond experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2520000823,"Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a severe disease that is caused by maternal alloantibodies generated during pregnancy or at delivery as a result of incompatibility between maternal and fetal human platelet antigens (HPAs) inherited from the father. Antibody-mediated immune suppression using anti-HPA-1a immunoglobulins is thought to be able to prevent FNAIT caused by HPA-1a. A fractionation process to prepare anti-HPA-1a immunoglobulin (Ig) G (IgG) from human plasma was therefore developed. Anti-HPA-1a plasma was obtained from volunteer mothers who underwent alloimmunization against HPA-1a during a previous pregnancy. Plasma was cryoprecipitated and the supernatant treated with caprylic acid and solvent/detergent (S/D), purified by chromatography, nanofiltered, concentrated, and sterile-filtered. The anti-HPA-1a immunoglobulin fraction was characterized for purity and safety. PAK12 and quantitative monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigen (MAIPA) assays were used to detect anti-HPA-1a IgG. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) removal during nanofiltration was assessed by spiking experiments, using cell culture-derived reporter HCV and luciferase analysis. The caprylic acid treatment precipitated non-Ig proteins yielding a 90% pure Ig supernatant. S-HyperCel chromatography of the S/D-treated supernatant followed by HyperCel STAR AX provided high IgG recovery (>80%) and purity (>99.5%), and efficient IgA and IgM removal. Concentrations of complement factors C3 and C4 were < 0.5 and < 0.4 mg/dL, respectively. The final IgG could be nanofiltered on Planova 20N under conditions removing more than 3 log HCV infectivity to baseline mock infection level, and concentrated to ca. 30 g/L. Proteolytic activity and thrombin generation were low in the final fraction. The Pak12 and MAIPA assays showed good recovery of anti-HPA-1a throughout the process. Clinical-grade HPA-1a IgG can be prepared using a process compliant with current quality requirements opening perspectives for the prevention of FNAIT."
