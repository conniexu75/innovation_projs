https://openalex.org/W2028474222,"The quantal release of glutamate depends on its transport into synaptic vesicles. Recent work has shown that a protein previously implicated in the uptake of inorganic phosphate across the plasma membrane catalyzes glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles. However, only a subset of glutamate neurons expresses this vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1). We now report that excitatory neurons lacking VGLUT1 express a closely related protein that has also been implicated in phosphate transport. Like VGLUT1, this protein localizes to synaptic vesicles and functions as a vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2). The complementary expression of VGLUT1 and 2 defines two distinct classes of excitatory synapse."

One prominent theory posits that LIPC does not mediate semantic retrieval per se, but rather subserves the selection of task-relevant knowledge from amidst competing knowledge. The present event-related fMRI study provides evidence for an alternative hypothesis: LIPC guides controlled semantic retrieval irrespective of whether retrieval requires selection against competing representations. With selection demands held constant, LIPC activation increased with semantic retrieval demands and with the level of control required during retrieval. LIPC mediates a top-down bias signal that is recruited to the extent that the recovery of meaning demands controlled retrieval. Selection may reflect a specific instantiation of this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1573826674,"Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is an abundant, largely cytosolic enzyme that scavenges superoxide anions. The biological role of SOD1 is somewhat controversial because superoxide is thought to arise largely from the mitochondria where a second SOD (manganese SOD) already resides. Using bakers' yeast as a model, we demonstrate that Cu,Zn-SOD1 helps protect mitochondria from oxidative damage, as sod1Delta mutants show elevated protein carbonyls in this organelle. In accordance with this connection to mitochondria, a fraction of active SOD1 localizes within the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria together with its copper chaperone, CCS. Neither CCS nor SOD1 contains typical N-terminal presequences for mitochondrial uptake; however, the mitochondrial accumulation of SOD1 is strongly influenced by CCS. When CCS synthesis is repressed, mitochondrial SOD1 is of low abundance, and conversely IMS SOD1 is very high when CCS is largely mitochondrial. The mitochondrial form of SOD1 is indeed protective against oxidative damage because yeast cells enriched for IMS SOD1 exhibit prolonged survival in the stationary phase, an established marker of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Cu,Zn-SOD1 in the mitochondria appears important for reactive oxygen physiology and may have critical implications for SOD1 mutations linked to the fatal neurodegenerative disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2166530541,"Neurotrophin regulation of actin-dependent changes in growth cone motility may depend on the signaling of β-actin mRNA transport. Formation of an RNP complex between the β-actin mRNA zipcode sequence and Zipcode Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1) was required for its localization to growth cones. Antisense oligonucleotides to the zipcode inhibited formation of this RNP complex in vitro and the neurotrophin-induced localization of β-actin mRNA and ZBP1 granules. Live cell imaging of neurons transfected with EGFP-ZBP1 revealed fast, bidirectional movements of granules in neurites that were inhibited by antisense treatment, as visualized by FRAP analysis. NT-3 stimulation of β-actin protein localization was dependent on the 3′UTR and inhibited by antisense treatment. Growth cones exhibited impaired motility in the presense of antisense. These results suggest a novel mechanism to influence growth cone dynamics involving the regulated transport of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2020799083,"The PSD-95/SAP90 family of scaffold proteins organizes the postsynaptic density (PSD) and regulates NMDA receptor signaling at excitatory synapses. We report that SPAR, a Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP), interacts with the guanylate kinase-like domain of PSD-95 and forms a complex with PSD-95 and NMDA receptors in brain. In heterologous cells, SPAR reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and recruits PSD-95 to F-actin. In hippocampal neurons, SPAR localizes to dendritic spines and causes enlargement of spine heads, many of which adopt an irregular appearance with putative multiple synapses. Dominant negative SPAR constructs cause narrowing and elongation of spines. The effects of SPAR on spine morphology depend on the RapGAP and actin-interacting domains, implicating Rap signaling in the regulation of postsynaptic structure."
https://openalex.org/W1496461152,The exact roles and abilities of the individual components of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor complex of proteins remain unclear. MD-2 is a molecule found in association with toll-like receptor 4. We produced recombinant human MD-2 to explore its LPS binding ability and role in the LPS receptor complex. MD-2 binds to highly purified rough LPS derived from Salmonella minnesota and Escherichia coli in five different assays; one assay yielded an apparent KD of 65 nm. MD-2 binding to LPS did not require LPS-binding proteins LBP and CD14; in fact LBP competed with MD-2 for LPS. MD-2 enhanced the biological activity of LPS in toll-like receptor 4-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells but inhibited LPS activation of U373 astrocytoma cells and of monocytes in human whole blood. These data indicate that MD-2 is a genuine LPS-binding protein and strongly suggest that MD-2 could play a role in regulation of cellular activation by LPS depending on its local availability.
https://openalex.org/W1970795696,"Distinct classes of neurons are generated from progenitor cells distributed in characteristic dorsoventral patterns in the developing spinal neural tube. We define restricted neural progenitor populations by the discrete, nonoverlapping expression of Ngn1, Math1, and Mash1. Crossinhibition between these bHLH factors is demonstrated and provides a mechanism for the generation of discrete bHLH expression domains. This precise control of bHLH factor expression is essential for proper neural development since as demonstrated in both loss- and gain-of-function experiments, expression of Math1 or Ngn1 in dorsal progenitor cells determines whether LH2A/B- or dorsal Lim1/2-expressing interneurons will develop. Together, the data suggest that although Math1 and Ngn1 appear to be redundant with respect to neurogenesis, they have distinct functions in specifying neuronal subtype in the dorsal neural tube."
https://openalex.org/W2069262764,"Giant vesicles were used to study the rates of uptake of long-chain fatty acids by heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue of obese and lean Zucker rats. With obesity there was an increase in vesicular fatty acid uptake of 1.8-fold in heart, muscle and adipose tissue. In some tissues only fatty acid translocase (FAT) mRNA (heart, +37%; adipose, +80%) and fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) mRNA (heart, +148%; adipose, +196%) were increased. At the protein level FABPpm expression was not changed in any tissues except muscle (+14%), and FAT/CD36 protein content was altered slightly in adipose tissue (+26%). In marked contrast, the plasma membrane FAT/CD36 protein was increased in heart (+60%), muscle (+80%), and adipose tissue (+50%). The plasma membrane FABPpm was altered only in heart (+50%) and adipose tissues (+70%). Thus, in obesity, alterations in fatty acid transport in metabolically important tissues are not associated with changes in fatty acid transporter mRNAs or altered fatty acid transport protein expression but with their increased abundance at the plasma membrane. We speculate that in obesity fatty acid transporters are relocated from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane in heart, muscle, and adipose tissues.

Based on their hydrophobic structure it has been postulated that FA are sequestered by cells through passive diffusion across the plasma membrane (cf. Ref. 1Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other evidence has shown that FA also traverse the plasma membrane via a protein-mediated mechanism (cf.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a number of groups began to search for FA transport proteins. Several putative fatty acid transport proteins have been identified that promote the cellular uptake of FA. These are a 43-kDa plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) (7Isola L.M. Zhou S.L. Kiang C.L. Stump D.D. Bradbury M.W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2646-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, to these membrane-associated proteins, a soluble cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding protein (FABPc) is also important for cellular FA uptake, because in FABPc null mice there is a marked decrease of FA influx into cardiac myocytes (11Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). FATP1, another putative fatty acid transport protein (12Hirsch D.

Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), correlates inversely with fatty acid transport in muscle and heart (4Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this protein appears to be a very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (14Coe R. Johnston-Smith A. Frohnert B.I.

These observations suggest that FATP1 is unlikely to be involved directly in fatty acid translocation across the plasma membrane. To examine the regulation of transmembrane fatty acid transport, we have characterized giant vesicles (4Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J.

With giant vesicles we have shown that fatty acid transport can be increased (a) when the number of FAT/CD36 transport proteins are increased over the course of several days (23Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar) or (b) when the FAT/CD36 protein is translocated, within minutes, from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (17Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P.

It is becoming increasingly evident that disorders in lipid metabolism are an important factor contributing to the etiology of a number of common human diseases such as diabetes and obesity (cf. Ref.24Kelley D.A. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Our evidence that protein-mediated FA uptake is a rate-limiting step in lipid metabolism allows the attractive speculation that malfunctioning of the FA uptake process could be a common critical factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The obese Zucker rat, a widely used rodent model for obesity and insulin resistance, has a mutation in the gene encoding the receptor for leptin. Homozygosity for this mutation is responsible for alterations in body lipid homeostasis resulting in the accumulation of body fat mass (25Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffel M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar). Recent studies using obese Zucker rats (19Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and other rodent models of obesity (26Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L.

Feingold K.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown tissue-specific changes in FA transporters at the mRNA and FA utilization levels (i.e. fatty acid uptake + metabolism). Up-regulation of FA utilization and transporter mRNAs in adipocytes of obese Zucker rats occur early in life preceding peripheral insulin resistance and obesity, suggesting that accumulation of FA transporters in the plasma membrane of adipocytes may be a critical step leading to obesity (19Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, these changes in the accumulation of transporters measured at the mRNA level only (19Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Fan X. Bradbury M. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) do not provide evidence that similar changes are occurring either at the protein level or in FA uptake across the plasma membrane (vesicular FA transport). Measurements of FA uptake in isolated cell systems are confounded by the subsequent rapid activation of FA to their CoA esters (19Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Fan X. Bradbury M. J. Biol.

Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F.C. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) suggests that in addition to determining the total amount of FA transporters, their subcellular localization also needs to be considered so as to link properly the involvement of FA transporters with FA uptake rates. Therefore, to examine tissue-specific changes in vesicular fatty acid transport and the subcellular location of FA transporters in obese Zucker rats: (a) we examined the levels of the two functionally important FA transporters (FAT/CD36 and FABPpm), both at the mRNA and protein level, as well as FABPc in metabolically important tissues (heart, muscle, adipose tissue); (b) we measured FA uptake rates in these tissues using giant vesicles in which FA uptake can be measured in the complete absence of FA metabolism; and (c) because giant vesicles have been proven suitable representatives of the plasma membrane (17Bonen A.

Rev. 1997; 77: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we used these vesicles to provide information on the plasmalemmal localization of FA transporters. Our studies demonstrate that in obesity vesicular FA uptake rates are markedly increased, but this is generally not associated with concomitant changes in the expression of fatty acid transporters. Instead, the increases in fatty acid transport are associated with changes in plasmalemmal fatty acid transporters. [9,10-3H]palmitate (American RadioChemicals, St. Louis, MO) and [14C]mannitol (ICN, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) were purchased from commercial sources. Collagenase type II was from Worthington, and collagenase 2a and collagenase VII were from Sigma-Aldrich. Fat-free bovine serum albumin was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Female obese (fa/fa) and lean (fa/+) Zucker rats were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). At 3 months of age, they were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Somnotol. Subsequently, hind limb muscle, epididymal adipose tissue, and heart were removed for FA uptake studies and for determination of FA transporters. Blood samples were collected into NaF/heparinized microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge. Plasma was then separated from red blood cells and stored at −80 °C until use. Glucose was determined by a spectrophotometric method (Sigma-Aldrich). Insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay using a rat-specific antibody (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Plasma fatty acids and triacylglycerols were determined using spectrophotometric procedures (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA, and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively). Giant vesicles from skeletal muscle and heart were isolated as described previously (4Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F.C. Tandon N.N. J. Biol.

Briefly, all of the tissues were cut into thin layers (1–3 mm thick) and incubated for 1 h at 34 °C in 140 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), aprotinin (10 mg/ml), and collagenase in a shaking water bath. Collagenase type VII (150 units/ml) was used for muscle tissue, collagenase type II (0.3%, w/v) was used for heart, and collagenase type 2a (0.05%, w/v) was used for adipose tissue. At the end of the incubation, the supernatant was collected, and the remaining tissue was washed with KCl/MOPS and 10 mm EDTA, which resulted in a second supernatant. Both supernatant fractions were pooled, and Percoll and aprotinin were added to final concentrations of 16% (v/v) and 10 mg/ml, respectively. The resulting suspension was placed at the bottom of a density gradient consisting of a 3-ml middle layer of 4% Nycodenz (w/v) and a 1-ml KCl/MOPS upper layer. This sample was centrifuged at 60 ×g for 45 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the vesicles were harvested from the interface of the upper and middle layers, diluted in KCl/MOPS, and recentrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. In case of skeletal muscle, the pellet was resuspended in KCl/MOPS to a protein concentration of 2–3 mg/ml, in case of the other tissues, the pellet was resuspended to a protein concentration of 0.4–0.8 mg/ml. Palmitate uptake studies were performed as we have described previously (4Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J.

Briefly, 40 µl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in KCl/MOPS containing unlabeled (15 µm) and radiolabeled 0.3 µCi of [3H]palmitate and 0.06 µCi of [14C]mannitol were added to 40 µl of vesicle suspension. The incubation was carried out for 15 s. Palmitate uptake was terminated by the addition of 1.4 ml of ice-cold KCl/MOPS, 2.5 mm HgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The sample was then quickly centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and radioactivity was determined in the tip of the tube.

The contents of heart-type cytoplasmic FABP (H-FABPc) in homogenates and giant vesicles from heart and skeletal muscles were determined by a sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (35Vork M.M.

Because of the unavailability of the appropriate antibody we were not able to determine the adipocyte lipid binding protein (A-LBP), the predominant FABPc in adipose tissue. Giant vesicles were prepared from heart, muscle and adipose tissue from lean rats and obese Zucker rats. These were overlain with a scaling grid and were then photographed through a phase contrast microscope. Vesicle diameter sizes were determined from these photographs. The data were analyzed using analyses of variance. All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Zucker obese rats had a markedly greater (1.7-fold) body weight than their lean counterparts (Table I). Their hearts were slightly (1.3-fold) but significantly enlarged. This increase in mass is likely due to cellular hypertrophy rather than to hyperplasia for the heart (37Duarte J. Martinez A. Bermejo A. Vera B. Gamez M.J. Cabo P. Zarzuelo A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue exhibited the most prominent increase in mass as exemplified by the more than 4-fold increase in the amount of epididymal fat. This mass increase is known to be caused by increases in both cell size and cell number (38Marques B.G. Hausman D.B. Martin R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1898-R1908PubMed Google Scholar).

The circulating FA and triacylglycerols concentrations were 1.9-fold and 6.6-fold higher in the obese Zucker rats. They were also insulin resistant, as indicated by the 4.1-fold higher insulin concentrations but unaltered plasma glucose concentration (Table I). All these results (Table I), are consistent with previous reports concerning this rat model of obesity (39Murakami K. Tobe K. Ide T. Mochizuki T. Ohashi M. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T.

The ratio of plasma membrane protein/total protein in lean and obese animals did not differ in either heart, muscle or adipose tissue (data not shown). The presence of FABPc in the intravesicular lumen is a prerequisite for uptake of FA by giant vesicles, because these proteins act as a FA sink. In heart and muscle, the predominant FABPc isoform is the heart (H)-type FABPc (4Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we have observed previously (4Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), H-FABPc is more abundant in giant vesicles from heart than from muscle (Table II).

To relate the emergence of sensory maps to synaptogenesis, we recorded synaptic potentials evoked by whisker deflection in layer 2/3 neurons from postnatal day (P) 12 to 20. At P12, synaptic responses were undetectable. Only 2 days later in life (P14), receptive fields had mature organization. Sensory deprivation, if initiated before P14, disrupted receptive field structure. In layer 4, responses and maps were already mature by P12 and insensitive to deprivation, implying that barrel cortex develops from layer 4 to layer 2/3. Thus, P12-14 is a critical period shared by layer 2/3 synapses and their spines, suggesting that spine plasticity is involved in the refinement of maps."

Using mRNA from oxysterol-treated human THP-1 cells together with 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and polymerase chain reaction, we identified a novel ABCG1 transcript that encodes a putative protein of 786 residues containing a new amino terminus of 203 amino acids. Characterization of the genomic organization and structure of the human ABCG1 gene demonstrates that: (i) the gene consists of 23 exons spanning 98 kilobase pairs (kb) on chromosome 21q22.3, (ii) the 203 amino acids are encoded on three previously unidentified exons, 8–10, and (iii) a promoter, containing a TATA box and two liver X receptor (LXR) α response elements (LXREs), is located upstream of exon 8. Northern analysis using exon-specific probes confirms that oxysterol treatment results in >10-fold induction of ABCG1 transcripts that are derived from either exons 8–23 or exons 5, 7, and 11–23. Electromobility shift assays demonstrate that LXRα and retinoid X receptor α bind to the two LXREs in intron 7. Cells were transiently transfected with reporter luciferase constructs under the control of either (i) 9 kb of genomic DNA corresponding to intron 7 and part of exon 8 and containing either wild-type or mutant LXREs or (ii) two copies of the wild-type or mutant LXRE. In all cases, the wild-type construct was regulated in an LXR- and oxysterol-dependent manner, and this regulation was attenuated when the LXREs were mutated. In conclusion, the human ABCG1 gene contains multiple promoters, spans more than 98 kb and comprises 23 exons that give rise to alternative transcripts encoding proteins with different amino-terminal sequences.

Such macrophage foam cells are found in both fatty streaks and more advanced lesions in the artery wall and appear to be important in the development of atherosclerosis (2Gerrity R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to explore the changes in macrophage gene expression that occur during lipid loading, on the assumption that such changes effect the development of fatty streaks and/or the stability of advanced plaques. These studies led to the identification of three mRNAs, ABCG1, ABCA1, and apoE, that are highly induced when macrophages are incubated in the presence of either modified LDL or specific oxysterols (4Venkateswaran A.

ABCG1 (also referred to as human White or murine ABC8), and ABCA1 are two members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily of proteins (10Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). The ABC transporter family is large and currently is comprised of over 359 members, including 129 in Arabidopsis thaliana (13Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

ABC transporters fall into one of two broad groups: full ABC transporters, which contain two symmetrical halves, each half containing one ABC and six transmembrane domains; half transporters, which contain one ABC and six transmembrane domains, and which dimerize to form a functionally active transporter (10Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). To date, 27 full and 25 half transporters have been identified in humans (14Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Hutchinson A. Dean M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Each ABC is characterized by a conserved nucleotide binding domain comprising three motifs: a Walker A and Walker B motif (each approximately 9 amino acids in length) spaced by 90–120 amino acids, and a “signature” motif of 12 amino acids located 8 amino acids upstream of the Walker B motif (10Dean M.

The ATP-binding fold is required for the binding and hydrolysis of ATP, providing the energy for the transport activity, while the transmembrane domains determine substrate specificity (12Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). The human ABCG1 cDNA was first cloned when Chen et al. (15Chen H. Rossier C. Lalioti M.D. Lynn A. Chakravarti A.

Acta. 2000; 1494: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) used data available from an early sequencing draft of the Human Genome Project, that included sequences derived from two BAC clones (AC015555and AP001623), and reported that the entire cDNA sequence was contained on 15 exons (see Fig. 1A-II). Langmann et al. (18Langmann T. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Unkelbach U. Klucken J. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also performed 5′-RACE, using a cDNA library derived from human fetal liver and a primer corresponding to exon 7 (exon 2 in their nomenclature; see Fig. 1A) and identified a transcript that differed at the 5′ end from that reported by Chen et al. (15Chen H. Rossier C. Lalioti M.D. Lynn A. Chakravarti A. Perrin G. Antonarakis S.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 66-75PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Lorkowski et al. performed 5′-RACE with a primer corresponding to exon 7 and RNA from THP1 cells treated with LXRα and RXRα ligands and identified five new exons (19Lorkowski S. Rust S. Engel T. Jung E. Tegelkamp K. Galinski E.A. Assmann G. Cullen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (exons 1–4 and 6 in Fig. 1A-III). The latter 5′-RACE studies identified ten different transcripts that were assumed to result from alternative splicing and/or the use of four putative promoters that were postulated to be located upstream of either exon 1, 4, 5, or 6 (19Lorkowski S. Rust S. Engel T. Jung E. Tegelkamp K. Galinski E.A. Assmann G. Cullen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on these results, and the observation that there were multiple in-frame methionines in exons 1–6, Lorkowski et al. (19Lorkowski S. Rust S. Engel T. Jung E. Tegelkamp K. Galinski E.A. Assmann G. Cullen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) proposed that there might be 4–6 different ABCG1 protein isoforms that differed only in the ∼25 amino-terminal amino acids. Previous studies have led to the proposal that the nuclear receptor LXR is required for the induction of ABCG1 mRNA levels in lipid-loaded macrophages; this proposal is based on the observations that induction of ABCG1 mRNA levels (i) is enhanced when cells are incubated with LXR ligands, (ii) is stimulated when cells overexpress LXR, (iii) is attenuated when cells overexpress dominant negative forms of LXRα or LXRβ, and (iv) is attenuated in peritoneal macrophages derived from LXRα−/−, LXRβ−/− double knockout mice (4Venkateswaran A.

Despite these observations, neither LXREs nor other cis-elements that are involved in the oxysterol-dependent induction of ABCG1 mRNA levels have been identified.

In the current study, we identify three new exons (designated exons 8–10; see Fig. 1) in the human ABCG1 gene that are part of a transcript derived from exons 8–23. In addition, we show that this transcript encodes a novel ABCG1 isoform containing a unique amino-terminal sequence of 203 amino acids. We also identify and characterize a novel promoter that lies upstream of exon 8 and contains a TATA box and two functional LXREs. These findings identify the molecular mechanism by which oxysterols activate the human ABCG1 gene. The results suggest that ABCG1 expression, regulation, and function is complex and that identification of different ABCG1 isoforms will be important for our understanding of mammalian cholesterol homeostasis. pCMX expression plasmids for LXRα and RXRα were a gift from Ron Evans (Salk Institute). Oxysterols (Sigma), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), and the RXR-specific agonist LG 100153 (gift from Dr. Richard Heyman, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA) were dissolved in ethanol prior to the addition to cells (<1 µg/ml medium).

Poly(A)+mRNA was isolated with the mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from oxysterol-treated THP-1 macrophages.

First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH) using the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), SMART II oligonucleotide, and 5′-RACE cDNA synthesis primer (CLONTECH). 5′-RACE PCR was performed using the UPM primer (CLONTECH) and the gene-specific primer GSP1 (TableI) with Advantage 2 polymerase (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendation in a PerkinElmer GeneAmp 2400 thermocycler. The sample was then diluted 50-fold, and 2.5 µl used in nested 5′-RACE with a second gene-specific primer, NGSP1 (Table I), and the UPM primer (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCRs were performed using various gene-specific primers (see Table I) and Advantage 2 polymerase (CLONTECH). The PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 2.5 min. In vitro translated RXRα and LXRα were generated from the pCMX-RXRα and pCMX-LXRα plasmids with the TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (see Table I) were prepared and used in electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) with thein vitro translated proteins and, where indicated, anti-RXRα as described (28Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R.

The wild-type and mutant two copy LXRE TK-Luc reporter constructs (2xLXRE-1, 2xLXRE-2, 2xLXRE-1m, and 2xLXRE-2m) were generated by annealing complementary oligonucleotides (see Table I) containing BamHI overhangs and ligated into an empty TK-Luc reporter vector (29Selden R.F.

Constructs were verified by sequencing, as described above, using a TK-Luc-specific primer. The ABCG1 promoter contained within intron 7 was amplified from the BAC clone KB1430A10 by PCR using primers EV-1 and EV-4 (described in TableI). The DNA (−9318 to +167, where the first nucleotide of exon 8 is +1) was cloned into the XhoI/MluI restriction sites of the pGL3-luciferase vector (Promega) to create pG-9.3. LXRE mutant promoter constructs containing four mutations in one or both LXRE-1 and LXRE-2 were generated using the same PCR-based strategy (see Table I for primer sequences). First, a PCR product obtained with primers EV-1 (+167) and EV-2-wt or EV-2 mut (−5162) was cloned into the XhoI site of pGL3-luciferase to yield pG-5.0-wt and pG-5.0-mut, respectively. Next, the PCR product obtained with primers EV-5 (−5163) and EV-4-wt (−9318) was cloned into pG-5.0-mut to give pGL-9.2-m1. To construct pG-9.3-m2 and pG-9.3-m1,2, the PCR product obtained with primers EV-5 (−5136) and EV-4-mut (−9318) was cloned into pG-5.0-wt and pG-5.0-mut, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2030027173,"It is not known exactly which cortical areas compute somatosensory representations of shape. This was investigated using positron emission tomography and cytoarchitectonic mapping. Volunteers discriminated shapes by passive or active touch, brush velocity, edge length, curvature, and roughness. Discrimination of shape by active touch, as opposed to passive touch, activated the right anterior lobe of cerebellum only. Areas 3b and 1 were activated by all stimuli. Area 2 was activated with preference for surface curvature changes and shape stimuli. The anterior part of the supramarginal gyrus (ASM) and the cortex lining the intraparietal sulcus (IPA) were activated by active and passive shape discrimination, but not by other mechanical stimuli. We suggest, based on these findings, that somatosensory representations of shape are computed by areas 3b, 1, 2, IPA, and ASM in this hierarchical fashion."

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) prevents cytokine-induced MMP-1 gene expression in fibroblasts. In these studies, we examined the hypothesis that repression of MMP-1 may be mediated through the Smad signaling pathway. The results showed that Smad3 and Smad4, but not Smad1 or Smad2, mimicked the inhibitory effect of TGF-β and abrogated interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced stimulation of MMP-1 promoter activity and NFκB-specific gene transcription in dermal fibroblasts. Experiments with truncation mutants indicated that both MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad3 were necessary for inhibitory activity. Dominant negative mutants of Smad3 or Smad4 and antagonistic Smad7, which disrupts ligand-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, abrogated the repression of MMP-1 transcription by TGF-β. Similar results were obtained using immunoblot and Northern analysis. Furthermore, TGF-β failed to repress MMP-1 promoter activity in Smad3-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts. These results implicated cellular Smads in mediating the inhibitory effects of TGF-β. Overexpression of the transcriptional co-activator p300, but not its histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-deficient mutant, was able to relieve repression of MMP-1 gene expression, suggesting that Smad-dependent inhibition may be due to increased competition between Smad proteins and IL-1β signaling pathways for limiting amounts of cellular p300. Together, these results demonstrate that MMP-1 is a target for negative regulation by TGF-β through cellular Smad3 and Smad4. Smad-mediated repression of MMP-1 gene expression may be important for preventing excessive matrix degradation induced by inflammatory cytokines; disruption of Smad signaling, as occurs in certain cancer cells, may thus be causally linked to uncontrolled tissue destruction mediated through MMP-1.

Synthesis of MMP-1 (collagenase-1), the principal enzyme mediating the turnover of interstitial collagen in most human tissues, is markedly enhanced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (1Borden P. Heller R.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Excessive matrix degradation is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, tumor invasion, and periodontitis. It is not surprising therefore that MMP-1 gene expression is under tight control through regulation of its promoter activity and mRNA stability. Interleukin-1β, one of the most potent physiological inducers of MMP-1 production, stimulates MMP-1 gene expression via c-jun and c-fos, which recognize conserved AP-1 binding elements (2Karin M. J.

Kier A.B Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar). The diverse cellular responses elicited by TGF-β are triggered by activation of serine/threonine kinase TGF-β receptors and mediated through multiple cellular signal transduction pathways. TGF-β receptors propagate signals downstream through direct interaction with cytoplasmic Smads, and possibly other proteins as well (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Vertebrate Smads can be grouped into three structurally and functionally distinct classes (14Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Receptor-activated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) are directly phosphorylated by activated TGF-β receptors and form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 that translocate into the nucleus and modulate the transcription of target genes (15Zawel L.

In many TGF-β-regulated genes, Smad-binding sequences are located adjacent to AP-1 recognition sites (17Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Although transcriptional responses can result from direct Smad binding to DNA, more commonly functional interaction of Smads with transcriptional co-factors and coactivators or co-repressors is required. In mink lung epithelial cells, a physical interaction of Smad3 with c-junresults in synergistic stimulation of MMP-1 transcription (21Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Smad7, a structurally and functionally divergent member of the Smad family, forms stable association with the activated TGF-β receptor complex, thereby preventing phosphorylation of Smad3 and blocking downstream TGF-β signaling (22Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 23Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). We have shown that in primary fibroblasts, Smad7 abrogated TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 promoter activity (20Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Therefore, Smad7 appears to fulfill an important function in fibroblasts as an autocrine negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. In inflammation, mesenchymal cells are targeted by distinct cytokines acting in opposition or in concert. In particular, TGF-β elicits multiple biological responses in these cells that are opposite of those induced by inflammatory mediators. For instance, inflammation-induced expression of nitric oxide synthetase, E-selectin, MMP-1, and MMP-3 are abrogated in cell type-specific manner by TGF-β (24Perella M. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.

Med. 2000; 192: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Repression of MMP-1 transcription by TGF-β in rabbit synovial fibroblasts was shown to be mediated through a sequence at −246 bp of the promoter that resembled a TGF-β inhibitory element previously identified in the rat stromelysin gene promoter (29White L. Mitchell T.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the level and mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of MMP-1 expression by IL-1β and TGF-β remain uncertain. Because both TGF-β and IL-1β are released at sites of injury and play important roles in modulating inflammatory responses, we are interested in characterizing the functional interaction between these two critical cytokines. In the present study, therefore, we examined the involvement of Smads in MMP-1 regulation by TGF-β. We now report that TGF-β abrogated the stimulation of MMP-1 transcription and protein synthesis induced by IL-1β, and overexpression of Smad3 or Smad4 mimicked this response. Inhibition of endogenous Smad signaling in the fibroblasts using dominant negative mutants of Smad3 or Smad4 prevented repression of MMP-1 by TGF-β. In Smad3-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, TGF-β failed to repress MMP-1 activity. Furthermore, Smad7, an endogenous antagonist of Smad-mediated signaling, partially abolished the negative regulation of MMP-1 promoter activity by TGF-β. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the Smad pathway of TGF-β signaling was necessary and sufficient for potent negative regulation of MMP-1 gene expression in dermal fibroblasts. Disruption of cellular Smad signaling could contribute to aberrant regulation of MMP-1 gene expression and uncontrolled matrix degradation characteristic of pathological conditions. Primary cultures of human dermal fibroblasts were established from neonatal foreskin biopsies by previously described explant techniques (20Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts were established from 14d pc Smad3−/− mice, as described previously (30Datto M.B. Frederick J. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Media were obtained from Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD); all other tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% vitamins, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine and studied between passages 4–8. When the cells reached early confluence, fresh medium containing TGF-β1 (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), IL-1β (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), or IFN-γ (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) was added to the cultures for the indicated periods. In some experiments, cycloheximide (from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml for 1 h before TGF-β or IL-1β. Viability of the cells estimated using trypan blue exclusion was >90%. For Northern analysis, total RNA was isolated from confluent fibroblasts using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and relative levels of mRNA were examined using a32P-labeled human MMP-1 cDNA probe. Following washing of the nitrocellulose membranes, the RNA-cDNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography. The filters were scanned, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager. The SBE4-luc construct contains four tandem repeats of a palindromic Smad-binding sequence (15Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). p3TP-lux contains the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 TGF-β response element and three concatamerized repeats of the MMP-1 AP-1 site (31Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors for Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 containing the CMV promoter have been previously described (21Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 23Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E.

A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Smad3A is a dominant negative mutant with three C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites changed to alanines (32Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant Smad4 was created by deletion of the C-terminal 51 amino acids required for Smad4 interaction with other Smads (32Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Terminal truncations of Smad3 were generated by restriction enzyme digestions that resulted in deletion of the first 114 (Smad3ΔN) or the last 148 (Smad3ΔC) amino acids, respectively (33Nagarajan R.P. Liu J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31229-31235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression vector for p300 contains FLAG-tagged full-length p300 in pCI, whereas p300ΔHAT contains p300 lacking the HAT domain (amino acids 1472–1522) (34Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). The C/H1 and C/H3 p300 expression plasmids coding for p300 lacking amino acids 348–412 (C/H1) or 1737–1836 (C/H3) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The 3.8MMP1/CAT and −72MMP1/CAT plasmids consist of the sequences −3.8 kb to +37 bp, or −72 to +36 bp of the human MMP-1 gene, respectively (35Doyle G.A. Pierce R.A. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11840-11849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The tk-renilla luciferase expression vector was used as standard for transfection efficiency. The p65 expression plasmid encodes the p65 subunit of human NFκB. The κB-luc plasmid consists of three tandem copies of the major histocompatibility complex class I gene NFκB element in pGL2-Basic, and AP-1/CAT contains five tandem copies of the human MMP-1 gene AP-1 binding site (3Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). Neonatal dermal fibroblasts at near-confluency were transfected by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method or using FUGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), which permits >50% efficiency of transfection in primary fibroblasts, as described previously (20Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The total amount of plasmid DNA within each experiment was kept constant by addition of appropriate empty vectors. 6–12 h following transfection, cells were placed in media with 1% FCS and TGF-β or IFN-γ together with IL-1β. Cultures were harvested after a further 24-h incubation, and CAT and luciferase activities in aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were determined. The efficiency of transfections was monitored by measuring Renilla luciferase activity. The values shown are the means of triplicate determinations and are representative of multiple independent experiments. Confluent fibroblasts were incubated with IL-1β and/or TGF-β in media containing 0.1% FCS. After 24 h, culture supernatants were harvested, and precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid. Equal amounts of protein were then fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and subjected to Western blotting using 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal antibody to human recombinant MMP-1 (AB806 from Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). To verify transfer efficiency, membranes were stained with Ponceau S. Immunoreactivity was visualized by chemiluminescence. The intensity of the bands was quantitated by densitometric analysis. Statistical differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance, and values of p < 0.05 by unpaired two-tailed Student'st test were considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the Excel98 software program. Northern blot analysis indicated that levels of MMP-1 mRNA were very low in unstimulated dermal fibroblasts but were markedly increased by IL-1β treatment (Fig.1A). Treatment of the cultures with TGF-β abrogated the induction of MMP-1 mRNA expression by IL-1β, with maximal inhibition at a concentration of 12.5 ng/ml TGF-β. Essentially identical results were observed with fibroblasts derived from four separate individuals. The regulation of MMP-1 synthesis was examined by Western immunoblot. The results showed that treatment of the fibroblasts with IL-1β induced a >5-fold increase in the secretion of MMP-1 into the culture media (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of MMP-1 secretion was completely abrogated in the presence of TGF-β. To examine the level of MMP-1 regulation by TGF-β, transient transfections were performed. The 3.8MMP1/CAT construct contains 3.8 kb of the human MMP-1 promoter, including AP-1 binding sites that are considered essential for both basal and IL-1β-induced promoter activity, as well as a consensus Smad binding site adjacent to the more proximal AP-1 site. The basal expression of the MMP-1 promoter in the transfected fibroblasts was relatively high, suggesting constitutive AP-1 activity (6Borghaei H. Borghaei R.C. Pease E. Thronton R. Mochan E. Inflamm. Res. 1997; 46: 177-178Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and was reproducibly increased by IL-1β (Fig.1C, left panel). As noted previously, the increase in mRNA levels induced by IL-1β was consistently of greater magnitude than the increase in promoter activity noted in transient transfection assays (4Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of upstream regulatory elements or stabilization of mRNA transcripts. Significantly, IL-1β stimulation of MMP-1 promoter activity was abrogated by TGF-β in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1C, left panel). In contrast to its inhibitory effect on MMP-1, TGF-β in parallel experiments caused stimulation of the SBE4-luc construct, as expected (Fig. 1C, right panel). These results demonstrate that TGF-β inhibition of 3.8MMP1/CAT did not reflect a nonspecific repressive effect on reporter activity and indicate the selectivity of TGF-β inhibitory activity for MMP-1 gene expression. Pretreatment of the cultures with cycloheximide at 5 µg/ml, a concentration we previously determined to inhibit protein synthesis by >90% in fibroblasts, failed to prevent suppression of MMP-1, indicating that the TGF-β inhibitory response was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis (Fig.1D). Smads function as mediators of several cellular responses elicited by TGF-β (reviewed in Ref. 14Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). To examine their involvement in down-regulation of MMP transcription, Smads were transiently overexpressed in confluent fibroblasts co-transfected with the 3.8-kb MMP-1 promoter construct. The results showed that ectopic Smad3 was able to abrogate IL-1β stimulation of promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2A, left panel). As a positive control, regulation of a TGF-β-responsive minimal promoter was examined. As expected, 3TP-driven luciferase activity was markedly up-regulated by Smad3 (Fig. 2A, right panel). The receptor-activated Smads share highly conserved and functionally distinct MH1 and MH2 domains. To characterize structural determinants of Smad3 inhibitory activity, we next determined the effects of truncated forms of Smad3 lacking the MH2 domain (Smad3ΔC), or the MH1 (Smad3ΔN). The results of transfection experiments showed that both terminal deletion mutants lost the ability to repress the MMP-1 promoter, indicating that the DNA-binding and protein interaction domains are both required for inhibitory activity of Smad3 (Fig.2B). When the ability of the Smad3 mutants to stimulate minimal promoter activity was examined, we found that, consistent with other reports (33Nagarajan R.P. Liu J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31229-31235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), overexpression of Smad3ΔN efficiently transactivated SBE4-luc, whereas deletion of the MH2 domain (Smad3ΔC) abrogated the ability of Smad3 to stimulate promoter activity (data not shown). The Smad signaling partner Smad4 by itself repressed the MMP-1 promoter and abrogated its activation by IL-1β (Fig. 2C), whereas Smad1, which is implicated in BMP but not TGF-β signaling (36Hoodless P.A. Haerry S. Abdollah M. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), had no significant effect. Interestingly, Smad2, which shares a high degree of structural similarity to Smad3, also failed to inhibit MMP-1, although it was able to stimulate SBE4-luc (data not shown). The level of expression for each ectopically expressed Smad protein was comparable in transfected COS cells. Next, the regulation of MMP-1 mRNA by Smad3 was examined by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig.2D, transient overexpression of Smad3 in the fibroblasts resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cellular MMP-1 expression induced by IL-1β. To define the region of the MMP-1 gene mediating its transcriptional repression by TGF-β/Smad3, a truncated promoter construct was used. The plasmid −72MMP1/CAT contains the −72 to +36 sequence of the human MMP-1 gene, including a single AP-1 binding site and an overlapping Smad site that is identical to the proposed optimal Smad3 binding AGAC sequence (15Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Treatment of transiently transfected fibroblasts with TGF-β caused a modest increase in basal or IL-1β-stimulated −72MMP1/CAT activity (Fig. 2E). Overexpression of Smad3 in these cells greatly enhanced the activity of truncated MMP-1 promoter in the presence or absence of IL-1β. These results indicate that TGF-β/Smad3 enhances, rather than inhibits, basal or IL-1β-stimulated activity of a truncated MMP-1 promoter, and is consistent with findings in Mv1Lu cells (49Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 59Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Because optimal transactivation of a truncated MMP-1 promoter in Mv1Lu cells appeared to require DNA binding of both c-Jun and Smad3, maximal stimulation was attributed to ligand-induced interaction of DNA-bound c-Jun with DNA-bound Smad3 (49Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, stimulation of MMP-1 short promoter activity by TGF-β was also seen in F9 cells devoid of c-Jun and c-Fos, suggesting that Smads were able to interact directly with the promoter even in the absence of AP-1 (59Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To establish the functional involvement of cellular Smads in TGF-β-induced repression, complementary loss-of-function approaches were employed. Fibroblasts were transfected with Smad3A, a mutant in which replacement of three C-terminal serine residues with alanine interferes with Smad3 phosphorylation by the activated TGF-β receptor (32Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that overexpression of Smad3A would disrupt the inhibitory effect of TGF-β. The results indicated that, although Smad3A by itself had no effect on basal or IL-1β-stimulated activity of the MMP-1 promoter in transient transfection assays, in fibroblasts co-transfected with mutant Smad3 TGF-β failed to repress MMP-1 induction; indeed, IL-1β-stimulated MMP-1 promoter activity was actually further enhanced by TGF-β in the presence of Smad3A (Fig.3A, left panel). These results were reproducible in several independent experiments. Transfection of dominant negative Smad4 likewise prevented repression of MMP-1 promoter by TGF-β in the presence of IL-1β; furthermore, mutant Smad4 abrogated repression of MMP-1 by Smad3 as well, indicating that a fully intact Smad signaling pathway was essential for the inhibitory response (Fig. 3B and data not shown). It was important to confirm that the ability of dominant negative Smad3 to rescue stimulation of MMP-1 transcription in the presence of TGF-β was specifically due to disruption of cellular Smad signaling. To this end, we e"

However, the potential triggers of programmed cell death in the heart and the involvement of specific metabolic pathway(s) are less well characterized. Detachment of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inner membrane is a necessary first step for cytochrome c release into the cytosol and initiation of apoptosis. The saturated long chain fatty acid, palmitate, induces apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and diminishes content of the mitochondrial anionic phospholipid, cardiolipin. These changes are accompanied by 1) acyl chain saturation of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylglycerol, 2) large increases in the levels of these two phospholipids, and 3) a decline in cardiolipin synthesis. Although cardiolipin synthase activity is unchanged, saturated phosphatidylglycerol is a poor substrate for this enzyme. Under these conditions, decreased cardiolipin synthesis and release of cytochrome c are directly and significantly correlated. The results suggest that phosphatidylglycerol saturation and subsequent decreases in cardiolipin affect the association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane, directly influencing the pathway to cytochrome crelease and subsequent apoptosis.

Apoptosis may occur by two general pathways, i.e.receptor-mediated and stress-induced (mitochondrial-initiated) apoptosis (1Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). In both pathways, cytochrome c release is one of the most important regulatory steps. In receptor-mediated apoptosis, caspase 8 is activated early and cleaves BID, releasing cytochrome c (2Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). In stress-induced apoptosis, however, caspase 8 is usually not activated, and the mechanism of cytochromec release is uncertain. Current theories involve transient opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore causing slight swelling as well as formation of pores in the outer membrane by proapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family, e.g. BAX and BAK (1Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar, 3Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. DiLisa F. Eur. J.

Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). These mechanisms mediate the passage of unbound cytochromec through the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the mechanism by which cytochrome c dissociates from the inner membrane is less clear. Cytochrome c is bound to the outer surface of the inner membrane phospholipids by electrostatic forces (predominating at neutral pH). Dissociation from the inner membrane is a necessary first step before cytochrome c can pass through release channels and ultimately reach the cytosol. Cardiac apoptosis occurs during ischemia and reperfusion as well as in the genetically obese Zucker rat model of lipo-apoptosis (5Zhou Y.-T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D.

In both of these situations, there is an increase in the levels of circulating long chain fatty acids. Using the saturated long chain fatty acid, palmitate (C16:0), we have developed a model of stress-induced apoptosis in cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes that results in cytochrome c release followed by a heterogeneous loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent caspase 3 activation (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of cytochrome c dissociation from the inner mitochondrial membrane leading to its translocation to the cytosol, we studied the role of cardiolipin (1,3-bis (1′,2′-diacyl-3′-phosphoryl-sn-glycerol)-sn-glycerol) (CL),1 a phospholipid necessary for cytochrome c insertion, retention, stability, and function (7Rytomaa M. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Choi S. Swanson J.M. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 54: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CL loss in ischemia (9Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aging has been associated with decreases in mitochondrial carrier activities and cytochrome levels including cytochrome c (10McMillin J. Taffet G. Taegtmeyer H.T. Hudson E.K. Tate C.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 2222-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Paradies G. Ruggiero F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, a decrease in CL has been shown to cause increased ceramide production through the reverse activity of a mitochondrial ceramidase (12El Bawab S. Birbes H. Roddy P. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska Z.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16758-16766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CL is a unique phospholipid carrying four acyl groups and two negative charges. After the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) plus CTP to CDP-diacylglycerol (DAG) and pyrophosphate by CDP-DAG synthase, CL biosynthesis in eukaryotes occurs in a three-step process in the mitochondrial inner membrane (Fig. 1). First, phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) synthase catalyzes the formation of PGP from CDP-DAG and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate. In the second step, PGP is dephosphorylated to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by PGP phosphatase. Lastly, CL synthase catalyzes a phosphatidyl transfer from CDP-DAG to PG, an irreversible reaction that involves cleavage of a high energy anhydride bond to form CL. Understanding of the regulatory steps in CL synthesis is important to our understanding of mitochondrial function in the life cycle of the mammalian cell. In particular, the quantitative interaction of cytochrome cwith anionic mitochondrial phospholipids may predetermine the relative distribution of this protein between mitochondrial membranes and the cytosol. Thus, in addition to the well described function of cytochromec in energy production and/or programmed cell death, CL may also play an integral role as an upstream effector of these important processes. Cardiomyocytes attain steady-state labeling with [32P]Pi (20 μCi/ml) after 20 h of plating. In the experiments described, cells were labeled for 24 h at a constant specific activity of [32P]Pi, after which oleate or palmitate (0.5 mm in a 2:1 ratio with BSA) was added at zero time, and cells were harvested at the times indicated. Protein levels were determined as described previously (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized with a solution of CH3OH/CHCl3/0.1 n HCl (10:5:4). Lipids were isolated by acid organic extraction (half-volumes each of CHCl3, 0.1 n HCl, and 0.5 mNaCl) (13Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). It was found in every case that the amount of label isolated in the organic fraction was directly proportional to the protein concentration of the cell lysate. Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using a 20 × 20-cm silica gel plate (Whatman) (14Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and individual species were identified by the co-migration of standards (Sigma). Spots were extracted from the plate and subjected to phosphate analysis (14Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that the label in the spot was directly proportional to the amount of phosphate in every case in which cells were labeled to steady state. The spots were quantified by phospho-counting (either an Instant Imager (Packard) or a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad)) and normalized to the total amount of label present in each sample. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared according to McMillin et al. (15McMillin J.B. Hudson E.K. Buja L.M. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 301-309Google Scholar) using 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Fatty acid/BSA solutions were prepared in a molar ratio of 2:1 fatty acid to BSA. Fatty acid (0.5 mm) was added to cells along with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.3 g/liter glutamine and 4.5 g/liter sucrose (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry by direct infusion into a Quatro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Manchester, UK). A sample was introduced into the electrospray probe via a 75-μm inner diameter capillary. Flow to the electrospray probe, which consisted of chloroform/methanol (1:2 (v/v)), was maintained at 5 μl/min using a Beckman pump. The electrospray probe was operated at a voltage of −3.2 keV (negative-ion mode) or +3.5 keV (positive-ion mode). Mass spectra were obtained by scanning in the range of 400–950m/z (positive- and negative-ion mode) every 1.6 s and summing individual spectra for phospholipid (excluding CL) analysis. For CL analysis, mass spectra were obtained by scanning in the range of 1300–1700 m/z every 1.2 s and summing individual spectra. Source temperature was maintained at 70 °C. The spectrometer was operated at unit resolution. Purchased ceramides and/or phospholipids (Matreyea, Sigma, and Calbiochem) were used as standards for quantitative purposes. The identification of lipids was based on collision-induced dissociation of individual lipids for assessment of fatty acyl chain composition/headgroup analysis as well as precursor ion scanning and for determination of phospholipid class in both the positive- and negative-ion modes. Collision-induced dissociation spectra were obtained by selecting the mass ion of interest and scanning in Q3 at 500 Da/s using 8 × 10−4 to 3 × 10−3 mBar argon in the collision chamber. Using precursor ion scanning techniques, negative precursors of 241 and 196 identified parents of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. Positive precursors of 184 yielded parents of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine. Neutral-loss scans of +141 and +185 yielded parents of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, respectively. Cytosolic cytochrome cwas measured following digitonin (30 μm) permeabilization of cardiomyocytes (15McMillin J.B. Hudson E.K. Buja L.M. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 301-309Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting, and gel band intensities were quantified by densitometry (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain crude preparations of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes (CDP-DAG, PGP, and CL synthases), cardiomyocytes were either untreated or incubated with oleate or palmitate for 20 h. Cells were lysed by freeze/thawing in hypotonic lysis buffer and homogenized with a Wheaton pestle (17Weeks R. Dowhan W. Shen H. Balantac N. Meengs B. Nudelman E. Leung D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Total membranes were isolated by 109,000 × gcentrifugation in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). CDP-DAG synthase assays were performed by conversion of CTP plus PA to radiolabeled CDP-DAG (16Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M. Zucker C.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For the time course, PA derived from egg yolk lecithin and [3H]CTP were used as substrates (Sigma). [3H]CDP-DAG was isolated by acid organic extraction (13Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar) and quantified in a liquid β-scintillation counter (LKB). For the substrate preference studies [32P]PA was isolated by acid organic extraction and thin layer chromatography from cardiomyocytes grown in the presence of32Pi for 20 h in palmitate or oleate. The assays were accomplished in 100 μl with 200 μg of membrane protein. The same cpm of substrate was added in each reaction. Conversion of [32P]PA to radiolabeled CDP-DAG was monitored by the separation of product from substrate by thin layer chromatography followed by counting. PGP synthase assays were performed by conversion ofsn-[14C]glycerol-3-phosphate and CDP-DAG (dioleoyl, Avanti) to product (18Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were cultured, and total membranes were isolated as described above. The assays were accomplished in 100 μl with 400 μg of membrane protein. [14C]PGP (which is converted readily to [14C]PG) was isolated and quantified. To assay CL synthase, the conversion of [32P]PG to [32P]CL was measured (19Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). [32P]PG was isolated by acid organic extraction and thin layer chromatography from cardiomyocytes cultured as described above. The assays were accomplished in 100 μl with 100 μg of membrane protein. The same cpm of substrate was added in each reaction. The product, [32P]CL, was separated from substrate by thin layer chromatography and quantified. [32P]DPPA was localized on the silica gel thin layer chromatography plate by autoradiography. The silica gel was scraped off and resuspended in acidic methanol (1:50 HCl) by vigorous vortexing. Subsequent to centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, dried, and resuspended in an appropriate volume of CHCl3. Programmed cell death leads to significant changes in cellular phospholipids, suggesting a role for these changes in metabolic pathways accompanying apoptosis (20Madesh M. Anup R. Benard O. Balasubramanian K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ascertain changes in steady-state levels of whole-cell phospholipids with time during apoptosis, cardiomyocytes were labeled with 32P to steady state, fatty acids added as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and phospholipids were isolated and separated using thin layer chromatography (Fig.2A). Palmitate (C16:0) (0.5 mm bound in a 2:1 molar ratio with BSA) was used to induce apoptosis, and oleate (C18:1) (0.5 mm bound in a 2:1 molar ratio with BSA) was used as a nonapoptotic control (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most dramatic difference between the two labeling experiments was the time-dependent appearance of a new spot (designated DPPA) in palmitate-treated cells (Fig.2B). DPPA represents dipalmitoyl (C16:0, C16:0) PA, whereas POPA is palmitoyl-oleoyl (C16:0, C18:1) PA (see below). The designation PA (Fig. 2) represents a mixture of phosphatidic acid species with no fatty acid composition verified, determined, or implied. There was little change in the distribution of label in oleate-treated cells (Fig. 2B, PAversus DPPA). Each spot was identified as PA by isolation and conversion to CDP-DAG with CTP and cardiomyocyte CDP-DAG synthase. A mass spectrometry analysis of total lipid extracts of 16-h palmitate-treated cells revealed the presence of DPPA (Da/e = 647) (Fig. 3). This species is missing in extracts of oleate-treated cells. The latter extract contains palmitoyl-oleoyl (C16:0, C18:1) PA (Da/e = 673) among a mixture of other minor PA species with varying fatty acid compositions but clearly lacks significant levels of DPPA. With time, the total amount of label in the PA-plus-DPPA region of the autoradiograms increased only slightly in oleate-treated cells but demonstrated dramatic increases in palmitate-treated cells,i.e. by 50% beginning at 2 h (Fig.4A). By 20 h, this increase was greater than 3-fold and accounted for more than 6% of the total cellular phospholipid. As shown in Fig. 2B, this increase was solely caused by the formation of DPPA (again, DPPA was not detectable in oleate-treated cells). PA is the precursor of many other phospholipids including the anionic phospholipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane, PG and CL (Fig. 1). In mammalian cells, PG and CL are uniquely mitochondrial phospholipids. Changes in the mitochondrial content of CL are known to affect transport functions; however, there may also be quantitative alterations in its electrostatic interaction with extrinsic membrane proteins such as cytochrome c. During palmitate induction of programmed cell death, the only phospholipids that demonstrated changes in steady-state levels with time were PG and CL. PG increased significantly in palmitate-treated cells beginning at the 2-h time point with a 30% increase in the steady-state level over cells incubated with oleate (Fig. 4B). PG increased to over 50% of control levels at 20 h and accounts for more than 3.5% of phospholipids at that point. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that nearly all the PG from palmitate-incubated cells was dipalmitoyl (C16:0, C16:0) PG (Da/e = 721) (Fig. 3), which is missing in oleate-incubated cells that show the C16:0, C18:1 species (palmitoyl-oleoyl (C16:0, C18:1) PG, Da/e = 747). Therefore, the saturation of PA by palmitate likely causes anionic phospholipid metabolites to become saturated as well. The greatly increased levels of PG with time suggest a problem converting this saturated species to CL. Steady-state CL levels in palmitate-treated cells decrease by 15% after only 2 h (Fig.4C). By 20 h, CL levels are 50% of control. A mass spectroscopy analysis of mitochondrial phospholipids from cells treated with palmitate or oleate for 4 h showed a dramatic decrease in the levels of eight different CL species in palmitate-treated cells. However, the Da/e ratios of these species were the same with both treatments (data not shown), indicating a loss of pre-existing CL with little new synthesis. When a comparison is made between total steady-state CL levels and cytosolic cytochrome c, a strong linear correlation is observed (Fig. 5). This correlation is also temporal, demonstrating that both CL reduction and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c are triggered at an early stage in the commitment of a cell to apoptosis. These data provide strong evidence that CL levels may directly influence cytochromec retention in the mitochondria. The molecular basis for changes in cardiac myocyte phospholipid composition was studied by determining phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme activities. In palmitate-treated cells, CDP-DAG synthase activity decreased to 40% of oleate control by 4 h (Fig.6A). This decreased activity is correlated with a substantial increase in saturated PA (Figs.2B and 4A). When total PA was taken from cells incubated for 20 h in either palmitate or oleate and used as a substrate for CDP-DAG synthase, the activity of this enzyme was dramatically less when PA from palmitate-incubated cells (mostly DPPA, Fig. 3) was used (Fig. 6B). Therefore, not only is the activity of CDP-DAG synthase decreased in palmitate-treated cells, but the DPPA synthesized by these cells is also a poorer enzyme substrate, as observed by others (16Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M. Zucker C.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PGP synthase activity remains unchanged in palmitate-cultured cells with a value of 4.5 ± 0.5 and 5.2 ± 0.5 nmol/mg/min after 16 h of oleate and palmitate incubation, respectively. Therefore, the increases in PG synthesis and levels observed in the palmitate-incubated cells (Figs. 3B and 4B) do not result from altered enzyme activity. The increased synthesis may be caused by increased substrate availability in the mitochondrial inner membrane, reflecting the increased need of the cell for anionic phospholipids. CL synthase activity is also unaffected by growth of cells in palmitate (Fig. 6C). However, PG isolated from cells incubated with palmitate (mostly dipalmitoyl (C16:0, C16:0) PG, Fig. 3) shows a much lower conversion to CL with this enzyme than PG from untreated or oleate-treated cells. This suggests that although the myocyte has PG available to increase CL levels, new CL is not synthesized because of the low affinity of CL synthase for saturated phospholipids. This effect is compounded in that the predominant CDP-DAG species is derived from dipalmitoyl PA (Fig. 2). CL is the most unsaturated phospholipid found in cells, which is most likely essential to many of its properties and functions (21Schlame M. Beyer K. Hayer-Hartl M. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem./FEBS. 1991; 199: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Pistolese M. DiVenosa N. Serena D. Ruggiero F.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Decreases in mitochondrial CL demonstrate a strong linear and temporal relationship to cytosolic cytochrome c levels, suggesting that changes in CL directly affect cytochrome crelease from the mitochondrial inner membrane into the cytosol. In our model of lipo-apoptosis, this decrease in CL is caused by decreased synthesis, because saturated fatty acid precursors are poor substrates for CL synthase. To compensate for this altered metabolism, the myocyte increases substrate availability for CL precursor synthesis; however, the substrate precursors PA and PG are highly saturated in cells exposed to high concentrations of saturated fatty acids. Although unsaturated PG substitutes for CL in several cellular processes, saturated PG may not be physiologically suitable (7Rytomaa M. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bobyleva V. Bellei M. Pazienza T.L. Muscatello U. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The present results build on a wealth of data by other investigators showing that CL is closely associated with cytochrome c and may produce secondary and tertiary changes in cytochrome cstructure (25Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Because of this interrelationship, it is reasonable to expect that the two events, i.e. CL diminution and cytochrome c release, should be related closely. The data are strongly supportive of this hypothesis and further suggest that CL depletion likely is responsible for the decreased inner membrane/cytochrome c interaction leading to its subsequent release into the cytosol. In the cultured neonatal cardiac myocyte, cytochrome c appears to be released from a heterogeneous population of mitochondria within a single cell (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that within the first 2–4 h, only a few mitochondria releasing cytosolic cytochrome c are required for propagation of the apoptotic signal in the heart. The 25% decrease in CL by 4 h of palmitate incubation surely would be sufficient to alter the electrostatic interactions of the mitochondrial inner membrane with cytochrome c such that membrane-protein interactions are weakened substantially. The concept of altered lipid metabolism and cardiac cell death is central to understanding therapies to minimize the onset of cardiac pathology. There have been several intriguing reports in which the development of cardiac pathophysiology is correlated with a “mismatch” between fatty acid uptake and utilization. The presence of high levels both of circulating fatty acids and tissue fatty acid content in patients after myocardial infarction correlates with the appearance of ventricular arrhythmias and enzyme release from the myocardium (26Kurien V.A. Yates P.A. Oliver M.F. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 1: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27deLeiris J. Opie L.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1978; 12: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism is reported during cardiac hypertrophy and failure such that oxidative metabolism of extracted fatty acids is decreased (28Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S. Bastin J. McCune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Despite the oncotic cell death associated with infarction, it has been suggested recently that apoptosis defines and limits the size of the infarct zone in ischemic heart (29Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J.E. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Lipid messengers of programmed cell death have been identified and include sphingosine (29Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J.E. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) and ceramide (30Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that de novo increases in myocardial ceramide content occur as a consequence of apoptosis rather than being a factor in its initiation (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Watts J.D. Gu M. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Polverino A.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). When there is fatty acid overload in a cell, triacylglycerol accumulation is an indicator of the extent of acyl-CoA bond formation (where saturated fatty acyl CoA is a precursor of triacylglycerol and ceramide synthesis). Long chain acyl-CoA interacts with the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (a proposed component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore), displacing ADP from the outer side of the inner membrane to inhibit adenine nucleotide translocation (33Chua B.H. Shrago E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6711-6714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, stabilization of the pore responsible for the mitochondrial permeability transition involves binding of ADP to the adenine nucleotide translocase (34Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.-Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Therefore, competitive displacement of ADP from a component of the mitochondrial pore by acyl-CoA could be a mechanism for initiation of programmed cell death during lipo-apoptosis. It follows that increased myocardial triglyceride is diagnostic of a mismatch between fatty acid uptake and oxidation with potential peripheral effects involving mitochondrially mediated apoptosis. The presence of cardiac steatosis in diabetic fa/fa rats (5Zhou Y.-T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and in diabetic patients (35Fiordaliso T. Latini R. Li B. Malhota A. Kajstura J. Circulation. 1999; 100 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 759Google Scholar) is associated with programmed cell death. Both lipo-apoptosis and cardiac failure are associated with ventricular wall thinning, suggesting loss of contractile cells caused by cell death. Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing sarcolemmal long chain acyl CoA synthetase in the heart, lipid accumulation is observed, again hypothesized to result from a mismatch between the increased fatty acid uptake that exceeds fatty acid oxidation (36Chiu H.-C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.-F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). These perturbations in lipid metabolism are associated also with apoptotic cell death (36Chiu H.-C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.-F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), adding further credence to the significance of a switch in substrate preference in cardiac failure. The pathway of CL loss reported in the present study represents an alternate mechanism for increased susceptibility of the injured myocardium to programmed cell death. Incubation of cardiac myocytes with saturated versus unsaturated free fatty acids does not provide either early or selective effects on the mitochondrial permeability transition via acyl-CoA interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocase (33Chua B.H. Shrago E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6711-6714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the hypothesis that palmitate is not acting directly (as palmitoyl-CoA) at the mitochondrial pore, at 4 h of incubation both palmitate and oleate are oxidized at similar rates, and triglyceride accumulation is not different between groups (37Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 511-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, chronic restructuring of membrane phospholipids may have pathophysiological consequences that are modeled by the present study. Losses in mitochondrial CL have been observed in ischemic and ischemic-reperfused myocardium (38Kajiyama K. Pauly D.F. Hughes H. Yoon S.B. Entman M.L. McMillin-Wood J.B. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 39Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with no changes in the fatty acid composition of the remaining CL (39Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is in agreement with the present results. Besides the purported direct effect of CL loss on cytochrome c association with the inner membrane, CL is also an essential component of the acylcarnitine-carnitine translocase (40Paradies G. Ruggiero F.M. Petrosilla G. Quagliariello E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is important for the catalytic activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (41Pande S.V. Murthy M.S. Noel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of CL would engender a negative feedback loop on fatty acid oxidation and augment the process of lipo-apoptosis, with late effects potentially on pore opening. We have described recently how Fas and ionizing radiation also lead to saturation of PG in Jurkat cells with subsequent progression to cell death (42Amoscato A.A. Matsko C.M. Rabinowich H. Lotze M.T. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (abstr.): A511Google Scholar) and have also described CL loss in this process (43Thomas R.L. Matsko C.M. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30580-30588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, saturation and/or modification of precursor phospholipids leading to CL loss may be a general mechanism for cytochrome c release in stress-induced apoptosis. It also is important to note that cardiolipin is an integral phospholipid in the catalytic function of the adenine nucleotide translocase as well as cytochrome oxidase (25Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This acute model of fatty acid overload leading to mitochondrial changes in cardiolipin serves as a paradigm for sustained biochemical events that are associated with cardiac disease and ventricular failure. In summary, we have provided an essential role for phospholipid metabolism in the onset of apoptosis in palmitate-incubated cardiac myocytes. The coincidence of changes in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway as well as the concurrent loss of CL from mitochondrial membranes occurs early and is correlated significantly in time with cytochrome c release into the cytosol. These changesprecede the late appearance of ceramide, the late selective decrease in palmitate oxidation and Complex III activity, with activation of caspase 3-like proteases (6Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2124-H2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that a decrease in mitochondrial membrane CL can lead directly to a decreased affinity of the membrane for cytochrome c and facilitate its release for the initiation of programmed cell death in the heart.

Occludin function is thought to be regulated by phosphorylation, but no information is available on the molecular pathways involved. In the present study, the involvement of the protein kinase C pathway in the regulation of the phosphorylation and cellular distribution of occludin has been investigated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol induced the rapid phosphorylation of occludin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultured in low extracellular calcium medium with a concomitant translocation of occludin to the regions of cell-cell contact. The extent of occludin phosphorylation as well as its incorporation into tight junctions induced by protein kinase C activators or calcium switch were markedly decreased by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF-109203X. In addition, in vitroexperiments showed that the recombinant COOH-terminal domain of murine occludin could be phosphorylated by purified protein kinase C.

Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The dynamic rearrangement of cell-cell junctions including TJs is a critical step in various cellular processes, including the establishment of epithelial cell polarity and developmental patterning (3Fleming T.P. Papenbrock T. Fesenko I. Hausen P. Sheth B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previous data suggest that TJ function may be regulated by the phosphorylation of certain proteins (4Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 5Staddon J.M. Herrenknecht K. Smales C. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerols have been shown to trigger the formation of TJ, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C; the identities of the molecular pathways involved remain, however, elusive (4Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The integral membrane protein occludin was recently identified as a component of TJ of epithelial and endothelial cells (7Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 8Hirase T. Staddon J.M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Itoh M. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Occludin comprises four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and three cytoplasmic domains (one intracellular short turn, a short NH2-terminal domain, and a long COOH-terminal domain). Accumulating evidence suggests that occludin plays an important role in tight junctions, although embryonic stem cells lacking occludin are able to form well developed TJs (9Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The overexpression of mutant forms of occludin in cultured epithelial cells leads to changes in the barrier and fence function (10Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. Gonzalez S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 11Bamforth S.D. Kniesel U. Wolburg H. Engelhardt B. Risau W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of synthetic peptides corresponding to the extracellular loops of occludin to epithelial cells results in the disappearance of TJ and inhibition of cell adhesion (12Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 13Lacaz-Vieira F. Jaeger M.M. Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr.

Finally, occludin knock-out mice show a complex phenotype, including retarded growth and various histological abnormalities, suggesting that the functions of both TJ and occludin are more complex than was supposed previously (15Saitou M. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Occludin has been shown to be highly phosphorylated (16Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 17Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar). Tight junction assembly induced by calcium switch is paralleled by occludin phosphorylation and incorporation into the TJ of MDCK cells (16Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar,17Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar). It has also been shown that highly phosphorylated occludin molecules are selectively concentrated at TJs, whereas non- or less phosphorylated occludin is localized in the cytoplasm (16Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Occludin becomes phosphorylated and associates with ZO-1 during certain stages of mouse embryo development, and these processes are proposed to regulate TJ biogenesis and the timing of blastocyst formation (18Sheth B. Moran B. Anderson J.M. Fleming T.P. Development. 2000; 127: 831-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent results suggest that the phosphorylation of occludin may regulate tight junction permeability in response to histamine and lysophosphatidic acid (19Hirase T. Kawashima S. Wong E.Y. Ueyama T. Rikitake Y. Tsukita S. Yokoyama M. Staddon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10423-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The findings above led to the conclusion that occludin function at TJ is regulated by phosphorylation. The molecular pathways regulating occludin phosphorylation remain unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), activators of protein kinase C, on the phosphorylation and cellular localization of occludin in monolayers of MDCK cells incubated in low extracellular Ca2+ medium. PMA and diC8 induced a rapid phosphorylation of occludin and its redistribution to the regions of cell-cell contact. The phosphorylation and incorporation of occludin into tight junctions induced by PMA, diC8, or calcium switch were inhibited by a PKC inhibitor. Furthermore, Ser338 of the recombinant COOH-terminal domain of murine occludin was found to be phosphorylatedin vitro by purified protein kinase C. These findings suggest that the regulation of phosphorylation and cellular distribution of occludin are mediated by protein kinase C. Protease inhibitors and protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Protein kinase C, PMA, 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, and GF-109203X were from Alexis Deutschland GmbH (Gruenberg, Germany). TRIzol reagent and flasks on a slide were from Life Technologies GmbH (Technologiepark Karlsruhe, Germany). Cy3- and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit monoclonal antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-occludin antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). MDCK cells were obtained from Dr. Swaroop (MDC, Berlin, Germany). The pMAL fusion and purification system, BamHI, and SalI were purchased from New England Biolabs GmbH (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Taq polymerase, alkaline phosphatase, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were from Promega GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP and the blotting detection kit were from Amersham Pharmacia BiotechEurope GmbH (Freiburg, Germany). Total RNA was isolated from 50 mg of murine kidney using TRIzol reagent and reverse transcription was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. A 777-base pair fragment encoding amino acids 264–521 of murine occludin was amplified using the primers 5′-AGGATCCAAAACCCGAAGAAAGATGGATCGG-3′, and 5′-TTGTCGACTAAGGTTTCCGTCTGTCATAGTC-3′ (BamHI andSalI sites are underlined). The amplified product was cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Several clones were sequenced (Taq DyeDeoxy-Terminator cycle sequencing kit, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany); a clone containing no mutations was selected, and itsBamHI-SalI fragment was subcloned into the pMAL-c2x plasmid to produce a plasmid coding for the COOH-terminal domain of occludin fused with maltose-binding protein. The fusion protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified over an amylose column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro phosphorylation of occludin was performed as follows. Purified recombinant occludin fragment (5 µg) was mixed with 16 ng of protein kinase C in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmATP, 5 nm PMA, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a reaction volume of 40 µl. In other experiments GF-109203X at a concentration of 5 µm was used to inhibit PKC. Phosphorylation of MBP-β-galactosidase (the expression product of the pMal-c2x plasmid) was performed as for occludin, but double the amount of PKC was used. MDCK cells were cultured in MEM with 10% FCS. Low Ca2+ medium (LC) was prepared from S-MEM (calcium-free MEM) and 5% FCS pretreated with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, München, Germany) as described in Ref. 19Hirase T. Kawashima S. Wong E.Y. Ueyama T. Rikitake Y. Tsukita S. Yokoyama M. Staddon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10423-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were grown in normal calcium (NC) medium (MEM with 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 5% FCS), washed twice with PBS, and then transferred to low Ca2+ medium for 20 h prior to the addition of normal calcium medium, PMA, or diC8. In other experiments GF-109203X at a concentration of 5 µm was added 30 min before the addition of normal calcium medium (or low calcium medium with PKC activators) containing 5 µmGF-109203X. Cells were grown in the flasks on slides, washed with PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, soaked in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 60 min, and then incubated with 300 µl of anti-occludin antibodies (diluted 100 times). Samples were washed three times with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 60 min with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. After four washes coverslips were mounted over the cells with the aid of mounting medium (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Samples were examined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with the AxioVision image acquisition and analysis system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cells were washed twice with PBS and extracted for 30 min with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 µm leupeptin, 0.3 µm aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmpepstatin at 4 °C (the resulting extract is referred to as the Triton X-100-soluble fraction). The remaining material was scraped into lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% SDS), boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g(the resulting extract is referred to as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE (8% gel) was performed according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, which were then incubated with the antibodies. The antibodies were detected with a blotting detection kit. To detect protein phosphorylation, samples were blotted as above and the 32P signal was detected by autoradiography. Proteins transferred on the nitrocellulose membrane were visualized by silver staining. MDCK cells cultured on 8.8-cm2 Petri dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 µm leupeptin, 0.3 µmaprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µm pepstatin) for 30 min and collected in 1.5-ml tubes. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of lysis buffer, heated 5 min at 95 °C, and combined with 900 µl of immunoprecipitation buffer. After centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant was pretreated with a 15-µl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose. For immunoprecipitation 1 µg of anti-occludin antibodies and a 10-µl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose were added to the supernatant and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and then resuspended in 100 µl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm spermidine) with or without 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, SDS-PAGE buffer was added and beads were boiled to elute the immunoprecipitates for subsequent PAGE. For MALDI analysis, 15 µl of occludin solution taken from the phosphorylation reaction were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by staining with a Colloidal Blue staining kit (Novex, San Diego, CA). Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated occludin bands were excised from the stained gels, washed with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubation in 30 µl of 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at 55 °C. Alkylation was performed by replacing the dithiothreitol solution with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. After a 20-min incubation at 25 °C in the dark, the gel pieces were washed with 50–100 µl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The gel pieces were re-swollen in 10 µl of 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, containing 300 ng of endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After 15 min, 5 µl of 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to keep the gel pieces moist during Lys-C cleavage (37 °C, overnight). To extract the peptides, 15 µl of 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile was added, and the samples were sonicated for 5 min. The separated liquid was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 10 µl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. The peptides were purified over a C18 reversed-phase minicolumn filled in a micropipette tip (ZipTip C18, Millipore, Bedford, MA) for mass spectrometry analysis. Purification was performed according to the manufacturer's manual, except that peptides were eluted with 3 µl of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.3% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid or with 5 µl of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.2% (v/v) formic acid for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS), respectively. MALDI-MS measurements were performed on a Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry work station MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). One µl of the analyte solution was mixed with 1 µl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution consisting of 10 mg of matrix dissolved in 1 ml of 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile-water (1:1, v/v). One µl of the resulting mixture was applied to the sample plate. Samples were air-dried at ambient temperature (24 °C). Measurements were performed in the reflection mode at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, 70% grid voltage, and a delay of 200 ns. Each spectrum obtained was the mean of 256 laser shots. For nanoESI-MS/MS, 5 µl of the peptide mixture were lyophilized and dissolved in 5 µl of methanol, 1% formic acid (1:1, v/v). The MS/MS measurements were performed with a nanoelectrospray hybrid quadrupole mass spectrometer (Q-Tof, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). The collision gas was argon at a pressure of 6.0 × 10−5millibars in the collision cell. In view of the fact that diacylglycerols are known to induce the formation of tight junction strands in MDCK cells cultivated in low calcium medium (4Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we assumed that occludin phosphorylation and recruitment into tight junctions are mediated by PKC. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of PKC activators on the phosphorylation and cellular distribution of occludin in MDCK cells cultured in low calcium medium, which disrupts tight junctions. In accordance with literature data (7Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 10Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. Gonzalez S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), occludin was intensively stained at cell-cell contacts in confluent MDCK cells in normal Ca2+ medium, indicating that continuous TJs were formed (Fig. 1A). After incubation of the cells in LC, occludin became localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm, indicating a down-regulation of TJs (Fig.1B). When PMA at 2 nm was added for 2 h to the cells in LC, a portion of the occludin was translocated to the plasma membrane at regions of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1C,arrows). Staining of occludin at cell-cell contacts was not as continuous or intensive as in the cells grown in NC (Fig.1A). Prolongation of the incubation period up to 4 h further increased the amount of occludin translocated to the regions of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1D). When 25 nm PMA was used to stimulate cells, occludin translocated to the periphery showed a more discontinuous and intensive staining as compared with samples treated with 2 nm PMA (Fig. 1E). Most of the occludin was still localized in the cytoplasm, a significant portion in large granular structures (Fig. 1E, arrowheads). Prolongation of the incubation time up to 4 h did not change the distribution pattern significantly (Fig. 1F), although the decrease in the amount of occludin localized at cell-cell contacts was notable. The treatment of MDCK cells in LC with the another protein kinase C activator diC8 resulted in the redistribution of occludin, which was similar to the effect of 2 nm PMA. Fragmentary staining of occludin at cell-cell contacts was evident 2 h after the addition of diC8 (Fig. 1G). The amount of occludin translocated to cell-cell contacts further increased when the incubation time was prolonged up to 4 h (Fig. 1H). Previous studies have shown that occludin localized in TJ cannot be extracted with non-ionic detergents from confluent epithelial cells and that it shows a decreased electrophoretic mobility due to extensive phosphorylation (16Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 17Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar, 21Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In accordance with literature data (17Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar), occludin extracted with Triton X-100 from MDCK cells grown in NC migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, whereas that from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction migrated as multiple unresolved bands with apparent molecular masses ranging between 60 and 82 kDa (Fig. 2A,lane 1). When MDCK cells were incubated in LC in order to down-regulate TJs, the high molecular mass bands disappeared from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and the amount of Triton X-100-insoluble occludin decreased significantly (Fig. 2A,lane 2). When TJ re-assembly was induced by calcium switch, the banding pattern of Triton X-100-insoluble occludin was restored (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Four hours after the addition of 2 nm PMA to the cells in LC, the amount of Triton X-100-insoluble occludin increased significantly and a portion of occludin underwent an upward band shift (Fig.2A, lane 4). Treatment of cells in LC with 25 nm PMA for 4 h resulted in an additional increase in the amounts of Triton X-100-insoluble occludin and in the degree of upward band shift, with a concomitant decrease in the amount of Triton X-100-soluble occludin (Fig. 2A, lane 5). The decrease is probably due to increased proteolysis, since high concentrations of PMA are known to cause degradation of occludin (21Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Clarke H. Soler A.P. Mullin J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in Triton X-100-insoluble occludin and an upward band shift were also evident in cells treated with 0.5 mm diC8 for 4 h (Fig. 2A, lane 6). The multiple bands revealed by immunoblotting analysis probably represent differently phosphorylated occludin molecules. In order to show that the upward band shift induced by PMA was due to phosphorylation, MDCK cells were treated with PMA and occludin immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was subjected to in vitro phosphatase treatment. Fig.2B shows that the additional high molecular weight occludin bands disappeared on alkaline phosphatase treatment. Therefore, the upward band shift of occludin induced by PMA is due to phosphorylation of occludin, and changes in the cellular distribution of occludin induced by the treatment of MDCK cells in LC by PMA or diC8 are paralleled by its phosphorylation. Fig. 3 shows the time and concentration dependence of PMA-induced phosphorylation of occludin. As high molecular weight bands corresponding to phosphorylated occludin were invariably found to be Triton X-100-insoluble, only Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were analyzed. Addition of PMA to MDCK cells incubated in LC medium resulted in a dose-dependent phosphorylation of occludin (Fig. 3A). When PMA was added for 1 h, the phosphorylation was evident at 2.5 nm PMA and reached a maximum at 40 nm PMA. The time dependence of occludin phosphorylation in MDCK cells in LC induced by 25 nm PMA is shown on Fig. 3B. The upward band shift became evident after 5 min and reached a maximum 40 min after PMA addition. The striking effects of the PKC activators PMA and diC8 on the phosphorylation and distribution of occludin suggest that PKC may be a physiological regulator of occludin function. To investigate the involvement of PKC in the regulation of occludin incorporation into TJs, the assembly of tight junctions was induced by the calcium switch procedure in the presence or absence of the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X and occludin localization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Four hours after switching to NC, continuous occludin staining was evident at intercellular contacts, indicating the recruitment of occludin into tight junctions (Fig.4A). Inhibition of PKC with 5 µm GF-109203X resulted in very weak staining of occludin at the intercellular contacts but a prominent staining of occludin in cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). It can be concluded from these data that PKC participates in the targeting of occludin into TJs. Furthermore, GF-109203X inhibited the redistribution of occludin to the regions of cell-cell contacts induced by PMA (Fig. 4, C andD) and diC8 (Fig. 4, E and F). In order to study the involvement of PKC in the phosphorylation of occludin, the effect of GF-109203X on calcium switch-induced occludin phosphorylation was investigated. The characteristic multiple-band pattern of occludin is seen on the immunoblot in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of MDCK cells incubated in NC medium (Fig.5, NC). High molecular weight bands disappeared when cells were incubated in LC medium, indicating the dephosphorylation of occludin (Fig. 5, LC). Four hours after switching to NC, a profound upward band shift of occludin was visible on the immunoblot, reflecting the increased phosphorylation of occludin (Fig. 5, +Ca2+). When the calcium switch was performed in the presence of 5 µm GF-109203X, the extent of occludin phosphorylation was markedly decreased, indicating the involvement of PKC. Similarly, the increase in phosphorylation of occludin induced by PMA and diC8 was significantly decreased by GF-109203X, again indicating the involvement of PKC (Fig.5, +PMA and +diC8). To investigate whether occludin may serve as a substrate for protein kinase C, recombinant occludin (MBP fusion protein of the soluble cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of murine occludin or MBP-occludin) was incubated in vitro with purified PKC (a mixture of α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms of PKC) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown on Fig. 6 (lane 1), an autoradiography signal was detected corresponding to a protein of ∼74 kDa (the predicted molecular mass of MBP-occludin is 73.6 kDa), implying that MBP-occludin was phosphorylated by protein kinase C. No autoradiography signal was detected when MBP-occludin or PKC was omitted (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and3), excluding the possibilities that the autoradiography signal was due to autophosphorylation of PKC or to any kinase activity that might have co-purified with MBP-occludin. The phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by 5 µm GF-109203X (Fig. 6,lane 4). Another MBP fusion protein, MBP-β-galactosidase, with a predicted molecular mass of 53.5 kDa was phosphorylated to a much lower extent, indicating the relative specificity of occludin phosphorylation by PKC (Fig. 6, lane 5). To determine which sites of occludin are phosphorylated by PKC, occludin was analyzed by in-gel digestion using chymotrypsin, trypsin, Asp-N, or Lys-C, followed by peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Comparison of the peptide mass fingerprints of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated occludin revealed a distinct mass peak at m/z 1256.532 (theoretical m/z 1256.535) corresponding to the phosphorylated fragment333RSYPESFYK341 after Lys-C digestion of occludin treated with PKC (Fig.7a). This peak was not present when PKC was omitted (Fig. 7b). The site of phosphorylation within the phosphorylated occludin fragment was determined by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Based on the double charge ion with m/z 628.78, the spectrum (Fig.8) shows a peak corresponding to the neutral loss of H3PO4 (98 Da). The evidence for the phosphorylation of Ser338 comes from the mass of the b2 and b3 ions corresponding to the non-phosphorylated NH2-terminal part, whereas the ions with a mass greater than 700 Da appear as b6-98, b7-98, b8-98, and y6-98. No evidence of a concurrent phosphorylation was found at any other position. From mass spectrometry data, it can be concluded that Ser338 of mouse occludin is phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro.Figure 8Identification of Ser338as an in vitro phosphorylation site. MS/MS spectrum of the peptide 333RSYPEpSFYK (pS, phosphoserine residue) with the double charged ion m/z = 628.78 Da. The base peak with m/z = 579.73 Da results from the neutral loss of H3PO4 (98 Da). Parts of the spectrum are magnified by 2 to aid the observation of lower abundance product ions. Relevant ions are labeled according to the accepted nomenclature (23Biemann K. Scoble H.A. Science. 1987; 237: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Both the b ions and the y ions in the spectrum that contain the phosphoserine are produced by consecutive fragmentation reactions, whereby the amide bond is broken and H3PO4 is lost, or vice versa. The masses of the b2 and b3ions correspond to the unphosphorylated NH2-terminal part, whereas the ions with a mass greater than 700 Da confirm the phosphorylation of Ser338.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Occludin phosphorylation has been implicated in the regulation of tight junction function (16Sakakibara A.

Biol. 1999; 170: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but the molecular pathways involved remain unclear. The present study establishes the importance of the protein kinase C pathway in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of occludin. The redistribution of occludin from the cytoplasm to the lateral plasma membrane has been observed after the treatment of MDCK cells in LC with 2 nm PMA or 0.5 mm of more specific PKC activator diC8. This probably reflects the insertion of occludin into TJs, since the formation of tight junction fibrils was reported under similar conditions (4Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The amount of occludin translocated to the lateral plasma membrane increases with PMA concentration, but the staining of occludin becomes discontinuous. This observation is in agreement with studies reporting the disruption of TJs and increase in occludin proteolysis in response to the treatment of MDCK cells with very high (0.1–1 µm) concentrations of PMA (21Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Clarke H. Soler A.P. Mullin J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here clearly indicate that a Triton X-100-insoluble pool of occludin is phosphorylated upon the addition of the protein kinase C activators PMA or diC8 to MDCK cells incubated in low calcium medium. Previously, the time course of occludin phosphorylation induced by a calcium switch was shown to be paralleled by TJ formation (16Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In this study, a low but easily distinguishable level of upward band shift of occludin caused by the 4-h incubation of MDCK cells with 2 nm PMA correlates well with the low amounts of occludin translocated to the lateral cell membrane. Correspondingly, the increased phosphorylation caused by 25 nm PMA is paralleled by the increased amounts of occludin translocated to TJs. These observations support the assumption that the phosphorylation of occludin in response to PMA or diC8 is involved in the regulation of TJ assembly. The degree and rate of occludin phosphorylation induced by PMA are the same or even higher compared with those induced by the calcium switch; phosphorylation is induced by rather low concentrations of PMA, indicating that diacylglycerols, along with calcium ions, are physiological regulators of occludin phosphorylation. High molecular weight forms of occludin that appeared after the treatment of the cells in LC by PMA or diC8 were invariably not extractable with Triton X-100. It can be concluded that the phosphorylation regulates the association of occludin with the cytoskeleton and/or detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (24Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Verkade P. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Innis-Whitehouse W. Eastburn K.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Future investigations should clarify which detergent-insoluble structures interact with occludin and how the phosphorylation of occludin regulates these interactions. Both the phosphorylation of occludin and its incorporation into tight junctions induced by calcium switch were markedly inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X. These observations indicate that PKC participates in the regulation of occludin function during tight junction assembly induced by calcium switch. Previously, the application of the PKC inhibitor has been shown to inhibit the development of transepithelial electrical resistance, a functional measure of tight junction biogenesis (25Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Occludin, the only known transmembrane protein of TJ whose localization in tight junctions is dependent on its phosphorylation state, may be a key target in the PKC-mediated regulation of tight junctions. Other authors have noted similarities between occludin and connexins in terms of phosphorylation and structure (16Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The data presented here extend the similarities further; connexin43 is phosphorylated by PKC in response to PMA, and the phosphorylation dramatically changes gap junction channel conductivity (26Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Possibly, the assembly of the junctional complex is regulated by PKC via the phosphorylation of connexin43 and occludin to coordinate the formation of a functionally active barrier and the function of intercellular channels. The phosphorylation and redistribution of occludin induced by PKC activators were strongly inhibited by the application of GF-109203X. These observations further substantiate the specificity of the regulation of occludin functions by PKC. The simplest explanation for the observed occludin phosphorylation induced by PMA or diC8 is that PKC directly phosphorylates occludin when stimulated by PMA, although the possibility that PKC activates an intermediate kinase(s) cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the in vitro phosphorylation of the recombinant occludin COOH-terminal domain by PKC was investigated. The carboxyl-terminal domain of occludin has been recently shown to be responsible for the targeting of occludin to the TJs (27Mitic L.L. Schneeberger E.E. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and for its interaction with other proteins (28Nusrat A. Chen J.A. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Tom J. Cromwell M. Quan C. Mrsny R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29816-29822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the COOH-terminal domain of occludin may be phosphorylated by classical isoforms of PKC, which are known to be expressed in MDCK cells (30Godson C. Masliah E. Balboa M.A. Ellisman M.H. Insel P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To date, only casein kinase 2 has been reported to phosphorylate the COOH-terminal domain of occludin in vitro, whereas a number of tested kinases did not phosphorylate occludin (31Cordenonsi M. Turco F. D'atri F. Hammar E. Martinucci G. Meggio F. Citi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, there are no indications of the involvement of casein kinase 2 in the regulation of TJ functions. Despite the use of four different proteases to produce various peptides of occludin, Ser338 of occludin was the only phosphorylation site for classical PKCs that was positively identified by MS. On the other hand, the presence of multiple phosphorylated forms of occludin in vivo was demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (19Hirase T. Kawashima S. Wong E.Y. Ueyama T. Rikitake Y. Tsukita S. Yokoyama M. Staddon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10423-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The appearance of multiple phosphatase-sensitive occludin bands resulting from treatment of MDCK cells with PMA indicates the multiple phosphorylation of occludin. Whereas it is possible that some phosphorylation sites might not have been identified by MS, the absence of additional phosphorylation sites suggests that other kinase(s) must phosphorylate occludin in vivo. These may include non-classical PKC isoforms, some of which are known to be associated with TJs (32Dodane V. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Izumi Y. Hirose H. Tamai Y. Hirai S.-I. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and which have different substrate sequence motifs from those of classical PKCs (34Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), or an intermediate kinase(s) which is activated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates occludin at different positions. Ser338 is located within a ∼100-amino acid stretch of occludin, which was shown to be dispensable for the binding to ZO-1 (29Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and for the targeting of occludin to TJs (27Mitic L.L. Schneeberger E.E. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, the significance of the phosphorylation on Ser338 is not clear. Taken together, our data outline the importance of the protein kinase C pathway in the regulation of occludin function at tight junctions. Further analysis of the PKC pathway will lead to a better understanding of the functional biochemistry of occludin and tight junctions.

https://openalex.org/W2067067698,"ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are bifunctional multimers assembled by an ion conductor and a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) ATPase. Sensitive to ATP/ADP, K(ATP) channels are vital metabolic sensors. However, channel regulation by competitive ATP/ADP binding would require oscillations in intracellular nucleotides incompatible with cell survival. We found that channel behavior is determined by the ATPase-driven engagement of SUR into discrete conformations. Capture of the SUR catalytic cycle in prehydrolytic states facilitated pore closure, while recruitment of posthydrolytic intermediates translated in pore opening. In the cell, channel openers stabilized posthydrolytic states promoting K(ATP) channel activation. Nucleotide exchange between intrinsic ATPase and ATP/ADP-scavenging systems defined the lifetimes of specific SUR conformations gating K(ATP) channels. Signal transduction through the catalytic module provides a paradigm for channel/enzyme operation and integrates membrane excitability with metabolic cascades."

To date, two serine/threonine protein phosphatases, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), have been demonstrated to function as ceramide-activated protein phosphatases. In this study, we show that treatment with either anti-FAS IgM (CH-11) (150 ng/ml) or exogenousd-(e)-C6-ceramide (20 μm) induces the dephosphorylation of the PP1 substrates, serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, in Jurkat acute leukemia T-cells. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, but not the PP2A-specific inhibitor, okadaic acid, inhibited both FAS- and ceramide-induced dephosphorylation of SR proteins. Anti-FAS IgM treatment of Jurkat cells led to a significant increase in levels of endogenous ceramide beginning at 2 h with a maximal increase of 10-fold after 7 h. A 2-h pretreatment of Jurkat cells with fumonisin B1 (100 μm), a specific inhibitor of CoA-dependent ceramide synthase, blocked 80% of the ceramide generated and completely inhibited the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to anti-FAS IgM. Moreover, pretreatment of Jurkat cells with myriocin, a specific inhibitor of serine-palmitoyl transferase (the first step in de novo synthesis of ceramide), also blocked FAS-induced SR protein dephosphorylation, thus demonstrating a role for de novo ceramide.

In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous ceramide and FAS activation on SR proteins in Jurkat acute leukemia T-cells and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. We demonstrate that SR proteins are dephosphorylated by endogenous ceramide derived from thede novo sphingolipid pathway and through PP1 activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsd-(e)-C6-ceramides were obtained from Matreya Inc. The catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) was purchased from Promega Corporation. The recombinant catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase 1γ (PP1γc), okadaic acid, caspase inhibitors, and calyculin A were purchased from Calbiochem. Mouse anti-FAS IgM (CH-11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. mAb104 (phospho-SR protein antibody) hybridoma cells were purchased from ATCC. Mouse anti-human ASF/SF2 (SRp30a) was the gracious gift of Dr. Adrian Krainer (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, NY). Fumonisin B1 was purchased from Alexis Corporation.Cell CultureJurkat (acute lymphocytic T-cell leukemia) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented withl-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 200 units/ml of penicillin G sodium, and 200 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate. Cells were maintained at densities between 2 × 105 and 1.2 × 106 cells/ml under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). For treatments with ceramide and anti-FAS monoclonal antibody, Jurkat cells were diluted to 3.75 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated for at least 2 h under standard incubator conditions prior to treatment.A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were grown in 50% RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with l-glutamine/50% low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 units/ml of penicillin G sodium, and 200 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate. Cells were maintained under 80% confluency and standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). For treatments with ceramide, A549 cells were plated at 4 × 105cells/ml in 35-mm dishes 16 h prior to treatment.Western BlottingBoth Jurkat and A549 cells were directly lysed using Laemmli buffer as described (42Chao R. Khan W. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23459-23462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat and A549 whole cell lysates (20 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PDVF membranes, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk, washed with phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, and incubated 1.5 h with primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Blots were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 and incubated 45 min with the secondary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Phosphatase AssaysReactions were carried out in 1.5 ml of polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and the appropriate amount of ceramide or ethanol vehicle were mixed in a 1.5-microcentrifuge tube. Stock enzyme (PP1γc or PP2Ac) was diluted 1:100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 milliunits were added to each tube. Tubes containing PP2Ac or PP1γc and Buffer A were pre-incubated for 10 min at 30 °C before addition of purified SR proteins. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of purified phosphorylated SR proteins (1 mg/ml) in Buffer A. After 1 h at 30 °C, the assay was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling of the reactions for 10 min. Quantitative dephosphorylation of SR proteins was observed by Western immunoblotting and mAb104 as described above.Quantification of Ceramide LevelsPulse Labeling with [3 H]Palmitic Acid2 × 106 Jurkat cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (16.7 nm) with simultaneous addition of anti-FAS CH-11 antibody or control mouse IgM. After 7 h, lipids were extracted from the radiolabeled cells using the Bligh-Dyer method as described (43Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

Ceramide levels were normalized to total lipid phosphate.DISCUSSIONPreviously, Bcl-2, c-Jun, and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) were demonstrated to be dephosphorylated in response to ceramide in cells, and this effect was mediated by PP2A, a CAPP (32Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 34Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

In this study, we demonstrate a novel in vitro and in vivo pathway involving PP1 as a CAPP with SR proteins as substrates. We further demonstrate that ceramide generated through activation of the de novo sphingolipid pathway activates PP1 in response to FAS. These findings are important for several reasons. First, protein phosphatase 1 is now shown to be a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase in cells, and specific roles for different CAPP species are better defined. Second, for the first time, a specific pathway/pool of ceramide, generated in the de novo pathway, is shown to activate protein phosphatase 1 in cells. Third, SR proteins, an important family of RNA splicing factors, have been demonstrated as novel targets for certain apoptotic agonists.Treatment with either exogenous ceramide or FAS antibody led to dephosphorylation of SR proteins. This differs from a previous report from Utz et al. who reported that FAS activation increased the phosphorylation of SR proteins in Jurkat cells (60Utz P.J. Hottelet M. van Venrooij W.J. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This observation may be a result of the Nonidet P-40 lysis system employed. This cell lysis method does not solubilize the nuclei in Jurkat cells. Using a direct lysis method, as done in this study, the phosphorylation status of total SR proteins is directly determined. We clearly demonstrate that SR proteins are dephosphorylated in response to ceramide and FAS activation. This effect on SR proteins was not due to proteolytic degradation as caspase inhibitors had no effect on ceramide-induced dephosphorylation of SR proteins. The non-phosphoepitope antibody to the SR proteins, ASF/SF2 (SRp30a), demonstrated only changes in molecular weight and no loss in immunoreactivity in contrast to the specific phospho-SR protein antibody, mAb104. Furthermore, calyculin A, an inhibitor of both PP1 and PP2A, completely blocked ceramide- and FAS-induced SR protein dephosphorylation, while okadaic acid at concentrations that only affect PP2A in cells had no effect. Therefore, both FAS and ceramide induce phosphatase-dependent and caspase-independent dephosphorylation of SR proteins.Moreover, the results with the phosphatase inhibitors along with the observation that only PP1c and not PP2Ac is able to dephosphorylate SR proteins in vitro in response to ceramide clearly define PP1 as the CAPP-regulating SR protein dephosphorylation. These findings are consistent with several previous studies. First, two spliceosomal-targeting subunits for PP1, PSF, and NIPP-1 were reported (40Hirano K. Erdodi F. Patton J.G. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, Lamond and co-workers reported that PP1c and not PP2Ac dephosphorylate SR proteins in nuclear extracts (38Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Third, Misteli and Spector demonstrated that exposure of permeabilized nuclei to PP1 will change the nuclear distribution of SR proteins (39Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Endogenous ceramide levels have been observed to increase in response to FAS by several laboratories (50Cuvillier O. Edsall L.

In this study, most of the endogenous ceramide produced in response to FAS activation resulted from activation of de novo ceramide synthesis. This conclusion is based on the observation that fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of the generation of de novo ceramide, decreased endogenous ceramide in response to FAS activation by 80%. Of interest to note, fumonisin B1 pretreatment did not block all of the endogenous ceramide generated in response to FAS. This may indicate specificity of the de novo sphingolipid pathway for PP1 activation or that the magnitude of the ceramide response plays a role in PP1 activation. We hypothesize that the remaining 20% increase in response to FAS activation may be generated by either neutral or acid sphingomyelinases, both of which have been suggested to mediate ceramide increases in response to FAS activation. Further studies to answer both questions are currently being investigated.The effect of FAS activation on the phosphorylation state of SR proteins was not observed until 3 h posttreatment with anti-FAS IgM. Thus, dephosphorylation of SR proteins did not begin until there was a significant increase in endogenous ceramide levels. Using several methods, it was clearly demonstrated that the activation by PP1 is dependent on this increase in endogenous ceramide. First, two specific inhibitors of the de novo sphingolipid pathway, fumonisin B1 and myriocin, completely blocked FAS-induced dephosphorylation of SR proteins in Jurkat cells. Second, in a different de novo ceramide model, A549 cells treated with exogenous ceramide, fumonisin B1 also completely inhibited the dephosphorylation of SR proteins. Furthermore, overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase completely abrogated the ability of exogenous ceramide to induce SR protein dephosphorylation in A549 cells. Thus, in this study, the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to FAS and exogenous ceramide was dependent on endogenous ceramide generation.Another implication of this study pertains to the regulation of the phosphorylation of SR proteins in response to apoptotic stimuli. Thus the question is, what are the consequences of the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in the apoptotic process? SR proteins are known to modulate alternative mRNA processing, and dephosphorylation of certain SR protein species has been shown to regulate alternative splicing (38Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.

Many apoptotic regulators such as Bax, Bcl-x, caspase 9, and caspase 2 have been shown to be alternatively spliced with the splice variants having opposite/dominant-negative activities (69–81). By dephosphorylating SR proteins, posttranscriptional processing of various genes can be affected, and therefore any regulation of SR proteins can affect the gene expression of key apoptotic regulators via changes in alternative splicing inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of SR proteins has been shown to occur in response to various mitogens; thus, dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to apoptotic agonists may enhance the execution of the apoptotic response (62Manley J.L.

The Mechanism and Physiological Significance of Insulin-induced Alternative Splicing of PKCbeta pre-mRNA. UMI, Ann Arbor, MI1997Google Scholar).In this paper, it was demonstrated that SR proteins are dephosphorylated by FAS activation and exogenous ceramide treatment. Mechanistically, this effect is dependent on endogenous ceramide generation from de novo ceramide synthesis. Furthermore, PP1 is implicated as a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase in cells and as the protein phosphatase species regulating SR protein dephosphorylation. Therefore, this study defines a novel and specific module of in vivo activation of PP1 by de novoceramide leading to subsequent dephosphorylation of SR proteins (Fig.9). Several lines of evidence have suggested ceramide as an important regulator of various stress responses and growth mechanisms. First, formation of ceramide from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin or fromde novo pathways is observed in response to inducers of stress such as TNFα, γ-interferon, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, IL-1, ultraviolet light, heat, chemotherapeutic agents, FAS antigen, and nerve growth factor (1Okazaki T.

https://openalex.org/W2133956002,"Odorant receptors and signaling proteins are localized to sensory cilia on olfactory dendrites. Using a GFP-tagged odorant receptor protein, Caenorhabditis elegans ODR-10, we characterized protein sorting and transport in olfactory neurons in vivo. ODR-10 is transported in rapidly moving dendritic vesicles that shuttle between the cell body and the cilia. Anterograde and retrograde vesicles move at different speeds, suggesting that dendrites have polarized transport mechanisms. Residues immediately after the seventh membrane-spanning domain of ODR-10 are required for localization; these residues are conserved in many G protein-coupled receptors. UNC-101 encodes a μ1 subunit of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex. In unc-101 mutants, dendritic vesicles are absent, ODR-10 receptor is evenly distributed over the plasma membrane, and other cilia membrane proteins are also mislocalized, implicating AP-1 in protein sorting to olfactory cilia."

Previous studies demonstrated that human keratinocytes express the full-length extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) and an alternatively spliced variant lacking exon 5 and suggested their involvement in calcium regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. To understand the role of the CaR, we transfected keratinocytes with an antisense human CaR cDNA construct and examined its impact on calcium signaling and calcium-induced differentiation. The antisense CaR cDNA significantly reduced the protein level of endogenous CaRs. These cells displayed a marked reduction in the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to extracellular calcium or to NPS R-467, a CaR activator, whereas the ATP-evoked rise in [Ca2+]i was not affected. Calcium-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and calcium-stimulated expression of the differentiation markers involucrin and transglutaminase were also blocked by the antisense CaR cDNA. When cotransfected with luciferase reporter vectors containing either the involucrin or transglutaminase promoter, the antisense CaR cDNA suppressed the calcium-stimulated promoter activities.

On the other hand, the message levels of AltCaR remain relatively unchanged throughout differentiation (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These changes in CaR expression are consistent with the reduction in [Ca2+]i and IP3 response to [Ca2+]o during differentiation (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and further support a role for CaR in keratinocyte differentiation. In the present study, we transfected an antisense CaR cDNA construct into undifferentiated keratinocytes to elucidate the role of CaRs in calcium sensing and calcium-induced differentiation. We report here that the full-length antisense CaR cDNA construct significantly reduced the protein level of endogenous CaRs. In these cells, the [Ca2+]i response to an increase in [Ca2+]o was inhibited, as were calcium-induced inhibition of proliferation and calcium-stimulated expression of the differentiation markers involucrin and transglutaminase. These results demonstrate that CaR-mediated calcium signaling is required for keratinocyte differentiation. Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal human foreskins and grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as described previously (9Gibson D.F. Ratnam A.V. Bikle D.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were isolated from newborn human foreskins by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 4 °C, 16 h), and primary cultures were established in KGM containing 0.07 mmcalcium. First- and second-passage keratinocytes were plated in KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium and used in the experiments described below. To construct a vector expressing CaR antisense RNA, a 3.3-kb human CaR cDNA fragment (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) containing the entire open reading frame was subcloned in an antisense orientation into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which expresses a neomycin resistance gene. The 3.7-kb fragment of the human involucrin promoter (a gift from Dr. L. B. Taichman) (16Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the 2.2-kb fragment of the human keratinocyte transglutaminase promoter (a gift from Dr. R. Rice) (17Mariniello L. Qin Q. Jessen B.A. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31358-31363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pGL-3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), linking them to the firefly luciferase gene to generate involucrin and transglutaminase promoter/reporter constructs (gifts from Dr. D. Ng), respectively. First-passage keratinocytes were transfected with the CaR antisense cDNA construct or pcDNA3.1 vector using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) or Mirus Trans-It keratinocyte transfection reagent (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Transfected cells were then incubated in KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium for 2 days before G418 selection. Cells were then selected with 300 µm G418 for 3 days prior to further study. At this point, membrane protein was prepared, and the level of endogenous CaR was measured by Western analysis (see below). To examine the impact of antisense CaR on the expression of differentiation marker genes, transfected cells were switched to KGM containing 1.2 mm calcium for an additional 2 days before harvest. Total RNA was isolated, and the message levels for involucrin, transglutaminase, and antisense CaR were quantitated by Northern analysis (see below). To monitor the impact of antisense CaR on the calcium-stimulated transcriptional activation of involucrin and transglutaminase genes, the antisense CaR cDNA construct was transiently transfected into second-passage keratinocytes together with either involucrin-luciferase or transglutaminase-luciferase constructs and with a β-galactosidase gene expression vector, pRSV-gal (18Carroll J.M. Taichman L.B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 925-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), used to normalize the transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were incubated overnight in KGM supplemented with 0.03 mmcalcium. The next day, fresh KGM containing 0.03 or 1.2 mmCaCl2 was added to the cultures. Cells were lysed 48 h later, and the cell extract was assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-light kit (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA). Chemiluminescence produced by the luciferase and β-galactosidase assays was measured by a luminometer (model BG-1; GEM Biomedical., Hamden, CT). Every experiment was done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The effect of antisense CaR cDNA on cell proliferation was assessed by measuring the rate of DNA synthesis. Preconfluent keratinocytes were transfected with the CaR antisense cDNA construct or pcDNA3.1 vector and selected with G418 as described above. Transfected cells were then incubated in fresh KGM containing 0.03 or 1.2 mm calcium for 24 h, with the last 4 h in 2 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine (77 Ci/mmol [methy-3H]thymidine; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Finally, the cells were solubilized in 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity in the washed acid precipitate was measured in a scintillation counter. Every experiment was done in triplicate and repeated twice. Crude plasma membranes were isolated from cultured human foreskin keratinocytes and from human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells transfected with human cDNA for full-length or spliced variant CaR as described previously (15Oda Y.

Briefly, the cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the membrane fractions were extracted with RIPA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 20 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 µg/ml aprotinin). The protein concentration in these membrane preparations was determined by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Membrane protein samples were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; 0.45 µm; Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking, the blot was incubated with a polyclonal anti-CaR antibody, either ADDR or BoCaR#3 (a gift from Dr. Dolores Shoback), which reacts with both full-length human CaR and its splice variant, AltCaR, or with another polyclonal anti-CaR antibody, hCaR4/6, which specifically reacts with AltCaR. The ADDR antibody was raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 215–236 of the human CaR (ADDDYGRPGIEKFREEAEERDI), and BoCaR#3 was raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 916–936 of the bovine CaR (SSKSNSEDPFPQQQPKRQKQP) (20Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hCaR4/6 antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to the fusion splice junction between exon 4 and exon 6 in human CaR (KKVEAWQVPFSNCSR). As a control for specificity, the antibody was preabsorbed with the specific synthetic peptide against which the antibody was raised. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibody was visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Kit (Pierce) and subsequent exposure to x-ray film. The data presented are representative of three independent experiments. The localization of endogenous CaR proteins in cultured human keratinocytes was detected by immunostaining. Second-passage keratinocytes on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After blocking, cells were incubated with a polyclonal anti-CaR antibody, BoCaR#2 (a gift from Dr. Dolores Shoback), which was raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 215–236 of the bovine parathyroid CaR (20Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and subsequently incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Finally, the cells on coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Gel-Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined with a Leica TCS NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Total RNA was isolated using RNA-STAT 60 reagent (TEL-TEST “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty µg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted onto a nylon filter (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were hybridized with the appropriate 32P-labeled cDNA probe (P1–2 for involucrin (a gift from Dr. Howard Green), hTG for transglutaminase (a gift from Dr. Robert Rice), and 18 S ribosomal RNA probe for normalization). To detect the antisense CaR transcript, the RNA blots were hybridized with a32P-labeled 320-nucleotide sense strand RNA probe. The blots were then washed twice in 1× SSC/0.1% SDS and twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Bound radioactivity was detected by exposing the blot to x-ray film. The data presented are representative of three independent experiments. The [Ca2+]i response to elevated [Ca2+]o was measured using a Dual-wavelength Fluorescence Imaging System (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as described previously (22Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, preconfluent keratinocytes were transfected with the antisense human CaR cDNA construct or pcDNA3.1 vector on a coverslip in KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium. Three days after 300 µm G418 selection, transfected cells were loaded with 5 µm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 0.1% Pluronic F127 in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 1 mg/ml glucose) containing 0.07 mm calcium. Cells were then washed and measured in buffer A containing 0.03 mm calcium before exposure to 1.2 or 5 mmcalcium or to the calcimimetic compound NPS R-467 (provided by Dr. Edward F. Nemeth; NPS Pharmaceuticals, Salt Lake City, UT), a selective CaR activator (24Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Van Hung B.C.P. Wagenen B.C. Delmar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The cells were alternately illuminated with 340 and 380 nm light, and the fluorescence at emission wavelength 510 nm was recorded. The signals from 15–40 single cells for each measurement were recorded. Each sample was calibrated by the addition of 20 µm ionomycin (Rmax) followed by 20 mm EGTA/Tris, pH 8.3 (Rmin). Intracellular calcium concentration was calculated from the ratio of emission at the two excitation wavelengths based on the formula (23Grnkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) [Ca2+]i =KdQ(R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R), R =F340/F380,Q =Fmin/Fmax at 380 nm, andKd for Fura-2 for Ca2+ is 224 nm. [Ca2+]i measurement of suspended keratinocytes was carried out as described previously (11Bikle D.D. Ratnam A. Mauro T. Harris J. Pillai S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, undifferentiated keratinocytes were transfected with the antisense human CaR cDNA construct or pcDNA3.1 vector and selected by G418 as described above. Transfected cells were trypsinized and loaded with Fura-2 AM in buffer A at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were then washed and resuspended in buffer A at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were placed in a quartz cuvette, and [Ca2+]i was measured in buffer A containing 0.03 mm Ca2+, after which the response to 1 µm NPS R-467 was recorded. Then 1.2 mm Ca2+ was added to record the response to extracellular calcium. Fluorescence was recorded with a fluorimeter (650-40; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 340 and 510 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Each sample was calibrated by the addition of 20 µm ionomycin (Fmax) followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm EGTA/Tris, pH 8.3 (Fmin). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the formula [Ca2+]i = Kd(F −Fmin)/(Fmax −F), where Kd for Fura-2 for Ca2+ is 224 nm. Each data point shows the mean ± SD of triplicate determinations. We previously reported that human keratinocytes express the transcripts of the CaR, both the full-length form and its alternately spliced variant (AltCaR) lacking exon 5 (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To detect the presence of CaR proteins, we analyzed membrane extracts from preconfluent human keratinocytes by Western blotting. The CaR was detected using a peptide affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against human CaR, ADDR (Fig.1A). Although this antibody could detect both forms of CaR, the reaction with full-length CaR is stronger than that with AltCaR (Fig. 1A). ADDR specifically detected three bands of 120, 160, and 185 kDa in the human keratinocytes grown in serum-free medium containing either 0.03 or 1.2 mm calcium (Fig. 1A, left panel). ADDR also detected a minor band of 130 kDa in keratinocyte membranes, which was best observed on longer-exposed film (data not shown). The 160-kDa band corresponds to one of the two major glycosylated forms of CaR (with sizes of 140 and 160 kDa), whereas the 120-kDa band corresponds to the nonglycosylated form of CaR expressed in HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for the full-length human CaR (Fig. 1A, left panel). The 130-kDa band corresponds to the single band of CaR expressed in HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for AltCaR. The size of the 130-kDa band is consistent with the spliced variant lacking 77 amino acids of exon 5 that we have previously shown has altered glycosylation. The identity of the 185-kDa band remains unclear, although it specifically reacted with ADDR antibody. Preincubation of ADDR antibody with the specific peptide to which it was raised prevented detection of these bands (Fig. 1A, right panel). These bands were also detected by another anti-CaR antibody, BoCaR#3, which was raised against a peptide derived from the intracellular domain of CaR protein (data not shown). To confirm that the 130-kDa protein present in keratinocyte membranes is the spliced variant of human CaR, the same blot was incubated with hCaR4/6 antibody, which specifically reacts with the CaR splice variant (Fig. 1B). This antibody detected the 130-kDa band in keratinocytes and in HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for the spliced variant of CaR (Fig.1B, left) but not the full-length CaR. No immunoreactive band was observed when the blot was incubated with the same antibody preabsorbed with the specific peptide against which it was raised (Fig.1B, right panel). We next performed fluorescence immunostaining to detect CaR protein in fixed preconfluent keratinocytes cultured in 1.2 mm calcium using an anti-CaR antibody, BoCaR#2, which recognizes the full-length and spliced forms of human CaR. Examination by confocal microscopy confirmed that a low level of CaR protein is localized on the plasma membrane in some of the cells, whereas the majority of the CaR protein is expressed throughout the cytoplasm of keratinocytes (Fig.2). To elucidate the role played by CaRs in calcium sensing and keratinocyte differentiation, we transfected an expression construct with full-length human CaR cDNA in the antisense orientation into undifferentiated keratinocytes. The transfectants were selected with neomycin analogue G418 in KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium for 3 days to enrich transfected cells. Total RNA and membrane proteins were then prepared and subjected to Northern and Western analyses, respectively, to examine the expression of the CaR antisense transcript and the level of endogenous CaR protein. Northern analysis using a sense strand CaR RNA as probe showed that the keratinocytes transfected with the CaR antisense cDNA construct efficiently expressed the full-length CaR antisense strand transcript (Fig. 3A). Moreover, Western analysis of the membrane proteins by BoCaR#3 (Fig. 3B) or hCaR4/6 (Fig. 3C) antibody showed that the expression of both the 160-kDa full-length CaR (Fig.3B) and its 130-kDa spliced variant (Fig. 3C) was decreased in the cells transfected with the antisense CaR construct as compared with the cells transfected with empty vector. In this experiment, hCaR4/6 also detected a 115-kDa band in HEK293 cells but not in keratinocytes (Fig. 3C); however, this band is not detected by BoCaR#3 antibody. We next evaluated the effects of the CaR antisense cDNA construct on calcium sensing by examining the [Ca2+]iresponse to raised [Ca2+]o in the transfected keratinocytes. As shown in Fig.4A, raising [Ca2+]o from 0.03 to 5 mm induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in keratinocytes transfected with empty vector from 90 ± 9 to 803 ± 114 nm(mean ± S.D.; n = 31). Keratinocytes transfected with the CaR antisense cDNA had comparable basal [Ca2+]i (57 ± 6 nm;n = 27). However, these cells displayed a marked reduction in the rise of [Ca2+]i (to 238 ± 28 nm) in response to 5 mm extracellular calcium. Because transfection of CaR antisense cDNA could not completely block CaR expression (as shown in Fig. 3), the residual CaR protein presumably accounts for the residual 35% of the [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]oin these cells. The reduction of the [Ca2+]iresponse by antisense CaR was also observed when the [Ca2+]o was raised from 0.03 to 1.2 mm (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, [Ca2+]i in keratinocytes transfected with vector increased from 79 ± 20 to 243 ± 49 nm(n = 40) in response to 1.2 mm[Ca2+]o, whereas the cells transfected with the CaR antisense cDNA displayed a slow increase of [Ca2+]i from 75 ± 11 to 131 ± 12 nm (n = 36). To test the specificity of the antisense CaR cDNA transfection, we examined its impact on the [Ca2+]i response induced by ATP through the activation of P2 purinergic receptors and by the calcimimetic NPS R-467, a positive modulator of the CaR (24Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Van Hung B.C.P. Wagenen B.C. Delmar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that extracellular ATP evoked a rapid and transient mobilization of calcium from intracellular sources in keratinocytes (25Pilai S. Bikle D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the current study, ATP (100 µm) induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i (from 223 ± 12 to 295 ± 21 nm; n = 21) in keratinocytes transfected with empty vector in the presence of 1.2 mm calcium (Fig.5A). ATP also evoked a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i to the same magnitude (from 106 ± 10 nm to 172 ± 18 nm;n = 15) in the cells transfected with the antisense CaR cDNA, whereas extracellular calcium failed to induce a [Ca2+]i response (Fig. 5A). We have previously shown that NPS R-467 raised [Ca2+]iand stimulated differentiation in keratinocytes (12Tu C.-L. Oda Y. Bikle D.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5B, 1 µm NPS R-467 increased [Ca2+]i in the cells transfected with vector in the presence of 0.03 and 1.2 mm extracellular calcium (from 93 ± 11 to 123 ± 10 nm and from 241 ± 18 to 302 ± 19 nm, respectively; n = 15). In contrast, the NPS R-467-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was abolished in the cells transfected with the antisense CaR cDNA, as was the response to [Ca2+]o (n = 18; Fig.5B). To compare these results with our previous studies (12Tu C.-L. Oda Y. Bikle D.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we examined the NPS R-467-elicited [Ca2+]iresponse in suspended keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 5C, in the cells transfected with vector, 1 µm NPS R-467 increased the [Ca2+]i from 158 ± 40 nm (Basal) to 233 ± 20 nm(+R467) in the presence of 0.03 mm extracellular calcium. Subsequent addition of 1.2 mm extracellular calcium raised [Ca2+]i to 381 ± 39 nm (+R467 +Ca2+). However, in the cells transfected with the antisense CaR cDNA, the ability of NPS R-467 to raise [Ca2+]i was blunted (an increase from 159 ± 10 to 181 ± 13 nm) at a [Ca2+]o of 0.03 mm, as was the response to the subsequent addition of 1.2 mm[Ca2+]o (increased to 219 ± 36 nm). These results demonstrate that the CaR antisense construct specifically blocks the [Ca2+]iresponse to [Ca2+]o mediated by endogenous CaR. One of the key characteristics of calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation is an inhibition of cell proliferation (1Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of CaR in calcium-induced differentiation, we first examined the effect of antisense CaR cDNA transfection on proliferation by measuring the rate of DNA synthesis. After transfection with the CaR antisense cDNA construct or empty vector and selection by G418 in KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium for 3 days, keratinocytes were either maintained in 0.03 mm calcium or switched to 1.2 mm calcium for 24 h, and the rate of DNA synthesis was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In the keratinocytes transfected with vector, 24 h of incubation in 1.2 mm calcium resulted in a reduction of DNA synthesis to 46.6 ± 0.1% as compared with the control cells maintained in 0.03 mm calcium (Fig. 6). In contrast, DNA synthesis was minimally affected by 1.2 mmcalcium (99 ± 19% of control) in the keratinocytes transfected with antisense CaR cDNA (Fig. 6). We next examined the ability of the antisense CaR construct to block calcium induction of the differentiation markers involucrin and transglutaminase. As shown in Fig. 7, 48 h of incubation in 1.2 mm calcium significantly increased the levels of involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA in keratinocytes transfected with vector. However, the stimulation of involucrin and transglutaminase expression by calcium was blocked by the antisense CaR cDNA construct. Basal levels of involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA at 0.03 mm calcium were little affected by the antisense CaR cDNA construct. To determine whether CaR mediates the calcium-induced transcriptional activation of the involucrin and transglutaminase genes, involucrin or transglutaminase promoter/reporter constructs were transiently cotransfected with the antisense CaR cDNA construct, and their response to calcium was then evaluated (Fig.8). Raising [Ca2+]ofrom 0.03 to 1.2 mm induced a nearly 5-fold increase in involucrin promoter activity. Antisense CaR cDNA suppressed this increase (Fig. 8A). Similarly, transglutaminase promoter activity was increased 3-fold in response to 1.2 mmextracellular calcium, an increase that was completely blocked by the antisense CaR cDNA construct (Fig. 8B). These data indicate that the induction of both involucrin and transglutaminase by calcium requires CaR. Conceivably the neomycin analogue G418 could affect the [Ca2+]i response and cell differentiation in keratinocytes by stimulating the CaR. However, our pilot experiments had shown that 300 µm G418, which was used to enrich transfected cells, did not raise [Ca2+]i in keratinocytes in the presence of 0.03 mm[Ca2+]o (data not shown). Furthermore, G418 at this concentration did not drive cultured keratinocytes toward differentiation because only very low levels of the differentiation markers involucrin and keratinocyte transglutaminase were detected in the transfected cells before exposure to 1.2 mm[Ca2+]o (Fig. 7). Moreover, similar results were obtained in keratinocytes transfected with a CaR antisense construct carrying a hygromycin-resistant gene and subsequently selected by 100 µg/ml hygromycin (data not shown). Extracellular calcium tightly controls the balance between proliferation and differentiation in a number of different cell types. In mesenchymal fibroblasts (26Mailland M. Waelchli R. Ruat M.

Gynecol. 1998; 178: 305-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), increased extracellular calcium promotes proliferation. It has been shown that the CaR modulates this proliferative response to extracellular calcium through activation of Src kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (27McNeil S.E. Hobson S.A. Nipper V. Rodland K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, in keratinocytes (1Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), breast epithelial cells (29Ochieng J. Tahin Q.S. Booth C.C. Russo J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and intestinal epithelial cells (30Black B.L. Smith J.E. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), differentiation is promoted, whereas proliferation is inhibited by elevated extracellular calcium. The question this study addresses is whether the CaR is also involved in that cellular response to calcium. We reported previously that keratinocytes express the full-length CaR and its alternatively spliced variant (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The transcript of the full-length CaR is predominantly expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes, and its level decreases as the cells differentiate (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The changes in CaR expression are consistent with the finding that the [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]ois maximal in undifferentiated cells and is attenuated as the cells differentiate (15Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The notion that CaR modulates the cellular response to extracellular calcium is further supported by the ability of a selective CaR activator, NPS R-467, to potentiate the [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]oand to activate the genes required for cornified envelope formation (12Tu C.-L. Oda Y. Bikle D.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed the expression of CaR proteins in keratinocytes. Because the blockage of CaR production specifically reduced the [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]o and to NPS R-467, our results indicate that CaR mediates calcium sensing directly or indirectly in keratinocytes. Transfection of the antisense CaR cDNA also suppressed the calcium-induced inhibition of proliferation and calcium-stimulated expression of involucrin and transglutaminase genes. These results are complementary to our findings (22Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in a mouse model in which the synthesis of full-length CaR was disrupted (31Ho C. Conner D.A.

The loss of the full-length CaR altered the morphologic appearance of the epidermis and resulted in a reduction in the expression of the differentiation related gene, loricrin (22Oda Y. Tu C.-L.

Furthermore, epidermal keratinocytes isolated from these animals displayed a reduced [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]o(22Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that CaR is one of the critical factors that modulate keratinocyte differentiation in vitro andin vivo by mediating calcium sensing and/or by coupling to other calcium signaling molecules important for proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Immunocytochemical localization studies revealed that in keratinocytes, a low level of CaR protein is expressed on the plasma membrane, whereas its cellular localization is mostly cytoplasmic. Nonetheless, substantial cytoplasmic localization of CaR, often a perinuclear distribution, is commonly observed in other cell types, i.e.rat chondrogenic RCJ.C5.18 cells (32Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (33Kanatani M. Sugimoto T. Kanzawa M. Yano S. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), osteoblasts and articular and growth plate chondrocytes (34Chang W. Tu C. Chen T.-H. Komuves L. Oda Y. Pratt S.A. Miller S. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5883-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pancreatic acinar cells (35Bruce J.I. Yang X. Ferguson C.J. Elliott A.C. Steward M.C. Case R.M. Riccardi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20561-20568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unclear whether intracellular CaR represents nascent receptor protein being processed through the biosynthetic pathway or whether it has distinct biological functions. Indeed, the possibility that CaR mediates calcium sensing not only on the plasma membrane but also within the endoplasmic reticulum has been suggested (36Brown E. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Although our observations that the antisense CaR specifically reduced the [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]ocan be understood as indicating a role for calcium sensing of extracellular calcium by the CaR, it is conceivable that antisense CaR transfection could disrupt a CaR-mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores or a CaR-mediated increase in calcium influx through calcium channels. In either case, the [Ca2+]o-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i would be blocked by inhibition of CaR production, and differentiation would subsequently be aborted. Thus, the role of the CaR in calcium-mediated keratinocyte differentiation remains open for further investigation, but this study indicates that it has such a role. We are grateful to Dr. Dolores Shoback for providing anti-CaR antibodies and Dr. Edward F. Nemeth for providing NPS R-467. We thank Sally Pennypacker for providing human epidermal keratinocytes."

Based on our identification of three distinct protein bands interacting with an antibody to InsP6K, we explored data bases and uncovered a sequence that might represent a third InsP6K. We now describe the molecular cloning and characterization of human InsP6K3 (hInsP6K3), a new member of the InsP6 kinases family with high densities in the brain and localizations in the nucleus and cytoplasm. [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3and [3H]InsP6 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was prepared by phosphorylating [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 using yeast IPMK (17Saiardi A.

Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71450) Google Scholar). We were able to localize InsP6K1 and InsP6K2 genes on chromosome 3 and to identify on chromosome 6 a new gene with substantial similarity to the InsP6Ks (see “Results”). We used the sequence information to synthesize the following gene-specific oligonucleotide primers: GSP1 (5′-GGTGGCTTCCATTATGTAGGAACTGATAG-3′) and GSP2 (5′-GTGTCACAGTACACGCATCCCTGTGTCC-3′). We used these primers to perform 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a human brain Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The hInsP6K3 cDNA was amplified from the 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends products using the supplied AP1 oligo and cloned in NotI site of Bluescript SK+. The plasmid was sequenced on both strands using a PerkinElmer Abi Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Foster City, CA). The ORF for human InsP6K3 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the following primers: 5′-GCGTCGACCATGGTTGTGCAAAACAGCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCATTCTCCCTCTTGGATATCC-3′, and subcloned in theSalI site of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX 4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ORF hInsP6K3 was also polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the following oligos 5′-GCACTCGAGTCATGGTTGTGCAAAACAGCGC-3′ and 5-GCAGAATTCTCATTCTCCCTCTTGGAT-3′ and subcloned in the XloI and EcoRI sites of the pTrcHis expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). We used His-hInsP6K3 to mutagenize lysine 217 to alanine and serine 335 to alanine using the following oligo: K217A, 5′-CCCTGTGTCCTGGATCTGGCCATGGGGACCCGGCAGCAC-3′ and complement; S335A, 5′-CATACCGCTTCTATTCCAGCGCTCTCCTTGTCATCTATG-3′ and complement. Transformation of Escherichia coli (strain BL21), induction with isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside and isolation of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins using glutathione agarose (Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo) and of poly(His)-tagged proteins using Talon resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant hInsP6K3 (10–20 ng) was incubated at 37 °C in 20 µl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 6 mm MgCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01 mg/ml phosphocreatine kinase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). About 5000 cpm of the specific 3H-labeled inositol phosphate was added. Kinetic parameter determinations were done under initial rate conditions (<10% of product formation). The assays were quenched with ice-cold perchloric acid and neutralized before HLPC analysis as described previously (21Shears S.B. Shears S.B. Signaling by Inositides: A Pratial Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 33-52Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity of recombinant enzymes was assessed using a 4.6 × 125-mm Partisphere SAX column (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). The column was eluted with a gradient generated by mixing Buffer A (1 mm Na2EDTA) and Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1.3 m(NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.8, with H3PO4) as follows: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–10 min, 0–30% B; 10–60 min, 30–100% B; and 60–75 min, 100% B. The fractions (1 ml) were collected and counted using 5 ml of Ultima-Flo AP LCS-mixture (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Total RNA was isolated from various mouse organs using LiCl precipitation methods (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA (20–40 µg) was loaded on 1% agarose/formaldehyde/MOPS gel and transferred to HybondTMN+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ORFs for hInsP6K3 were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using oligo labeling as described (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly frozen mouse brain sections (2–3 months old, C57/Black6 male) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized, and hybridized in 50% formamide, 5% SSC with 100 ng/ml of unhydrolyzed digoxygenin-labeled probe overnight at 55 °C. The sections then were washed, blocked, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 4% normal goat serum in TBS with antidigoxygenin-AP antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:5000 dilution. After washing in TBS, the slides were developed with 1 ml of color development solution containing 3.375 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium, 3.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, and 0.24 mg/ml levamisole, in the dark. The color reaction was allowed to run for 48 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped in double distilled H2O, and the slides were sealed in Aquapolymount. Unique probes for hInsP6K3 were generated from cDNA corresponding to the ORF of hInsP6K3 subcloned in the SalI site of Bluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The templates were generated by T7 and T3 RNA polymerases. The sense control probes used at equal concentrations generated no specific signal. The ORF of InsP6K1, InsP6K2, and InsP6K3 were subcloned in the sites XhoI and EcoRI of enhanced green fluorescent protein pEGFP-C1 plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). GFP-mInsP6K1, GFP-hInsP6K2, and GFP-hInsP6K3 plasmids were transient transfected into 70% confluent HEK 293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, INc.). The cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% (w/v) glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal-calf serum. After 24 h, transiently transfected cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and washed three times in PBS. The nuclei were stained with 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min. Images of fluorescent cells were obtained on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 display about 60% similarity in amino acid sequence. A sequence of 18 amino acids located in the catalytic domain of the enzymes is identical to mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2. In Western blot analysis of rat brain, an antibody raised against this conserved domain (Fig.1A) reveals a major broad band at about 49 kDa and a faint band at about 60 kDa (Fig. 1B). Preimmune serum interacts with the 60-kDa band but not with the prominent 49-kDa band. Because InsP6K purified from rat brain migrates as a 50-kDa band (23Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dorman G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and the calculated molecular mass of cloned mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 is about 49 kDa (17Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), we conclude that our antibody specifically recognizes InsP6Ks. Western blot analysis of multiple tissues reveals the same broad and prominent band with the highest density in whole brain, cerebellum, and spleen, intermediate levels in the heart and testis, and the lowest levels in the kidney and liver. Preabsorption with the InsP6K peptide utilized in raising the antibody abolishes the 49-kDa band (Fig. 1C). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis reveals two InsP6Ks bands (Fig. 1D), whereas Bis-Tris NuPage gel electrophoresis analysis focused on molecular masses in the InsP6K range discriminates three bands, suggesting that three discrete InsP6K enzyme proteins might exist (Fig. 1,E and F). To search for a putative third InsP6K, we examined a human genomic data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/), screening with the known sequences of mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 and located three discrete genes. mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 both occur on chromosome 3 at 3q11.1 and 3p21.31 regions, respectively. A novel gene is located on chromosome 6 (region 6p21), which we tentatively designated hInsP6K3 on the basis of its substantial sequence similarity to the other InsP6K genes (Fig. 3). Chromosome 6q24.1 also contains a sequence that has substantial of homology to InsP6K2 but that lacks intron-exon organization and so is likely a pseudogene. We employed 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to clone hInsP6K3 from a human brain cDNA library (GenBankTM accession number AF393812). The putative hInsP6K3 cDNA possesses 2,391 nucleotides (Fig.2). The cDNA sequence comprises 102 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated regions rich in G/C (64%) and does not contain an in frame start or stop codon. The ORF is codified by 1233 nucleotides, and the putative start codon is preceded by a 5′-CCGCC-3′ region similar to the Kozak consensus sequence responsible for the translation starting site (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region consists of 1056 nucleotides and terminates with a 21-nucleotide poly(A) tail beginning 15 nucleotides downstream of a candidate polyadenylation signal. The DNA homology with other members of the InsP6K family in the ORF is 36–46% (Table I). Homology is lower in the untranslated regions.Table ISequence similarities between the three mammalian InsP6KsDNA homologyAmino acid identityAmino acid similarity%%%mInsP6K1 vs. hInsP6K2394864mInsP6K1 vs. hInsP6K3465064hInsP6K2 vs.hInsP6K3364560DNA homology was calculated using a Blasta program (20Altschul S.F.

The GenBank™ accession numbers of the sequences are: mInsP6K1,AF177144; hInsP6K2, AF177145; hInsP6K3, AF393812. The human InsP6K3 gene defines a protein containing 410 amino acids with a molecular weight of 46,431 and a theoretical pI of 8.28. This contrasts with mInsP6K1, which contains 433 amino acids, a molecular weight of 49,215 and a theoretical pI of 6.64, whereas hInsP6K2 possesses 426 amino acids, a molecular weight of 49,180, and a theoretical pI of 6.52. InsP6K3 display 51 and 45% sequence identity to InsP6K1 and InsP6K2, respectively, which possess 48% identity to each other. Thus, hInsP6K3 appears to be a somewhat smaller protein than mInsP6K1 or hInsP6K2 and is substantially more acidic than the other proteins. The more acidic character of InsP6K3 may derive from its lower content of basic amino acids. Thus, hInsP6K3 possesses 22 lysines in contrast to 25 and 35 lysines in mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2, respectively. hInsP6K3 possesses 24 arginines, whereas mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 possess 32 and 25 arginines, respectively. The sequence comprising the 18-amino acid peptide used to generate the antibody to InsP6K is highly conserved in the InsP3 kinases (25Dewaste V. Pouillon V. Moreau C. Shears S. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), IPMK (19Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 (17Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and is identical in the three InsP6Ks (amino acids 210–228 in hInsP6K3) (Fig. 3). This sequence comprises a crucial part of the catalytic site including a lysine that binds inositol phosphates that presumably account for its conservation (26Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Splicing sites in InsP6K1, InsP6K2, and InsP6K3 are virtually identical (Fig. 3), indicating that the genomic structures of the three genes are essentially the same. To assess the catalytic activity of this new member of the InsP6 kinase family, we expressed a glutathioneS-transferase-hInsP6K3 construct in E. coli (Fig. 4A). The purified protein runs as a single band with a molecular weight corresponding to the sum of glutathione S-transferase and InsP6K3. Incubation of the purified enzyme with [3H]InsP6 for 1 h at 37 °C leads to a substantial reduction of the [3H]InsP6 peak in HPLC analysis and the appearance of a major peak corresponding to authentic InsP7 (Fig. 4B), establishing that InsP6K3 converts InsP6 to InsP7. We have previously showed that mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2 can employ inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) as a substrate (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Incubation of InsP6K3 with [3H]InsP5 leads to a substantial reduction in the [3H]InsP5 peak in HPLC analysis and the appearance of a prominent peak corresponding to authentic PP-InsP4 (Fig. 4C). We also observe a third, smaller peak that elutes identically to a peak obtained when we incubate [3H]InsP5 with mInsP6K1 or hInsP6K2. We have previously identified this peak as bis-diphosphoinositol trisphosphate (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, hInsP6K3, like mInsP6K1 and hInsP6K2, can add two pyrophosphate groups to InsP5. We fail to detect metabolic activity when enzyme preparations are incubated with [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 or [3H]InsP7 (data not shown). Analysis of hInsP6K3 kinetic parameters reveals a Kmof 0.9 µm and a Vmax 0.6 µmol/mg/min for InsP6 and a Km of 5.5 µm and a Vmax 0.8 µmol/mg/min for Ins(1,3,4,5,6)IP5. To investigate portions of hInsP6K3 that may be critical for catalytic activity we performed selected mutations. Previous studies have identified a lysine in InsP3KA that is critical for catalytic activity, presumably because it participates in binding the inositol phosphate substrate (26Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In hInsP6K3 this lysine occurs at position 217. Converting this lysine to an alanine abolishes enzymatic activity (Fig.5). Although mInsP6K1, hInsP6K2, hInsP6K3, and IPMK are part of the same large family of inositol phosphate kinases, the sequences of IPMK and the InsP6Ks are markedly divergent. One area of amino acid identity comprises an SSLL sequence (19Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which, in hInsP6K3 occurs at amino acids 334–337 (Fig. 3). Mutation of serine 335 to alanine virtually eliminates enzyme activity (Fig.5). Northern blot analysis reveals two prominent bands at 6 and 2 kilobases, respectively, with two fainter bands at lower molecular weight (Fig.6A). These four bands are present in all tissues examined but at varying densities. The tissue with highest density of any bands is the cerebellum, in which the two largest bands are especially abundant. Moderate levels are evident in the kidney, whereas other tissues have lower levels. The presence of multiple putative mRNA species implies the existence of alternative splicing. In situ hybridization in mouse brain reveals discrete localizations for hInsP6K3 mRNA (Fig. 6B). In cerebellum the highest densities occur in Purkinje cells with somewhat lower levels in granule cells. In hippocampus substantial densities occur in CA1–CA4 layers of the hippocampus as well as in the dentate gyrus. No hybridization is evident with a sense probe. To evaluate the disposition of hInsP6K3 protein, we conducted Western blot analysis of a virtually pure neuronal culture of embryonic (E18) rat cerebral cortex (Fig. 1E). We observe all three bands, indicating that the three enzymes are all expressed in neurons. However, we cannot rule out their expression in glia as well. To examine the intracellular localizations of hInsP6K3 protein, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with GFP fusion constructs of hInsP6K3, mInsP6K1, and hInsP6K2 and examined localizations by confocal microscopy (Fig. 7). We observe notable differences in the localizations of the three enzymes. The disposition of mInsP6K1 is similar to that of GFP itself with comparable amounts of staining in the nucleus and cytoplasm. By contrast, hInsP6K2 appears to be almost exclusively nuclear. hInsP6K3, on the other hand, appears to predominate in the cytoplasm with only modest nuclear levels. In the present study we have cloned and characterized hInsP6K3, a new member of the InsP6K family. hInsP6K3 was identified by screening human genome data base. We found no other gene that would be a likely candidate for a fourth InsP6K. Our antibody to a peptide that is very highly conserved in all InsP6 kinases recognized only three bands in brain preparations. This suggests that there may exist only three InsP6Ks, although the human genome is not yet completely assembled so that we cannot fully rule out the presence of a fourth InsP6K. The Km and Vmax values for InsP6K3 with InsP6 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 are similar to those for InsP6K1 (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the two enzymes physiologically metabolize both substrates. With InsP6K2 the Km value for Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is 8 µm, about 20 times itsKm for InsP6, suggesting selective actions on InsP6. Vmax values for InsP6K2 using both substrates are 5–8-fold lower than for InsP6K3 and InsP6K1 (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies indicated a selective localization of hInsP6K3 to discrete neuronal populations in the brain with notably high densities in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. We have observed virtually identical localizations for mInsP6K1 (27Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Nagata E. Keqiang Ye T.S.J. Luo X. Jain S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2001; 31: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and hInsP6K2. 2E. Nagata and S. H. Snyder, manuscript in preparation. Thein situ hybridization studies indicate that these enzymes occur in all Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and all pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Thus, it would appear that individual cells contain all three enzymes. Might the three enzymes manifest different functions in the same cells? Their differing intracellular localizations are consistent with this possibility. Thus, hInsP6K2 is almost exclusively nuclear, and mInsP6K1 occurs at similar densities in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas hInsP6K3 is predominantly cytoplasmic. The principal functions suggested for the inositol pyrophosphates involve nuclear events as well as the disposition of vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. A prominent nuclear role for inositol pyrophosphates is implied by our observations that these substances mediate stimulated homologous recombination. 3H. R. Luo, A. Saiardi, and S. H. Snyder, manuscript in preparation. West and co-workers (28Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) identified InsP6 as an important factor of end-joining DNA repair in mammalian nuclei mediated by DNA-dependent protein kinase (28Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that InsP7 and InsP8 might be the physiologic mediators of this action. Apoptosis, which involves nuclear events, appears to be influenced by InsP6K2 (16Morrison B.H.

Thus, deletion of InsP6K2 diminishes interferon-β induced apoptosis in tumor cells in culture, whereas cells overexpressing InsP6K2 are more susceptible to interferon-β-induced cell death (16Morrison B.H.

https://openalex.org/W2118442022,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variants share significant sequence similarity with typical E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating) enzymes of the protein ubiquitination pathway but lack their characteristic active site cysteine residue. The MMS2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes one such ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant that is involved in the error-free DNA postreplicative repair pathway through its association with Ubc13, an E2. The Mms2-Ubc13 heterodimer is capable of linking ubiquitin molecules to one another through an isopeptide bond between the C terminus and Lys-63. Using highly purified components, we show here that the human forms of Mms2 and Ubc13 associate into a heterodimer that is stable over a range of conditions. The ubiquitin-thiol ester form of the heterodimer can be produced by the direct activation of its Ubc13 subunit with E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) or by the association of Mms2 with the Ubc13-ubiquitin thiol ester. The activated heterodimer is capable of transferring its covalently bound ubiquitin to Lys-63 of an untethered ubiquitin molecule, resulting in diubiquitin as the predominant species. In (1)H (15)N HSQC ((1)H (15)N heteronuclear single quantum coherence) NMR experiments, we have mapped the surface determinants of tethered and untethered ubiquitin that interact with Mms2 and Ubc13 in both their monomeric and dimeric forms. These results have identified a surface of untethered ubiquitin that interacts with Mms2 in the monomeric and heterodimeric form. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin does not participate in this interaction. These results suggest that the role of Mms2 is to correctly orient either a target-bound or untethered ubiquitin molecule such that its Lys-63 is placed proximally to the C terminus of the ubiquitin molecule that is linked to the active site of Ubc13."

Recent biochemical and cell biological studies have shown that components of the cadherin-catenin adhesion complex in epithelial adherens junctions are targeted by caspases during apoptosis. In epithelial cells, desmosomes represent a second type of anchoring junctions mediating strong cell-cell contacts. Using antibodies directed against a set of desmosomal proteins, we show that desmosomes are proteolytically targeted during apoptosis. Desmogleins and desmocollins, representing desmosome-specific members of the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, are specifically cleaved after onset of apoptosis. Similar to E-cadherin, the desmoglein-3 cytoplasmic tail is cleaved by caspases. In addition the extracellular domains of desmoglein-3 and desmocollin-3 are released from the cell surface by a metalloproteinase activity. In the presence of caspase and/or metalloproteinase inhibitors, both cleavage reactions are almost completely inhibited. As reported previously, the desmosomal plaque protein plakoglobin is cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis. Our studies now show that plakophilin-1 and two other major plaque proteins, desmoplakin-1 and -2, are also cleaved by caspases. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that this cleavage results in the disruption of the desmosome structure and thus contributes to cell rounding and disintegration of the intermediate filament system.

Once the cell death program is started, dramatic changes in cell morphology can be observed such as nuclear/cytoplasmic condensation, formation of membrane protrusions, DNA fragmentation, and disruption of the structural integrity followed by fragmentation into “apoptotic bodies” that are removed by subsequent engulfment by neighboring cells or macrophages. Many of these morphological changes can be attributed to the cleavage of structural and regulatory proteins by members of the caspase family of cysteine proteinases.

Desmosomes are punctate intercellular junctions located on the basolateral side primarily of epithelial cells. They provide mechanical strength to epithelial tissues by forming stable cell-cell contacts that are anchored to the keratin intermediate filaments, thereby connecting the intermediate filament system of neighboring cells within a tissue. Two types of transmembrane glycoproteins of the cadherin superfamily, the desmogleins (Dsg1–3)1 and the desmocollins (Dsc1–3), mediate cell-cell adhesion in desmosomes. At present conflicting results about the mechanism of desmosomal cell-cell adhesion exist (for review see Ref. 17Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). From studies in a nonadhesive fibroblastic host cell environment it appears that transfection with plakoglobin together with desmoglein and desmocollin results in substantial adhesion, suggesting that both types of cadherins are important for cell adhesiveness (18Marcozzi C. Burdett I.D.J. Buxton R.S. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 495-509PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tselepis C. Chidgey M. North A. Garrod D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the anchorage of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, a number of proteins have to be associated with the cytoplasmic tails of the desmosomal cadherins to form the desmosomal plaque. Two families of proteins appear to play a central role in the functional assembly and stabilization of desmosomes: members of the Armadillo protein family, namely plakoglobin and plakophilin1–3 (20Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cyt. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the plakin protein family (21Green K.J. Bornslaeger E., A. Kreis T. Vale R.

Dev. 1997; 7: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A number of studies performed to analyze the molecular structure of the desmosomal plaque suggest a highly complex network of interactions between these proteins. Within this network plakoglobin and plakophilin-1 are able to interact directly with the desmosomal cadherins and are involved in the recruitment of desmoplakin to the membrane. Moreover, it also appears that desmoplakins can bind to desmosomal cadherins (25Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Association with the intermediate filament system is mediated by plakophilins and desmoplakins (25Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J.

From these interaction studies a model for the structural assembly of the desmosomal plaque has emerged whereby plakoglobin links desmoplakin to the desmosomal cadherin tails, and plakophilin1-desmoplakin interactions extend the plaque laterally (17Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with data obtained by high resolution immunoelectron microscopy (28North A.J. Bardsley W.G. Hyam J. Bornslaeger E.A. Cordingley H.C. Trinnaman B. Hatzfeld M. Green K.J.

This in consequence implicates that cells irreversibly destined for cell death must have highly efficient mechanisms to inactivate cell-cell contacts. Cell junctions representing sites of cytoskeletal anchorage therefore appear to be predestined sites for cleavage by effector caspases. Adhesion complexes of epithelial and endothelial adherens junctions have previously been shown to be targeted by caspases during apoptosis (13Herren B. Levkau B. Raines E.W. Ross R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Schmeiser K. Grand R.J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Steinhusen U.

However, at present our knowledge about the fate of desmosomes during apoptosis is limited. It is known that plakoglobin, a protein localized in the desmosomal plaque and in adherens junctions, is cleaved by caspases after induction of apoptosis (32Brancolini C. Sgorbissa A. Schneider C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we report an extensive study analyzing the fate of desmosomes after induction of apoptosis. Similar to the classical cadherin family member E-cadherin, desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) is cleaved by caspase(s) and a metalloproteinase(s) during programmed cell death. Inhibitor studies, however, indicated that the metalloproteinase responsible for shedding of the desmoglein extracellular domain is not identical with the enzyme releasing the E-cadherin extracellular domain into the cell culture supernatant. Desmocollin-3 (Dsc3) cleavage was inhibited by the same metalloproteinase inhibitor. Moreover, the desmosomal plaque proteins desmoplakin-1 and -2 and plakophilin-1 were fragmented by caspase activity. This results in the disruption of desmosomes and concomitant breakdown of the keratin cytoskeleton as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. The cell lines HaCat and MDCK were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5% CO2. The monoclonal antibody directed against the desmoglein cytoplasmic domain (clone 62) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany); antibodies directed against desmocollin-3 (Dsc3-U114), desmoplakin-1 and -2 (DP1&2–2.15) (33Moll R. Cowin P. Kapprell H.P. Franke W.W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 54: 4-25PubMed Google Scholar), and cytokeratin pan were obtained from Progen (Heidelberg, Germany). The desmoglein-3 antibody (5H10) against the extracellular domain is described by Proby et al. (34Proby C.M. Ota T. Suzuki H. Koyasu S. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Wahl J.K. Wheelock M.J. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. Br. J. Derm. 2000; 142: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against plakophilin-1 head (anti-667) and repeat domains (anti-670) are described elsewhere (27Hatzfeld M. Haffner C. Schulze K. Vinzens U. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Alexa FluorTM488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa FluorTM594 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany). Caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor-1 were purchased from Calbiochem (Schwalbach, Germany), and TAPI was kindly provided by Dr. R. Black (Immunex, Seattle, WA). The active recombinant human caspase-3 (CPP32) was purchased from BD PharMingen (Heidelberg, Germany). Staurosporine and camptothecin were obtained from Sigma, and CompleteTM-EDTA protease inhibitor mix was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Apoptosis was induced in confluent monolayers of cells cultivated in 6-well dishes by addition of either 1 µmstaurosporine in Me2SO or 2 µg/ml camptothecin. Detached cells were harvested from the culture medium at 310 ×g for 10 min. These cells were pooled with adherent cells and incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 0.1 m KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmMbO 42−, 1 mmNaVO3, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and CompleteTM-EDTA protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 20,800 ×g), the supernatant was used for Western blotting. The total protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined with the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). For inhibitor studies, the cells were preincubated for 30 min with 50 µm Z-DEVD-FMK and/or 100 µm MMP inhibitor1 before addition of staurosporine. For solubilization of desmoplakins, the cells were incubated in lysis buffer, and after the addition of an equal volume of 8 murea they were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. 50 µg of total protein in 4× SDS loading buffer was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PolyScreen polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked with TST buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the first antibody (1 µg/ml for anti-desmoglein (Clone 62) and anti-desmoplakin (DP1&2–2.15); anti-plakophilin-1 antibody (anti-670) was diluted 1:5,000; anti-desmocollin-3 and anti-desmoglein-3 (5H10) antibodies were diluted 1:200 and 1:20, respectively) in TST for 1 h. After three washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TST for 30 min. Chemoluminescence detection was performed by exposure of Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) treated membranes to Biomax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Molecular masses of fragments were determined using BenchMarkTM Protein Ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell culture supernatants were collected at different time points after induction of apoptosis. After centrifugation (10 min, 20,800 × g), 1 ml of the supernatant was precleared by incubation with 30 µl of protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. Protein A beads were removed by centrifugation (20,800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and 40 µl of desmoglein-3 antibody (5H10) were added to the supernatant. After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, 40 µl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads was added and incubated for a further 1 h. Protein A beads were sedimented by centrifugation (1 min, 2,700 × g, 4 °C), washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), and resuspended in 20 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed as described above. The cells were grown for 18 h on gelatine-coated glass coverslips. 3 or 6 h after induction of apoptosis cells were washed with PBS and fixed immediately in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. For staining with anti-Dsg3 (clone 62) antibody and anti-plakophilin-1 (anti-670) cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice, and fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for another 20 min. Subsequently the cells were washed in PBS and after blocking with 0.1% (v/v) goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with first antibodies for 30 min at room temperature (anti-plakophilin-1 antibody (anti-670) was diluted 1:250). After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa FluorTM488 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa FluorTM594 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies for another 30 min and washed again before mounting with ProTaqs Mount Fluor (Biocyc, Luckenwalde, Germany). For double staining the cells were incubated with primary antibodies (2 µg/ml for anti-desmoplakin-1 and -2; 1:100 for anti-desmoglein-3 clone 5H10; 1:100 for anti-cytokeratin pan) under otherwise identical conditions. Analysis and photography were performed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with 63× magnification at excitation wavelengths 543 and 488 nm. Details on the microscopy setup are available on request. A recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-tagged cytoplasmatic domain of human desmoglein-3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and adsorbed on GST-agarose beads. Recombinant protein (5 µg) was digested with 60 ng of recombinant caspase-3 in 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 µm leupeptin, and 200 µg/ml aprotinin at 37 °C for 2 to 4 h. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the cleavage products were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Coomassie-stained protein bands were excised and sequenced by automated Edman degradation on a Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (model 473A). Our recent analysis of E-cadherin fragmentation during apoptosis revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin is cleaved by caspase-3 near the transmembrane domain, and, simultaneously, the extracellular domain is released from the cell surface by a metalloproteinase (16Steinhusen U. Weiske J. Badock V. Tauber R. Bommert K. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4972-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To examine whether desmosomal cadherins are cleaved in a similar way at intracellular and/or extracellular sites, apoptosis in HaCat cells was induced by staurosporine treatment, and the fate of desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) and desmocollin-3 (Dsc3) was analyzed in detergent extracts of cells by Western blotting. The intracellular domain of desmoglein was detected with the monoclonal anti-desmoglein antibody (clone 62). The specificity of this antibody for Dsg1 or Dsg3 was tested against GST-Dsg1 and GST-Dsg3 cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins. The antibody interacted strongly with Dsg3 and exhibited weak cross-reactivity with Dsg1 (not shown). The extracellular domain of Dsg3 was analyzed with the well characterized monoclonal anti-Dsg3 antibody (clone 5H10) (34Proby C.M. Ota T. Suzuki H. Koyasu S. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Wahl J.K. Wheelock M.J. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. Br. J. Derm. 2000; 142: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dsc3 was detected with the monoclonal anti-desmocollin-3 (clone Dsc3-U114) antibody (35Nuber U.A. Schäfer S. Stehr S. Rackwitz H.-R. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). HaCat cells responded to the apoptotic stimulus by changes in cell shape, fragmentation of the nucleus, and detachment from the substrate. Stimulation of apoptosis was confirmed biochemically in analyses for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage products (not shown). Dsg3 was almost completely cleaved within 24 h after staurosporine-induced apoptosis, and two Dsg3 fragments with apparent molecular masses of about 55 kDa (fragment 1) and 100 kDa (fragment 2) both reacting with the monoclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain were detectable in detergent extracts after 3–12 h (Fig. 1A). Quantification of the signal intensities for fragment 2 was highest around 9 h after induction of apoptosis and then declines during the next 12–15 h, suggesting that fragment 2 is further fragmented (not shown). A similar fragmentation pattern was observed in both staurosporine- or camptothecin-treated MDCK and HaCat cells (Fig. 1B), confirming that fragmentation of Dsg3 is not dependent on a specific cell line or apoptosis inducing agent. Analysis of the fragmentation pattern with the anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibody revealed cleavage products with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 100 kDa (Fig. 1C). The 80-kDa cleavage product was assigned as fragment 3. The 100-kDa fragment appears to be identical to fragment 2 because both fragments perfectly aligned when analyzed on the same gel (not shown). The molecular masses of fragments 1–3 suggested that Dsg3 is fragmented during apoptosis by three distinct intracellular and extracellular cleavages. In this context, it was expected that the extracellular cleavage reaction should release an extracellular domain fragment of Dsg3 into the cell culture supernatant. In immunopreciptitation experiments with anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibody, a 75-kDa fragment (fragment 4) was precipitated from the supernatants of apoptotic cells that increased in a time-dependent manner after induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1D). To further confirm these data, inhibitor studies were performed. In the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK, formation of fragment 2 was strongly inhibited when analyzed with anti-Dsg3 (clone 62) antibody, whereas generation of fragment 1 was less reduced (Fig.2A). The formation of fragments 2 and 3 was blocked when analyzed with anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibody (Fig. 2B). In our previous studies (16Steinhusen U. Weiske J. Badock V. Tauber R. Bommert K. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4972-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) we have shown that the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI inhibits shedding of the E-cadherin extracellular domain. Using this inhibitor, Dsg3 shedding could not be blocked (not shown). However, in the presence of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor-1 (MMPI-1) inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases 1, 8, 9, and 3 (36Odake S. Morita Y. Morikawa T. Yoshida N. Hori H. Nagai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), formation of fragment 1 was blocked, whereas fragment 2 was not affected when analyzed with anti-Dsg3 (clone 62) antibody (Fig. 2A). Fragments 2 and 3 where not affected when analyzed with anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibody (Fig.2B). Consistent with these data, shedding of the soluble fragment 4 was not affected in the presence of Z-DEVD-FMK (Fig.2C). In the presence of MMPI-1, however, the amount of fragment 4 in the cell culture supernatant was reduced (Fig.2C). All figures are representatives of at least three independent experiments. From these data we propose the following model (Fig. 2D). Fragments 2 and 3 result from two distinct caspase cleavages in the cytoplasmic tail of Dsg3 and encompass the entire extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and different parts of the intracellular domain dependent on the caspase cleavage site. Fragment 1 represents part of the extracellular domain C-terminal to the metalloproteinase cleavage site, the transmembrane domain, and the entire cytoplasmic domain.Figure 2Inhibition of cytoplasmic domain cleavage and extracellular domain shedding.A, formation of fragments 2 and 1 is inhibited in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK (DEVD) and the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor-1 (MMPI), respectively, as analyzed with anti-desmoglein (clone 62) antibody. B, in the presence of DEVD fragments 2 and 3 were not detectable when analyzed with anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibody. The addition of MMPI-1 did not affect the formation of fragments 2 and 3. C, in the presence of DEVD shedding of fragment 4 was not affected, whereas addition of MMPI-1 inhibited formation of fragment 4 as shown by immunoprecipitation with anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibody and subsequent Western blotting. For all experiments cells or cell culture supernatants were harvested 6 h after induction of apoptosis. D, schematic model of the apoptotic cleavage fragments of Dsg3 deduced from the detected fragmentation pattern. The epitopes detected by the anti-desmoglein (clone 62) and the anti-Dsg3 (5H10) antibodies are indicated as deduced from our data and from Ref. 34Proby C.M. Ota T. Suzuki H. Koyasu S. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Wahl J.K. Wheelock M.J. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. Br. J. Derm. 2000; 142: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, respectively. Co, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm this model we tried to identify the caspase cleavage site(s) in the Dsg3 cytoplasmic domain. However, the epitope detected by the anti-desmoglein antibody (clone 62) maps to the N-terminal half of the Dsg3 cytoplasmic domain and thus it was not possible to isolate the apoptotic fragment(s) generated from the Dsg3 cytoplasmic domainin vivo. Therefore, we tried to map the caspase cleavage site(s) by in vitro cleavage using a GST-Dsg3 cytoplasmic domain fusion protein as substrate for recombinant caspase-3. Two cleavage fragments were detectable (not shown), and subsequent N-terminal sequencing of the cleavage fragment(s) by Edman degradation allowed us to map a caspase-3 cleavage site C-terminal to amino acid Asp781. Unfortunately, no sequence data could be obtained for the second fragment. Analysis of the fate of desmocollin-3 after induction of apoptosis indicated that apart from desmogleins desmocollins are also proteolytically targeted in apoptotic cells. Desmocollins are subjected to alternative splicing resulting in two isoforms that differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domains (37Collins J.F. Legan P.K. Kenny T.P. MacGarvie J. Holton J.L.

After induction of apoptosis both the 109-kDa and the 100-kDa splice variants of Dsc3 were cleaved within 24 h (Fig.3A). As compared with the 109-kDa form, the 100-kDa splice variant appeared to be cleaved more efficiently. No specific cytoplasmic or membrane-bound cleavage products were detectable in cellular detergent extracts. This can be explained by the specificity of the anti-Dsc3 (clone Dsc3-U114) antibody that is directed against an epitope located in the Dsc3 extracellular domain. Moreover, analysis of the cytoplasmic domain amino acid sequence revealed only one obvious caspase cleavage site C-terminal to Asp734 in human Dsc3. If this site is used by endogenous caspases, an 18-amino acid fragment would be dele"

Synthesis of D-type cyclins and the assembly and nuclear translocation of cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (cdk4/6) complexes is required for commitment to G1entry, whereas the consequent cyclin E accumulation and activation of the associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) allows progression through G1 (20Lundberg A.S.

Cyclin D·cdk4/6 complexes trigger initial phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and titrate cdk2 inhibitors (cip1/kip1family), thus de-repressing cyclin E/cdk2 activity. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb by cyclin E/cdk2 is followed by release of the Rb-associated transcription factor E2F, which activates cyclin E transcription in a positive feedback loop, allowing the burst of cyclin E accumulation and activity in a narrow window coincident with the G1/S transition. E2F transcriptional activity is required to elicit timely induction of genes required for S phase progression, such as cyclin A2. Progression through the S phase coincident with the appearance of cyclin A2/cdk2 activity is followed by rapid down-regulation of cyclin E levels (20Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Eur. J.

We report evidence that SCF acts as a mitogenic factor in cultured c-kit-expressing spermatogonia and that both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)- and PI3K-dependent pathways are required for the proliferative response. The mitogenic effect is not accompanied by an increase in total cellular amount of cyclin D3 (24Feng L.X. Ravindranath N. Dym M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25572-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but it is associated with a rapid change in its subcellular localization. We also show that SCF is an anti-apoptotic factor for spermatogonia, but the MEK- or the PI3K-dependent pathways are not sufficient on their own to promote the survival response. Spermatogonia were obtained from either 5/6- or 8-day-old Swiss CD-1 mice, as reported previously (17Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Spermatogonial stem cells and proliferating but undifferentiated spermatogonia are the prevalent germ cell types at 5–6 days of age, whereas differentiating (type A1–A4, intermediate, and type B) spermatogonia predominate at 8 days of age (25Bellve A.R.

Gamete Res. 1986; 14: 245-254Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, germ cell suspensions were obtained by sequential collagenase-hyaluronidase-trypsin digestions of freshly withdrawn testes from 20 animals. To release cells completely, after the trypsin treatment, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium and pipetted at least 30 times and then brought to 20 ml with culture medium adding 2 mg/ml DNase and 10% fetal calf serum. Cell suspension was plated in Petri dishes (5 ml/dish) for 3 h in a humidified incubator at 32 °C to promote adhesion of somatic cells. At the end of this pre-plating treatment, enriched germ cell suspensions were washed from fetal calf serum, and spermatogonia were then cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 mmdl-lactic acid, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). For time course experiments, spermatogonia were either left untreated or stimulated with SCF (100 ng/ml, Genzyme) at different time points and then they were processed as described below. Where indicated cells were also incubated 1 h before SCF addition with 10 µm U0126 (catalog number V1121, Promega), with 10 µm LY294002 (catalog number 270-038-M005, Alexis), or with 1 µm tyrphostin AG490 (catalog number 658401, Calbiochem), all dissolved in Me2SO. In these experiments, an equal volume of the Me2SO solvent was also added in control and SCF-treated cultures. Nuclear morphology of spermatogonia after the pre-plating time and after 24 h of culture in the absence or constant presence of SCF and/or the signaling inhibitors was assessed after hypotonic shock of 105 cells (75 mm KCl) followed by fixation in methanol:acetic acid solution (3:1). Cells were then dropped onto glass slides to allow spreading of the nuclei and stained with Giemsa solution. Spermatogonia nuclei were judged as in interphase, metaphase, or apoptotic and counted from quadruplicate experiments. Somatic nuclei were excluded from the counts, and purity of spermatogonia was assessed as about 85% after the pre-plating treatment and almost 100% after 24 h of culture. DNA synthesis was studied by [3H]thymidine incorporation followed by autoradiography as previously described (17Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In these experiments, incubation with [3H]thymidine was performed during the last 4 h of the 24 h culture period. Cells were harvested, washed in cold PBS, and homogenized at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1/100th (v/v) of a pre-formed protease inhibitors mixture (P8340, Sigma). Total cellular proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked with PBS buffer containing 5% fat-free milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then hybridized with primary antibodies. After hybridization with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the immunocomplexes were detected with Supersignal West Pico detection reagent (Pierce). Primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt rabbit polyclonal (PhosphoPlus Akt (Ser-473) antibody kit, catalog number 9270, New England Biolabs Inc.); anti-phospho Erk1/2 mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-Erk2 rabbit polyclonal (sc-154, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-cyclin D3 mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-6283, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-cyclin E rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-481, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-cyclin A2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-751, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-Rb (aa 332–344) mouse monoclonal antibody (14001A, PharMingen); anti-Rb (carboxyl terminus) rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-p21Cip1/Waf1 mouse monoclonal antibody (catalog number sc-6246, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-c-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-788, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-cdk4 goat polyclonal antibody (sc-260-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). 2 × 106 viable cells were harvested and homogenized in 40 µl of a modified lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.4 µl of a pre-formed protease inhibitors mixture (P8340, Sigma). One hundred µg of proteins from clarified supernatants of whole cell lysates were incubated with 20 µg/ml anti-cyclin D3 monoclonal antibody or anti-cyclin E polyclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. The immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), respectively, for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times at 4 °C with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and once with the specific kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a 20-µl volume of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate, 0.2 µl of a pre-formed protease inhibitors mixture (P8340, Sigma), 2.5 mm EGTA, 50 µm ATP, 0.1 mm protein kinase A inhibitor, 3 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction, and the following specific substrates: 0.5 µg/reaction histone H1 (type III-S, Sigma) for cyclin E/Cdk2 and 0.5 µg/reaction GST-Rb (sc-4112, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for cyclin D3/Cdk4/6. Reactions were terminated by addition of 4× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography. Control and 1-h SCF-treated spermatogonia, preincubated or not with U0126 or LY294002, were spotted onto poly-l-lysine glass slides and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized 10 min with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin D3 antibody at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml and then 1 h at room temperature with cyanin 3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem). Slides were washed and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS and immediately examined by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were counterstained with 1 µg/ml Hoechst (catalog number 33342, Sigma). Control experiments were performed using mouse non-immune IgGs instead of the specific antibody. For in situ detection of apoptotic cell death, control and SCF-treated spermatogonia, preincubated or not with U0126, LY294002, or AG490, after a 24-h period of culture were spotted onto poly-l-lysine glass slides, fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde, and subjected to TUNEL assay with an in situ cell death detection kit (catalog number 1684817,Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with 1 µg/ml Hoechst (catalog number 33342, Sigma). Slides where then examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cultures of germ cells obtained from 8-day-old mice are particularly enriched in differentiating spermatogonia (25Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J.

Fig. 1shows that, after 24 h of culture, several nuclei with characteristic features of apoptosis, such as reduced size and intense chromatin staining, can be observed in untreated cells. In SCF-treated cultures, the frequency of such cells is clearly reduced (see the last paragraph of this section), and a clear increase in the number of mitotic figures (nuclei showing condensed metaphase chromosomes) can be appreciated. These data confirm that SCF is required to maintain the proliferative state of differentiating spermatogonia cultured in vitro (17Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev.

We studied DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in these cultures by using [3H]thymidine incorporation and metaphase counting. SCF induces a 2-fold increase in the number of [3H]thymidine incorporating cells and a 3-fold increase of metaphase counts with respect to the control after 24 h of culture (Table I). We also analyzed the effects of SCF addition in germ cell populations from 5- to 6-day-old mice, when undifferentiated spermatogonia are the predominant cell types (25Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C.

To investigate whether these c-kit-activated signaling pathways mediate the mitogenic activation of spermatogonia observed in vitro, the proliferation assays were performed in the presence of inhibitors selective for each of the three different pathways: the MEK inhibitor U0126, the JAK2 inhibitor tyrphostin AG490, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Table I). The inhibition of the MEK pathway abolished the SCF-induced increase in both [3H]thymidine incorporation and metaphase counts, demonstrating that the integrity of this pathway is required for SCF induction of mitogenesis. Inhibition of PI3K pathway also abolished SCF mitogenic effect, indicating that both MEK and PI3K pathways are required. On the contrary, inhibition of JAK2 signaling had no effect on SCF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation.

Feeding diets containing high levels of oleate to the SCD1−/− mice did not increase the levels of C18:1n-9 or C20:1n-9 in the HG and failed to restore the ADG to the levels found in the HG of the wild-type mouse. De novo ADG synthesis as measured by the incorporation of [3H]glycerol and [14C]glucose was high in the SCD1+/+ mouse but was reduced by greater than 90% in the HG of SCD1−/− mouse. The deficiencies in the levels of ADG and C20:1n-9 were not compensated for by the expression of SCD2 and SCD3 isoforms in the HG of the SCD1−/− mouse.

Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Most organs of different mouse strains express both SCD1 and -2 with the exception of liver, which expresses mainly the SCD1 isoform (3Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCD2 is constitutively expressed in the brain (3Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and like SCD1 is expressed at high levels in livers of mice that overexpress the truncated nuclear form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a (6Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the mouse SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3 genes are structurally similar, sharing ∼87% nucleotide sequence identity in the coding regions, their 5′-flanking regions differ somewhat resulting in divergent tissue-specific gene expression. However, in some tissues such as the adipose and eyelid both SCD1 and SCD2 genes are expressed whereas in the skin all the three SCD gene isoforms are expressed (5Zheng Y. Prouty S.M. Harmon A. Sundberg J.P. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The reason for having two or more SCD isoforms in the same tissue is not known but could be related to the substrate specificity of the isomers and their regulation through tissue-specific expression. The existence of multiple SCD genes in mice and rat tissues makes it difficult to determine the role of each gene in lipid metabolism. Most previous studies have assessed SCD gene function by measuring mRNA expression but have not differentiated which SCD isoform is responsible for the altered total SCD activity. The clue as to what the physiological role of the SCD1 gene and its endogenous products (the monounsaturated fatty acids) is has come from recent studies of the asebia mutant mouse strains (abj and ab2j) that have a natural mutation in the SCD1 gene (5Zheng Y. Prouty S.M. Harmon A. Sundberg J.P. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J.

Genet. 1999; 23: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most recently we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 gene (7Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and have shown that it has phenotypes similar but not identical to those present in the natural models. The 5′-boundary of the natural deletion in the SCD1 gene of the asebia mutant mouse has not been mapped within a 10-kilobase promoter region suggesting that this deletion could extend into other genes. Consequently, it has not yet been possible to generate appropriate DNA primers to distinguish the heterozygous asebia mice from the wild-type mice by genotyping. The basis for the difference in some phenotype between the laboratory and the natural mutant mouse strains could also be because of strain background modifying gene effects. The Harderian gland (HG) that was first described by Johann J. Harder in 1694 (10Harder, J. J. (1694) Acta Erudit Publ. Lipisiae, 49–52.Google Scholar) occurs in most terrestrial vertebrates and is located within the orbit of the eye where in most species it is the largest structure. The chief products of the gland vary between different groups of vertebrates. In rodents the gland synthesizes lipids, porphyrins, and indoles (11Payne A.P. J. Anat. 1994; 185: 1-49PubMed Google Scholar). The lipids are excreted by an exocytotic mechanism (12Seyama Y. Kasama T. Yasugi E. Park S.-H. Kano K. Webb S.M. Hoffman R.A. PuigDomingo M.L. Reiter R.J. Lipids in Harderian glands and their significance. Harderian glands. Porphyrin Metabolism, Behavioral and Endocrine Effects. Springer-Varlag, Berlin1992: 195-217Google Scholar). The major secretory lipid of the HG of the mouse has been identified as 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol (ADG) whereas in the rat the chief products are wax esters (11Payne A.P. J. Anat. 1994; 185: 1-49PubMed Google Scholar). The ADG acts as a lubricant of the eyeball and is therefore important in facilitating the movement of the eyelid (13Buzzell G.R. Hida A. Fu S. Seyama Y. J. Exp. Zool. 1997; 277: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition it has been proposed that the HG can act as a site of immune response, a source of pheromones, a source of thermoregulatory lipids, a photoprotective organ, a part of a retinal-pineal axis, a site of osmoregulation, and a source of growth factors (11Payne A.P. J. Anat. 1994; 185: 1-49PubMed Google Scholar, 12Seyama Y. Kasama T. Yasugi E. Park S.-H. Kano K. Webb S.M. Hoffman R.A. PuigDomingo M.L. Reiter R.J. Lipids in Harderian glands and their significance. Harderian glands. Porphyrin Metabolism, Behavioral and Endocrine Effects. Springer-Varlag, Berlin1992: 195-217Google Scholar). The HG is also a target of hormonal agents including gonadal, thyroid, and pituitary hormones, in addition to the many neuropeptides that have been shown to regulate the activity of this gland (12Seyama Y. Kasama T. Yasugi E. Park S.-H. Kano K. Webb S.M. Hoffman R.A. PuigDomingo M.L. Reiter R.J. Lipids in Harderian glands and their significance. Harderian glands. Porphyrin Metabolism, Behavioral and Endocrine Effects. Springer-Varlag, Berlin1992: 195-217Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the HG of the mouse with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 gene isoform has decreased levels of ADG, the major lipid of this gland. The amount of C20:1n-9, which is the major fatty acid in the ADG, was reduced by greater than 90% despite the presence in both SCD1−/− and SCD1+/+ mice of normal elongase activity, the enzyme proposed to elongate C18:1n-9 to C20:1n-9. HG microsomes isolated from SCD1−/− mice had very low desaturase activity toward C18:0-CoA as a substrate compared with C16:0-CoA. Feeding diets containing high levels of oleate to the SCD−/− mice did not increase the levels of C18:1 or C20:1n-9 in the HG and failed to restore the levels of ADG to the levels found in the HG of the wild-type mouse. De novo ADG synthesis as measured by the incorporation of [3H]glycerol and [14C]glucose was reduced by greater than 80% in the HG of SCD1−/− mouse. Taken together, the observations demonstrate that SCD1 isoform has a preference of C18:0-CoA as a substrate of desaturation compared with C16:0-CoA and that SCD1-synthesized oleoyl-CoA is the major substrate required for the biosynthesis of very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids of HG 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol. The generation of targeted SCD1−/− mice has been described previously (7Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pre-bred homozygous (SCD1−/−) and wild-type (SCD1+/+) male mice on an SV129 background were used. Mice were maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle and were fed a normal nonpurified diet (5008 test diet; PMI Nutrition International Inc., Richmond, IN) or a high carbohydrate diet (TD99252; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) supplemented with 5% soybean oil (control oil), 5% or 30% high oleate oil. In some experiments the high carbohydrate diet was supplemented with 5% C20:1n-9 as trieicosenoin. The fatty acid composition of soybean oil is 11% palmitic acid (16:0), 5% stearic acid (18:0), 23% oleic acid (18:1n-9), 53% linoleic acid (18:2n-6), and 8% linoleic acid (18:3n-3). The fatty acid composition of high oleate oil diet is 2% 16:0, 11% 18:0, 75% 18:1n-9, 10% 18:2n-6, and 2% 18:3n-3. The high trieicosenoin diet contained 6% 16:0, 12% 18:1n-9, 26% 18:2n-6, 4% 18:3n-3, and 50% eicosenoic acid (20:1n-9). SCD1−/− and SCD1+/+ mice are housed and bred in a pathogen-free barrier facility of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison. The breeding of these animals is in accordance with the protocols approved by the Animal Care Research Committee of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Radioactive [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Dupont. Thin layer chromatography plates (TLC Silica Gel G60) were from Merck. [1,2,3-3H]Glycerol and [14C]glucose were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The cDNA probes for FAS were obtained from Dr. H. Sul, University of California, Berkeley. The cDNA probes for SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were provided by Dr. O. Ezaki, National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Japan. Rabbit anti-rat SCD, which was raised against purified rat liver SCD, was a gift from Dr. Juris Ozols, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Total lipids were extracted from HG according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) and were separated by silica gel TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:30:1) as the developing solvent. The lipids were visualized by cupric sulfate in 8% phosphoric acid. The lipids were scraped, methylated, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a capillary column coated with DB-225 (30-m length, 0.25 mm, internal diameter, 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE). Column temperature was kept at 70 °C for 1 min, increased to 180 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and then to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The temperature was kept at 220 °C for 15 min. 20:1n-9 and 20:1n-7 fatty acids were identified by comparison of retention times with authentic standards (Sigma). A heptadecanoic acid and a 1,2-dihepatadecanoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) were added as internal standards for the quantitation of 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol and phospholipids, respectively. Total RNA was isolated from each tissue using the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction method (8Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30132-30138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). 20 µg of total RNA were separated by 1.0% agarose/2.2m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with32P-labeled FAS (15Sul H.S. Wang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 331-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), SREBP-1 (16Kim H.J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O. J. Biol.

SCD3-specific probe was generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using mouse skin RNA and specific primers (forward, 5′-CTTGGATAACCACCCTGGGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CATGCTGGTTCTTGGAGGC-3′) (5Zheng Y. Prouty S.M. Harmon A. Sundberg J.P. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Microsomes were isolated from HGs of SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice by differential centrifugation and suspended in a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Stearoyl-CoA desaturase was assayed at 23 °C with 30 µm[14C]stearoyl-CoA or [14C]palmitoyl-CoA and 2 mm NADH (7Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Microsomal elongase activity was assayed at 37 °C with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NADPH, 2 mm NADH, 30 µm acyl-CoA, and 100 µm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (17Anderson G.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Total protein was prepared from pooled HG from three mice of each group. The HG (100 mg) was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 2 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa2MoO4, 40 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The same amount of protein (25 µg) from each fraction was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes at 4 °C. After blocking with 10% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline buffer (pH 8.0) plus Tween at 4 °C for 2 h, the membrane was washed and incubated with rabbit anti-rat SCD as primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as the secondary antibody. Visualization of the SCD protein was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (18Kim Y.C. Gomez F.E. Fox B.G. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1310-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Glycerol or [14C]glucose was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl at a concentration of 5 µCi/0.2 ml and injected into mice 1 h before being sacrificed (19Kudo N. Kawashima Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 145: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Ntambi J.M. J.

HG lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC using hexane:ether:acetic acid (90:30:1) as developing solvent. The 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol fraction was scraped off the plate, and the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Fig. 1 shows a Northern blot of total RNA isolated from various tissues of wild-type mice and analyzed for the expression of SCD1, SREBP-1 and FAS mRNAs. Compared with several mouse lipogenic tissues including liver and white adipose tissue, the HG expresses much higher mRNA levels of SCD1, SREBP-1, and FAS indicating that the HG is highly lipogenic. 28 S mRNA expression used as loading control was similar in the tissues tested. Fig. 2 shows TLC analysis of lipids extracted from HG of SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. As reported previously (22Kasama K. Uezumi N. Ito K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 202: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Kasama K. Blank M.L. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9453-9461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the main lipid present in the HG of the mouse is ADG. The ADG was markedly reduced in HG of the SCD1−/− mice compared with the SCD1+/+ control mice. The free cholesterol levels were not changed. Triglyceride levels were very low, and cholesterol esters were undetectable. ADG and phospholipids were also measured quantitatively by GLC using heptadecanoic acid as an internal standard. TableI shows that the total ADG content in HG of SCD1−/− mice was decreased by 53% whereas the phospholipid content was decreased by 24%.Table IHarderian gland lipid contents between SCD1−/− and wild-type miceGenotype+/+−/−Harderian glandTotal fatty acids(mg/g tissue)423.7 ± 26.3236.1 ± 11.6ADG(mg/g tissue)280.6 ± 27.57132.7 ± 8.9PL(mg/g tissue)109.7 ± 5.582.8 ± 9.3Each value denotes the mean ± S.D.

ADG, 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol. PL, phospholipid. Fig. 3 shows the contents (mg/g) of the major fatty acids measured in the total lipid, 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol, and phospholipid fractions of the HG of SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. The most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid in the total lipid of the SCD1+/+ mice is eicosenate (C20:1n-9) (148 mg/g), which was decreased by greater than 90% in the SCD1−/− mice. The content of C20:1n-7 was decreased by 34% whereas that of C18:1n-9 was decreased by 60%. In the ADG fraction, C20:1n-9 and C20:1n-7 were decreased by 93 and 44%, respectively. The phospholipid fraction did not contain C20:1n-9 or C20:1n-7, but the content of C18:1n-9 was decreased by 57%. The HG lipids contained very low levels of w-6 and w-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. To determine whether dietary oleate could substitute for the endogenously synthesized oleate and restore the HG ADG levels of the SCD1−/− mice to the levels observed in the SCD1+/+ mice, we supplemented the semipurified diet with high levels of C18:1n-9 (75% of total fat) as high oleate oil and fed it to the SCD1−/− mice for 1 month, a long enough feeding regimen to ensure equilibration of lipid pools. The food intake was not very different between the SCD1+/+ mice controls and the SCD1−/− mice. Total HG extracts were prepared, the lipid fractions were analyzed by TLC, and the fatty acid composition was analyzed by GLC. Feeding diets supplemented with 5 or 30% oleate-rich diet to the SCD1−/− mice did not result in an increase in the levels of ADG (Fig. 4A). The content in (mg/g tissue) of ADG was not increased (Fig.4B). GC analysis showed that content s of C18:1n-9 and 20:1n-9 were not increased in the ADG fraction of the SCD1−/− mouse (Fig. 4C). The content of C20:1n-9 was not increased in the total lipid or ADG fraction when SCD1−/− mice were fed diets supplemented with high levels of C20:1n-9 as trieicosenoin (data not shown). These observations suggest strongly that the normal levels of C20:1n-9 in 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol are largely dependent on endogenously synthesized C18:1n-9. The low levels of ADG observed in the SCD1−/− mice could have resulted from reduced levels of the elongase activity, the enzyme that would catalyze the elongation of C18:1n-9 to C20:1n-9. Fig.5A shows that the elongase activity as measured by rate of conversion of [14C]malonyl-CoA to labeled C20:1n-9 was almost equal in HG microsomes of both SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. Compared with elongase activities in liver and white adipose tissue, the HG elongase activity was highest when either palmitoleoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA were used as substrates (Fig. 5B). These observations demonstrate the requirement of palmitoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA as substrates for elongation into very long monounsaturated fatty acids that subsequently become incorporated into ADG and the HG. To establish that the low levels of ADG in the SCD1−/− mice is because of lower de novo synthesis rates, we used [3H]glycerol or [14C]glucose as precursors of lipid synthesis to measure directly newly synthesized ADG in the HG of SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. Fig. 6shows that the ADG synthetic rate both from glucose and glycerol was decreased by greater than 80% in the HG of the SCD1−/− mice. These results indicate that the normal levels of ADG in the HG are dependent on SCD1 gene expression. To determine whether the HG of the SCD1−/− mouse expresses other SCD isoforms in addition to SCD1, total RNA isolated from SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice was analyzed by Northern blot using as specific DNA probes SCD2 and SCD3 isoforms. Fig.7A shows that the HG of SCD1−/− mice as expected did not express SCD1 but that SCD2 and SCD3 isoforms are expressed in both SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. Interestingly, SCD2 mRNA level in SCD1+/+ was lower than that in the SCD1−/− mouse whereas that of SCD3 was higher in the SCD1+/+ than in the SCD1−/− mouse. FAS, SREBP-1, and SREBP-2 mRNA levels were similar between SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. The 28 S mRNA expression used as a loading control was also similar in the SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice. Consistent with the Northern blot results of Fig.7A, Western blot analysis showed high immunoreactive SCD protein in HG from the SCD1+/+ with a decreased protein level in the SCD1−/− mice (Fig. 7B). To determine whether the SCD isoforms have different substrate specificity, we assayed microsomes from HG of SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice for desaturase activity toward the main substrates of SCD, C16:0-CoA, and C18:0-CoA. Fig.7C shows that SCD enzyme activity in the HG as measured by the rate of conversion of [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA to [1-14C]palmitoleoyl-CoA was higher in the wild-type mice and was reduced by 35% in the SCD1−/− mouse. However, the SCD activity as measured by the rate of conversion of [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA to [1-14C]oleate revealed that whereas the SCD1+/+ microsomes had high SCD activity, the SCD activity was reduced by greater than 95% in microsomes of SCD1−/− mice. These results indicate that SCD1 can use C16:0-CoA (the 35%) as a substrate but uses C18:0-CoA (the 95%) as the preferred substrate for desaturation. On the other hand SCD2 or SCD3 isoform uses C16:0-CoA as a specific substrate of desaturation. These results suggest that SCD isoforms present in the HG have different substrate specificity. We found that the eyeball-associated HG of the mouse has a higher expression of SCD1 mRNA than in other tissues analyzed previously, including liver and white adipose tissue (Fig. 1). The expression of other lipogenic genes (FAS and SREBP-1) was also higher than the levels observed previously in liver and white adipose tissue. These observations indicated to us that the HG is a highly lipogenic gland. The major neutral lipid found in the HG of the mouse is ADG with lower levels of phospholipid and free cholesterol. As indicated in Fig. 2 and Table I, the SCD1−/− mice have a deficiency in ADG and C20:1n-9; the main monounsaturated fatty acid in ADG was reduced by greater than 90% (Fig. 3). The phospholipid levels were also decreased in the SCD1−/− mice. Feeding diets supplemented with high levels of oleate did not result in an increase in the levels of C18:1 or C20:1n-9 and could not repair the deficiency in 1-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol (Fig. 4). Feeding diets supplemented with high levels of C20:1n-9 itself to the SCD1−/− mice did not correct the deficiency in ADG either. Further, we demonstrated that the deficiency of ADG in the SCD1−/− mice was because of a decreased rate of de novo synthesis (Fig. 5). However, the ADG synthesis occurred at a much lower level (20%) whereas the level of ADG was reduced by 50% suggesting a possible defect in the secretion of ADG from the HG of the SCD1−/− mice. The deficiencies in the levels of ADG and C20:1n-9 were not compensated for by the expression of SCD2 and SCD3 isoforms in the HG of the SCD1−/− mouse. These observations suggest that endogenously synthesized C18:1 as a result of SCD1 gene expression is required for the biosynthesis of ADG in the HG. The endogenously synthesized oleate is also required for synthesis of normal levels of phospholipids. The mouse genome contains three well characterized structural genes (SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3) that are highly homologous at the nucleotide and amino acid level and encode the same functional protein (5Zheng Y. Prouty S.M. Harmon A. Sundberg J.P. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the difference in physiological function between SCD1, -2, and -3 has not been well addressed, we suggested previously that the SCD1 and SCD2 isoforms might exhibit different specificity for substrates (18Kim Y.C. Gomez F.E. Fox B.G. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1310-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to exhibiting tissue-specific expression (5Zheng Y. Prouty S.M. Harmon A. Sundberg J.P. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We found that the mouse HG expresses three SCD isoforms (SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3) and, in addition, noted that there were differences in the levels of their expression between the SCD1+/+ and SCD1−/− mice (Fig. 7). Although SCD2 was expressed at lower levels in the SCD1+/+ mice its expression was elevated in the SCD1−/− mice. Expression of SCD3 was higher in the SCD1+/+ but decreased in the SCD1−/− mice. Similarly in the skin of asebia mouse lacking SCD1, SCD3 expression was decreased (6Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, the three SCD isoforms were expressed in different cell types in the skin (6Shimomura I.

SCD1 is located in pre-sebocytes of the sebaceous gland of the skin whereas the mature sebocytes expressed SCD3. On the other hand SCD2 is expressed in hair follicles. It is not known whether the HG SCD isoforms are expressed in different cell types, as well, but it is possible that their pattern of expression is a reflection of HG cell types in different stages of differentiation. Despite the expression of SCD2 and SCD3 in the HG of SCD1−/−, the deficiencies in the levels of ADG and C20:1n-9 were not compensated for suggesting a distinct role of each SCD isoform in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids of the HG. The observation that microsomes isolated from HG of SCD1−/− mice had very low desaturase activity toward C18:0-CoA compared with C16:0-CoA (Fig. 7) strongly suggests that C18:0-CoA is the main substrate of SCD1 isoform. The other isoforms (SCD2 or -3) preferentially utilize C16:0-CoA as the substrate of desaturation. Consistent with this notion the levels of C18:1n-7 and C20:1n-7 derived from elongation and desaturation of C16:0-CoA were decreased by 30% in the SCD1−/− mouse compared with a decrease of greater than 90% in the levels of C20:1n-9 that would be derived from the elongation of C18:1n-9. These studies, along with a recent report of a palmitoyl-CoA-specific Δ9 desaturase from Caenorhabditis elegans (24Watts J.L. Browse J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that the SCD isoforms have different substrate specificity and may explain why there are several SCD isoforms in the mouse genome. The differences in the catalytic selectivity of the SCD isoforms may also contribute to the establishing of the lipid composition of the cell. A finer control can be provided by regulated expression of several isoforms with differing selectivity than by expression of either one or two with the same substrate selectivity. We propose, as depicted in Fig. 8, that in the HG palmitate is synthesized de novo by FAS from acetyl-CoA producing palmitate (C16:0) as the major end product. Palmitate then serves as a substrate for the microsomal malonyl-CoA-dependent elongase to produce stearate, which then serves as the main substrate of SCD1. The C16:1n-7 synthesized by either SCD2 or SCD3 is converted first to C18:1n-7 by a general elongase and then both C18:1n-9 and C18:1n-7 are converted to C20:1n-9 and C20:1n-7, respectively, by the HG elongase. Desaturation of C20:0 to C20:1 by any of the SCD isoforms is unlikely, because C20:1n-11, the product of this reaction, was not detected. The elongase may be specific to the HG, because we cannot detect C20:1n-9 or C20:1n-7 fatty acids in other tissues. In addition, the elongase in HG exhibited higher substrate specificity for C18:1n-9-CoA and C16:1n-7-CoA, whereas that in other tissues such as liver and adipose tissues showed high substrate specificity for 16:0-CoA (Fig. 5B). The C20:1n-9 and C20:1n-7 then become the preferred substrates for esterification to the 2,3 positions of alkyl glycerol by unidentified 1-alkylglycerol: acyltransferase for the synthesis of ADG. The reasons for incorporating specific very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids in the 1-alkyl-2,3-diacyglycerol of the mouse HG are not clear, but it may be that they are required to maintain the correct physical properties of the fluids for normal eye function. The narrow eye fissure phenotype of mice with a targeted disruption of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene (7Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as well as in the asebia mouse with a natural deletion in the SCD1 gene (9Zheng Y. Eilertsen K.J. Ge L. Zhang L. Sundberg J.P. Prouty S.M. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), may be because of a deficiency in endogenous oleoyl-CoA. We found very low levels of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the HG indicating that these fatty acids are either not required or do not accumulate in the lipids of the Harderian gland. It seems that the lipids of this gland are composed mainly of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids of the n-9 series. Because of the numerous roles cited for the mouse HG (12Seyama Y. Kasama T. Yasugi E. Park S.-H. Kano K. Webb S.M. Hoffman R.A. PuigDomingo M.L. Reiter R.J. Lipids in Harderian glands and their significance. Harderian glands. Porphyrin Metabolism, Behavioral and Endocrine Effects. Springer-Varlag, Berlin1992: 195-217Google Scholar) in different animal species, further studies of this gland could reveal previously undescribed roles that monounsaturated fatty acids play in diverse physiological processes. Humans do not have the HG, but because this structure is part of the retina axis of the mouse, it is likely that it has evolved into the retina in humans. Consistent with this stipulation high SCD expression has been reported in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (25Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28744-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and its expression may play an important role in the pathophysiology of these cells. In conclusion, the studies have revealed that SCD1 gene expression is required for the synthesis of another class of neutral lipid, the ADG. The Harderian-specific elongase that synthesizes the very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids of ADG requires C18:1 and C16:1, the endogenous products of SCD isoforms, as substrates. The failure of dietary fatty acids to repair the deficiency in phospholipids and ADG levels strongly suggests the HG relies on de novomonounsaturated fatty acids for lipid synthesis. Presently, the SCD1 knockout mouse may be a useful model to study the role of endogenous oleoyl-CoA in lipid metabolism, and the studies described here may have broad implications for the potential use of SCD1 as a target in the treatment of some eye diseases.

Opsin is known to have at neutral pH only a small residual constitutive activity toward its G protein transducin, which is thought to play a considerable role in light adaptation (bleaching desensitization). In this study we show with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy that after metarhodopsin II decay, opsin exists in two conformational states that are in a pH-dependent equilibrium at 30 °C with a pK of 4.1 in the presence of hydroxylamine scavenging the endogenous all-trans retinal. Despite the lack of the native agonist in its binding pocket, the low pH opsin conformation is very similar to that of metarhodopsin II and is likewise stabilized by peptides derived from rhodopsin's cognate G protein, transducin. The high pH form, on the other hand, has some conformational similarity to the inactive metarhodopsin I state. We therefore conclude that the opsin apoprotein displays intrinsic conformational states that are merely modulated by bound all-trans retinal.

G protein-coupled receptor Fourier-transform infrared metarhodopsin I and II opsin state with inactive and active conformation 2-N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid Rhodopsin is the visual pigment responsible for dim light vision in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors. It is a seven-helix transmembrane protein and serves as a prototype for the study of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (1Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 50: 1-34Google Scholar). Unlike other GPCRs, rhodopsin's apoprotein, opsin, is covalently bound to its chromophore, 11-cis retinal, via a protonated Schiff base to Lys296 on helix 7, maintaining the receptor in an inactive conformation and giving it an absorption maximum centered at 500 nm. Upon photon absorption, the retinal isomerizes to an all-trans geometry, thereby switching from an inverse to a full agonist, and drives the receptor to an active state conformation, called metarhodopsin II (MII). This state is capable of catalytically activating the visual G protein, transducin. Formation of MII is accompanied by deprotonation of the Schiff base, thereby shifting the absorption maximum of the pigment to 380 nm with a concomitant protonation of Glu113 (2Jäger F. Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which forms the counterion to the protonated Schiff base in the MII precursors (3Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In vivo, signaling is shut off by receptor phosphorylation catalyzed by a specific receptor kinase and subsequent binding of visual arrestin (reviewed in Ref. 4Helmreich E.J.M. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The retinal Schiff base becomes hydrolyzed, and retinal is reduced by retinal dehydrogenase. The visual cycle is closed by dephosphorylation of the apoprotein opsin and regeneration to rhodopsin with 11-cis retinal from the retinal pigment epithelium. In isolated washed disc membranes, where these shut-off and regeneration reactions are absent, MII decays by hydrolysis of the Schiff base and dissociation into opsin and all-transretinal. All-trans retinal (λmax 380 nm) may then form in part Schiff bases with peripheral lysines on the apoprotein or phosphatidylethanolamine in the lipid bilayer (5van Breugel P.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Bonting S.L. Daemen F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Opsin has at neutral pH only a very small intrinsic activity toward the G protein transducin. This small constitutive activity is nevertheless suspected to be involved in adaptation of photoreceptors to high light levels in a process termed bleaching desensitization (6Jin J. Crouch R.K.

Rev. 2001; 81: 117-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Presumably, opsin is held in an inactive conformation by the constraint of a salt bridge between Glu113 on helix 3 and Lys296 on helix 7, as replacement of either of these residues by uncharged side chains considerably increases the constitutive activity (8Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Other mutations resulting in constitutive activity of opsin involve the residues Met257 (9Han M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8253-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Gly121, and Phe261 (10Han M. Lin S.W. Minkova M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which is known to play a major role in determining the equilibrium between MII and its still inactive precursor, MI. A second factor determining activity of opsin is the presence of the natural agonist of rhodopsin, all-transretinal. In high retinal/opsin ratios, all-trans retinal is known to further increase the activity of native opsin (13Palczewski K. Jäger S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and may in some mutants even reach the activity of the photoactivated mutant pigment. Infrared difference spectroscopy is a powerful tool in the investigation of both conformational and functional changes in proteins (20Vogel R. Siebert F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy that native opsin may form two distinct conformational states, which are in a pH-dependent equilibrium. The existence of a state with a putatively inactive conformation at neutral pH was characterized earlier by infrared spectroscopy (21Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At low pH, however, we show that opsin adopts a conformation that is very similar to that of the signaling state MII and that features a protonated Glu113, in contrast to its inactive counterpart at higher pH. In the framework of a two-state model of GPCR activation, a nonvanishing population of this state may be the molecular reason for the very small constitutive activity of wild-type opsin at neutral pH. The population of this state with an active conformation does not depend on, but is slightly augmented by, the stoichiometric presence of all-trans retinal being formed as the second MII decay product. We conclude that opsin possesses two intrinsic conformations, which are formed in the absence of ligand and which are likely to be regulated by the protonation state of Glu113. All experiments were carried out on bovine rhodopsin in disc membranes, which were prepared from rod outer segments of cattle retinae essentially as described previously (22Ganter U.M. Schmid E.D. Perez-Sala D. Rando R.R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5954-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All preparations involving pigment were performed under dim red light. FTIR spectroscopy was performed in transmission mode with a Bruker IFS 28 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled HgCdTe detector. All data were obtained from well hydrated sandwich film samples prepared by drying 0.5 nmol of pigment on specially designed CaF2 bottom windows with 4 µm path length as described previously (23Vogel R. Fan G.B. Sheves M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this sample type, a preferred orientation of the disc membrane normal perpendicular to the window plane is achieved, as evident from the inset in Fig. 2C. To ensure accurate pH adjustment, we pre-equilibrated the sample films on the bottom window with 5 µl of 200 mm buffer for a few seconds before squeezing the excess buffer out of the central sample part by sandwiching the bottom with the top window. We used citrate buffer (for pH < 6.0), MES buffer (pH 6.0–7.0), and bis-tris propane buffer (pH > 7.0), all supplemented with 200 mm NaCl to reduce potential membrane surface pH effects. The samples were thermostatted (stability 0.1 °C) in the dry air-purged sample chamber. Spectra were recorded in blocks of 512 scans at 4 cm−1 resolution with 1-min acquisition time. After base-line stabilization, 10 subsequent spectra were recorded, the sample was photolyzed for 30 s by a fiber optic connected to a 150-watt slide projector and an OG 530 cut-off filter (Schott, Germany), and up to 30 subsequent spectra were recorded to follow the decay of the initially resolved MII photoproduct. In the experiments involving the transducin derived high-affinity peptide analog, 10 nmol of peptide were added to 0.5 nmol of pigment before drying. All experiments were carried out at 30 °C to ensure rapid decay of MII within a time frame accessible to infrared difference spectroscopy. At this temperature, no further spectral changes were observed 15 min after illumination, and we therefore used the difference spectrum obtained after this period as “final decay product.” In the presence of hydroxylamine, a stable decay product was already obtained 1–5 min after illumination, depending on pH, thereby allowing experiments to take place also at 20 °C. In additional experiments, we also used squeezed sediment samples (24Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1980; 6: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with similar results to those obtained for the film samples, which involved drying of the pigment. As the kinetics of MII decay are similar in sandwich film samples and diluted suspensions (halftime about 2.8 min at 30 °C), our results obtained with sandwich samples likely match those expected from diluted suspensions within reasonable deviations. To determine the half-time of the decay of MII, a negative exponential was fitted to the decay of prominent bands at 1748, 1711, 1686, 1664, 1645, 1554, and 1530 cm−1. To determine the titration curve of the opsin states, we defined two normalized basis spectra, which were averages of final decay product spectra of each two experiments at pH 4.0 and 7.0, respectively (shown in Fig. 3, A and B). All obtained spectra of the final decay products were normalized by their absorption bands at 1238 cm−1 and then fitted to the linear combinationscale·(a·base4.0 + (1 − a)·base7.0) +offset of this spectral basis set over the range from 1800 to 1100 cm−1 by a least square Newton fitting procedure. The parameters scale and offset were always very close to 1 and 0, respectively. To eliminate possibly pH-dependent contributions from peripheral Schiff bases formed by dissociated retinal, we excluded their spectral range of absorption, i.e. from 1665–1645 cm−1, 1585–1540 cm−1, 1248–1228 cm−1, and 1210–1170 cm−1. This was essentially not necessary for the experiments in the absence of hydroxylamine, as a fit over the entire spectral range gave very similar results. It was, however, necessary for the fitting of spectra obtained in the presence of hydroxylamine (where no peripheral Schiff bases are formed) to our standard basis set, which was obtained without hydroxylamine, and therefore was used throughout for consistency. The pH dependence of the obtained values of a were fitted to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (ephigh+ eplow·10pK − pH)/(1 + 10pK − pH), whereephigh and eplow are the end points of titration at high and low pH. Fitting of the data obtained at 30 °C in the absence of hydroxylamine yielded a lower end point parameter eplow = 1.53, suggesting that the spectra obtained at pH 4.0 do not yet correspond to a pure state, whereas ephigh could be set to zero. The pure state, Ops*, was reconstructed from these data by the linear combination Ops* =eplow·base4.0 + (1 −eplow)·base7.0. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed with a thermostatted PerkinElmer Lambda 17 UV-visible spectrophotometer either with sandwich samples identical to those used for FTIR experiments or with disc membranes in suspension in 100-µl microcuvettes with a 10 mm path length (Hellma, Germany). In Fig.1, the time evolution of the FTIR difference spectra photoproduct minus dark statefrom film samples after pigment photolysis are shown. The first spectrum of the initial photoproduct, which was recorded immediately after illumination, still corresponds largely to a MII spectrum. At pH 7.0, this spectrum decays rapidly, however, as evident from the decrease of both negative and positive absorption bands. This decay is particularly evident in the region of amide I and amide II vibrations indicative of changes in the protein backbone (around 1650 and 1550 cm−1, respectively) and in the region of the protonated carboxyl groups between 1700 and 1800 cm−1, which also serve as structural and functional markers. This general decrease of absorption bands has been reported before and interpreted as a refolding of the MII structure to a structure partly resembling the dark state during the decay (21Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At pH 4.0, the situation is very different, as the intensities of most bands remain, after an initial small decrease, unchanged for the most part (the difference spectrum obtained after 20 min still possesses most features of the initial MII difference spectrum). We next examined identical, oriented film samples by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 2). As evident from Fig. 2, A and B, after photolysis of the dark state (λmax 500 nm) a MII photoproduct is formed (λmax 380 nm), which then decays by hydrolysis of the Schiff base to opsin and free all-trans retinal, a fraction of the latter forming Schiff bases with peripheral lysines and the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine present in the embedding lipid bilayer (5van Breugel P.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Bonting S.L. Daemen F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resulting products absorb at 380 nm (free retinal) and around 450 and 370 nm (for the protonated and unprotonated Schiff bases). The relatively low absorption of the decay products is due to a reorientation of the transition dipole moment of the retinal during decay. While in the dark and the MII state, the dipole moment in the oriented film samples is mostly parallel to the electric field vector of the measuring beam (25Chabre M. Breton J. Vision Res. 1979; 19: 1005-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); this preferential orientation is lost upon decay. This could also be verified by comparing difference spectra of the final decay product minus dark state at pH 4.0 in the presence of hydroxylamine, converting the retinal quantitatively into oxime absorbing around 360 nm (inset in Fig. 2C), obtained from oriented film samples and from suspension samples. In the film samples the ratio of oxime absorption to dark absorption is decreased compared with suspension samples, in line with the above interpretation. The 380 nm absorption of MII decays exponentially with a half-time of about 2.8 min, at both pH 4.0 and 7.0. A similar half-time was obtained for the decay of prominent FTIR bands (see “Experimental Procedures”) for both pH values in Fig. 1, although the decrease of band intensities at pH 4.0 is quite small. The difference between the decay patterns obtained at both pHs in the infrared can therefore not be due to slower or only partial hydrolysis of the Schiff base at pH 4.0 and therefore an extended MII life span. Instead it must be due to a lack of conformational change during the decay at this pH. The conformation of the decay product opsin at pH 4.0 must therefore be similar to MII, whereas at pH 7.0 its conformation is closer to the dark state, as evident from the overall decrease of bands and in agreement with a previous study (21Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in the MII spectra obtained at pH 4.0, there is a small contribution of a MII photoproduct with a protonated Schiff base due to anion binding from the solvent to the Schiff base, which is generally observed at low pH. 2Vogel, R., Fan, G. B., Siebert, F., and Sheves, M. (2001) Biochemistry, in press. This does not, however, interfere with the conclusions drawn in this paper. In Fig.3, A and B, the infrared spectra of the final decay products obtained 15 min after pigment photolysis at pH 4.0 and 7.0 are plotted and compared with the corresponding spectra of the initial photoproducts obtained immediately after photolysis, corresponding largely to MII. At pH 4.0, the spectrum of the final decay product is very similar to that obtained immediately after photolysis (Fig. 3A). An important spectral region lies between 1730 and 1770 cm−1with the difference band pattern of the protonated carboxylic acids Asp83 and Glu122, which may serve as a conformational marker (26Fahmy K. Jäger F. Beck M. Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10206-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). While a difference band located at −1768/+1750 cm−1, which reflects a change of the hydrogen bonding properties of During activation, Asp83 is preserved in the final decay product, and there is an absorption decrease of a positive photoproduct band at 1745 cm−1, which because of its position can be assigned to Glu122. According to the rhodopsin three-dimensional structure, Glu122 is positioned in contact with the βionone ring of retinal (27Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), and the changes therefore likely reflect a changed environment because of dissociation of the chromophore. There is also a very slight decrease in the positive band at 1712 cm−1, which is attributed to protonated Glu113in MII (2Jäger F. Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and which reflects either a marginal deprotonation of this residue in the final decay product at this pH or local changes associated with chromophore dissociation. In the amide I region, there is a small decrease at 1659 and 1643 cm−1 as well as in the amide II region at 1547 cm−1, indicating slight conformational changes. The absorbance increase at 1558 cm−1 may, as we will show below, be due in part to the C=C stretch mode of peripheral protonated Schiff bases of retinal being formed during the decay process. At pH 7.0, the decay process corresponds to a reduction of almost all difference bands, with the exception of bands related the 11-cis retinal chromophore of dark rhodopsin. These are, in particular, the intense fingerprint band at 1238 cm−1, the C=C stretch vibration around 1549 cm−1, and the Schiff base C=N stretch vibration at 1659 cm−1, which cannot be compensated by the decay product all-trans retinal or its Schiff base (Fig. 3B). In the amide I region, there are two positive bands at 1667 and 1632 cm−1 arising in the decay product. Interestingly, there are possibly equivalent bands in the spectrum of MI, the inactive precursor of MII (Fig. 3C). Indeed, except for the positive bands related to the chromophore of MI at 1539 and 1204 cm−1, the spectrum of MI has some similarity to that of the final decay product at pH 7.0. Importantly, as deduced from the considerable decrease of the band at 1712 cm−1, Glu113 deprotonates during the decay of MII at this pH, thereby decreasing the amplitude of a negative band at 1399 cm−1, which is attributable to the symmetric stretch vibration of the carboxylate in the decay product. We can therefore conclude that there are two distinct conformational states of opsin: 1) a state with a conformation somewhat similar to MI and with only minor structural changes compared with the dark state and, importantly, a negatively charged glutamate at position 113; 2) a state very similar to the active state MII as judged from amide bands and the band pattern related to Asp83 and in part to Glu122, with a neutralized side chain of Glu113, despite apparent hydrolysis and dissociation of the retinal from its binding pocket. To determine the pH dependence of the conformational equilibrium between these two states, we used a fitting procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures” with spectra obtained at pH 4.0 and 7.0 as basis spectra. The linear coefficient a obtained by this method in the pH range 4.0 to 7.0 was found to follow a Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the lower titration end point left open for fitting and the higher titration end point set to zero. The results of this fitting procedure give a pK of the transition of 4.3. The value 1.53 for the end point of titration at low pH clearly indicates that the final decay product obtained at pH 4.0 does not yet correspond to a pure state. Instead it is still a mixed state consisting of contributions from the conformation obtained at pH 7.0 (from now on termed “Ops”) and from a MII-like conformation, which should be formed in purity at still lower pH. This also explains why there is a small but significant decay of the initial photoproduct at pH 4.0 (Fig. 3A). As it was not possible to obtain completely stable final decay products at pH values below 4.0, we constructed this pure state, which we will call “Ops*” as it possesses an active state conformation, from the given basis set of spectra and the parameter obtained for the titration end point at low pH (see “Experimental Procedures”). In Fig.4A, we plot the fraction of Ops* contributing to the final decay products over the pH range 4.0 to 7.0. In Fig. 4B, we show the reconstructed infrared spectrum of Ops* in comparison with the final decay product obtained at pH 4.0 and a pure MII spectrum obtained at 10 °C. Obviously, Ops* is structurally equivalent to the signaling state MII and is therefore very likely also an active state, whereas Ops corresponds to an inactive conformation as suggested by its conformational closeness to the MI state. Up to now, all experiments were conducted in the presence of the 1:1 stoichiometry of all-trans retinal being formed as the decay product of MII. In several studies, all-trans retinal was shown to exert an agonistic activity on opsin, particularly when applied in higher retinal/opsin ratios (8Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Han M. Sakmar T.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To investigate, therefore, its role in the equilibrium of the two opsin states, we repeated our experiments in the presence of hydroxylamine, which scavenges the retinal by quantitatively transforming it into retinal oximes. In contrast to the aldehyde, the oxime of all-trans retinal was shown to possess no agonistic activity on opsin (18Buczylko J. Saari J.C. Crouch R.K. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20621-20630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As evidenced in Fig.3D, opsin was capable of forming the active conformation Ops* also in the absence of all-trans retinal. The only major difference from spectra obtained in the absence of the scavenging hydroxylamine is a decrease around both 1570 and 1200 cm−1, which can be attributed to the lack of peripherally formed protonated Schiff bases being otherwise formed by the dissociated retinal. A more detailed analysis of the pH dependence of the opsin equilibrium indicates a slightly lower contribution of Ops* to the final decay product, which is expressed in a pK of 4.1 compared with 4.3 in the absence of hydroxylamine (Fig.4A). Because of the more rapid decay of MII in the presence of hydroxylamine (Fig. 2C), the equilibrium of the opsin states could also be examined at 20 °C, yielding a pK of 3.8 (data not shown). Transducin as well as short peptides corresponding to certain domains of transducin are known to interact specifically with MII and to shift thereby the MI/MII equilibrium toward the active state MII (extra MII effect) (29Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. König B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the influence on the opsin equilibrium of a modified peptide analog to the C terminus of the transducin α-subunit, peptide 23 (acet-VLEDLKSCGLF), which was shown to stabilize MII with high affinity (30Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We conducted this experiment in the presence of hydroxylamine to ensure efficient decay of MII, which was verified by UV-visible spectroscopy (data not shown). In the presence of peptide, a MII-like conformation of opsin was almost fully preserved up to pH 6.0 (Fig. 4C), where in the absence of peptide the opsin conformational equilibrium is already largely shifted toward the inactive state. In comparison with MII spectra obtained in the absence of peptide, there are small deviations in the peptide-bound opsin spectra in the region around 1654 and 1550 cm−1, which are similarly observed for the MII·peptide complex (31Fahmy K. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1306-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and which reflect small conformational changes of peptide and/or receptor upon complex formation. Similar to MII, Ops* is therefore also very likely recognized by the transducin holoenzyme as an active state, further supporting our conclusions above drawn from the conformational analysis. Under bright light the sensitivity of visual photoreceptors decreases in an adaptation process termed bleaching desensitization. In photoreceptors, where bleached pigment is not regenerated with 11-cis retinal by the visual cycle, the desensitized state persists in the dark and induces a sustained stimulation of the visual cascade similar to that observed under continuous background illumination (7Fain G.L. Matthews H.R. Cornwall M.C. Koutalos Y. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 117-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In the resulting depressed adaptational state, the MII decay product opsin is accepted to maintain a basal level of G protein stimulation either alone or in combination with all-trans retinal being released as well upon MII decay. Opsin alone has only a slight activity toward the visual G protein transducin, although the reported values vary considerably betweene.g. 10−6 at pH 8 (32Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3182-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and ∼0.1 at pH 6.1 compared with light-activated rhodopsin (12Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This activity can, on the one hand, be abolished by regeneration with the inverse agonist 11-cis retinal or, on the other hand, be increased by the presence of the agonist all-trans retinal (8Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because of its involvement in bleaching desensitization and its analogy to GPCR activation by diffusible ligands, this retinoid-induced activation has attracted much interest recently (17Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Han M. Sakmar T.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Still, its mechanism is not entirely clear at present. An extensive study revealed a pronounced selectivity of opsin for different isomers of retinal and retinal analogues (18Buczylko J. Saari J.C. Crouch R.K. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20621-20630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which may suggest a binding of the ligand in the native binding pocket. This study also demonstrated that all-transretinal has a critical size for binding as its oxime is already excluded. On the other hand, some studies suggest a noncovalent binding of all-trans retinal outside of the native binding pocket (16Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and exclude formation of a covalent Schiff base bond in the native binding pocket (14Surya A. Knox B.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This situation is different in constitutively active opsin mutants, which seem to have a considerably increased affinity for all-trans retinal and which in some cases clearly form a stable, active pigment with exogenously added all-trans retinal, corresponding to MII (3Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 19Han M. Sakmar T.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The conformational similarity between Ops* and MII and its specific stabilization by transducin-derived peptides strongly suggests that Ops* can activate transducin as well. The previously described constitutive activity of opsin, which becomes detectable upon lowering the pH to 6, may therefore be due to an increasing population of Ops*. Importantly, Glu113, which forms the counterion to the protonated Schiff base in the dark state of rhodopsin, is clearly protonated in Ops* but not in the inactive state, Ops. This finding is in agreement with previous studies of MII, which suggested a pivotal role of the protonation state of this residue for the formation of an active receptor conformation (33Fahmy K. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data do not allow the conclusion that protonation of Glu113 is the determining step in the equilibrium between Ops and Ops*, as e.g.Glu134, which plays a role in the pH-dependent equilibrium between MI and MII (34Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), may be involved as well. However, other studies on opsin mutants strongly suggest that we are really titrating a salt bridge between Glu113 and Lys296, which constrains opsin to an inactive conformation at neutral pH. In the opsin mutants E113Q and K296G, where the native charge pair is abolished, the pK for the transition to an active conformation is considerably increased from presumably around 5.1 for native opsin, as extrapolated from transducin activation data (12Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), to 6.8 and 8.0, respectively (8Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutant opsin E134Q shows a considerably smaller increase to only 5.6 (12Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Additionally, in the double mutant E134Q/K296G the pK is not further increased compared with the single mutant K296G (12Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A different study revealed for the E134Q mutant an activity of only 3.0% (±1.2%) at pH 7.2, whereas E113Q had an activity of 23% (±0.8%), which was further increased in the double mutant to 31% (±11%) (9Han M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8253-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These data suggests that protonation of Glu134 modulates the pK of the salt bridge between Glu113 and Lys296 by releasing other inactivating conformational constraints rather than being the initial event itself, implying that disruption of the charge pair is the essential step of opsin activation. The difference between the pKs of E113Q and K296G could be shown to reside largely in steric interactions of the side chain at position 296, as it vanishes in mutants in which Lys296 is replaced by uncharged residues of similar size as lysine (12Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We further showed in this study that the formation of Ops* does not depend on the presence of all-trans retinal. Ops* is also formed when the endogenous all-trans retinal is converted to oxime in the presence of hydroxylamine. All-trans retinal oxime, however, was shown to have no influence on the activity of opsin (18Buczylko J. Saari J.C. Crouch R.K. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20621-20630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relative increase of the pK of the transition from the inactive to the active conformation by about 0.2 units in the absence of hydroxylamine can therefore be attributed to the presence of the dissociated free all-trans retinal and is quite small. These observations allow a description of the conformational equilibria of opsin and the rhodopsin photoproducts similar to that of the two-state model of other GPCRs. In this model first set up by Lefkowitz and colleagues (35Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the conformation of a receptor in the absence of ligand is in equilibrium between an inactive state, R, and an active state, R*. This internal equilibrium may be shifted by the binding of either activating or inactivating ligands, L, forming the respective states L·R and L·R*. In the absence of agonist, opsin forms a similar internal equilibrium with the conformational states Ops and Ops*. Because of the apparently very low affinity of all-trans retinal for the retinal binding pocket of native opsin, the fully agonist-bound states are realized only in the rhodopsin photoproduct states MI and MII, which are stable for some time after photolysis of the dark pigment at a decreased temperature. As in the general scheme, the presence of an agonist in the binding pocket of the rhodopsin photoproducts MI and MII also strongly shifts the internal conformational equilibrium to the active state, which becomes evident in a pK shift of 4 units from 4.1 for ligand-free opsin to ∼8.5 for the MI/MII equilibrium (as extrapolated in Ref. 36Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5054-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar in agreement with own data), both at 30 °C (Fig.4A). In conclusion, we have shown in this study that the conformations capable of transducin activation are presumably very similar for the rhodopsin photoproduct MII and the apoprotein opsin alone. Both active and inactive conformations are therefore intrinsic properties of the apoprotein itself and are only regulated by the presence of activating or inactivating ligands. The activation process of visual pigments, which involves photon absorption and isomerization of the covalently bound ligand 11-cis retinal, is different from that of other GPCRs, which are activated by binding of diffusible ligands, and it puts rhodopsins in a functionally separate class of GPCRs. The conformational equilibria between inactive and active states of visual pigments and other GPCRs, however, are similar and allow the functions of both GPCR categories to be described by a two-state model.

DHA is derived from its parent precursor, the dietary essential fatty acid linolenic acid (C18:3n-3), via a series of alternating desaturation and elongation steps (see Fig. 1) (10Brenner R.R. Lipids. 1971; 6: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Sprecher H. Bracco U. Deckelbaum R.J. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition. Nestec Ltd., Vevey/Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 13-24Google Scholar). The primary products of C18:3n-3 are eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-3), and DHA. Until 1991, it had been postulated that conversion of C18:3n-3 to DHA was carried out entirely in microsomes. However, the last step in the biosynthetic pathway required conversion of C22:5n-3 to DHA via Δ4-desaturase, an enzyme that may not exist in higher animals (12Voss A. Reinhart M. Sankarappa S. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19995-20000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A modified pathway was therefore proposed in which C22:5n-3 is elongated to tetracosapentaenoic acid (C24:5n-3), desaturated to tetracosahexaenoic acid (C24:6n-3) in microsomes, and then retroconverted to DHA in peroxisomes (see Fig. 1) (12Voss A.

That the retroconversion step for DHA synthesis, a chain shortening of C24:6n-3 to DHA, takes place only in peroxisomes has been called into question, and a mitochondrial contribution has also been suggested (18Infante J.P. Huszagh V.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Infante J.P. Huszagh V.A. Mol. Genet.

The identities of specific enzymes or mechanisms involved in the retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA is not known. Both mitochondria and peroxisomes carry out fatty acid β-oxidation. This cyclic process is similar in both organelles with each cycle containing dehydrogenation/oxidation, hydration, dehydrogenation, and thiolytic cleavage steps. However, the functions of mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation pathways are significantly different (23Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Mol. Asp. Med. 1998; 19: 69-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). In general, one cycle of β-oxidation shortens an acyl chain by two carbons, releasing one molecule of acetyl-CoA, in a process mediated by a sequence of enzymes, each of which is specific for its substrate. In mitochondrial β-oxidation, the preferred substrates are fatty acids with a chain length of less than 20 carbons. These fatty acids enter the organelle by the carnitine transport system and are usually degraded completely to acetyl-CoA via several β-oxidation cycles. Peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation is capable of oxidizing longer chain length substrates, the very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), e.g. hexacosanoic acid (C26:0) and tetracosanoic acid (C24:0). Entry of these substrates does not require carnitine but may involve ATP-binding cassette transporters such as the ALD protein. Peroxisomal β-oxidation does not proceed to completion but rather only through a few cycles in which the acyl chain is shortened. In this study, the mechanism and enzymes involved in the retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA, a two-carbon shortening process, were investigated. We compared the rate of radiolabeled DHA synthesis from [1-14C]18:3n-3, the parent precursor, and [1-14C]22:5n-3, a more direct precursor, in human skin fibroblasts from normal controls with DHA synthesis rates in cells from patients with disorders of peroxisomal or mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Our results confirm the existence of the new revised DHA synthetic pathway in which C22:5n-3 is elongated to C24:5n-3, desaturated to C24:6n-3 in microsomes, and then retroconverted to C22:6n-3 in peroxisomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) and D-bifunctional protein (DBP) are essential for the retroconversion process. One or both of the known peroxisomal thiolases, 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) thiolase, may participate in retroconversion, but the former enzyme does not appear to be essential for this process. Thus, we conclude that the retroconversion step in DHA synthesis from C24:6n-3 proceeds via the peroxisomal straight-chain fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. We find no evidence for involvement of mitochondrial enzymes in this process. Radiolabeled [1-14C]18:3n-3 (52 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]22:5n-3 (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Standards of fatty acids and fatty acids methyl esters were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). The free fatty acid of C24:5n-3 and C24:6n-3 were generous gifts from A. Spector and H. Sprecher, respectively. Human skin fibroblasts from normal controls and patients with peroxisomal or mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders were obtained through the Kennedy Krieger Institute's Mental Retardation Research Center.

The disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation included deficiencies of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) (32Kelley R.I. Biochem.

Cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The radiolabeled substrates [1-14C]18:3n-3 and [1-14C]22:5n-3 were solubilized by preparing a complex of their sodium salts with serum albumin at a molar ratio of 3:1 (34Su H.M. Brenna J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When fibroblast cultures reached 90% confluence, they were incubated in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.05 μCi of [1-14C]18:3n-3 or 0.05 μCi of [1-14C]22:5n-3 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, incubations were for 72 h. After this labeling period, the medium was removed, the cells were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin. The suspended cells were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and stored at −20 °C after flushing the tube with nitrogen. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of deionized water and disrupted using a cup sonicator (550 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific) operated at 35% maximum power for 2 min. After removal of an aliquot for protein determination, lipids were extracted from the cell sonicate. Internal standards (C18:3n-3, C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, and DHA) were added, and total fatty acyls were converted to their methyl esters as described previously (35Moser A.B. Jones D.S. Raymond G.V. Moser H.W. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled fatty acid methyl esters were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography by a modification of the method of Moore et al. (14Moore S.A. Hurt E. Yoder E. Sprecher H. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2433-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were applied to a 4.6 × 150-mm Luna 3-μm C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and eluted with a mobile phase of water and acetonitrile at 0.75 ml/min. The elution program consisted of 76% acetonitrile for 55 min followed by a linear increase to 100% acetonitrile over 10 min and maintenance at this concentration for an additional 15 min. This program efficiently separated methyl esters of C18:3n-3, C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, C24:5n-3, C24:6n-3, and DHA. Labeled products were collected using a fraction collector. The mobile phase was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Labeled products were identified by comparing their retention times with fatty acid methyl ester standards. The purity of the major n-3 fatty acid methyl ester peaks was checked by gas chromatography (35Moser A.B. Jones D.S. Raymond G.V. Moser H.W. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Collected fractions identified as C18:3n-3, C20:5n-3, and DHA methyl esters were 99% pure. Collected fractions identified as C22:5n-3, C24:5n-3 and C22:5n-3 methyl esters contained unlabeled n-6 and n-9 fatty acids. The C22:5n-3 fraction contained linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), the C24:5n-3 fraction contained C22:4n-6 and 17:1n-9, and the C24:6n-3 fraction contained C22:5n-6. These associated fatty acids do not contribute to the radioactivity of the fraction. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of the specific radioactivity recovered. Until recently, the terminal steps in the accepted pathway for synthesis of DHA from dietary essential fatty acids required a Δ4-desaturase. Because no mammalian enzyme with this activity had been identified, Voss et al. (12Voss A. Reinhart M. Sankarappa S. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19995-20000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed the retroconversion pathway shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, Moore et al. (14Moore S.A. Hurt E. Yoder E. Sprecher H. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2433-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that retroconversion likely occurred in peroxisomes. Infante and Huszagh (18Infante J.P. Huszagh V.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Infante J.P. Huszagh V.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 168: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have recently challenged the involvement of peroxisomes in DHA synthesis, primarily on theoretical grounds. To address these issues, we examined the synthesis of DHA in cultured human skin fibroblasts using two precursors, [1-14C]18:3n-3 and [1-14C]22:5n-3. Cells from normal controls incubated with these substrates for 72 h incorporated label into DHA at a rate of 75 ± 10 and 31 ± 6.6 dpm/mg of protein/h, respectively. To confirm the original observation of Moore et al. (14Moore S.A. Hurt E. Yoder E. Sprecher H. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2433-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that DHA synthesis required functional peroxisomes, we studied cells from patients with Zellweger syndrome, a PBD in which multiple peroxisomal functions are defective. PBDs are caused by mutations in one of 23 known PEX genes (25Moser H.W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Brown T.W. Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and Moore et al. (14Moore S.A. Hurt E. Yoder E. Sprecher H. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2433-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied two patients with the same genotype. The clinical presentation of PBD patients ranges from severe (Zellweger syndrome) to moderate (neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy) to mild (infantile Refsum disease), and there is no genotype-phenotype correlation (38Gould S.J. Raymond G.V. Valle D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3181-3217Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig.2, cells from Zellweger syndrome patients with mutations in PEX1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -10, -12, and -16 were studied. The rate of radiolabeled DHA synthesis in fibroblasts from all Zellweger syndrome patients, with either [1-14C]18:3n-3 (Fig. 2, top panel) or [1-14C]22:5n-3 (Fig. 2, bottom panel) as substrate, was less than 5% of that in control cells. Thus, the defect is not limited to a single PBD genotype. These data therefore validate and extend the original observation that peroxisomes are essential for DHA synthesis. Moreover, radiolabeled C22:5n-3, C24:5n-3, and C24:6n-3 derived from both substrates were detected in Zellweger syndrome patient cell lines (data not shown). These intermediates precede peroxisomal retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA in the revised pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that peroxisomes are essential for DHA synthesis. In addition to defects in peroxisomal β-oxidation, patients with PBDs such as the Zellweger syndrome have multiple biochemical abnormalities, including a low rate of plasmalogen biosynthesis (39van den Bosch H. Schrakamp G. Hardeman D. Zomer A.W. Wanders R.J. Schutgens R.B. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Infante and Huszagh (18Infante J.P. Huszagh V.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have argued that the defect in plasmalogen biosynthesis in PBD patients contributes to their low rate of DHA synthesis. Therefore, we examined DHA synthesis from [1-14C]18:3n-3 and [1-14C]22:5n-3 in fibroblasts from patients with deficiency of either AOx or DBP. AOx catalyzes the first step in peroxisomal β-oxidation of straight-chain fatty acids, and DBP catalyzes the second (enoyl-CoA hydratase) and third (d-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) reactions of this pathway (Fig. 1) (24Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from patients with AOx deficiency synthesized DHA from either [1-14C]18:3n-3 (Fig. 3, top panel) or [1-14C]22:5n-3 (Fig. 3, bottom panel) at a rate less than 10% of that of control cell lines. Similarly DHA synthesis in cells from patients with DBP deficiency was less than 5% of control with [1-14C]18:3n-3 as substrate (Fig. 3, top panel) and was 20% of control with [1-14C]22:5n-3 as substrate (Fig. 3,bottom panel). Patients with AOx or DBP deficiency have defective peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation of VLCFA but normal plasmalogen synthesis (24Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). Therefore, these data indicate that both AOx and DBP are involved in DHA synthesis. We also investigated DHA synthesis in fibroblasts from patients with RCDP. Cells from RCDP patients fail to import the final peroxisomal β-oxidation enzyme 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase into the organelle and have defective plasmalogen biosynthesis (29Purdue P.E. Skoneczny M. Yang X. Zhang J.W. Lazarow P.B. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to AOx- and DBP-deficient fibroblasts, cells from RCDP patients synthesized DHA at nearly normal rates from either [1-14C]18:3n-3 (Fig. 3, top panel) or [1-14C]22:5n-3 (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Peroxisomes contain a second thiolase derived from SCPx in addition to 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (40Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the presence of SCPx thiolase, RCDP fibroblasts are able to oxidize VLCFA at normal rates (41Hoefler G. Hoefler S. Watkins P.A. Chen W.W. Moser A. Baldwin V. McGillivary B. Charrow J. Friedman J.M. Rutledge L. Hashimoto T. Moser H.W. J. Pediatr. 1988; 112: 726-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data indicate that peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase is not absolutely required for DHA synthesis. Furthermore, the results indicate that SCPx thiolase can catalyze this reaction but do not reveal whether 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase can do so. AOx is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal straight-chain fatty acid β-oxidation and is the first enzyme unique to the pathway (42Aoyama T. Souri M. Kamijo T. Ushikubo S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the accumulation of labeled DHA synthesis intermediates in control and AOx fibroblasts incubated for 8–120 h with either [1-14C]18:3n-3 or [1-14C]22:5n-3 substrates. As shown in Fig.4, only a small amount of the [1-14C]18:3n-3 substrate accumulated in either normal or AOx-deficient cell lines. In control cell lines, the amount of radiolabeled DHA increased with increasing incubation time up to 4 days and remained constant to 5 days. In contrast, DHA synthesis was significantly reduced in AOx-deficient cell lines. In both cell lines, the main radiolabeled intermediates, C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, C24:5n-3, and C24:6n-3, accumulated during the incubation period, suggesting that AOx is not required for any aspect of the n-3 fatty acid synthetic pathway from C18:3n-3 through to C24:6n-3. During the 5-day incubation period, the two most direct precursors of DHA, C24:5n-3 and C24:6n-3, accumulated to a higher level in AOx-deficient cell lines than in control fibroblasts (Fig. 4), supporting the conclusion that peroxisomal straight-chain fatty acid β-oxidation is essential for DHA synthesis. Similar results were obtained using [1-14C]22:5n-3 as substrate (Fig.5). Cellular accumulation of the substrate in normal cells increased slightly from 8 h to 1 day and then slowly decreased up to 5 days. In AOx-deficient cells, levels of the [1-14C]22:5n-3 substrate were 2–3 times higher than in control fibroblasts, consistent with a downstream metabolic impairment. Labeled DHA accumulated in control cells with increasing time of incubation but was never greater than 5% of control in AOx-deficient cells. In contrast, the level of labeled C24:6n-3, the most direct precursor of DHA prior to retroconversion, increased to more than 5-fold over control levels in AOx-deficient cells with increasing time of incubation. Accumulation of C24:5n-3, the intermediate preceding C24:6n-3 in the DHA biosynthetic pathway, was 2–3 times higher in AOx-deficient cell lines as compared with controls. A similar increase in C24:6n-3 and C24:5n-3 levels was observed in fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome and DBP deficiency (data not shown). These observations are consistent with a block in the DHA biosynthetic pathway between C24:6n-3 and DHA. We next determined whether DHA synthesis was defective in other human disorders of peroxisomal fatty acid catabolism. Peroxisomal β-oxidation of saturated, straight-chain VLCFA is defective in X-ALD due to mutations in the ABCD1 gene (43Smith K.D. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T. Lu J.F. Wei H.M. Geraghty M. Stetten G. Bergin J.S. Pevsner J. Watkins P.A. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters, the precise function of which remains unknown (43Smith K.D. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T. Lu J.F. Wei H.M. Geraghty M. Stetten G. Bergin J.S. Pevsner J. Watkins P.A. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Synthesis of DHA from either [1-14C]18:3n-3 or [1-14C]22:5n-3 was not impaired in fibroblasts from X-ALD patients (Fig. 6). This result indicates that, unlike saturated VLCFA, peroxisomal β-oxidation of C24:6n-3 to DHA does not require the participation of the product of the ABCD1 gene. Patients with Refsum disease have a defect in the peroxisomal α-oxidation of phytanic acid, a branched-chain fatty acid (30Wanders R.J.A. Jakobs C. Skjeldal O.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3303-3321Google Scholar). Like the situation with X-ALD, fibroblasts from Refsum disease patients synthesized DHA normally from either radiolabeled precursor (Fig. 6). Results presented above imply a role for peroxisomal β-oxidation in the retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA. To verify that defects in mitochondrial β-oxidation do not produce a similar impairment in DHA synthesis, we incubated fibroblasts from patients with deficiency of either MCAD or VLCAD with [1-14C]18:3n-3 or [1-14C]22:5n-3. As shown in Fig.7, neither disorder exhibited defective DHA synthesis from either labeled substrate. Furthermore, there was no significant accumulation of the C24:6n-3 intermediate in cells from MCAD or VLCAD patients. These findings support the hypothesis that peroxisomes, not mitochondria, are the subcellular site of retroconversion in DHA biosynthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes AOx and DBP are essential for the retroconversion step in DHA synthesis that shortens C24:6n-3 by two carbons. The involvement of peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase or peroxisomal SCPx thiolase in this process is also likely. Our data confirmed the existence of the new revised DHA synthetic pathway originally proposed by Voss et al. (12Voss A. Reinhart M. Sankarappa S. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19995-20000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which C22:5n-3 is elongated to C24:5n-3 and desaturated to C24:6n-3 before retroconversion. We conclude that in human skin fibroblasts, retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA proceeds via the peroxisomal straight-chain fatty acid β-oxidation pathway responsible for the catabolism of saturated VLCFA. The use of two radiolabeled substrates, [1-14C]18:3n-3 and [1-14C]22:5n-3, allowed us to examine DHA synthesis from both its natural parent precursor (C18:3n-3) and from an intermediate in the pathway (C22:5n-3) just proximal to the retroconversion step. The latter is the most direct radiolabeled precursor of DHA that is commercially available. The radiolabeled intermediates C24:5n-3 and C24:6n-3, derived from either [1-14C]18:3n-3 or [1-14C]22:5n-3, were detected in normal human skin fibroblasts and in cells from patients with peroxisomal disorders or mitochondrial disorders used in this present study. Over time, higher accumulations of those two metabolites were found in Zellweger syndrome patient cell lines and in patients with either AOx deficiency or DBP deficiency but not in those with mitochondrial β-oxidation defects. Analysis of labeled fatty acids accumulating in cells incubated from 8 to 120 h with labeled substrates allowed us to verify that the proposed intermediates in the pathway were indeed synthesized. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that C18:3n-3 is converted to DHA via a series of alternating desaturation and elongation steps up to C24:6n-3, reactions that occur in microsomes (44Sprecher H. Chen Q. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is not essential for DHA synthesis. The first step unique to mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, a group of enzymes with distinct but overlapping chain length specificities for acyl-CoAs (33Roe C.R. Ding J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2297-2326Google Scholar). Four acyl-CoA dehydrogenases have been described and designated as very long-chain (VLCAD), long-chain (LCAD), medium-chain (MCAD), and short-chain (SCAD) enzymes. Human patients with VLCAD, MCAD, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency are known, but true long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency has not been documented (33Roe C.R. Ding J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2297-2326Google Scholar). Our observation that DHA biosynthesis from either [1-14C]18:3n-3 or [1-14C]22:5n-3 in cells from patients with VLCAD and MCAD deficiency is consistent with the hypothesis that retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA does not occur in mitochondria. In contrast, peroxisomes are essential for DHA biosynthesis. The rate of DHA synthesis from either [1-14C]18:3n-3 or [1-14C]22:5n-3 in fibroblasts from Zellweger syndrome patients was less than 5% of control. Peroxisome assembly is defective in these patients, resulting in multiple biochemical abnormalities (8Moser H.W. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1993; 21: 1-106PubMed Google Scholar, 45Goldfischer S. Moore C.L. Johnson A.B. Spiro A.J. Valsamis M.P. Wisniewski H.K. Ritch R.H. Norton W.T. Rapin I. Gartner L.M. Science. 1973; 182: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). At present, at least 23 PEX genes encoding peroxisomal assembly factors (peroxins) have been identified (37Brown T.W. Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M. Just W.W. Kiel J.A. Kunau W.H.

Deficiencies of 10 PEX genes are known to cause PBDs in humans (25Moser H.W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present study, the genotypes of the Zellweger syndrome patients included defects of PEX1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -10, -12, and -16. Defective peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation of saturated VLCFA is observed in all of these genotypes (38Gould S.J. Raymond G.V. Valle D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3181-3217Google Scholar). Because the rate of DHA synthesis was <5% of control for nearly all genotypes tested, results from all Zellweger syndrome fibroblasts are reported as a group. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that defective peroxisomal β-oxidation is responsible for DHA deficiency and C24:6n-3 accumulation in PBD patients. Fibroblasts from PBD patients with the above genotypes also have defective biosynthesis of plasmalogens (38Gould S.J. Raymond G.V. Valle D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3181-3217Google Scholar). Infante and Huszagh (18Infante J.P. Huszagh V.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) proposed that low membrane plasmalogen levels contributed to the low rate of DHA synthesis in PBD patients. Our findings that DHA synthesis was normal in fibroblasts from RCDP patients dispute this hypothesis. Classical RCDP results from mutations in PEX7, the gene encoding the cytoplasmic receptor for proteins targeted to peroxisomes via peroxisome-targeting signal 2 (PTS2) (38Gould S.J. Raymond G.V. Valle D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3181-3217Google Scholar). PTS2-containing proteins include the β-oxidation enzyme 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and a key enzyme in plasmalogen synthesis, alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (48de Vet E.C. Ijlst L. Oostheim W. Wanders R.J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10296-10301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although plasmalogen synthesis is profoundly deficient in these cells, saturated VLCFA β-oxidation proceeds normally due to the presence of a second thiolase, SCPx thiolase, which is targeted to peroxisomes by a different signal, PTS1 (23Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Mol. Asp. Med. 1998; 19: 69-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data reported in Fig. 3were obtained from PEX7-deficient RCDP type 1 patient fibroblasts. We also found that DHA synthesis from [1-14C]18:3n-3 was normal in fibroblasts from two patients with RCDP type 2 (dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase deficiency) and one patient with RCDP type 3 (alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase deficiency) (data not shown). RCDP type 2 and 3 patients have defective plasmalogen synthesis, normal VLCFA β-oxidation, and normal targeting of both 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and SCPx thiolase to peroxisomes (24Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). Therefore, at least in fibroblasts, defective plasmalogen synthesis without a concomitant β-oxidation deficiency does not adversely affect DHA synthesis. While our studies indicate that SCPx thiolase can participate in peroxisomal retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA, they do not rule out the possibility that 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase is also capable of catalyzing this last step in DHA synthesis. Human peroxisomes contain two fatty acid β-oxidation pathways, one for straight-chain fatty acids and the other for methyl-branched-chain fatty acids (49Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 50Wanders R.J. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 51Wanders R.J. van Grunsven E.G. Jansen G.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Until recently, it had been believed that human peroxisomal β-oxidation of saturated unbranched fatty acids such as the VLCFA C26:0 required AOx, L-bifunctional protein, and 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase. Similarly it was thought that human β-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids such as pristanic acid involved branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, DBP, and SCPx thiolase. In 2001, Wanders et al. (24Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar) proposed that the human pathway for β-oxidation of saturated VLCFA be revised to include AOx, DBP (and not L-bifunctional protein), and either 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolaseor SCPx thiolase; the branched-chain pathway remains unchanged. Our observation that AOx or DBP, both of which are essential for β-oxidation of saturated VLCFA, are also required for the retroconversion step of DHA biosynthesis is consistent with Wanders' proposed pathway. Our observations that DHA synthesis is normal in X-ALD fibroblasts highlight one important distinction between peroxisomal β-oxidation of VLCFA and retroconversion of C24:6n-3 to DHA. The ALD protein, product of the ABCD1 gene defective in X-ALD, is apparently not required for DHA biosynthesis. Although the ALD protein belongs to the large family of ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporters, its precise function is not yet known. Normal DHA synthesis in Refsum disease patient fibroblasts is consistent with the notion that peroxisomal α-oxidation does not participate in DHA synthesis. In conclusion, our results clearly provide evidence that in human skin fibroblasts the retroconversion step of DHA synthesis, a two-carbon shortening system from C24:6n-3, requires peroxisomal enzymes AOx and DBP as well as either 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase or SCPx thiolase. We further conclude that the retroconversion step in DHA synthesis proceeds via peroxisomal straight-chain fatty acid β-oxidation but not via peroxisomal branched-chain fatty acid β-oxidation or mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Our data support all facets of the new revised DHA synthetic pathway."

Here we report a splice variant ofAIB1 mRNA that lacks the exon 3 sequence. We determined that the AIB-Δ3 mRNA encoded a 130-kDa protein that lacks the NH2-terminal basic helix-loop-helix and a portion of the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim homology) dimerization domain. The 130-kDa protein was detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells at levels that were 5–10% of the full-length protein, whereas in non-transformed mammary epithelium lines, the AIB-Δ3 protein was present at significantly lower levels compared with the full-length AIB1. Consistent with this finding, the abundance of AIB1-Δ3 mRNA was increased in human breast cancer specimens relative to that in normal breast tissue. To determine whether there were phenotypic changes associated with the overexpression of the AIB-Δ3 isoform, we performed functional reporter gene assays. These revealed that the ability of AIB1-Δ3 to promote transcription mediated by the estrogen or progesterone receptors was significantly greater than that of the full-length protein. Surprisingly, the AIB1-Δ3 isoform was also more effective than AIB1 in promoting transcription induced by epidermal growth factor. Overexpression of AIB1-Δ3 may thus play an important role in sensitizing breast tumor cells to hormone or growth factor stimulation.

The AIB1 gene is amplified in 5–10% of breast cancers, and the abundance of the corresponding mRNA and protein is increased in some breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines (14Anzick A.L.

In addition, several splice variants of SRC family members have been described, although the functions of these variants remain unknown (13McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a splice variant ofAIB1 that is overexpressed in breast cancer tissue and cell lines. The AIB-Δ3 transcript encodes an NH2-terminal truncated version of AIB1 that lacks the bHLH and PAS A domains. In functional studies we have determined that the AIB-Δ3 protein is a significantly more effective coactivator of estrogen, progesterone, and EGF signaling than the wild type ER, suggesting a role for this AIB1 isoform in hormone and paracrine signaling in breast cancer. We subcloned the full-length AIB1cDNA from pCMX-ACTR (provided by R. Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with the use of the flanking KpnI and XhoI sites, thereby creating the expression vector pcDNA3-AIB1. We subcloned the smaller of the two RT-PCR products generated from MCF-7 cell total RNA with exon 1- and exon 9-specific primers (Fig. 1b) into pCRII (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and HpaI, recognition sequences that flank the splice sites of AIB1-Δ3 cDNA, and the released fragment was purified and used to replace the corresponding sequence of pcDNA3-AIB1, thereby creating pcDNA3-AIB1-Δ3. The pcDNA3-AIB1 and pcDNA3-AIB1-Δ3 vectors contain identical 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, differing only in the loss of exon 3 in the latter. The inserts were verified by sequencing. The expression vectors for human estrogen receptor α and progesterone receptor B were provided by P. Chambon (CNRS, France). The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing the estrogen response element (ERE) from the Xenopus vitellogenin gene was provided by V. C. Jordan (Northwestern University, Chicago), and the plasmid containing the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter was provided by G. Hager (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human FGF-BP gene promoter has been described previously (32Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Renillaluciferase vector (pRL-CMV) was from Promega. All cell lines were obtained from the tissue culture core facility of the Lombardi Cancer Center. MCF-7, ME-180, and COS-1 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium (IMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF-10A and A1N4 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of IMEM and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) that was supplemented with 5% horse serum, EGF (20 ng/ml), insulin (10 µg/ml), and hydrocortisone (500 ng/ml). CHO cells were maintained in F-12 nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS. Frozen tissue samples were obtained from the Lombardi Cancer Center Histopathology and Tissue Shared Resource Core. The six normal samples were obtained from individuals undergoing reduction mammoplasty (mean age at time of surgery, 29 years; range, 19 to 54 years); the eight primary breast carcinoma specimens were obtained from women with a mean age at the time of surgery of 51 years (range, 29 to 64 years). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (32Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and equal portions (30 µg of protein) were resolved either on denaturing 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels or on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing Tris-glycine. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with a 1:500 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for amino acids 376–389 of human AIB1 (Transduction Laboratories), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin (1:10,000 dilution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isolation of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA by RT were performed as described previously (33Fang W.J. Hartmann N. Chow D. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amplification ofAIB1 cDNA sequences was achieved by PCR according to the following protocol: incubation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 90 s. The oligonucleotides used as primers for PCR or as probes for hybridization were as follows: exon 1, 5′-GACTGGTTAGCCAGTTGCTG-3′; exon 2, 5′-GCCATGTGATACTCCAGGAC-3′; exon 3, 5′-CTGAGCTGATATCTGCCAATC-3′; exon 4, 5′-AGCCGATGTATCTTCTACAGG-3′; exon 5, 5′-ATGTTTCCGTCTCGATTCACC-3′; exon 8, 5′-CCTCATGGAGGATCTCAGTG-3′; and exon 9, 5′-CCATCAGCCAACGAGAATCG-3′. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and hybridized with a32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Quantification of PCR products was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics 445SI). COS-1 and CHO cells were plated at densities of 2 × 105 and 5 × 105 cells/well, respectively, in six-well plates and were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2in IMEM or Ham's F-12, respectively, supplemented with 5% FBS that had been treated with dextran-coated charcoal. The medium was then replaced with IMEM containing LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) and expression and reporter plasmids as indicated. After incubation for 3 h, the medium was replaced with IMEM (COS-1 cells) or Ham's F-12 (CHO cells), each containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS and nuclear receptor ligands. Cells were incubated for 24 h and then disrupted in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Portions (20 µl) of the resulting cell extract were assayed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). ME-180 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105cells/well and cultured for 24 h in IMEM supplemented with 5% dextran-charcoal-treated FBS. They were then incubated for 3 h in IMEM supplemented with LipofectAMINE Plus and expression and reporter plasmids. The cells were washed and then incubated in IMEM for an additional 3 h before incubation for 18 h with EGF (5 ng/ml) in serum-free IMEM and subsequent lysis. Because of high background induction of pRL-CMV expression by EGF, firefly luciferase activity was normalized by protein concentration as described previously (32Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription-translation was performed with the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Plasmid DNA (1 µg) was combined with 25 µl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2 µl of TnT reaction buffer, 1 µl of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 µl of amino acid mixture, 1 µl of Rnasin (Ambion) ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units), and 1 µl of Transcend biotin-lysyl-tRNA (Roche) and the final volume was adjusted to 50 µl. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 90 min, after which 5 µl of the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and either to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to AIB1 or to direct detection with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) and enhanced chemiluminescence. In this study we determined whether there are naturally occurring splice variants of AIB1 present in breast cancer cells that might encode proteins with altered function relevant to breast cancer progression. The exon-intron structure of AIB1 was assembled as shown in Fig.1 a by comparing the published sequence of the cDNA (14Anzick A.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar) with the contiguous genomic sequence available through the NCBI data base. We arbitrarily designated the most 5′ exon of AIB1 as exon 1, with the result that the first codon is located in exon 2. Our initial strategy was to determine whether RNA from MCF-7 cells, which overexpress AIB1 (14Anzick A.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar), contained any splice variant forms of AIB1 RNA. To achieve this end, we performed reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of total RNA from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with primers amplifying the region between exons 1 and 9. This revealed two PCR products that differed in size by ∼150 base pairs. These PCR products were then subjected to Southern blot analysis, and individual lanes from the membrane were probed separately with oligonucleotides specific for each exon from 2 to 8. Typical hybridizations with exons 2, 3, and 8 are shown in Fig. 1 b. This analysis revealed that the smaller PCR product hybridized with all probes except the one specific for exon 3 (Fig. 1 b), indicating that the lower band corresponds to an RNA splice variant (designated AIB1-Δ3) of AIB1 that lacks the exon 3 sequence. We subsequently subcloned and sequenced this PCR product, confirming that nucleotides 267–439 (exon 3) of the full-length AIB1 cDNA were missing (Fig. 1 c). To determine whether an AIB1-related protein was encoded by theAIB1-Δ3 mRNA, we performed in vitrotranscription and translation of AIB1-Δ3 cDNA. Western blot analysis with an AIB1-specific antibody of the proteins translatedin vitro revealed the production of a 130-kDa protein (Fig.2). Interestingly, we had also consistently detected a similar 130-kDa protein, in addition to the 156-kDa full-length AIB1, by immunoblot analysis of MCF-7 cell extracts with antibodies to AIB1 on 5–20% polyacrylamide gels (27List H.-J. Reiter R. Singh B. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 2016: 1-8Google Scholar). To determine whether the MCF-7 130-kDa species and the in vitrotranscription translation product had identical electrophoretic properties, we performed high resolution electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing Tris-glycine followed by immunoblot analysis. This analysis demonstrated that the mobility of the 130-kDa protein detected in MCF-7 cell extracts was identical to that of the 130-kDa protein produced by in vitro transcription and translation of AIB1-Δ3 cDNA (Fig. 2). This observation suggested that the 130-kDa MCF-7 cell protein was translated fromAIB1-Δ3 mRNA present in these cells. To verify that the AIB1-Δ3 mRNA was translatedin vivo we performed transient transfection of CHO cells (Fig. 2; see Fig. 4a) or COS-1 cells (see Fig.5a) with the AIB1-Δ3 cDNA. Analysis of cell extracts demonstrated that this indeed resulted in the production of a 130-kDa protein, whereas transfection with the full-lengthAIB1 cDNA yielded only the 156-kDa full-length protein. This latter observation demonstrated that the 130-kDa protein was clearly not the product of proteolytic processing of the full-length protein. The electrophoretic mobility of the 130-kDa protein synthesized in cells transfected with the AIB1-Δ3 cDNA was identical to that of both the 130-kDa AIB1 species present in MCF-7 cell extracts and the product of in vitrotranscription-translation of the AIB1-Δ3 cDNA (Fig.2). Together these data indicated that the endogenousAIB1-Δ3 mRNA present in MCF-7 cells encodes a 130-kDa protein.Figure 5Effects of AIB1 and AIB1-Δ3 on the activation of estrogen receptor α and progesterone receptor B in COS-1 cells. a, cells were transfected and analyzed as described in the legend for Fig. 4 a (the amount of pcDNA3-AIB1 was 3 µg). b, cells were transfected with 1 µg of either pcDNA3, pcDNA3-AIB1, or pcDNA-AIB1-Δ3 together with an expression vector for human progesterone receptor B (10 ng), a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (1 µg), and pRL-CMV (0.1 ng).

We did not detect this predicted low molecular mass product in vivo or in vitro. The 130-kDa species is detected by an AIB1 antibody raised against amino acids 376–389 in the amino terminus of the protein. This suggests that the AIB1-Δ3 isoform most likely represents an NH2-terminally truncated form of AIB1, with synthesis being initiated at an internal translation start site downstream of the splice junction but prior to amino acid 376. Such internal translational initiation has been described for various mRNAs with extended 5′-untranslated regions (34Nanbru C. Lafon I. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Huez G. Prats A.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The difference in size between the 156-kDa full-length AIB1 protein and the 130-kDa species suggested that the latter lacks ∼210 amino acids of the former, including all of the bHLH region (residues 16–88) and most of the PAS A domain (residues 116–171) (Fig. 1 c). This would place the initiation codon for the 130-kDa protein most likely at the codon at position 778 (Fig. 1 c). Interestingly, for cells transfected with equivalent amounts of cDNA, the intracellular concentration of AIB1-Δ3 protein was ∼10% of that of full-length AIB1 (Fig. 2; see Figs. 4 a and 5 a), suggesting that translation initiation of the splice variant was inefficient, possibly because of the long 5′-untranslated region of theAIB1-Δ3 mRNA. Given that we first detected the AIB1-Δ3splice variant in a breast cancer cell line, we next examined whether its expression was restricted to tumor cells. MCF-7 cells are derived from a pleural effusion of metastatic breast cancer, whereas MCF-10A and A1N4 cells are not malignantly transformed and were derived from atypical human breast epithelial hyperplasia (38Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar) and from human mammary epithelial cells treated with benzopyrene (39Stampfer M.R. Bartley J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2394-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), respectively. RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis revealed that the amounts ofAIB1-Δ3 mRNA in MCF-10A and A1N4 cells were lower than that of MCF-7 cells (Fig.3a). By subsequent real-time PCR analysis, using primers specific for AIB1 or its isoform, we have assessed that the ratio of AIB1-Δ3 mRNA/full-length AIB1 is 5% in MCF-7 cells, whereas in MCF-10A and AIN4 cells the ratio is 0.5% (data not shown). We then compared the abundance of theAIB1-Δ3 mRNA in a series of eight human breast tumors with that in normal tissue obtained from six women undergoing breast reduction mammoplasty. The amount of the full-length AIB1mRNA in tumor samples was slightly greater than that in the normal tissue samples, but this difference was not significant (Fig.3 b). In contrast, the abundance of the AIB1-Δ3mRNA in the tumor specimens was significantly greater than that in the normal tissue samples, with all but one of the tumors showing an increased amount of this transcript compared with the normal range. We next examined the effect of the deletion of the bHLH and PAS A domains in AIB1-Δ3 on protein function. AIB1 acts as a coactivator for several nuclear receptors, including those for estrogen and progesterone, which are important in breast carcinogenesis. We therefore transfected CHO cells with expression vectors encoding full-length AIB1 or AIB1-Δ3, an expression vector for estrogen receptor α, and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing an ERE. Transfection of CHO cells with 3 µg of the AIB1 expression vector resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in estrogen-induced luciferase activity, whereas transfection with 3 µg of the vector for AIB1-Δ3 resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in the estrogen response (Fig.4 a). However, given that the abundance of recombinant AIB1 in the transfected cells was about 10 times that of AIB-Δ3, we also transfected CHO cells with 0.3 µg of the AIB1 vector, which yielded about the same amount of intracellular recombinant protein as did 3 µg of the AIB1-Δ3 vector (Fig. 4 a). A comparison of transfected cells containing approximately equal amounts of recombinant protein thus revealed that AIB1 and AIB1-Δ3 potentiated the estrogen response by factors of 1.1 and 3.8, respectively. Similar transfection experiments with COS-1 cells (which express endogenous AIB1) also demonstrated a greater potentiation of the estrogen response by AIB1-Δ3 than by full-length AIB1 (Fig. 5 a). The differences between full-length and the AIB1-Δ3 isoform were seen at different concentrations of estrogen (0.1–10 nm) and thus were not due to a change in the affinity of the hormone for its receptor but rather suggest enhanced efficacy of the signaling (data not shown). We also obtained similar results in COS-1 cells with an expression vector encoding progesterone receptor B; the transcriptional response to the progesterone analog R5020 was thus potentiated to a greater extent by AIB1-Δ3 than by AIB1 in both CHO and COS-1 cells (Figs. 4 b and 5 b). Of particular note is that small amounts of transfected AIB-Δ3 protein had significant effects on ER- and progesterone receptor-induced transcription even against a relatively high background of full-length AIB1 (Fig. 5,a and b). The fact that members of the p160 SRC family act as coactivators in intracellular signaling pathways that activate transcription factors other than nuclear receptors (30Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Lee S.K. Kim H.J. Kim J.W. Lee J.W. Mol Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1924-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether AIB1-Δ3 might be able to sensitize breast cancer cells to growth factor signaling. Overexpression of members of the families of epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligands or EGF receptors is important in the malignant progression of breast cancer (40Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 559-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Such growth factors also contribute to the hormone-independent phenotype of breast tumors and the HER-2 receptor is a target of current therapies (41Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. Baselga J. Norton L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (9491) Google Scholar). To determine whether AIB1 and AIB1-Δ3 affect EGF signaling, we transfected ME-180 human squamous cell carcinoma cells with the respective expression vectors and with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the promoter of the fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (FGF-BP) gene. FGF-BP functions as an angiogenic switch molecule (42Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) that is overexpressed in breast cancer, and its gene is activated by EGF in squamous cell and breast cancer cell lines (32Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As reported previously, EGF induced a 2.5-fold increase in reporter activity in control cells transfected with the empty expression vector (Fig. 6). The basal EGF induction was increased slightly by transfection of the full-length AIB1 expression vector, whereas EGF induction was increased ∼6-fold by expressing recombinant AIB1-Δ3. In this study we have provided evidence for the presence of a splice variant of AIB1 that has exon 3 deleted. TheAIB1-Δ3 mRNA is translated in vivo in breast cancer cells into an NH2-terminal truncated form of AIB1 that has several properties of interest. The first is that on a per molecule basis it is a more potent transcriptional coactivator of both the estrogen and progesterone receptors than the full-length AIB1 protein. This result was unexpected given that previous studies of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of the AIB1-related protein SRC-1 did not reveal an impact of this region on nuclear receptor signaling (9Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 30Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One possible reason for the increased activity of AIB1-Δ3 is that the conformation of this isoform is more favorable than that of the full-length protein for interaction with nuclear receptors or for recruitment of other coactivators such as CBP/p300. An alternative possibility is suggested by the observation that the bHLH-PAS domain of SRC-1 interacts with and potentiate the activity of members of the TEF (transcription-enhancing factor) family of transcription factors (30Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, full-length AIB1 might be unavailable for interaction with nuclear receptors because it is sequestered or squelched by other intracellular factors. In contrast, AIB1-Δ3, which lacks an intact bHLH-PAS domain, would not bind to factors such as TEF and would be available for nuclear receptor coactivation. This notion might explain why relatively small amounts of recombinant AIB1-Δ3 are able to induce significant potentiation of nuclear receptor activity in transfected COS-1 cells with a high background of endogenous full-length AIB1. This model also predicts that the relative coactivating effects of AIB1 and AIB1-Δ3 might be cell type-specific, depending on the endogenous expression of AIB1-sequestering molecules such as TEF. Interestingly, a recent report has described that the human MMS19 protein can interact with the PAS-HLH domain of AIB1 and can regulate ER-mediated transcriptional activity (43Wu X. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23962-23968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is possible that the lack of interaction of AIB1-Δ3 with this protein may explain some of its increased effectiveness in vivo. Whatever the reason for the increased activity of the AIB1-Δ3 isoform, our data suggest that its expression would sensitize cells to the effects of estrogen and progesterone. The second interesting aspect of the function of the AIB1-Δ3 isoform was that it also potently increased EGF signaling in ME-180 squamous carcinoma cells. This could be through direct interactions with a nuclear receptor. However, our analysis of the fragment of theFGF-BP gene promoter (nucleotides −118 to +62, relative to the transcription start site) used in this study did not reveal obvious consensus recognition sites for known nuclear receptors. In fact, EGF induction of this promoter is dependent on the factors AP-1 and c/EBPβ (32Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), either of which may interact directly or indirectly with AIB1. Alternatively it may be that a common intermediary of both nuclear receptor and AP-1 signaling such as CBP/p300 (44Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) may be the target of the superactivating effects of the AIB1-Δ3 isoform. Whatever the mechanism of the increased potentiation of growth factor signaling by the AIB1-Δ3 isoform, our data suggest that an increase in the abundance of the AIB1-Δ3 isoform in mammary epithelial cells may be an important step in tumor progression and in the development of a more aggressive, hormone-independent phenotype. Finally, of major interest for breast cancer is our finding that theAIB1-Δ3 mRNA is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and in human breast tumors. Our analysis of tumor cell lines suggests that there is an overall increase in the AIB1-Δ3mRNA relative to the full-length AIB1, although we do not know whether this is related to the gene amplification status of the endogenous gene. Alternatively, the increase in AIB1-Δ3mRNA may be because of an increase in RNA splicing of exon 3 in breast cancer cells. It is also possible that the increase in expression in tumors may be due in part to dilution effects of surrounding stromal tissue, but this seems unlikely given that we also see lower AIB1-Δ3 mRNA expression in non-transformedversus malignant mammary epithelial cell lines. To date a number of laboratories, including ours, have reported overexpression ofAIB1 mRNA and protein in breast tumor tissue, although the assessment of the portion of breast cancers overexpressing AIB1 varies widely between groups (14Anzick A.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 27List H.-J.

In addition, some groups have determined that AIB1 overexpression is correlated with ER and progesterone receptor status (26Bautista S. Valles H. Walker S.L. Anzick S. Zellinger R. Meltzer P. Theillet C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others have found an inverse relationship with steroid receptor expression but a positive correlation with HER-2 and p53 expression (47Bouras T. Southey M.C. Venter D.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 903-907PubMed Google Scholar). However, all of these RT-PCR or immunohistochemical analyses of expression levels have not distinguished the AIB1-Δ3 isoform signal from that of the wild type. Our data indicates that the overexpression of relatively low levels of the AIB1-Δ3 isoform can sensitize cells to estrogen, progesterone, and growth factors. Therefore we believe that measurement of increased levels of AIB1-Δ3 levels might be a sensitive indicator of the progression of breast cancer to a more hormone-independent phenotype.

Cataracts can occur both under hypocalcemic and hypercalcemic conditions, so the actual amount of available calcium in the lens is an important parameter for the health of the lens (1Duncan G. Jacob T.J.C. CIBA Found. Symp. 1984; 206: 132-152Google Scholar, 2Duncan G. Williams M.R. Riach R.A. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1994; 13: 623-650Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The normal mammalian lens has around 0.2 mm total calcium, of which the amount of free Ca2+ is only of the order of a few micromolars. Thus there must exist calcium regulation systems in the lens, and it is of interest to identify what they are and how they change in health and in disease. Vrensen et al. (3Vrensen G.F.J.M. Sanderson J. Willekens B. Duncan G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: S198Google Scholar) have done an ultrastructural analysis of calcium distribution in the rat lens and have found calcium precipitates in the intermediate cortex fiber membranes, cytoplasm, and the nuclear envelope and very low levels of calcium in gap junctions, epithelial cells, and superficial fibers (3Vrensen G.F.J.M.

The question of what the calcium-binding and -storing agents are in the lens is open; phospholipids and crystallins have been thought of as candidates. The major components of the lens are cytosolic proteins, crystallins, which account for about 40% of the wet weight of the lens. It is worth investigating whether any of the crystallins could act as a calcium sponge or storage depot in the tissue, particularly since the ultrastructural analysis shows calcium distribution in the cytoplasm. We have earlier shown that the β- and avian core protein δ-crystallins show significant calcium-binding ability (6Sharma Y. Rao C.M. Narasu M.L. Rao S.C. Somasundaram T. Gopalakrishna A.

Thus, the possibility of crystallins acting as lenticular calcium-sequestering and -storing systems exists. However, the calcium binding properties of γ-crystallin have not yet been reported. γ-Crystallin is a well studied protein and was the first crystallin whose structure was solved (8Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The Greek key crystallin fold was first described in this protein (8Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It was later found in another lens protein, β-crystallin, and in several other non-lens proteins, which were together classified as the βγ-crystallin superfamily (9Wistow G. Turnell B. Summers L.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The crystallin fold, also called the βγ motif, is a super-secondary structure formed from the symmetrical association of the two Greek key motifs that are organized as two four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets (8Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 9Wistow G. Turnell B. Summers L. Slingsby C. Moss D.

The crystallin fold is a protein domain in which aromatic residues Tyr/Phe/Trp at position 1 and Gly at position 8 constitute the conserved sequence (Y/F/W)XXXXXXG, followed by a Ser at positions 28–34 from the first Y/F/W residue, and this sequence is repeated within 40 residues. Gly-8 is irreplaceable and is needed for forming a dihedral angle, which is not possible with any other amino acid. These residues are required for the stabilization of the folded hairpin of the βγ motif (11Hemmingsen J.M. Gernert K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Between Gly-8 and Ser-34 lie two charge clusters of alternate signs (12Chirgadze Y.N. Tabolina O.Y.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) are the non-lens members of the βγ-crystallin superfamily. βγ-Crystallins are thought to have originated from a single domain ancestor by gene duplication and gene fusion (25Lubsen N.H. Aarts H.J.M. Shoenmakers J.G.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1988; 51: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The βγ motif is seen in single domain (spherulin 3a and WmKT), two domain (β- and γ-crystallins, protein S, EP37, SMPI) as well as multidomain proteins (AIM1). Evolutionarily, these proteins are among the most long-lived globular proteins known, generally expressed under stressed, adverse conditions or in differentiating tissues. It is believed that the crystallin domain evolved in proteins of extraordinary stability. Members of this superfamily have, therefore, been studied for their stability and architecture. An interesting feature of some of these proteins is their calcium-binding ability,e.g. β-crystallin (6Sharma Y. Rao C.M. Narasu M.L. Rao S.C. Somasundaram T. Gopalakrishna A. Balasubramanian D. J.

Biol. 1997; 271: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Putative calcium-binding sites have been shown in the EP37 proteins (20Ogawa M. Takabatake T. Takahashi T.C. Takeshima K. Dev. Genes Evol. 1997; 206: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, these proteins do not have any of the well characterized motifs for calcium binding, such as the EF-hand, lipocortin-, or the annexin-like domains. They thus seem to contain an “orphan” motif, which needs to be identified. Surprisingly, the calcium-binding ability of γ-crystallin is not yet known, although it is the representative model of the superfamily, whose three-dimensional structure is very well known. Studying the calcium binding to γ-crystallin not only points to the inherent characteristic of the superfamily but would also help in identifying the orphan motif in the members of βγ-crystallin superfamily. In this work, we report that γ-crystallin does bind calcium. We also show that the Greek key crystallin fold forms the calcium-binding site. Since members of this superfamily share a homologous crystallin fold, we suggest that other members also bind calcium and thus represent a novel class of calcium-binding proteins. All chemicals used were of the analytical grade. Terbium chloride was obtained from Aldrich and Stains-all from Sigma. Radioactive calcium chloride (45CaCl2, specific activity 11.7 mCi/mg) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine eyes were collected from animals (age 3–5 years) from a local slaughterhouse and brought to the laboratory on ice. Lenses were excised and homogenized in the gel filtration buffer. γ-Crystallin from bovine lenses was purified on a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column (2.5 × 90 cm) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. Solutions of crystallins were rendered calcium-free by dialyzing first against EDTA at pH 2 and then against calcium-free water. Protein solutions were concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit with YM-10 membrane. Finally, protein and buffer solutions were passed through Chelex-100 columns before use, so as to remove any calcium that might be present as a contaminant and stored in plasticware. Protein concentrations were calculated from their absorption coefficients. We have selected a stretch of 42 amino acids corresponding to the third motif of the bovine γII-crystallin (residues 90–131) to have a complete geometry of the Greek key crystallin fold. We have synthesized the wild type and its variants by modifying the potential residues by replacing them with Lys to see if these amino acids affect the binding affinity. We have also synthesized a 42-residue peptide corresponding to 14–56 amino acid residues of spherulin 3a to use as a control. The sequences of the synthetic peptides studied in the present work are reported in TableI. These peptides were synthesized according to the solid-phase procedure of Merrifield (28Merrifield R.B. Adv. Enzymol. 1969; 32: 221-296PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (29Fairwell T. Hospattankar A.V. Brewer H.B. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The purity and analysis of synthesized peptides were done on mass spectroscopy as well as by sequence analysis. The aggregational properties of these peptides were evaluated on gel filtration HPLC using the column, Protein-Pak 125 (Waters Associates, Millipore), in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl.Table IGreek key peptidesPeptidesAmino acid sequenceg390RMRIYERDDFRGQMSEITDDCPSLQDRFHLTEVHSLNVLEGS131g3a90RMRIYKRDDFRGQMSEITDDCPSLQDRFHLTKVHSLNVLEGS131g3b90RMRIYERDDFRGQMSEITKKCPSLQDRFHLTEVHSLNVLEGS131s3a14GEVFLYKHVNFQGDSWKVTGNVYDFRSVSGLNDVVSSVKVGPN56Amino acid sequence of the Greek key crystallin fold peptide (corresponding to the third Greek key of bovine γ-crystallin) and its mutants were synthesized and studied for calcium binding.

The binding of 45Ca to γ-crystallin was studied by the gel filtration method of Hummel and Dreyer (30Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Plastic containers, tubes, and bottles were used to avoid Ca2+contamination from laboratory glassware. Protein solutions were equilibrated with 45Ca for 1 h at room temperature and applied to Sephadex G-25 columns (25 × 2 cm) that had been equilibrated earlier with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl containing varying amounts of (25–100 µm) calcium chloride solution (including45Ca). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and total radioactivity in each fraction was counted for 45Ca in a Hewlett-Packard liquid scintillation counter. Bound Ca2+concentration was determined using the area of the radioactive peak corresponding to protein-bound 45Ca and the accompanying trough. Klotz plots (inverse plot, 1/r versus1/A) of the data collected at different free Ca2+ concentrations were used to estimate the binding constants (31Klotz I.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Klotz I.M. Hunston D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10060-10062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium binding to peptides was done by 45Ca overlay method of Maruyama et al. (33Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). 20–50 µg of peptides were spotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by dot-blot apparatus. The membrane was equilibrated in a solution containing 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 60 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and then incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the same buffer containing 1 µCi/ml 45Ca. The membrane was then rinsed twice in 45% ethanol, blotted dry, and exposed to PhosphorImager screen, and the signal was read in PhosphorImager (Fuji Bas-1800). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C with 7 accumulations. Cells of appropriate path lengths were used depending on the spectral region (0.02 and 2 cm for far- and near-UV CD, respectively). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded in the region of 195–250 nm. The ellipticity values were expressed in millidegrees. Aliquots of protein solutions were added to the Stains-all1solution and mixed gently. Circular dichroism induced in the achiral dye upon binding to the protein was measured in the visible region of the spectrum (400–700 nm). The dye solution and the crystallins were prepared in 2 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 30% ethylene glycol (34Caday C.G. Steiner R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5985-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sharma Y. Rao C.M. Rao C.S. Somasundaram T. Gopalakrishna A. Balasubramanian D. J. Biol.

Fluorescence emission spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-4010 spectrofluorimeter. The intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins was recorded by exciting the solution at 295 nm and measuring the emission in the 310–400-nm region. All spectra were recorded in the correct spectrum mode with excitation and emission band passes of 5 nm each. Terbium binding experiments were done in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.4. Aliquots of terbium chloride (10 mm stock prepared in water) were added to the protein solution, and spectra were recorded. The amino acid sequence of individual βγ motifs of bovine γβ-crystallin were aligned along with the members of the superfamily. The residues involved in calcium ligation were identified based on sequence homology with protein S and investigated in the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 4GCR.pdb) on a Silicon Graphics work station using software Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego. The position of calcium atom was fixed in space along with oxygens of side chain of amino acid residues that coordinate with it. Optimization and molecular dynamics operations were performed on this assembly. The calcium binding to γ-crystallin was performed by gel filtration method of Hummel-Dreyer (see Ref. 30Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). A representative Hummel-Dreyer gel elution chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1A. In a calcium-equilibrated column, a high radioactivity count at the protein elution peak (void volume), which quantitated calcium bound to the protein, was followed by a trough of low radioactivity count, which represented calcium depletion following calcium binding to the protein (Fig. 1A). The gel chromatography runs were repeated at45Ca concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 µm, keeping protein concentration constant. The dissociation constant, KD, for γ-crystallin was calculated by an inverse plot (31Klotz I.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from several chromatographic runs and found to be 90 µm, with 4 sites for metal binding (Fig. 1B). The calcium-binding affinity of γ-crystallin (90 µm) was comparable to that of other members of this superfamily (Table II).Table IIKD and number of binding sites (n) calculated for γ-crystallinProteinsKDNumber of binding sitesRefs.µmγ-Crystallin904This workβL-Crystallin170418Ray M.E.

We have used the calcium-mimic dye Stains-all as a reporter to study the calcium binding properties of γ-crystallin. Stains-all displays distinct absorption and induced CD bands in the 480–660 nm region when it binds to Ca2+-binding sites in proteins (34Caday C.G. Steiner R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5985-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sharma Y. Rao C.M. Rao C.S. Somasundaram T. Gopalakrishna A. Balasubramanian D. J. Biol.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 51-61Crossref Google Scholar). We have reported earlier that Stains-all binds to β- and δ-crystallin, which induce the J and γ bands of the dye, respectively (33Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 35Sharma Y. Rao C.M. Rao C.S. Somasundaram T. Gopalakrishna A. Balasubramanian D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20923-20927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2Ashows that Stains-all binds to γ-crystallin and induces an intense J band at 670 nm. The intensity of this band increases if the dye/protein ratio is decreased. The binding is strong enough to be able to induce optical activity in the otherwise achiral dye. Upon addition of 50 µm calcium, the J band intensity is increased due to the conformational rearrangement, also shown by the individual EF-hand motifs of calcium-binding proteins (38Sharma Y. Chandani S. Sukhaswami M.B. Uma L. Balasubramanian D. Fairwell T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Upon further addition of calcium, the J band intensity decreases and is finally abolished in the presence of excess calcium (300 µm) (Fig. 2B). The abolition of the J band in the presence of calcium shows that the dye binds at the calcium-binding sites in γ-crystallin (Fig.2B). Calcium binding to γ-crystallin was probed using the luminescent lanthanide probe, TbCl3. Tb3+is known to bind to Ca2+-binding sites and, as a consequence, displays enhanced luminescence in the visible region (39Brittain H.G. Richardson F.S. Martin R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 8255-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The ionic size and binding characteristics of Tb3+ are similar to those of the Ca2+ ions (39Brittain H.G. Richardson F.S. Martin R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 8255-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that γ-crystallin enhances Tb3+ fluorescence, suggesting that the protein binds the Ca2+-mimic lanthanide ion. The dissociation constant for terbium binding to γ-crystallin was found to be about 300 µm. The presence of aromatic residues in the vicinity of the calcium-binding site is of interest, and one would expect an interaction between the aromatic rings and the bound metal ions. Indeed, when the Ca2+-mimic Tb3+ is used, we see the luminescence of the lanthanide activated upon exciting at 285 nm (aromatic absorption region), indicative of energy transfer at an estimated distance of 5 Å (40Horrocks W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 495-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The above results clearly demonstrate that γ-crystallin is a calcium-binding protein with four sites for ion binding. Since it has no EF-hand or any such known motif for calcium binding, we thought that four calcium-binding sites may be located in the four Greek keys. Based on sequence homology with protein S, we have identified Greek keys as calcium-binding sites in γ-crystallin, as shown in Fig. 4. γ-Crystallin shows 47% sequence homology as well as similarity in the structure of 4-fold repeats (13Wistow G. Summers L. Blundell T. Nature. 1985; 315: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The residues involved in calcium ligation in protein S are known from its crystal structure (27Wenk M. Baumgarten R. Holak T.A. Huber R. Mayr E.M. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 1533-1545Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The motifs 1 and 3 of γ-crystallin are similar to motifs 2 and 4 in protein S, whereas motifs 2 and 4 of γ-crystallin are similar to motifs 1 and 3 of protein S (13Wistow G. Summers L. Blundell T. Nature. 1985; 315: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The alignment of individual βγ motifs of these proteins was used to identify the residues involved in calcium ligation, which shows that calcium-binding sites of γ-crystallin are located within Greek key motifs. Based on sequence alignment, we find that the first calcium ligates at Glu-7, Arg-31, Asn-33, and Ser-30, whereas the second calcium binds at Glu-46, Arg-76, Ser-74, and Asp-73 (Fig. 4). All these residues are located at the surface of the structure, and their side chains are available for calcium binding (Fig. 5). Similarly, two other calcium-binding sites located at the C-terminal domain were also identified. The residues Glu-95, Thr-120, Glu-121, and His-123 form site 3, whereas Glu-136, Asn-162, Ala-163, and Gly-165 constitute site 4. The propensity of these residues for calcium ligation was investigated by molecular modeling. These residues were found to possess bond length and bond angles suitable for forming a bond for calcium binding to the oxygen atoms of the side chains of these residues (Fig. 5).Figure 5Molecular modeling of γ-crystallin.a, the crystal structure of γ-crystallin (Protein Data Bank code 4GCR.PDB) was retrieved from protein data bank.

To ascertain if the residues identified by alignment (above, and Fig. 4) participate in ligation, we have also synthesized several mutants of Greek key peptides (Table I). The two putative residues (Glu-95 and Glu-121), which were identified for calcium binding by homology with protein S, were modified to Lys in the peptide g3a (Table I). We have also investigated whether other acidic residues are involved in calcium binding (such as two aspartates at positions 108 and 109 are replaced by Lys in the peptide g3b). We have characterized and evaluated the secondary structure and aggregational propensity of these peptides by CD and HPLC. The wild type peptide g3 and its mutants are fairly soluble in aqueous medium. However, the peptide s3a is not soluble in water; it was solubilized in trifluoroethanol. These peptides form aggregates of various sizes as seen in their gel filtration profiles on HPLC (the chromatogram for g3 is shown as Fig. 6). All these peptides show a poorly organized, unfolded structure in aqueous solution. Howeve"

We have previously demonstrated that four (Tyr1144, Tyr1201, Tyr1226/1227, or Tyr1253) of the five known Neu/ErbB-2 autophosphorylation sites can independently mediate transforming signals. The transforming potential of at least two of these autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1144and Tyr1226/1227) has been further correlated with their ability to associate with Grb2 and Shc adapter proteins, respectively. To confirm the specificity of these interactions, we have created a series of second site mutants in these phosphorylation sites. The results showed that Grb2 recruitment to site 1144 is absolutely required for transforming signal from this autophosphorylation site, whereas association of Shc-mediated transformation is dependent on conservation of the NPXY motif spanning Tyr1227. A stretch of amino acid identity around tyrosines 1201 (ENPEYLTP)and 1253 (ENPEYLDL) exists, and mutation of key residues within this motif reveals distinct requirements for an intact protein tyrosine-binding protein (NPXY). We show that DOK-R, a protein tyrosine-binding site-containing protein implicated in Ras signaling, interacts with Neu/ErbB-2 at Tyr1253 as do two unidentified proteins, p150 and p34, the latter correlating with transformation.

Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Although elevated expression of the ErbB family members is implicated in the etiology of human ovarian and breast cancers, ErbB-2 most clearly plays a causal role in this process. ErbB-2 amplification and elevated expression correlates with a poor clinical prognosis in breast cancer patients (2Andrulis I.L. Bull S.B. Blackstein M.E. Sutherland D. Mak C. Sidlofsky S.

Although these data are consistent with a role in mammary tumorigenesis, transgenic mice expressing either ErbB-2 or Neu (the rat ErbB-2 homolog) were generated to directly assess ErbB-2 oncogenic causality. Expression of wild type Neu or constitutively active Neu or ErbB-2 alleles in the mammary epithelia of transgenic mice results in the induction of metastatic mammary tumors (reviewed in Ref. 5Dankort D.L. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that activation of ErbB-2/Neu plays a causal role in mammary tumorigenesis. Despite the importance of ErbB-2/Neu in human malignancies, the molecular basis for the potent transforming properties of this oncogene remains to be elucidated. Activation of the ErbB-2 receptor via receptor dimerization results in the phosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues within the carboxyl-terminal regulatory region of the receptor. These phosphorylated tyrosines provide binding sites for a variety of Src homology 2 (SH2) and/or protein tyrosine binding (PTB)-containing proteins involved in transducing proliferative, transforming, or differentiating signals to the nucleus. For example, ErbB-2 associates with intracellular signaling molecules such as Crk, Grb7, PLCγ1, and c-Src, with the latter two proteins becoming activated by ErbB-2 (reviewed in Refs. 5Dankort D.L.

Another class of adapter proteins associate with ErbB-2 to modulate Ras activity by either promoting the active Ras-GTP complex formation through Sos GDP/GTP exchange proteins (Shc, Grb2, and Nck) or by accelerating the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to its inactive Ras-GDP state (Ras-GAP) (7Ben-Levy R.

Whereas these studies have provided compelling evidence that ErbB-2 can associate with a number of downstream mediators, the relative contribution of these signaling pathways remains to be elucidated. To address the role of the various signaling pathways in ErbB-2-mediated transformation, we have generated a series of ErbB-2 mutants that harbor mutations in the tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that a constitutive active ErbB-2 allele lacking all of the major phosphorylation sites within the regulatory region (NYPD mutant) was severely impaired in transformation. However, restoration of single phosphorylation sites to NYPD, creating a series of add-back mutants, demonstrated that four of five phosphorylation sites (sites B–E) can independently mediate transforming signals, whereas tyrosine 1028 functions to repress transforming signals from the receptor (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further biochemical analyses demonstrated that Grb2 associates directly with Tyr1144 (site B) and indirectly through tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc proteins at Tyr1226/1227 (site D) (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas Crk binds through tyrosine residue 1201 (site C) (10Dankort D. Maslikowski B. Warner N. Kanno N. Kim H. Wang Z. Moran M.F. Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that mutations in the Grb2 and Shc consensus binding sites revealed that transformation from these add-back mutants strictly correlates with their ability to bind Grb2 or Shc adapters, suggesting that these are the principle effector molecules of these sites. Furthermore, we show the PTB-containing protein, DOK-R, interacts with Neu/ErbB-2 at Tyr1253 (site E) as do two unidentified proteins, p34 and p150. Interestingly, although p150 and DOK-R associate with transformation deficient NPXY mutants at site E, p34 associates with only wild type site E in a transformation-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that Neu/ErbB-2 induces cellular transformation through multiple ostensibly redundant tyrosine phosphorylation sites through the recruitment of at least four different signaling molecules. The generation of rat ErbB-2 NYPD and add-back mutant plasmids and Rat1-derived fibroblasts has been described previously (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Secondary mutations around sites B, D, and E were generated by polymerase chain reaction, and all cloned polymerase chain reaction amplified regions were sequenced in their entirety. In all cases ErbB-2 was expressed in an Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat expression vector (pJ4Ω) (11Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Details of plasmid constructions are available on request. Rat1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and fungizone. DNA was introduced into Rat1 fibroblasts via electroporation for the focus formation assays of Figs.2, 4, and 5 as described (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 Rat1 fibroblasts along with 50 µg of each mutant plasmid DNA and 2 µg of PGK-puro were electroporated and were immediately seeded at 106cells/100-mm tissue culture dish. Plates were maintained in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 14 days with the medium being changed every third day. Following the manufacturer's instructions, the plates were stained with Giemsa, and the foci were counted from six plates/construct. Relative transformation potential was normalized to that obtained with activated Neu (NT) in each experiment and expressed as a percentage. Soft agar assays were as described using clonal Rat fibroblasts engineered to express the various Neu autophosphorylation mutants (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell.

Neu molecules harboring mutations of the Shc-binding site (NLYY) are indicated as depicted in Fig. 2. The asparagine (Asn1224) in the NLYY motif was changed to an alanine (YD-ALYY) or an aspartic acid residue (YD-DLYY). The tyrosine residue at 1226 or 1227 was converted to a phenylalanine residue to create YD-NLFY or YD-NLYF, respectively. All mutants contain the activating transmembrane mutation V664E with sites A, B, C, and E mutated to phenylalanine.

The membrane was cut, and the top third, containing proteins larger than 80 kDa, was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (B), the middle portion of the blot containing proteins of 32–80 kDa was probed with Shc-specific antisera (C), and the remaining third containing proteins under 32 kDa was probed with Grb2-specific rabbit polyclonal sera (D) as indicated.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) from 1 to 1.5 mg or cell lysate and were washed five to seven times in PLC lysis buffer prior to immunoblot analyses. Neu was immunoprecipitated with 7.16.4 monoclonal antibody. Grb2, Shc, Neu/ErbB-2, and phosphotyrosine were detected with anti-Grb2 (1:2,000) (C23; Santa Cruz), Shc (1:1,000) (S14630; Transduction Labs), Neu (1:1,000) (AB3, Oncogene science), or phosphotyrosine (1:1,000) (PY20, Transduction Labs or 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. The following peptides, synthesized by Research Genetics, were resuspended in 20 mm buffered HEPES, pH 7.0: NPEY, (biotin)-FEGTPTAENPE(Y)LGLDVPV; NPEpY, (biotin)-FEGTPTAENPE(pY)LGLDVPV; and DPepY, (biotin)-FEGTPTAEDPE(pY)LGLDVPV. The peptides were immobilized to streptavidin agarose, washed three to five times in PLC LB, and aliquoted such that each affinity purification contained 1 µg of immobilized peptide. The protein lysates (500 µg) from [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled Rat1, and Jurkat T-cells were incubated at 4 °C with immobilized peptides on a rotating platform for 1 h. The complexes were washed four to six times in PLC LB and transferred to silanized Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes, and specifically associated proteins were visualized by fluorography-assisted autoradiography following electrophoreses on a SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel. The p55-SHC PTB domain (amino acids 1–160) and SH2 domain (13Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cloned into the EcoRI site of GSTag (14Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). Following SDS-8.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Neu immunoprecipitates were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sodium azide containing 5% skim milk. Fusion proteins were purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immobilized GSTag fusion proteins were washed three times in DK buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 4.5 mmdithiothreitol) and were labeled in reaction buffer (50 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 4.7 mm dithiothreitol) containing 500 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mm) and 20 µg of protein kinase A (Sigma, P-2645). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, after which time an additional 20 µg of protein kinase A was added. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by washing six times in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm NaF and 5 mm EDTA. The proteins were eluted with glutathionine as described above. The blots were probed for 3 h at room temperature with radiolabeled fusion proteins at 1.5 × 106 cpm in block buffer. The membranes were washed three times in TBS-T and analyzed by autoradiography. To directly assess the role of the ErbB-2/Neu tyrosine phosphorylation sites in mediating transforming signals, we have generated a Neu tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient mutant (NT-NYPD) through single point mutations at each of the defined tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr1028, Tyr1144, Tyr1201, Tyr1226/1227, and Tyr1253) (Fig. 1). Activated ErbB-2/Neu NYPD alleles are severely impaired in transforming activities in culture and when expressed in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Dankort D. Maslikowski B. Warner N. Kanno N. Kim H. Wang Z. Moran M.F. Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To determine whether particular tyrosines were sufficient in mediating a transforming signal, individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites were reconstituted to NT-NYPD, creating a series of add-back mutants each possessing only one of these sites. For the purpose of clarity, activated Neu mutants harboring individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites are termed NT-YA (tyrosine at 1028), NT-YB (tyrosine 1144), NT-YC (tyrosine 1201), NT-YD (tyrosines 1226 and 1227), and NT-YE (tyrosine 1253) (Fig. 1A). To assess transformation potential, we performed soft agar colony formation assays. Activated ErbB-2 (NT) readily conferred anchorage-independent growth to expressing Rat1 fibroblasts, a process requiring the major phosphorylation sites, because NYPD failed to form colonies in these assays (Fig.1B). As we had observed in focus formation assays (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), NT-YA was transformation defective. Restoration of any one of four tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (NT-YB, NT-YC, NT-YD, or NT-YE) results in anchorage-independent growth activities comparable with those observed in the parental NT in Rat1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in multiple Rat1-derived cell lines expressing the various add-back mutants (data not shown). We consistently observed smaller colonies formed in stable lines expressing NT-YB compared with those from the other transforming mutants. The ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner was not acquired through the cloning and passaging of these lines, because pooled colonies from electroporated Rat1 cells behave in a similar manner (data not shown). Notably, pooled Rat1 cells expressing NT-YB appeared to form colonies of various sizes, suggesting that the small colonies formed from stable lines reflect the particular clones used in these assays. Taken together, these data demonstrate that four of five phosphorylation sites are sufficient to mediate transforming signals from activated Neu. We have previously used Far Western (direct blot) and co-immunoprecipitation analyses to demonstrate that Grb2 binds to Tyr1144 (site B) (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the Grb2 binds to NT-YB, it is conceivable that an additional protein interacts with this phosphorylation site to mediate transformation. Site B conforms to a consensus Grb2 SH2 domain-binding site as defined with degenerate peptide pools (YXNX) (15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Four alterations of the conserved asparagine (Asn1146 in the +2 position; Fig.2A) were engineered in NT-YB to evaluate whether loss of the asparagine (and presumably Grb2 association) correlated with a transformation defect. To ensure that any phenotype observed was due to the loss of the asparagine and not due to the acquisition of a new binding site for a different SH2-containing molecule, several amino acids were substituted. Alteration of this residue to histidine, leucine, valine, or proline had little effect on the phosphorylation status of the receptor (Fig.2B), although these mutants had dramatically decreased transformation potentials (Fig. 2A) to levels observed for YB lacking Tyr1144 (i.e. NT-NYPD). This decrease in transformation potential was correlated with a loss of Grb2 binding to the NT-YB-derived mutants (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggest that Grb2 binding is required for efficient NT-YB-mediated transformation. Our previous biochemical analyses demonstrated that Grb2 also associates with site D, albeit indirectly, and that Shc proteins likely mediate the indirect interaction of Grb2 (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The three Shc isoforms each contain a PTB and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain separated by a collagen homology region that harbors two tyrosine phosphorylation sites capable of binding Grb2 (16Gotoh N. Toyoda M. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To define the domains of Shc that bound Neu, bacterial GST fusions that included a protein kinase A recognition site and either the SH2 or PTB domain were purified and radiolabeled to high specific activity and used in Far Western/direct blot analyses. Although equivalent amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated Neu were detected in each immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3C), the Shc PTB (Fig.3A) but not the SH2 (Fig. 3B) domain bound to NT and site D (Tyr1226/1227) demonstrating the Shc PTB domain was sufficient in mediating this interaction. This same SH2 fusion protein has been shown to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (13Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that Shc-Neu interactions are mediated by the Shc PTB domain implies that the residues of Neu required for Shc binding are different from those which SH2 domains bind. Specifically, SH2 domains recognize sequences to the carboxyl-side of a phosphorylated tyrosine residue, whereas PTB domains recognize sequences predominantly to the amino side of the phosphotyrosine (reviewed in Ref. 18Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). The consensus binding sequence determined for the Shc PTB domain isXΦXNPXY, where Φ is a large hydrophobic residue (19Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Comparing the sequences surrounding site D (1224NLYY1227) to those found in the Shc binding site of MT (312NPSY315), both Asn1224 and Tyr1227 appear to create a partial PTB binding site for Shc (NXXY). Because both Tyr1226 and Tyr1227 were mutated to create site D mutants, we individually reconstituted these residues to tyrosines in the context of NT-NYPD to create YD-NLFY and YD-NLYF (Fig.4A). Additionally, Asn1224 was changed to alanine or aspartic acid in the context of NT-YD creating YD-ALYY and YD-DLYY, respectively. Consistent with the notion that Shc interacts through its PTB domain with Neu, mutation of either Tyr1227 or Asn1224 (YD-DLYY) dramatically reduced transformation potential (Fig. 4A), whereas mutation of Tyr1226 had little effect. Additionally, alteration of Asn1224 to alanine (YD-ALYY) resulted in an impairment of transformation intermediate that of NT-NYPD and NT-YD. The levels of Shc bound to these Neu mutants appeared to directly correlate with their transformation potential. Specifically, although low Shc levels are found associated with NT-NYPD, elevated Shc levels were detected in Neu immunoprecipitates from NT- and NT-YD-expressing cells (Fig. 4C). Mutation of Asn-1144 to aspartic acid reduced Shc binding to levels observed for NT-NYPD, whereas an alanine in this position reduced to levels intermediate that of NT and NT-NYPD (lanes 5–7). Reduced Shc binding was not a consequence of reduced receptor or Shc protein expression (Fig. 4, B andE) and was further coupled to a loss of detectable Grb2-Neu complex formation that cannot be ascribed to Grb2 levels within these cells (Fig. 4, D and F). Together, these data demonstrate that Shc binding tightly correlates with transformation from site D. A short stretch of amino acid identity around tyrosines 1201 and 1253 exist (site C, ENPEYLTP, and site E, ENPEYLDL, respectively). The presence of a β-turn-forming NPXY motif in the core Shc and IRS-1 PTB domain-binding sites suggests that one or more PTB-containing proteins mediates transformation from sites C and E. Mutations were made to codons encoding the conserved asparagine (Asn1250) or proline (Pro1251) to those encoding either alanine or aspartic acid. These mutations were made in the context of NT-YE creating YE-NAEY, YE-NDEY, YE-APEY, and YE-DPEY (Fig.5A). Focus formation assays demonstrated a requirement for asparagine 1250 for efficient site E-mediated transformation, whereas alteration of proline 1251 to alanine, but not aspartic acid, reduced the transforming activity of NT-YE (Fig. 5A). In a similar fashion mutation of proline 1199 in NT-YC to aspartic acid or alanine lead to a reduction in transformation potential (data not shown). The requirement of an intact NPXY motif argues that a PTB-containing protein(s) may in fact mediate the signal(s) emanating from this site. Several proteins implicated in proliferation/differentiation have been demonstrated to contain PTB-like domains including IRS-1, Numb, c-Cbl, and mDab1 (20Bonita D. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A novel cDNA encoding a putative PTB-containing protein was cloned via its association with the Tie-2/Tek RTK in a yeast two-hybrid screen (12Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed homology to p62DOK and is termed DOK-R for DOK-related protein. DOK is a 62-kDa Ras-GAP-associated protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to transforming and mitogenic PTK activation (21Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Further analyses suggest that DOK-R interacts with Tie-2/Tek through an amino-terminal domain that bears homology to the IRS-1 PTB-like domain. Moreover DOK-R is expressed in murine fibroblasts lines. Thus, because DOK-R contains a PTB domain and is expressed in the fibroblast lines suggested, it may be a candidate for interaction with site E. To explore the possibility that DOK-R physically interacts with Neuin vivo, the former was immunoprecipitated from Rat1-derived lines expressing ErbB-2 point mutants. DOK-R was associated with activated ErbB-2 derived from wild type as well as all point mutant-expressing cell lines with the exception of NT-E, which contains a single tyrosine to phenylalanine alteration at site E (Fig.5B). Conversely, similar DOK-R co-immunoprecipitations with ErbB-2 add-back mutants demonstrates interaction with NT-YE yet neither to NT-NYPD nor the other add-back mutants (Fig. 5C, comparelane 8 with lanes 3–7). These data demonstrate that tyrosine 1253 (site E) is both necessary and sufficient for Neu-DOK-R complex formation. The role of DOK-R in site E-mediated transformation, however, is unclear, because DOK-R-Neu complexes are readily detected in all the NT-YE-derived mutants (YE-NAEY, YE-NDEY, YE-APEY, and YE-DPEY) (Fig. 5C, lanes 9–12). Taken together, these data suggest that although DOK-R physically associates with ErbB-2 through site E, this interaction does not correlate with transformation through site E. Given that DOK-R-Neu interactions do not correlate with transformation, we have undertaken a search for site E-interacting proteins. To this end, chemically synthesized phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides spanning site E from the −11 to the +7 position relative to the phosphotyrosine residue (wild type NPEY peptide: FEGTPTAENPEYLGLDVPV) were used inin vitro association assays. The amino terminus of each peptide was covalently linked to biotin, providing a means of immobilizing the peptides via streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads. To these immobilized peptides, equivalent amounts of Rat1 [35S]methionine-labeled extracts were incubated, the beads were extensively washed, and specifically associated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography (Fig. 6). Consistently, two proteins of ∼150 and 34 kDa associate with the phosphorylated but not the nonphosphorylated peptide in both Rat1 (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (not shown). The lack of binding to the unphosphorylated peptide is not a result of decreased peptide concentration because dephosphorylation of the wild type peptide decreased the amount of the 34- and 150-kDa proteins detected (not shown). To determine whether p34 or p150 binding correlated with transformation from site E, a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide was synthesized to contain the N1250D mutation (DPEpY peptide: FEGTPTAEDPEpYLGLDVPV), which renders this site transformation incompetent (Fig. 5A). The 34-kDa protein, but not the 150-kDa protein, failed to interact with this DPEpY peptide when isolated from Rat1 and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (not shown) as well as in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 6). The 36-kDa protein associated with the phosphorylated DPEY peptide was not consistently observed, nor was it detected in all cell types such as Jurkat cells (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). These data suggest that a number of proteins associate with site E through the phosphorylation of tyrosine 1253, but the in vitro association of a single 34-kDa protein correlates with transforming potential from this site. The ability of activated RTKs to signal cellular proliferation and differentiation is dependent on their capacity to couple to a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules through a mechanism involving the binding of either SH2 or PTB domain-containing proteins with specific phosphotyrosine residues. These sites are required for efficient transformation by ErbB-2 because mutation of the known tyrosine phosphorylation sites (NT-NYPD) renders the RTK transformation deficient despite being efficiently expressed and harboring similar catalytic activities (9Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites to NT-NYPD reveals that individually sites B–E are sufficient for restoration of wild type transforming abilities. Biochemically, it is clear that site B (Tyr1144) binds directly to Grb2 and that this ErbB-2·Grb2 complex is required for transformation (Fig. 1), likely by recruiting mSos proteins to activate Ras (9Dankort D.L.

Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion Shc proteins interact with site D, tethering Grb2 to ErbB-2 and thereby providing a cogent explanation explaining the Ras requirement and Erk activation (10Dankort D. Maslikowski B. Warner N. Kanno N. Kim H. Wang Z. Moran M.F. Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In either case mutation of the residues required for Grb2 or Shc binding in NT-YB or NT-YD, respectively, ablates transforming activities. In this study we provide additional evidence that integrity of Grb2- or Shc-binding sites are required for efficient ErbB-2 mediated transformation from either the NT-YB or NT-YD add-back mutants. Indeed replacement of a conserved asparagine residue within the Grb2- or Shc-binding sites can dramatically impair transforming activities of these add-back mutants (Figs. 2 and 4). Significantly this impaired transforming activity correlated with a corresponding loss of the ability of these mutant ErbB-2 receptors to associate with either Grb2 or Shc. These data argue that the YB and YD sites are highly specific binding sites for Grb2 and Shc, respectively, that can independently mediate a transforming signal. Although these observations suggest that Shc and Grb2 binding to ErbB-2 result in functionally redundant transforming signals, there is an increasing body of evidence that recruitment of either of these adapter proteins to ErbB-2 results in the generation of distinct signals. For example, microinjection of a Grb2 dominant negative inhibitor can suppress DNA synthesis emanating from NT-YB mutant but has little impact on the NT-YD mutant (10Dankort D. Maslikowski B. Warner N. Kanno N. Kim H. Wang Z. Moran M.F. Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting this view stems from transgenic mice expressing the YB and YD ErbB-2 mutants in mammary epithelium. In these studies, although mammary epithelial expression of either ErbB-2 mutant was capable of inducing mammary tumors, only the YB-derived strains developed efficient metastatic disease (10Dankort D. Maslikowski B. Warner N. Kanno N. Kim H. Wang Z. Moran M.F. Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the ability of ErbB-2 to couple to either Grb2 or Shc may have distinct biological outcomes. In addition to the adapter proteins coupled to the B and D sites, we have presented evidence that transforming signal from the YE site is dependent on the conservation of the NPXY motif. Indeed, mutations that alter either the conserved asparagine or proline residues within the context of the YE add-back mutant exhibit an impaired transforming activity (Fig. 5). Given the importance of the PTB-binding motif, we further tested the possibility that a PTB-containing protein known as DOK-R is capable of interacting with ErbB-2. Somewhat surprisingly, DOK-R appears to specifically interact with site E but not C, even though the surrounding sequences are quite similar (site C: −8GGAVENPEYLVP+3and site E: −8TPTAENPEYLGL+3). Although DOKR-ErbB-2 complexes demonstrated specificity for site E, this interaction did not correlate with transformation from site E. Specifically, NPXY motif mutants severely impaired in their transformation potential remain capable of DOK-R binding (Figs. 5). Taken together these data represent the first demonstration that DOK family members interact with ErbB-2 and furthermore suggest that they are not positive mediators of signal transduction RTKs. Indeed, forced expression of DOK-R (also known as DOK-2) suppresses proliferation of cultured myeloid leukemia cells in response to several to a variety of growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, and stem cell factor) (22Suzu S. Tanaka-Douzono M. Nomaguchi K. Yamada M. Hayasawa H. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5114-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice made deficient for p62DOK expression demonstrate that the Ras-GAP-associated p62DOK is a negative regulator of signaling through the B cell receptor. Derived p62DOK-deficient B cells demonstrate hyper-responsiveness to antigen stimulation resulting in increased Erk activation, presumably a reflection of decreased localized Ras-GAP activity (23Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of DOK-2 in 32D cells leads to a decrease in interleukin-2-dependent Erk activation (24Nelms K. Snow A.L. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that although NT-YE is transforming, signaling from this phosphorylation site is negatively regulated by DOK-R recruitment. We have demonstrated that at least two additional proteins (p150 and p34) are capable of interacting with site E in vitro. Although both proteins interact in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner, only p34 associates specifically with the wild type but not the mutant DPEpY peptide. Additionally, p34 does not associate with a similar peptide to site C (data not shown). It is intriguing to note that p150 is similar in size to PLCγ, which is known to interact with a collinear site in the epidermal growth factor receptor (25Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and that a DOK-R-related protein interacts with PLCγ (26Maa M.C. Leu T.H. Trandel B.J. Chang J.H. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5466-5473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have ruled out both Crk and Nck proteins as being p34 by immunoblot analyses. Indeed, in similar peptide association assays, both proteins associate with site C (data not shown and Ref. 10Dankort D. Maslikowski B. Warner N. Kanno N. Kim H. Wang Z. Moran M.F. Oshima R.G. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The in vitro association of p34 correlates with transformation from site E, suggesting that p34 is an excellent candidate molecule mediating signaling from site E. Clearly future identification of this protein will provide important insight into the mechanism of Ras activation and the biological basis of ErbB-2 transformation from this site. Tyrosine phosphorylation mutants have proved to be a tool for the study of specific protein interactions. Using single phosphorylation point mutations we have previously demonstrated that no tyrosine phosphorylation site is absolutely required for ErbB-2-mediated transformation. As the removal of all the known tyrosine phosphorylation sites (NYPD) abrogates transformation, tyrosine reconstitution to generate a series of add-back mutants allows a coupled study cleanly correlate protein association with biological transformation. These data taken together suggest there are at least four distinct proteins that mediate transformation from activated ErbB-2 (Fig. 7)."

Phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser40produced a TH molecule with a more open conformation than the non-phosphorylated form.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). TH activity is controlled by both short term and long term regulatory mechanisms (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Short term regulation of TH is accomplished by dynamic changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Four phosphorylation sites have been identified (Ser8, Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40). Phosphorylation of only three of these serine residues (Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40) is regulated in vivo (3Haycock J.W. Haycock D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5650-5657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have shown that a number of protein kinases phosphorylate these residues (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The most likely physiological candidates for the phosphorylation of Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40 are CaMKII, MAPK, and PKA, respectively (1Fitzpatrick P.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It is only the phosphorylation of Ser40that has a major effect on TH activity. Phosphorylation of TH by PKA produces a 2-fold decrease in the Km for the cofactor BH4, but quantitatively the major effect of phosphorylation of Ser40 by PKA is to abolish feedback inhibition by the catecholamines (4Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ribeiro P. Wang Y. Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorylation of dopamine-bound TH by PKA at Ser40 can activate TH by up to 20-fold (4Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of the two other sites are less clear. Phosphorylation of Ser31in vitro produces a modest (less than 2-fold) increase in TH activity (7Haycock J.W. Ahn N.G. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser19 will not by itself increase TH activity. Phosphorylation of Ser19 by CaMKII will only increase TH activity in the presence of the 14-3-3 activator protein (8Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5404-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Itagaki C. Isobe T. Taoka M. Natsume T. Nomura N. Horigome T. Omata S. Ichinose H. Nagatsu T. Greene L.A. Ichimura T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15673-15680Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and again this results only in a modest (2-fold) increase in the activity. The precise role of the 14-3-3 protein in TH regulation is presently unclear (9Itagaki C. Isobe T. Taoka M. Natsume T. Nomura N. Horigome T. Omata S. Ichinose H. Nagatsu T. Greene L.A. Ichimura T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15673-15680Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Kleppe R. Toska K. Haavik J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1097-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been found that mutation of Ser19to leucine had no effect on the potassium-induced increase in TH activity in intact AtT-20 cells (11Haycock J.W. Lew J.Y. Garciaespana A. Lee K.Y. Harada K. Meller E. Goldstein M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1670-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation alters enzyme activity by the introduction of a bulky group, which is also negatively charged. This will, in many cases, alter the conformation of the protein. In the case of TH, a decrease in the thermal stability of phosphorylated TH compared with non-phosphorylated TH has been interpreted in terms of a change of conformation in the phosphorylated form (12Lazar M.A. Truscott R.J. Raese J.D. Barchas J.D. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of Ser40 makes TH more sensitive to tryptic digestion, which indicates that a conformational change is likely to have occurred (13McCulloch R.I. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unlike the above methods, gel filtration chromatography allows the extent of the conformational alteration to be determined. In the present work we used gel filtration chromatography to show that phosphorylation of both Ser40and Ser19 induces a substantial conformational change in TH. Recently, we developed a novel mass spectrometry method to examine the phosphorylation state of TH (14Graham M.E. Dickson P.W. Dunkley P.R. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This method is unique in that it allows the number of phosphate groups on individual TH molecules to be measured. In this work, we used this methodology to show that phosphorylation of Ser19 increases the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40. Vent DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and the restriction enzymes from Promega. Radiochemicals, heparin-Sepharose, and calmodulin-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bresatec Ltd. The catalytic subunit of PKA was from Sigma. HPLC-grade acetonitrile and AnalaR-grade formic acid, methanol, and chloroform were from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Merck Pty. Limited, Kilsyth, Australia). The concentration of purified TH was determined by A280 measurements, using an ε1% 280 value of 10.4 (15Haavik J. Andersson K.K. Petersson L. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and an assumed molar mass of 56 kDa. Rat adrenal TH cDNA (16Quinsey N.S. Lenaghan C.M. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was cloned into pET-3a. A Lac inducible protein expression system was used that required isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for the production of the recombinant protein. The expression and the purification of the recombinant TH was based on the procedures described elsewhere (4Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the growth and induction ofEscherichia coli was at 32 °C rather than 37 °C. No exogenous iron was added to TH. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace serine 40 with alanine in TH ([S40A]TH) (17Dickson P.W. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20369-20375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated cDNA was completely sequenced to verify that it contained only the desired amino acid substitution. Sequencing was performed by the Newcastle Biomolecular Research Facility. The [S40A]TH was expressed and purified using the protocol described for TH. When the [S40A]TH was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by PKA, no incorporation of radioactivity was observed. When the phosphorylation of [S40A]TH by CaMKII was analyzed by tryptic digestion and HPLC (18Bobrovskaya L. Cheah T.B. Bunn S.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), only a single peak corresponding to the position of the Ser19 peptide was detected. CaMKII was purified from rat brain by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography (19Rostas J.A. Seccombe M. Weinberger R.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The major protein present in the fractions was CaMKII (>90%) as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot using an anti-CaMKII antibody. CaMKII activity was assayed as described (20Lengyel I. Cammarota M. Brent V.A. Rostas J.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For PKA phosphorylation, TH was incubated with the catalytic subunit of PKA in a buffer containing 60 mm MOPS pH 7.2, 200 µmATP, and 90 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C. Non-phosphorylated TH control reactions contained every component except PKA. The units of PKA were as defined by the manufacturer. For CaMKII phosphorylation TH (or [S40A]TH) was incubated with CaMKII in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 200 µm ATP, 1.2 mmCaCl2, and 1.2 µm calmodulin. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C. Non-phosphorylated TH (or [S40A]TH) control reactions contained every component except CaMKII. One unit is defined as the amount of CaMKII that transfers 1.0 nmol of phosphate from ATP to autocamtide per min at pH 7.2 at 30 °C. TH was incubated in the presence of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm GSH, and 200 µm dopamine for 30 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 µl. TH and [S40A]TH preparations were precipitated with 3 m(NH4)2SO4 and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 96,600 × g for 30 min prior to gel filtration to remove any particulate component. Samples were then analyzed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system. The TH samples were applied to a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl and chromatographed at 12 °C using a flow rate of 40 µl/min. The peak elution time was determined using the software package available with the instrument. The column was calibrated using aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin as standards. To ensure that there was no change in the performance of the SMART system, four non-phosphorylated TH samples were run interspersed with the individual samples of each TH condition being tested. No change in the elution position of non-phosphorylated TH was found over a period of 6 months. After incubation of TH or [S40A]TH with or without kinases as described above, the reactions were halted using the chloroform/methanol/water precipitation method (21Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Chloroform/methanol/water precipitates of TH were dissolved in a 2% (v/v) formic acid solution to a final concentration of 2 µm and subjected to aspartic acid cleavage (14Graham M.E. Dickson P.W. Dunkley P.R. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The sample preparation, liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Platform II, Micromass, Altrincham, United Kingdom), and data processing have been described previously (14Graham M.E. Dickson P.W. Dunkley P.R. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). According to the Michaelis-Menten mechanism (22Michaelis L. Menten M.L. Biochem. Z. 1913; 49: 333-369Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of a substrate by a kinase reduces to a reaction that is zero order in the substrate on the assumption that the substrate concentration is far greater thanKm. The rate of phosphorylation is then dependent on the concentration of the kinase and independent of the equilibrium of binding and dissociation between the substrate and kinase. The phosphorylation of TH by CaMKII can be described as the following in Equation 1, TH→k′TH­P→k″TH­P2Equation 1 where the phosphorylation of TH (at either Ser19 or Ser40) produces single-phosphorylated TH (TH-P) and further phosphorylation produces dual-phosphorylated TH (TH-P2). The rate constants k′ and k“ describe the first and second phosphorylation steps, respectively. The three components, TH, TH-P, and TH-P2 may be easily quantified using mass spectrometry as demonstrated in Fig. 1. However, to determine the rate of phosphorylation of each site (Ser19 or Ser40), the production of TH-P2 must also be taken into account and it may occur via two different pathways as shown in Equation 2, TH→k1TH­P19→k3TH­P2 TH→k2TH­P40→k4TH­P2Equation 2 where k1 and k2are the rate constants for the formation of the single-phosphorylated species, TH phosphorylated at Ser19 (TH-P19) and TH phosphorylated at Ser40 (TH-P40), respectively. Here, k3 andk4 are the rate constants for the formation of TH-P2 by phosphorylation of TH-P19 and TH-P40, respectively. Equation 2 is sufficiently detailed to describe the possible influence of one phosphorylated site (Ser19 or Ser40) over the other. Particularly telling would be differences between the rate constants for single phosphorylation and double phosphorylation of each site (i.e. k1versus k4 and k2versus k3). The strategy for determining the four rate constants involved three different experiments and a total of three groups of phosphorylation reactions. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped at various times so that the mole fraction (χ) of product could be plotted against time, and the resulting curve was fitted to produce a rate constant. The equations used for curve fitting are based on a consecutive reaction model (23Harcourt A.V. Esson W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1866; 156: 193-220Crossref Google Scholar) (see Equation 1). This model was further elaborated to accommodate the two simultaneous consecutive reactions of Equation2. The rate equations describing the concentration of TH, TH-P19, and TH-P40 have the form shown in Equation 3. [TH]=[TH]0e−(k1+k2)tEquation 3 [TH-P19]=k1k3−k1(e−k1t−e−k3t)[TH]0Equation 4 [TH-P40]=k2k4−k2(e−k2t−e−k4t)[TH]0Equation 5 Curve fitting of the experimental data was done using Mathematica version 4.0.2.0. Mass spectrometry methods for the quantification of incorporated phosphate have only recently been developed (24Oda Y. Huang K. Cross F.R. Cowburn D. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 25Weckwerth W. Willmitzer L. Fiehn O. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1677-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The advantage to using mass spectrometry over other techniques is the ability to detect non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins simultaneously. However, direct comparison of the amount of non-phosphorylated to phosphorylated protein is difficult because the efficiencies of ionization and detection for the non-phosphorylated versus phosphorylated protein may differ (26Poulter L. Ang S.G. Williams D.H. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 929: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Craig A.G. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Meyer H.E. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel mass spectrometric method was developed in our laboratory to quantify the extent of phosphorylation of TH (14Graham M.E. Dickson P.W. Dunkley P.R. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This method utilizes an 8-kDa N-terminal fragment that is released after formic acid cleavage of TH. This 8-kDa fragment contains all the phosphorylation sites in TH. It is also an ideal-sized fragment for ensuring that the efficiency of detection is the same when the fragment is phosphorylated. The advantage of this method is that the proportion of nonphosphorylated TH can be directly compared with the amount of single- or multiple-phosphorylated TH (14Graham M.E. Dickson P.W. Dunkley P.R. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to analyze recombinant TH phosphorylated by PKA, a control TH sample (no PKA), TH phosphorylated by CaMKII, [S40A]TH phosphorylated by CaMKII, and a control [S40A]TH sample (no CaMKII). The spectra of the 8-kDa moieties are shown in Fig. 1. The TH and [S40A]TH control samples are shown in Fig. 1, A andB, respectively. These non-phosphorylated samples were determined to have molar masses of 8146.7 and 8129.0 Da, respectively, which agree well (i.e. within the resolution of the instrument) with the theoretical molar masses of 8144.0 and 8128.0 Da, respectively. Analysis of the [S40A]TH mutant by this method shows that the molar mass is consistent with a substitution of alanine for serine at position 40. This provides an independent confirmation of the identity of the mutant TH. Phosphorylation of TH by PKA (Fig. 1D) led to the expected increase in size of the N-terminal cleavage product because of the addition of a phosphate group (80 Da) to Ser40. The molar mass was determined to be 8225.6 Da, which agrees well with the theoretical molar mass of 8224.0 Da. This fragment is 78.9 Da larger than the non-phosphorylated TH cleavage product. Moreover, it can be seen that, within the detection limits of the instrument, there is no non-phosphorylated TH remaining. When TH is phosphorylated with CaMKII (Fig. 1E), the dual-phosphorylated form is predominant. At 8305.4 Da, it appears 158.7 Da greater in mass than the non-phosphorylated form. No non-phosphorylated TH was detected, and only a very small amount of single-phosphorylated TH was evident in the spectrum. Phosphorylation of [S40A]TH by CaMKII shows that a single phosphate group is incorporated (Ser19) and that there is no non-phosphorylated form remaining (Fig. 1C). The phosphorylated [S40A]TH cleavage product is 79.7 Da larger at a molar mass of 8208.7 Da (which agrees well with the theoretical molar mass of 8208.0 Da). Gel filtration separates molecules on the basis of both size and shape. If the size of a given protein does not change, any changes in elution position must be due to changes in the shape of the molecule. TH is a tetramer of identical subunits, and it is known that even if the first 155 residues are deleted, the molecule is still a tetramer (28Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struc. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29Daubner S.C. Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that phosphorylation events in the first 40 residues would affect tetramer formation. The gel filtration elution profiles of phosphorylated TH and dopamine-bound TH are shown in Fig. 2. Phosphorylation by PKA produces a substantial decrease in the elution time of TH (Fig. 2A). This change is highly significant (Table I). TH phosphorylated by PKA migrated with an elution time that is consistent with an increase in size of 14%. This apparent increase in the size of TH could be due to either the phosphorylated molecule adopting a more open conformation or to the tetramer weakly self-associating. If the tetramer was weakly self-associating, we would expect to see a substantial peak broadening because of the interconversion between the TH tetramer and higher order complexes of the TH tetramer during the chromatographic process. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, this is clearly not the case. Therefore, we conclude that the observed shift in elution position of TH is due to a substantial opening of the molecule.Table IEffect of phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser40 and of dopamine binding on the elution time of TH or [S40A]TH after gel filtration chromatographyEnzymeElution timenStudent's ttest p valueminTH37.70 ± 0.028[S40A]TH37.53 ± 0.019<<0.0011-aWhen compared to TH.TH + PKA36.86 ± 0.018<<0.0011-aWhen compared to TH.<<0.0011-bWhen compared to TH + CKII.TH + CaMKII36.71 ± 0.028<<0.0011-aWhen compared to TH.[S40A]TH + CaMKII37.22 ± 0.038<<0.0011-cWhen compared to [S40A]TH.TH + Dopamine37.93 ± 0.028<<0.0011-aWhen compared to TH.12 µm TH was phosphorylated to full stoichiometry with 186 units/ml PKA or 25 units/ml CaMKII or was incubated with 200 µm dopamine and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 12 µm [S40A]TH was phosphorylated to full stoichiometry with 25 units/ml CaMKII and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were chromatographed in a Superose 6 gel filtration column, and the peak elution times were determined. n = number of individual experiments performed.

Values are shown as means ± S.E. CaMKII phosphorylates both Ser19 and Ser40 on TH. To examine the effect of phosphorylation of Ser19 alone on the shape of TH, we generated a mutant [S40A]TH. This mutant has biochemical properties similar to that of TH (4Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When analyzed by gel filtration, the [S40A]TH had a small but significant change in elution position when compared with TH (Table I). Therefore, the CaMKII phosphorylated [S40A]TH was compared with the unphosphorylated mutant instead of TH. When [S40A]TH was phosphorylated at Ser19, it eluted earlier than the control [S40A]TH (Fig. 2B). The results in Table I show that the decrease in the elution position of the CaMKII-phosphorylated [S40A]TH compared with the non-phosphorylated control is highly significant. The conformational change because of the phosphorylation of Ser19 is smaller than that observed with Ser40. In this case, the change is equivalent to an increase in size of TH of ∼5%. When TH was phosphorylated by CaMKII (at both Ser19 and Ser40), there was a substantial change in the elution time when compared with non-phosphorylated TH. This change in elution time is equivalent to an increase in size of TH of ∼16%. In addition, the CaMKII-phosphorylated TH eluted earlier than the PKA (Ser40)-phosphorylated TH (Figure 2A). This change is small but nevertheless highly significant (see Table I). Dopamine and the other catecholamines inhibit TH and this inhibition is relieved by phosphorylation at Ser40 (4Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When dopamine-bound TH was analyzed, there was a small but highly significant increase in the elution time compared with TH (Table I). In this case the change is equivalent to a decrease in the size of TH of ∼4%. The kinetic model used to derive the rate constants is detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, TH was phosphorylated by CaMKII. A plot of the mole fraction of TH (χTH) versus time is shown in Fig. 3A. A curve can be fitted to the data to determine k′ (see Equation 1). The equation used in curve fitting is a simpler version of Equation 3 in that it can now be shown that k′ = k1+ k2. The fitted curve yielded the equation χTH = e−0.288 ± 0.017t with an R2 of 0.962. Therefore, k′ is equal to 0.288 ± 0.017 min−1. In a further experiment, [S40A]TH was phosphorylated by CaMKII. The mole fraction of [S40A]TH (χTHSer40Ala) plotted against time is shown in Fig. 3B. The absence of the Ser40 simplifies the description of the kinetic model so that the only rate constant in the rate equation isk1 because k2 has been eliminated by use of the mutant (see Equation 2). Hence,k1 can be determined by curve fitting with an exponential decay-type equation as in Equation 3. The equation χTHS40A =e−0.122 ± 0.009t is found to fit the consumption of [S40A]TH with anR2 of 0.929. Therefore,k1 is equal to 0.122 ± 0.009 min−1. Because k′ = k1 +k2, it may be inferred thatk2 is equal to 0.166 ± 0.026 min−1. In a final experiment, TH was first phosphorylated with PKA to a point where ∼100% of the TH was converted to TH-P40. CaMKII was then added to the reaction, and the disappearance of TH-P was determined. The plot of χTH-Pversus time for the CaMKII phosphorylation, which followed PKA phosphorylation, is shown in Fig. 3C. It is assumed that the PKA, present during the CaMKII phosphorylation, did not interfere with the binding of TH and CaMKII. There is no evidence in the literature that these kinases interact. Because the Ser40 sites are stoichiometrically phosphorylated, the only site available for phosphorylation by CaMKII is Ser19. The rate of consumption of TH-P40 in this secondary phosphorylation by CaMKII is described by an exponential decay because k2 is eliminated. The fit yielded the equation χTH-P = e−0.101 ± 0.004t with an R2 of 0.978. Therefore, k4 is equal to 0.101 ± 0.004 min−1. The remaining rate constant, k3, can be calculated by curve fitting the mole fraction of TH-P (χTH-P) versus time for the phosphorylation of TH by CaMKII (the initial experiment). Equations 4 and 5 were combined to yield an expression in terms of [Th-P] = [TH-P19] + [TH-P40]. The measured values fork1, k2 andk4 were substituted, leavingk3 as the only unknown in the curve fit. Fig.3D shows the curve fit for the χTH-Pversus time, which was used to determinek3. The fit produced Equation 6, χTH­P=0.326e−0.122te−0.497±0.082t−2.55e−0.166t−e−0.101tEquation 6 with an R2 of 0.871. Therefore,k3 = 0.497 ± 0.082 min−1.

Although the measurements have shown that k2 >k1, because of the uncertainty in the measurement of k1, it can only be concluded that the two rate constants are comparable in magnitude (i.e. k1 ∼k2). Similarly, it appears thatk1 > k4, but it can only be concluded that the two rate constants are comparable in magnitude (i.e. k1 ∼k4). However, it is clear thatk3 > k1,k2, and k4. The significance of k3 > k2will be discussed in greater detail below. Nevertheless, given the precision of these results, it can be concluded thatk3 is at least 2- to 3-fold larger thank2. Phosphorylation of proteins is one of the key elements involved in short term regulatory mechanisms in the cell. The addition of a phosphate group to a protein could act in a number of ways. The phosphate group could simply block the entry of a substrate into a binding pocket with no change in the structure of the protein. Alternatively, it could induce a subtle change in the structure of the protein to alter the substrate binding site but not change the overall shape of the molecule (e.g. the activation of MAPK by phosphorylation) (30Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphorylation could produce dramatic changes in the overall shape of proteins that would abolish the substrate binding site. It has been previously shown that phosphorylation of TH at Ser40 makes the molecule more sensitive to tryptic digestion (13McCulloch R.I. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The increased accessibility of the trypsin-sensitive site suggests that phosphorylation does alter the structure of TH. We have presented here, for the first time, direct evidence showing that phosphorylation of Ser40 induces a major conformational change in TH such that it adopts a much more open structure. In addition, we have shown that phosphorylation of TH at Ser19induces a smaller but very significant opening of TH. The simplest model that could account for these changes would be one in which the N terminus of TH forms a hinged regulatory arm with the hinge located somewhere C-terminal to Ser40. Such a model would explain why phosphorylation of Ser40, which would be closer to the hinge, would produce a more dramatic effect on shape than phosphorylation of Ser19, which would be further away from the hinge. Under this model we would have expected that phosphorylation of Ser40 alone would produce the maximal opening of TH, and therefore the elution time of the dual-phosphorylated TH would be the same as that obtained for TH phosphorylated only at Ser40. Our data show that the dual-phosphorylated TH adopts a more open conformation than TH phosphorylated at Ser40 alone; thus the effect of phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser40 is additive. The data are not consistent with a simple model of a hinged regulatory arm. Previous work has shown that binding of dopamine renders TH less sensitive to tryptic digestion (13McCulloch R.I. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This could be due to a dopamine-induced conformational change in TH, which would make it less accessible to trypsin, or it could simply be that dopamine sterically hinders access of trypsin to the active site. We have shown here that dopamine binding produces a small but significant contraction of the TH molecule. It is more difficult to phosphorylate TH with PKA when it is bound with dopamine (4Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The compaction of TH produced by dopamine binding as shown in this report probably plays an important role in reducing the accessibility of Ser40 to PKA. There is a large body of evidence confirming that in vitrophosphorylation of TH at Ser40 by PKA is associated with a strong activation of the enzyme (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This also occurs in intact cells. Treatment of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells with forskolin produces an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser40 with a concomitant increase in TH activity (31Cheah T.B. Bobrovskaya L. Goncalves C.A. Hall A. Elliot R. Lengyel I. Bunn S.J. Marley P.D. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 87: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effect of PKA phosphorylation of Ser40 is to decrease the binding of the catecholamines that inhibit TH. Direct evidence for a significant conformational change in TH shown here is likely to be a critical part of this reduction in catecholamine binding. The role of Ser19 phosphorylation in TH activation has been rather more controversial. Although CaMKII can phosphorylate both Ser19 and Ser40in vitro, it cannot activate TH by itself (8Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5404-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence from intact cells also indicates that phosphorylation of Ser19 does not directly activate TH. Treatment of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells with anisomycin produced a significant increase in the phosphorylation of Ser19 but not of Ser31 or Ser40(32Bobrovskaya L. Odell A. Leal R.B. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under these conditions there was no increase in TH activity. 2L. Bobrovskaya and P. R. Dunkley, unpublished results. Further, it has been shown that abolishing Ser19 phosphorylation has no effect on the final activation state of TH in response to potassium-induced depolarization in vivo (11Haycock J.W. Lew J.Y. Garciaespana A. Lee K.Y. Harada K. Meller E. Goldstein M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1670-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that Ser19 phosphorylation might indirectly affect TH activity by facilitating phosphorylation at other sites that directly influence TH activity. If this were correct, we would expect phosphorylation of Ser19 to precede the phosphorylation of the other sites. It has been shown that phosphorylation of Ser19 precedes the phosphorylation of Ser40 in response to nicotine (33Bunn S.J. Sim A.T. Herd L.M. Austin L.M. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1370-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), histamine (33Bunn S.J. Sim A.T. Herd L.M. Austin L.M. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1370-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), angiotensin II (32Bobrovskaya L. Odell A. Leal R.B. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and potassium-induced depolarization (11Haycock J.W. Lew J.Y. Garciaespana A. Lee K.Y. Harada K. Meller E. Goldstein M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1670-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All these agents activate TH. We have shown here that Ser19 phosphorylation induces a conformational change in TH. This conformational change could increase the accessibility of Ser40 to kinases. If phosphorylation of Ser19 were a prerequisite for the rapid phosphorylation of Ser40, this would provide an explanation for the fact that in vivo Ser19 phosphorylation precedes the phosphorylation of Ser40 (see above). To obtain direct evidence that phosphorylation at Ser19 could alter the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40, we developed a kinetic analysis of Ser19 and Ser40 phosphorylation. This analysis was dependant on our ability to simultaneously quantify whether individual molecules had zero, one, or two phosphate groups incorporated. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is the only direct methodology capable of this type of measurement. The results clearly show that initial phosphorylation of Ser19significantly increased the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40. This is consistent with a model in which phosphorylation of Ser19 alters the conformation of tyrosine hydroxylase to allow increased accessibility of Ser40 to kinases. It is clear that phosphorylation of TH at Ser40 is closely associated with TH activation. Hence, it is likely that the phosphorylation of Ser19 indirectly increases the rate of activation of TH. The data presented in this paper suggest that there is a hierarchical structure in TH phosphorylation. This interdependence of phosphorylation sites has been found in a number of systems. The best known is the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by casein kinase II and glycogen synthase kinase 3. Casein kinase II has to phosphorylate glycogen synthase at one site before glycogen synthase kinase 3 can then phosphorylate four further serine residues in a clearly defined order. This sequential phosphorylation of glycogen synthase is achieved by the fact that each phosphorylation event produces a new kinase recognition sequence (34Fiol C.J. Wang A. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6061-6065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14042-14048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism is quite different from the one we are proposing for TH in which phosphorylation at one site induces a conformational change that allows increased access of a kinase to a second site. A situation much more akin to that for TH can be seen with the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, p70s6k (36Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). It was proposed that phosphorylation of three sites within the autoinhibitory domain of p70s6k alters the conformation of p70s6k to allow the phosphorylation of Thr389. Phosphorylation of Thr389, in turn, further alters the conformation of p70s6k to allow the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, PDK1, to phosphorylate and activate p70s6k. PDK1 can also activate protein kinase B. It was suggested that even though p70s6k and protein kinase B are both activated by PDK1, they could be differentially regulated, as different pathways control the accessibility of PDK1 to each kinase (36Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the case of TH it has been shown that, at least in vitro, six kinases can phosphorylate Ser40 (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). At first glance, this suggests that TH could be activated through a large number of pathways that may not be relevant to increased catecholamine synthesis and secretion. The hierarchical TH phosphorylation described here suggests that additional signaling pathways would need to be activated to increase TH activity. This would provide additional specificity so that TH would only be activated under appropriate conditions.

Recently we demonstrated TFO-mediated targeted gene knockout following systemic administration in animals. However, a limitation to this approach is the requirement for a polypurine tract (typically 15–30 base pairs (bp)) in the target DNA to afford high affinity third strand binding, thus restricting the number of sites available for effective targeting. To overcome this limitation, we have investigated the ability of chemically modified TFOs to target a short (10 bp) site in a chromosomal locus in mouse cells and induce site-specific mutations. We report that replacement of the phosphodiester backbone with cationic phosphoramidate linkages, either N,N-diethylethylenediamine orN,N-dimethylaminopropylamine, in a 10-nucleotide, psoralen-conjugated TFO confers substantial increases in binding affinity in vitro and is required to achieve targeted modification of a chromosomal reporter gene in mammalian cells.

Science. 2000; 290: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) TFO-induced mutagenesis in transgenic mice following intraperitoneal injection of oligonucleotides designed to bind to a 30-bp polypurine site within a chromosomally integrated reporter gene. The binding specificity afforded by TFOs is obtained from the Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds formed in the major groove between the TFO and the purine-rich strand of the underlying target duplex (33Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). G-rich purine stretches are preferentially bound by purine-rich (GA or GT) TFOs, which are oriented anti-parallel to the purine strand of the duplex (8Cooney M. Czernuszewicz G. Postel E.H.

In a purine triplex motif, guanines in the TFO pair with guanines in the target duplex forming G:GC triplets, whereas adenines or thymines bind to adenines forming A:AT or T:AT triplets. Whereas purine TFOs form stable triplexes at physiological pH, purine triplex formation can be inhibited by physiological levels of potassium (36Cheng A.J. Van Dyke M.W.

Several modifications have been incorporated into TFOs to diminish the potassium-mediated inhibition, including the base modifications, 6-thioguanine (36Cheng A.J. Van Dyke M.W.

In order to modify effectively a gene in cells via triplex formation, high affinity, specific binding is required. Calorimetry measurements have demonstrated similar energies for Hoogsteen (−2.6 kcal/mol per base triplet) as compared with Watson-Crick (-1.3 kcal/mol per bp) hydrogen bonds, consistent with stable third strand binding (44Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for relatively long polypurine sequences limits the number of potential target sites for triplex formation. Several strategies have been used to enhance TFO binding affinity at sites where unmodified phosphodiester TFOs would be ineffective in cells. These include the covalent attachment of the duplex intercalator, pyrene, to the end of the oligonucleotide (along with sugar modification at the 2′ position) or the incorporation of a phosphoramidate backbone consisting of substitution of a nitrogen for the 3′-bridging oxygen (31Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.-L.M. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat.

A. 2000; 97: 3084-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another approach to stabilize triplexes (and to aid entry into cells) is the use of polyamines either covalently attached to the TFOs or used in conjunction with the oligonucleotides during transfection (46Thomas T.J. Faaland C.A. Gallo M.A. Thomas T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3594-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 47Antony T. Musso M. Hosseini M.W. Brand G. Greenfield N.J. Thomas T. Van Dyke M.W.

The work reported here describes studies of triplex-mediated, targeted mutagenesis using short psoralen-linked TFOs with chemically altered backbones designed to enhance their binding affinities in vivo. We have compared the effects of backbone composition and charge on triplex formation in vitro under physiologic conditions, and we have examined the ability of the modified TFOs to target mutations within a chromosomal supF reporter gene at a 10-bp homopurine site and within an episomal reporter at a 16-bp site. We report that mutations were induced in the supFtarget gene at a frequency ∼10-fold above background with a cationic TFO containing the DEED modification (pAG10DEED) and 6-fold above background with a TFO made cationic with DMAP modification (pAG10DMAP), whereas the phosphodiester TFO (pAG10PD) did not significantly induce mutagenesis above background levels. At the 16-bp episomal site, the PD TFO was somewhat effective (as expected, since this site affords high affinity binding by the standard DNA TFO), but the DEED and DMAP substitutions still enhanced the activity of the TFO. These results demonstrate that DEED- and DMAP-modified, cationic TFOs have greater intracellular activity than negatively charged phosphodiester TFOs of the same sequence. In addition, the results show that a homopurine site of only 10 bp can be a sufficient target for TFO-mediated genome targeting with appropriate chemical modification. Collectively, these results lend additional support to the potential application of triplex technology in vivo. The sequences and modifications of the oligonucleotides used are shown in Fig. 1. Syntheses and purifications were performed as described previously (41Dagle J.M. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Psoralen was incorporated on the 5′ end using the derivative, (2-[4′-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen]-hexyl-1-O-(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidate, from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). The concentration of DNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to determine apparent dissociation constants (Kd values). For the 10-bp target site in thesupF gene, oligonucleotides (24 nucleotides) corresponding to a region of the supF sequence were annealed to form a synthetic 24-bp target duplex. For the 16-bp target site in the variantsupF10 gene, a synthetic 29-bp duplex was used. Duplexes were radiolabeled on the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, gel-purified, and incubated ∼18 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of TFO in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm spermine, 10% glycerol, and additional cations (MgCl2 and KCl) as indicated. Samples were then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12% native gels containing 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.0, and 10 mmMgCl2 for ∼4 h at 60 V. Mouse fibroblasts (LN12 cells (48Glazer P.M. Sarkar S.N. Summers W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) with multiple integrated copies of a λ vector DNA containing the supF mutation reporter gene were maintained and treated in media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum) containing G418 at 0.2 mg/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). Oligonucleotides were added to the cells (plated at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm2 culture dish) at a final concentration of 1 µm, via GenePorter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's suggestions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and UVA irradiation was administered at a dose of 1.8 J/cm2. Cells were collected for shuttle vector rescue and analysis 2–4 days later. Genomic DNA was isolated from the cells and incubated with λ in vitro packaging extracts for shuttle vector rescue as described (30Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The packaged phage were adsorbed toE. coli C lacZ 125(am) and plated on LB plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-Gal) at 1.6 mg/ml and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 1.3 mg/ml. An SV40-based shuttle vector plasmid pSupF10, similar to pSupFG1 (17Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a target. It was obtained from Dr. Michael Seidman (National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, MD). This vector contains a modified supF gene,supF10, containing a 16-bp G:C-rich target site at the 3′ end of the gene. Monkey COS cells were transfected with the pSupF10 vector DNA using electroporation as described previously for similar vectors (22Chan P.P. Lin M. Faruqi A.F. Powell J. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11541-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours later, the cells were electroporated with the oligonucleotides (22Chan P.P. Lin M. Faruqi A.F. Powell J. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11541-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), followed by UVA irradiation at a dose of 1.8 J/m2 2 h later. Forty eight hours after irradiation, the cells were lysed for preparation of episomal vector DNA, as described (17Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rescued vector DNA was used to transform indicator bacteria to ampicillin resistance, and supF10 gene function was determined based on colony color, as described (17Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported a 5-fold TFO-directed induction of mutagenesis in transgenic mice (3340) containing a modified supF gene (supFG1) incorporating a 30-bp polypurine target site (32Vasquez K.M. Narayanan L. Glazer P.M. Science. 2000; 290: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Additionally, we demonstrated a 10-fold induction in a fibroblast cell line established from these mice (30Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was achieved using a specific 30-mer TFO, AG30, that (with a standard phosphodiester backbone) was found to bind to the target site with high affinity (Kd ∼ 3 × 10−9m). However, in the same cell culture study, efforts to target mutations to a shorter chromosomal polypurine site (10 bp) in the unmodifiedsupF gene in mouse LN12 cells (48Glazer P.M. Sarkar S.N. Summers W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. Neither the specific 10-mer TFO (AG10), a related 13-mer (AG13), nor the 30-mer (AG30), all containing unmodified phosphodiester backbones, were able to induce mutagenesis in the target supF gene (30Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the lack of mutagenesis was due to low affinity binding by the unmodified TFOs to the 10-bp supF polypurine target (Kd values ≥10−6m). In all cases, nuclease resistance was provided by 3′-propylamine substitution (49Zendegui J.G. Vasquez K.M. Tinsley J.H. Kessler D.J. Hogan M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In previous work, it was shown that the binding affinity of purine TFOs could be improved by replacing the phosphodiester backbone with either of two different cationic modifications, DMAP or DEED, both of which are protonated at physiological pH (41Dagle J.M. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Bailey C.P. Dagle J.M. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4860-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Bailey C. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked whether DMAP or DEED modification of the AG10 TFO could provide sufficient increases in binding to allow targeting of the 10-bp homopurine site in the supF gene in LN12 cells. The structures of the DMAP and DEED modifications incorporated into the oligonucleotides used in this study are depicted in Fig.1A. The sequence of the 10-mer TFO, AG10, designed to bind in an anti-parallel fashion to thesupF target duplex is shown in Fig. 1B, along with the scrambled sequence control (SCR10). Gel mobility shift assays were used to determine the binding affinity of pAG10PD, pAG10DMAP, and pAG10DEED to the supF triplex target site. Under the conditions used (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermine, and 10% glycerol) there was essentially no detectable binding of pAG10PD to the supF target site (Fig.2A). However, the binding affinity was substantially increased when the phosphodiester backbone linkages were replaced with either the DMAP or DEED phosphate derivatives (Fig. 2A). This result is consistent with previous work using 17-mer TFOs with the DEED modification targeted to the enhancer of the GS17 gene of Xenopus laevis (41Dagle J.M. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hence, both of the cationic modifications showed substantially higher affinity triplex formation compared with the unmodified TFO. The simplest explanation is that the increased affinity is due to the reduction of electrostatic repulsion between duplex target and the TFO phosphates. Magnesium is known to stabilize triplex structures but is not necessarily required for triplex formation to occur (37Vasquez K.M. Wensel T.G. Hogan M.E. Wilson J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7243-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to test whether magnesium was required for the DEED and DMAP TFOs to bind their target duplex, a range of MgCl2 concentrations was used in gel mobility shift assays. When the MgCl2 concentration was reduced to 0.1 mm, triplex formation again was not detected with pAG10PD at concentrations up to 10−5m, whereas triplex formation with pAG10DMAP and pAG10DEED was still detected (Fig. 2B). In fact, the extent of triplex formed by the modified TFOs was not significantly diminished in low MgCl2. These results suggest that the charge neutralization afforded by magnesium is not necessary for high affinity binding by the cationic TFOs. The binding of G-rich TFOs can be inhibited by physiological levels of potassium, most likely due to self-association during the formation of G-quartets and related structures. The DEED modification has been shown to reduce the inhibitory effect of potassium on triplex formation by a 17-mer TFO (41Dagle J.M. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to test whether the short, 10-mer TFOs used in this study modified with DEED or DMAP, could bind in the presence of physiological levels of potassium, we performed gel mobility shift assays following incubation of the TFOs with duplex DNA in buffer containing 140 mm KCl (Fig. 2C). The binding affinities for both the DMAP and DEED-modified TFOs were somewhat reduced in the presence of physiological levels of potassium, with apparent Kd values in the range of 10−7m. In order to determine the mutagenic potential of the DMAP- and DEED-modified TFOs on a chromosomal target, we transfected LN12 mouse cells containing the supF reporter gene carrying the 10-bp triplex target site with the TFOs. Two hours after transfection, the cells were irradiated with UVA (1.8 J/cm2) to photoactivate the psoralen moiety covalently linked to the 5′ end of the oligonucleotides. The results indicated an oligonucleotide charge- and structure-dependent induction of mutagenesis (Table I). The specific TFO, pAG10PD, containing a negatively charged phosphodiester backbone, did not significantly induce mutations in supF above the background frequency (Table I), consistent with our previous work (30Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Despite the very similar target site binding by the two cationic modifications in vitro, there was a small but detectable difference when the intracellular efficacy was examined. The DMAP modification (pAG10DMAP) induced mutagenesis ∼6-fold above the background mutation frequency, whereas the DEED TFO, pAG10DEED, induced mutagenesis 10-fold above the background, based on the compiled results of two independent experiments using separate preparations of oligonucleotides (Table I).Table ITargeted mutagenesis of the chromosomal supF gene in LN12 mouse cells by DMAP and DEED-modified psoralen TFOsOligonucleotideIrradiationMutants/total plaquesMutation frequency (×10−5)J/cm2None3/183,7562 ± 1None1.83/119,3303 ± NApAG10PD1.814/365,2034 ± 1pAG10DMAP1.857/471,31712 ± 3pAG10DEED1.877/399,86519 ± 2pSCR10DEED1.88/287,0533 ± 2Oligonucleotides (1 µm final concentration) were added to cells using GenePorter transfection reagent and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h.

The data represent the combined results of two independent experiments using separate preparations of oligonucleotides, with the S.E. given. To confirm that the effects seen with pAG10DMAP and pAG10DEED were sequence-specific and triplex-mediated, we treated cells with a control oligonucleotide, pSCR10DEED, that contained the cationic DEED-modified backbone structure and the same base composition as AG10 but a scrambled sequence. Mutagenesis in the supF gene was not induced in cells treated with this control oligonucleotide. These data show that the DEED- and DMAP-modified TFOs can specifically induce mutations in the target gene in mouse cells, whereas a scrambled control oligonucleotide, even with the cationic DEED modification, cannot. To confirm further that the mutagenesis was triplex-dependent and to examine the specificity of gene targeting, we screened the λ cII gene in the same vector in LN12 cells for possible nonspecific induction of mutagenesis by the PD, DMAP, and DEED TFOs. The cII gene serves as a specificity control since it does not contain the 10-bp triplex target site. Although the background mutation frequency in the cIIgene is higher than that of the supF gene, mutations in thecII gene were not significantly induced in cells treated with any of the 10-mer oligonucleotides (TableII). This result provides additional support for a specific triplex-directed effect in the supFgene with the DMAP- and DEED-modified"

In addition to an EGF-like domain, sufficient for receptor binding and tyrosine auto-phosphorylation, many spliced forms also have an IG-like domain that binds HSPGs and maintains a high concentration of neuregulin at synapses. Here, we show that the IG-like domain functions to keep the EGF-like domain at sufficiently high concentrations for a sufficiently long period of time necessary to induce acetylcholine receptor gene expression in primary chick myotubes. Using recombinant neuregulins with and without the IG-like domain, we found that IG-like domain binding to endogenous HSPGs produces a 4-fold increase in receptor phosphorylation. This enhancement of activity was blocked by soluble heparin or by pretreatment of muscle cells with heparitinase. We show that at least 12–24 h of neuregulin exposure was required to turn on substantial acetylcholine receptor gene expression and that the erbB receptors need to be kept phosphorylated during this time. The need for sustained erbB receptor activation may be the reason why neuregulins are so highly concentrated in the extracellular matrix of synapses.

Once released, many polypeptide factors have additional binding interactions with heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) situated in the extracellular matrix between cells. The functional consequences of this dual binding interaction are not entirely clear but have been proposed to concentrate these factors at sites where needed, to protect them from proteolysis, and to modulate their interactions with their cell-surface receptors (1Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). What is even less clear is how these extracellular interactions modulate the intracellular events that ultimately change the properties of the cell. The neuregulins (NRGs)1 are a family of heparin-binding growth and differentiation factors with multiple functions in growth and development of the nervous system and heart and in cancer (2Fischbach G.D.

This transynaptic activation results in a dramatic up-regulation of muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) needed to guarantee proper synaptic transmission. NRG also promotes the transition from embryonic to adult forms of mammalian AChRs by inducing the switch to the ε AChR subunit (7Martinou J.C. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Merlie J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7669-7673Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (8Corfas G. Fischbach G.D. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2118-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these effects would be expected to increase the efficacy of synaptic transmission as the target muscle fiber increases in size and the neuromuscular junction matures. Consistently, mice in which the Type INRG1 allele is disrupted by homologous recombination exhibited a 50% reduction in the density of AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane, and when challenged by low doses of curare, a reduced safety factor for neuromuscular transmission was demonstrated (9Sandrock Jr., A.W. Dryer S.E. Rosen K.M. Gozani S.N. Kramer R. Theill L.E. Fischbach G.D. Science. 1997; 276: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A common feature shared by all NRGs is an EGF-like domain. Even when expressed by itself, this domain is sufficient for receptor binding and activation of homo- and heterodimers of erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 receptors, which are highly concentrated at the neuromuscular synapses in the postsynaptic muscle membrane (5Moscoso L.M.

The rapid autophosphorylation of these receptors on tyrosine residues initiates a signaling cascade that translates this initial binding event into the induction of AChR genes (11Corfas G. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This signaling cascade involves a number of signaling pathways, including both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (12Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Tansey M.G. Chu G.C. Merlie J.P. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most spliced forms of NRG also have an immunoglobulin-like (IG-like) domain NH2-terminal to the EGF-like domain (Fig. 1). We and others (3Loeb J.A. Khurana T.S. Robbins J.T. Yee A.G. Fischbach G.D. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have shown that this domain interacts with HSPGs and may lead to the deposition of NRGs in the extracellular matrix of neuromuscular synapses and within the central nervous system. HSPGs, including agrin, have been identified to play important roles in neuromuscular junction formation (17Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). For the NRGs, HSPGs may serve to “direct” the accumulation of NRG forms with the IG-like domain to the basal lamina of developing neuromuscular synapses and other locations in the developing nervous system at key stages of development (3Loeb J.A. Khurana T.S. Robbins J.T. Yee A.G. Fischbach G.D. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional consequences of NRG-HSPG interactions on AChR expression, however, are not known. One feature of NRG that distinguishes it from other heparin-binding ligands is that it has distinct domains for heparin and receptor binding that are separated from one another by a glycosylated, spacer region. This gave us the unique ability to determine the direct effects of HSPG binding on receptor and gene activation that would not be readily possible with other heparin-binding ligands. Here, we provide evidence that the IG-like domain functions to keep the EGF-like domain at sufficiently high concentrations near erbB receptors for a sufficiently long period of time necessary to induce AChR gene expression. We have examined how NRG-HSPG interactions affect NRG-erbB receptor binding, erbB receptor autophosphorylation, and downstream activation of AChR genes and newly synthesized proteins in primary chick myotube cultures. Using recombinant NRG β1 isoforms with and without the heparin-binding IG-like domain, we show that IG-like domain potentiates the EGF-like domain on receptor phosphorylation by interaction with endogenous HSPGs. Through HSPG interactions, the IG-like domain induces sustained NRG-erbB receptor phosphorylation for over 8 h that is required to turn on AChR mRNA and protein expression. These results provide a molecular rationale for why NRG is highly concentrated in the extracellular matrix of neuromuscular synapses. Recombinant human NRG polypeptides were generously provided by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). The isolated EGF-like domain corresponds to amino acids 177–246, and the IG-EGF domain corresponds to amino acids 14–246; both of the human β1 forms were expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1) and used previously (15Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa, Mr∼13,000) and bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) were purchased from Sigma. Heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC were purchased from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 was purchased from Calbiochem. All other tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen-Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Chick myotube cultures from embryonic day 11 pectoral muscle were cultured on 50 μg/ml collagen type I from rat tail (Collaborative Biomedical Products) as described previously (18Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). 2% chick embryo extract medium was made from 2% chick embryo extract, 10% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomysin, 1% glutamine, and 1% pyruvate in minimum essential medium. Cells were plated at 60,000 cells per 48-well tissue culture plate in 300 μl of medium and at 3 × 105 cells/dish in 2 ml of medium in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and kept in a 5% CO2 incubator. Fresh 2% chick embryo extract medium was changed on the 4thday after plating, and experiments were done on the 7th day after plating. Each form of NRG with and without other reagents was applied to 7-day-old chick myotubes for 45 min at 37 °C. The medium was then discarded, and the cells were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min as described previously (11Corfas G. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated forms of the erbB receptors (p185) were detected by Western blot analysis using the phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY 20 (Transduction Laboratories) after first resolving on overrun 5% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The filters were then probed with a goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp.) and exposed to X-blue film (Eastman Kodak Co.) after treatment with chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 125I-IG-EGF NRG was prepared (19Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using the chloramine-T method yielding a specific activity of 9,000 Ci/nmol. Chick myotube cultures were pretreated with either heparitinase (0.04 unit/ml, to remove endogenous heparan sulfates) or chondroitinase (0.04 unit/ml, to remove chondroitin sulfates) for 90 min at 37 °C. 0.1 nm125I-IG-EGF was applied to prechilled myotube cultures in quadruplicates for 2 h on ice without or with 1 μm cold ligand (IG-EGF) or 500 μg/ml soluble heparin. Total counts/min bound was measured in a γ counter (Packard Instruments) after washing three times with cold minimum essential medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and total counts/min bound was measured after solubilization in 100 μl of 1 n NaOH, 0.5 mg/ml deoxycholate for 10 min at room temperature. Measurement of newly inserted AChR proteins in the myotube membrane was achieved by blocking AChR binding sites with cold α-bungarotoxin, allowing newly synthesized AChRs to appear in the plasma membrane, and then measuring these new AChRs with 125I-α-bungarotoxin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (18Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed on RNA extracted from either 35-mm plates or pooled wells from 48-well plates using Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX) as described previously (20Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1416-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AChR α subunit exon 7 and flanking sequence in vector pBluescript was kindly provided by Dr. Jakob Schmidt at SUNY, and 32P-labeled probes were prepared from this 399-base pair fragment by random priming using Prime It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was re-probed with a32P-labeled GAPDH probe for normalization purposes. Quantitation was performed either using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or by image analysis of x-ray films on nonsaturated images after scanning with a Power Look (UMAX) flat bed scanner with transparency adapter and then analyzing with the Metamorph Imaging system, version 4.0 (Universal Imaging Corp.). Relative mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH levels. To assess the contribution the IG-like domain of NRG makes on erbB receptor phosphorylation, we compared the potency of recombinant NRG forms with (IG-EGF) and without (EGF) the IG-like domain on primary chick myotube cultures. These are biologically active, recombinant NRG Type I β1 isoforms that we have used previously (15Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Although there are some additional sequences besides the IG-like domain on the IG-EGF construct, the heparin-binding portion has been localized to the IG-like domain (16Meier T. Masciulli F. Moore C. Schoumacher F. Eppenberger U. Denzer A.J. Jones G. Brenner H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After treatment with NRG, the erbB receptor complex appears as a diffuse band at ∼185 KDa called “p185” that includes phosphorylated forms of erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 on phosphotyrosine Western blot (11Corfas G. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Employing equal molar amounts, the IG-EGF form was 4-fold more potent than the EGF form alone during the 45 min assay (Fig. 2). We investigated the possibility that this increase in potency of the IG-EGF form is due to HSPG interactions on the myotube surface. We first compared the proportion of NRG that binds to HSPGsversus erbB receptors by selectively removing endogenous HSPGs with heparitinase. A competitive binding study of125I-NRG (IG-EGF) demonstrated that NRG is distributed fairly equally between both erbB receptors and endogenous HSPGs (Fig.3A). Specific binding, assessed by blocking with cold IG-EGF NRG, was about 25% of total binding. Similarly, removing endogenous heparan sulfates reduced total binding by 25%, but did not reduce the specific binding to erbB receptors. Soluble heparin blocked total binding by 50%, similar to the combination of heparitinase and cold NRG. This suggests that a similar proportion of 125I-NRG is associated with its receptor and with endogenous HSPGs. Pretreatment with an enzyme that selectively degrades chondroitin sulfate (chondroitinase) had no effect on binding to either erbB receptors or HSPGs, demonstrating the specificity of NRG interactions with endogenous HSPGs. We examined whether this increased potency of the IG-EGF form on receptor phosphorylation was due directly to interactions with endogenous HSPGs (Fig. 3B). While treatment with heparitinase had no effect on EGF-like domain-induced receptor phosphorylation, it reduced erbB phosphorylation induced by the IG-EGF form to the same level as the EGF-like domain alone. This result suggests that interactions between the IG-like domain of NRG and endogenous HSPGs are directly responsible for the increased potency. This experiment also suggests that the two recombinant ligands are correctly folded, since their activity is the same in the absence of HSPGs. Adding soluble heparin has been shown to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on heparin-binding growth factors (1Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 15Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Krufka A. Guimond S. Rapraeger A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11131-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that high concentrations of soluble heparin effectively block NRG's ability to bind to its receptor. Here we explored the effects of soluble heparin both in modulating the NRG's ability to stimulate erbB receptor phosphorylation and AChR synthesis in cultured myotubes. Whereas heparin had no effect on receptor phosphorylation induced by the EGF-like domain, as little as 5 μg/ml heparin almost completely blocked receptor phosphorylation (p185) with the NRG form containing the IG-like domain (Fig. 4A). Even though heparin inhibited receptor phosphorylation at all concentrations above 1.0 μg/ml, a biphasic response to heparin was observed for AChR induction. At high concentrations, heparin was inhibitory, while low concentrations of heparin, up to 10 μg/ml, actually stimulated the rate of appearance of newly inserted AChR proteins onto the muscle membrane (Fig. 4B). Given that the AChR induction assay is considerably longer than the phosphorylation assay, these results suggest that the stimulatory effects of low concentrations of heparin may occur as a result of the longer course of this assay. Thus far, our results suggest that the IG-like domain of NRG concentrates NRG along cell surfaces through HSPG interactions and that this concentration effect may be responsible for increasing NRG's potency for receptor binding and phosphorylation. Another potential function of this interaction is to provide sustained signaling. Here we have examined the time of NRG exposure required to induce AChR mRNA and protein expression. We measured AChR induction after treating myotubes for different time periods from 15 min to 24 h with the same concentration of NRG (EGF versus IG-EGF) followed by “washing out” the NRG. We then measured AChR mRNA levels (Fig.5, A and B) and new surface proteins (Fig. 5C) 24 h from the start. The AChR α subunit was measured by Northern blot analysis and compared with the housekeeping gene GAPDH to normalize the data. The α subunit was chosen, because this subunit has been shown previously to have the greatest induction by NRG in chick myotubes (10Altiok N. Bessereau J.L. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Harris D.A. Falls D.L. Dill-Devor R.M. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1983-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). While maximal activation of AChR mRNA expression by the IG-EGF domain was achieved with a 15-min treatment, 24 h of treatment was needed for the EGF-like domain to induce significant AChR mRNA expression. Similarly, a significant lag of more than 8 h of exposure was required for the EGF-like domain to get a similar response as the IG-EGF form in promoting the insertion of new AChR proteins on the cell surface (Fig. 5C). From our earlier results, it is most likely that the IG-like domain binds to endogenous HSPGs so that the IG-EGF form is not in fact washed out in this assay, but provides a steady source of ligand to activate the erbB receptors. Unexpectedly, the appearance of new AChR proteins on the cell surface preceded the increase in mRNA, suggesting that mechanisms that increase AChR mRNA and protein expression on the cell surface may be distinct. We next examined the phosphorylation state of the erbB receptors for 24 h of NRG exposure (Fig.6A). Consistent with our results in Fig. 2, the initial phosphorylation response was greater with the IG-EGF form than the EGF form for the first 2 h. However, after 2 h, both constructs kept the erbB receptors phosphorylated to a similar, lower level through 24 h. The level of phosphorylation at 24 h was significantly above background levels without NRG treatment as seen in the blank lane. When we washed out these constructs after 45 min of treatment, and then measured p185 phosphorylation at indicated time points (Fig. 6B), the response induced by the EGF-like domain decayed rapidly and was lost within 1 h after the wash. On the other hand, the IG-EGF construct kept the erbB receptors phosphorylated for a full 8 h after the wash. These results suggest that sustained activation of erbB receptors is a consequence of NRG-HSPG interactions and may be required for AChR mRNA and protein induction. Finally, to demonstrate the importance of sustained erbB receptor phosphorylation in AChR induction, we used a specific erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (23Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) to block erbB receptor phosphorylation at specific times after adding NRG (Fig. 7). Fig. 7A shows that the concentration of inhibitor required to completely block erbB receptor phosphorylation using the EGF construct was above 1 μm. Using 10 μmAG1478, Fig. 7, B and C, show that 12–24 h of sustained receptor phosphorylation were necessary for the EGF-like domain to increase AChR mRNA levels, suggesting that sustained receptor phosphorylation is needed. Similar results were obtained using the IG-EGF construct of NRG; however, higher concentrations of the inhibitor were required. The results presented in this paper examine how extracellular interactions between the IG-like domain of NRG and HSPGs in the extracellular matrix modulate the intracellular signaling events that regulate the expression of synaptic AChRs. We have identified both short and long term effects of NRG-HSPG interactions. The addition of the IG-like domain to the EGF-like domain of NRG results in a rapid and transient increase in erbB receptor phosphorylation that requires interactions with endogenous HSPGs. Sustained NRG-erbB receptor activation, however, is required to turn on AChR mRNA and protein expression. These results suggest that the IG-like domain is needed to keep sufficiently high concentrations of the EGF-like domain near the erbB receptors for a long enough period of time required to induce AChR gene expression. During embryonic development, HSPGs and NRG become concentrated coincidently in the synaptic basal lamina of neuromuscular junctions and remain there throughout adult life (3Loeb J.A. Khurana T.S. Robbins J.T. Yee A.G. Fischbach G.D. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that sustained erbB receptor activation is required to induce AChR expression may be the reason why such high concentrations of NRG are maintained in the synaptic basal lamina. Our results demonstrate that more than 8 h of receptor activation is needed to induce AChR mRNA and protein expression and that this receptor activation requires the continuous presence of NRG. Earlier studies have shown that more than 5 h of NRG exposure was required to increase the insertion rate of new AChRs (24Buc-Caron M.H. Nystrom P. Fischbach G.D. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and up to a 12-h exposure was needed to increase voltage-gated sodium channels in chick muscle cultures (8Corfas G. Fischbach G.D. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2118-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results differ considerably from a recent report where only 1-min exposure of the EGF-like domain of NRG was needed to induce AChR mRNA 24 h after addition to C2C12 cells (25Si J. Wang Q. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8498-8508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the difference could be due to the different myotube culture systems used, it is also possible that they did not “wash away” the NRG. We have found that when we washed chick myotube cultures with PBS instead of serum-containing medium, we found similar results in that both the EGF and the IG-EGF constructs could induce AChR mRNA after 24 h with only 15 min of exposure. We also suggest that the reason the ligand is required for over 8 h is because the erbB receptors need to be maintained in a phosphorylated state for this entire period to increase AChR mRNA. We showed this using a specific tyrosine kinase antagonist added at different times after NRG addition. It is not clear why sustained erbB receptor activation is needed. There are, however, examples from the literature where sustained activation of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein for 4 h or more are needed to induce cell differentiation, migration, and the expression of specific genes (26Liu F.C. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 28McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4347-4353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sustained receptor activation may be needed to recruit other kinases and/or transcription factors or perhaps is needed to initiate new protein synthesis. New protein synthesis has been shown recently to be needed to induce AChR gene transcription (25Si J. Wang Q. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8498-8508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, newly made c-JUN and/or c-FOS mRNA were required to mediate the up-regulation of AChR mRNA by NRG. Pretreatment of C2C12 cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked NRG-induced AChR ε subunit mRNA completely, suggesting that de novoprotein synthesis was needed. There are a growing number of growth and differentiation factors that bind to extracellular matrix HSPGs, including NRG, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, transforming growth factor-β, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, interferon γ, the netrins, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (1Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 29Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 30Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Interactions with extracellular matrix HSPGs are thought to provide a readily accessible store of factors, to protect them from proteolytic degradation, and in some instances, to play important regulatory roles on their functions. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is one of the best studied growth factors in which heparin or HSPG binding is necessary for FGF receptor dimerization and activation (1Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). For other growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β, heparin-binding EGF, and NRG, receptor dimerization can be achieved in the absence of soluble heparin or cell surface HSPGs, but HSPGs may function to enhance the biological activity of these growth factors (32Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We found that a similar proportion of NRG associates with its receptors and with endogenous HSPGs on the cell surface. As a result of this interaction, NRG-induced activation of erbB receptor phosphorylation is increased by 4-fold. Removing endogenous HSPGs by heparitinase treatment eliminates this increase in potency. A similar observation has been described for the L6 muscle cell line (33Han B. Fischbach G.D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 25: 43Google Scholar). There are a number of possible explanations as to why HSPGs increases NRG potency. The most likely is that endogenous HSPGs situated on the cell surface concentrate NRG in a micro-environment nearby their erbB receptors, thus increasing the local ligand concentration. In addition, the HSPGs may present NRG molecules to their higher affinity erbB receptors. Finally, it is possible that heparan sulfate simultaneously binds to several NRG monomers producing a multimer of ligands that could more effectively stimulate multimeric receptor activation. Similar mechanisms have been proposed for FGF, where additional interactions between HSPGs and the FGF receptor have been proposed (31Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). We looked at the effects of soluble heparin on NRG-induced receptor phosphorylation and AChR expression. We found that while soluble heparin blocked NRG binding and NRG-induced erbB receptor phosphorylation, soluble heparin had a biphasic effect on AChR protein expression. Specifically, high concentrations of heparin blocked AChR protein expression, whereas low concentrations actually stimulated new AChR protein expression. Similar biphasic effects of soluble heparin have been described for FGF (21Krufka A. Guimond S. Rapraeger A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11131-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for our observations is that low concentrations of soluble heparin release NRG from endogenous HSPG binding sites, thus freeing it to interact with the high affinity erbB receptors. High concentrations of heparin, on the other hand, not only free NRG from endogenous HSPGs, but also keep it far from the cell surface erbB receptors. Another possibility may come from the time difference between the two assays. In an earlier study, we showed that the IG-like domain of NRG is preferentially degraded by proteases to produce an active EGF-like domain that is no longer inhibited by soluble heparin (15Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since the receptor phosphorylation assay is complete in 45 min, whereas the AChR protein insertion assay takes over 24 h, it is quite possible that the IG-like domain of the NRG is preferentially degraded over the longer course of this assay and that higher concentrations of heparin are required to prevent this proteolytic degradation. One of the more surprising results here is that even though both AChR mRNA and protein expression required prolonged NRG exposure, new AChR protein expression preceded the rise in AChR mRNA. This observation suggests that the cell-signaling mechanism that increases the insertion of new AChRs on the cell surface may be distinct from the mechanism that increases AChR mRNA. Further experiments will be required to sort out this apparent dissociation between AChR mRNA and protein expression that may involve different signaling pathways initiated by erbB receptor activation. It is possible that some of the earlier signaling events that do not require protein synthesis result in movement of pre-existing AChRs to the cell surface, whereas to make new AChR mRNA, more prolonged signaling pathways are required such as the requirement for new protein synthesis as has been described recently (25Si J.

However, little is known about the regulation of TNF-mediated apoptosis by other signaling pathways or growth factors. Here, unexpectedly, we found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and BMP-4 inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibition of caspase-8 activation in C2C12 cells, a pluripotent mesenchymal cell line that has the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts depending on BMP stimulation. Utilizing both a trans-dominant IκBα inhibitor of NF-κB expressed in C2C12 cells and IκB kinase β-deficient embryonic mouse fibroblast, we show that BMP-mediated survival was independent of NF-κB activation. Rather, the antiapoptotic activity of BMPs functioned through the Smad signaling pathway. Thus, these findings provide the first report of a BMP/Smad signaling pathway that can inhibit TNF-mediated apoptosis, independent of the prosurvival activity of NF-κB. Our results suggest that BMPs not only stimulate osteoblast differentiation but can also promote cell survival during the induction of bone formation, offering new insight into the biological functions of BMPs.

Classical NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65/RelA, which is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the IκB group of inhibitory proteins. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activate IκB kinase (IKK) complex to phosphorylate the conserved N-terminal region of IκB proteins (1Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. Ann.

In the absence of NF-κB activation, TNF can trigger the caspase cascade by interacting with Fas-associated death domain protein, which then recruits and activates caspase-8. (11Salvesen G. Dixit V.

However, in the presence of NF-κB activation, the caspase-8-mediated apoptotic pathway is suppressed (4Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.C. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S.

Although several growth factors have been found to inhibit TNF-mediated apoptosis through the activation of NF-κB (20Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J.G. Baldwin A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the regulation of TNF-mediated apoptosis by NF-κB-independent signaling. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, were originally identified by their unique ability to induce bone formation in vivo (21Hogan, B. L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 6,432–438.Google Scholar, 22Reddi A.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 23Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). BMPs initiate a signaling cascade through the ligand-dependent activation of a complex of heteromeric transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II (24Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The activated BMP type I receptor phosphorylates Smad1 and Smad5, resulting in their dissociation from the receptor complex. The phosphorylated Smad1 and Smad5 then form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes (25Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 26Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

Interestingly, the BMP/Smad signaling pathway is also negatively regulated by a structurally and functionally divergent Smad protein of the subfamily of inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7 (25Attisano L.

BMPs induce osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells and are involved in postnatal bone remodeling (28Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M.

Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrate that BMPs control digit numbers in the limbs, possibly through the induction of apoptosis in the interdigital and anterior tissue (30Tang M.K. Leung A.K. Kwong W.H.

Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). BMPs can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells, indicating the therapeutic potential of BMPs in cancer treatment (32Kawamura C. Kizaki M. Yamato K. Uchida H. Fukuchi Y. Hattori Y. Koseki T. Nishihara T. Ikeda Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the cell death machinery can be modulated by multiple factors or signaling pathways, we hypothesized that NF-κB-independent mechanisms may exist to suppress TNF-mediated apoptosis. During the search for regulators of TNF-mediated apoptosis, we unexpectedly found that in contrast to previous studies implicating BMPs in proapoptotic mechanisms (31Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 32Kawamura C. Kizaki M. Yamato K. Uchida H. Fukuchi Y. Hattori Y. Koseki T. Nishihara T. Ikeda Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BMPs possessed a novel antiapoptotic activity that promoted survival of mesenchymal cells during BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. The results reported here reveal a unique BMP/Smad signaling pathway that suppresses TNF-mediated apoptosis in a NF-κB-independent manner. Given the fact that apoptosis plays an important role in osteoporosis and other inflammatory-related bone disorders (33Lynch M.P. Capparelli C. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the utilization of BMP for bone regeneration and repair may have dual benefits: stimulation of osteoblast differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis. C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 µg/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and at 95% humidity. IKKβ−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells (105) were plated onto 6-well plates the day before stimulation. Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of BMP-2 or BMP-4 for 2 h and subsequently killed with tumor necrosis factor (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The supernatant was collected, and cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For annexin V staining, 2 × 104 cells were plated on a microscope coverslip in 24-well plates the day before stimulation. Sixteen h after stimulation, cells were gently washed once with 1× binding buffer and stained with annexin V conjugated with EGFP solution (1:40; CLONTECH) and propidium iodide (50 mg/ml, Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After staining, cells were washed twice with 1× binding buffer and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 20 min. The coverslips were inverted on a drop of Vectashield mounting media (Fisher Scientific) on slides and examined and photographed under a fluorescence microscope using a filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate. For EGFP survival assay, cells were co-transfected with pCMV-GFP vector and either pCMV-Smad-7 or control vector with Superfect (Qiagen). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were pretreated with BMP-2 or BMP-4 for 2 h and then killed with TNF for an additional 24 h. The green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were examined directly under a fluorescence microscope. Cells (2 × 106) were plated in a 100-mm plate the day before stimulation. Cells were pretreated with BMP-2 or BMP-4 at a concentration of 200 ng/ml for the indicated times. The detached and attached cells were collected. Whole cell extracts were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a 1:100 mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The proteins were resolved in by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was probed with polyclonal antibodies against caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (10Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Cells were treated as described above for Western blot. The detached and attached cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 200 µl of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer provided by the manufacturers (R&D Systems, CLONTECH, or Promega). The cell extracts were centrifuged, and supernatants were collected. Protein extracts (200–300 µg) were incubated in reaction buffer containing IETD-pNA (colorimetric caspase-8 substrate; R&D Systems) or DEVD-pNA (colorimetric caspase-3 substrate; Promega) at 37 °C for 2 to 3 h. The samples were analyzed with a plate reader by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of 405 nm. Cells were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for the indicated time points. Nuclear extracts were prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described previously (15Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 22Reddi A.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 µg) of nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 µg of poly(dI-dc) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe containing the class I major histocompatibility complex NF-κB site (5′-CAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAGTTTCACTTC-3′) was then added, and binding proceeded for 15 min. The complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and exposed for autoradiography (5Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 17Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). To determine NF-κB transcription activity, cells were transfected with 2× κB-dependent luciferase reporter constructs using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (20Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J.G. Baldwin A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). PRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase system (Promega). C2C12 cells are pluripotent mesenchymal cells that are widely used for the study of cell differentiation in vitro (6Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 28Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). To study the role of NF-κB in cell growth and apoptosis, we have established a C2C12I cell line stably expressing a modified form of the NF-κB inhibitor, super-repressor-IκBα (SR-IκBα; Fig.1A). SR-IκBα contains serine-to-alanine mutations at residues 32 and 36, which prevent signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα. As shown in Fig. 1A, TNF rapidly induced the phosphorylation and degradation of endogenous IκBα in C2C12 control cells (C2C12V) but did not induce phosphorylation and degradation of SR-IκBα in C2C12I cells. As predicted, SR-IκBα inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB induced by TNF (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our previous studies (10Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar), C2C12I cells were sensitive to TNF-mediated killing, confirming that NF-κB inhibits TNF-mediated apoptosis in cells (Fig.2A).Figure 2BMP-2 and BMP-4 inhibit TNF-mediated apoptosis through a NF-κB-independent mechanism.A, BMP-4 inhibited TNF killing. Cells were pretreated or not pretreated with BMP-4 for 2 h (100 ng/ml) and then treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion.

Thus, we utilized C2C12I cells to screen new growth factors or signaling molecules that could regulate TNF-mediated apoptosis in a NF-κB-independent fashion. Because C2C12 cells are a well-established model system to study BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation, we sought to determine whether BMPs would modulate TNF-mediated apoptosis. Previously, Lopez-Rovira et al. (34Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28937-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have found that transforming growth factor β activates NF-κB that is independent of IκB degradation. Thus, to confirm the observation that BMPs did not activate NF-κB in C2C12I cells, NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assays were performed. As shown in Fig.1C, BMP-4 did not induce NF-κB transcriptional activities in C2C12I cells. To test whether BMPs promoted cell survival, C2C12I cells were pretreated with BMP-4 or vehicle control for 2 h and then treated with TNF for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A,trypan blue exclusion analysis found that TNF stimulation caused 70–80% cell death in C2C12I cells. In contrast, only approximately 20% of cells were killed by TNF when cells were pretreated with BMP-4. BMP-4-mediated protection against TNF killing was dose-dependent, as shown in Fig. 2B. Furthermore, we also examined whether another BMP family member could inhibit TNF killing. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D,BMP-2, like BMP-4, also potently inhibited TNF killing in a dose-dependent manner. To further confirm the results described above, DNA fragmentation and histone release from cell culture supernatant were also measured with cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (4Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.C. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, A and B,pretreatment with BMP-2 and BMP-4 significantly inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by TNF. To determine whether BMP-mediated survival was due to the modification of apoptosis, EGFP-conjugate annexin V staining in conjunction with propidium iodide was performed. Changes in the plasma membrane of the cell surface are one of the earliest features of cells undergoing apoptosis. After initiating apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner face of the plasma membrane to the cell surface (11Salvesen G. Dixit V. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 12Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thornberry N. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Because annexin V has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine and can bind to cells with exposed phosphatidylserine, it has been used to detect the early stage of apoptosis (4Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.C. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 17Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, compared with numerous annexin V-positive-stained cells in the TNF-treated cells, only limited staining was detected in cells pretreated with BMP-2 or BMP-4. Annexin V-positive cells failed to take up propidium iodide (data not shown), indicating cell death via apoptosis, but not necrosis. Taken together, these results suggest that BMPs activate a NF-κB-independent signaling pathway to suppress TNF-induced apoptosis. Next, we examined the molecular mechanism by which BMP signaling inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis. To initiate apoptosis, TNF binds its receptor to recruit TNF receptor-associated death domain protein and Fas-associated death domain protein to activate caspase-8 (4Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.C. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 8Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

To determine whether BMPs inhibited TNF-induced caspase-8 activation, cells were pretreated with BMP-2 and subsequently killed by TNF. As shown in Fig.4A, Western blot analysis found that the processing of caspase-8 induced by TNF was strongly inhibited by BMP-2. Because we could not detect the active subunit of caspase-8 by Western blot analysis, we performed the caspase-8 enzymatic assay to determine whether BMP-2 suppressed caspase-8 activity induced by TNF. As shown in Fig. 4B, caspase-8 enzymatic activity induced by TNF was inhibited by BMP-2. A proapoptotic family member of Bcl-2, Bid, has been found to be a specific substrate of caspase-8 during death receptor-mediated apoptosis. The truncated Bid promotes and/or amplifies apoptosis by inducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol (14Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). To confirm that caspase-8 activity was inhibited by BMP-2, we examined the cleavage of Bid. As shown in Fig.4A, a substantial amount of truncated Bid was detected in cells after TNF stimulation, but not in cells pretreated with BMP-2. In addition to the cleavage of Bid, caspase-8 can also directly activate executing caspases such as caspase-3 to induce apoptosis (11Salvesen G. Dixit V. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 13Thornberry N. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Thus, we also determined whether caspase-3 activity was affected by the inhibition of caspase-8. As predicted, significantly lower DEVDase activity was present in the cells pretreated with BMP-2 compared with cells without BMP-2 pretreatment after TNF stimulation (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrated that BMP-2 suppressed TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activation. Because the results presented above were from C2C12 cells in which NF-κB activities were suppressed, they indicated that BMP-2- or BMP-4-mediated survival was independent of NF-κB. Biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that BMPs exhibit their biological functions through the Smad signaling pathway (35Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25364-25370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether BMP-mediated cell survival was dependent on the Smad signaling pathway. To block BMP-mediated Smad signaling, an inhibitory Smad, Smad7, was utilized. Smad7 interacts with activated BMP type I receptors and inhibits BMP-mediated signaling by inhibiting Smad1 and Smad5 phosphorylation (37Souchelnytskyi S. Nakayama T. Nakao A. Morén A. Heldin C. Christian J.L. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25364-25370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with pEGFP expression vector and pCMV-Smad7 expression vector or a control vector. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were pretreated with BMP-2 for 2 h, and TNF was subsequently added to induce cell death. As shown in Fig. 5, Aand B, cells transfected with control vector had no effect on BMP-mediated protection against TNF killing. In contrast, cells transfected with Smad7 were sensitive to TNF killing regardless of BMP pretreatment, indicating that BMP-mediated survival was dependent on Smad signaling. To rule out a nonspecific effect of SR-IκBα, we also determined whether BMP inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from IκB kinase β-deficient mice (IKKβ−/− cells). IKKβ is a key component of IKK complex for phosphorylation of IκBs and has been found to play an essential role in NF-κB activation (38Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). TNF is unable to activate NF-κB transcription in IKKβ−/− cells due to lack of IKK activity and the subsequent absence of IκB degradation. Therefore, similar to SR-IκBα-expressing cells, IKKβ−/− fibroblasts are also capable of undergoing TNF-mediated apoptosis (38Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To test this effect, IKKβ−/− cells were pretreated with or without BMP-2 for 2 h and then killed with TNF for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, BMP-2 also significantly inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis in IKKβ−/− cells. Similarly, the ectopic expression of Smad7 also rendered BMP-2-pretreated cells sensitive to TNF-mediated apoptosis (Fig.6B), confirming that BMP-mediated survival was dependent on Smad signaling, but not on NF-κB activation. Our results reveal a unique property of BMPs that inhibit TNF-mediated apoptosis in a NF-κB-independent manner. Furthermore, we found that BMP-mediated survival was dependent on Smad signaling, indicating that other survival pathways can replace NF-κB antiapoptotic function to suppress TNF-mediated apoptosis. BMPs suppressed TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activation. Because NF-κB-inducible genes includingTRAF-1, TRAF-2, c-IAP-1,c-IAP-2, c-Flip, and NDEDplay a critical role in inhibition of TNF-mediated caspase-8 activation (4Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.C. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), we examined whether the expression of those genes was regulated by BMPs. Western blot or Northern blot analysis found that none of these genes were induced by BMPs. Additionally, we also found that the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bad, and Bik, was not modulated by BMPs. 2S. Chen and C.-Y. Wang, unpublished observation. Thus, these results indicate that BMP/Smad signaling may regulate other antiapoptotic molecules that have yet to be identified. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that BMP/Smad signaling may posttranslationally modify antiapoptotic proteins. BMPs are multifunctional cytokines that are widely expressed and play important role in morphogenesis and development (23Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 24Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Contrary to our results, several reports indicate that BMPs function in a proapoptotic manner perhaps required for interdigit cell death (30Tang M.K. Leung A.K. Kwong W.H. Chow P.H. Chan J.Y. Ngo-Muller V. Li M. Lee K.K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,31Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). BMPs have been found to induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma (32Kawamura C. Kizaki M. Yamato K. Uchida H. Fukuchi Y. Hattori Y. Koseki T. Nishihara T. Ikeda Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These seemingly contradictory findings may be due to cell type-specific effects. However, it is of interest that both C2C12 cells and embryonic fibroblasts used for our studies have the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts upon BMP stimulation (28Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 29Krebsbach P.H. Gu K. Franceschi R.T. Rutherford R.B. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The process of osteoblast differentiation may be a stress stimulus that requires a survival signal to prevent the cell from undergoing apoptosis (33Lynch M.P. Capparelli C. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, Yang et al. (39Yang X. Castilla L.H. Xu X. Li C. Gotay J. Weinstein M. Liu P.P. Deng C.X. Development. 1999; 126: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found that deletion of Smad5 led to apoptosis in mesenchymal cells and angiogenesis defects during early mouse development by unknown mechanisms. Given the fact that Smad5 is a key component of BMP signaling (35Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the result implies that BMP/Smad signaling may play a role in cell survival during embryogenesis and development. In conclusion, our results suggest that BMPs can prevent apoptosis as well as stimulate osteoblast differentiation and provide new insight into biological functions of BMPs.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) binds to specific G protein-coupled receptors and is mitogenic in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the rat vascular Ang II type 1A receptor (CHO-AT1A). We recently reported that in these cells, Ang II induced cyclin D1 promoter activation and protein expression in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-, SHP-2-, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK)-dependent manner (Guillemot, L., Levy, A., Zhao, Z. J., Béréziat, G., and Rothhut, B. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 26349–26358). In this report, transfection studies using a series of deleted cyclin D1 promoters revealed that two regions between base pairs (bp) −136 and −96 and between bp −29 and +139 of the human cyclin D1 promoter contained regulatory elements required for Ang II-mediated induction. Mutational analysis in the −136 to −96 bp region provided evidence that a Sp1/early growth response protein (Egr) motif was responsible for cyclin D1 promoter activation by Ang II. Gel shift and supershift studies showed that Ang II-induced Egr-1 binding involved de novo protein synthesis and correlated well with Egr-1 promoter activation. Both U0126 (an inhibitor of the MAPK/ERK kinase MEK) and wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3K) abrogated Egr-1 endogenous expression and Egr-1 promoter activity induced by Ang II. Moreover, using a co-transfection approach, we found that Ang II induction of Egr-1 promoter activity was blocked by dominant-negative p21ras, Raf-1, and tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 mutants. Identical effects were obtained when inhibitors and dominant negative mutants were tested on the −29 to +139 bp region of the cyclin D1 promoter. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Ang II-induced cyclin D1 up-regulation is mediated by the activation and specific interaction of Egr-1 with the −136 to −96 bp region of the cyclin D1 promoter and by activation of the −29 to +139 bp region, both in a p21ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK-dependent manner, and also involves PI3K and SHP-2.

The expression of the Egr-1 protein is rapidly and transiently induced by growth factors and other extracellular signals and is a critical upstream mediator of cell proliferation (49Sukhatme V.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differentiation (50Nguyen H.Q. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A.

In turn, Egr-1 regulates expression of many genes such as those for growth factors, cytokines, and adhesion molecules (52Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

In a recent study (18Guillemot L. Levy A. Zhao Z.J. Béréziat G. Rothhut B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26349-26358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we established that Ang II-induced cyclin D1 protein expression and promoter activation required p21ras, Raf-1, MEK, PI3K, and also the catalytic activity of SHP-2 and its Src homology 2 (SH2) domains through the regulation of MAPK/ERK activity. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Ang II induction of the cyclin D1 promoter are not known in CHO-AT1A cells. Here we show that the Egr-1 transcription factor is largely implicated in Ang II-dependent activation of the cyclin D1 promoter and that induction of DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity via the Egr-1 site is mediated by the Ras/MEK/ERK-dependent pathway. We also demonstrate that Ang II induction of Egr-1 and cyclin D1 is modulated by PI3K and SHP-2 in CHO-AT1A cells. In addition, we found that the second region stimulated by Ang II and located between nucleotides −29 and +139 of the 5′-untranslated region of the promoter is also regulated by Ras/MEK/ERK, PI3K, and SHP-2. All culture media, Ang II, poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma.

Cells were passaged every 3–5 days in 100-mm dishes (Costar). Cells seeded for transient transfections were maintained until 3 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4, 136 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and incubated in Opti-MEM 1 with Glutamax-I medium (Life Technologies) just before transfections. Cells that were prepared for nuclear extracts were grown to 80–90% confluence in 100-mm dishes, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and growth-arrested in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 48 h prior to use. Firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs (D1Δ, pGLE, or pT81 constructs) were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1A cells (640 ng/3 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes) with or without different amounts of relevant expression vectors (i.e. 2.5 µg of Ras N17 mutant, 2.5 µg of Raf-1 C4 mutant, 5 µg of SHP-2 CS mutant, 5 µg of the SH2 domains of SHP-2, 5 µg of SHP-1 CS mutant, 5 µg of Egr-1 WT, 5 µg of Egr-1 RW mutant, or the corresponding empty vector) using LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagent following the protocol provided by the supplier. To control transfection efficiency and to normalize firefly luciferase values in experiments using pT81 constructs, cells were co-transfected with 6 ng of the internal control vector pRL-TK (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter driving Renilla luciferase expression). Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and aliquoted into 12-well cell culture dishes (250,000 cells/well). Six hours later, cells were serum-starved for 24 h in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin before preincubation or not with inhibitors for 1 h and then stimulated for the indicated times with 10−7m Ang II. Cells were lysed with 200 µl of passive lysis buffer (1×), and a 20-µl aliquot was assayed for luciferase activity in a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, Berthold) using the kit from Promega. CHO-AT1A cells pretreated or not with inhibitors for 1 h and exposed to Ang II 10−7m for the indicated times were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 at 4 °C and then scraped into 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 µl of ice-cold hypotonic solution (buffer A) consisting of 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml antipain, 1 µg/ml pepstatin and repelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C. The pellet was lysed for 15 min at 4 °C by the addition of 500 µl of ice-cold buffer A. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and then nuclei were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 30 µl of ice-cold solution (buffer C) consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml antipain, 1 µg/ml pepstatin. The nuclear extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Protein concentrations were measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay from Pierce. Binding reactions for gel shift assays were performed in 20 µl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% Ficoll, 4 µg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC),32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (200,000 cpm) and 7–8 µg of nuclear extract. The reaction was allowed to continue for 10 min at 4 °C. In supershift studies, 2 µg of the appropriate affinity-purified antibody was preincubated with the crude nuclear extract for 10 min at 4 °C before addition of the labeled probe. In competition experiments, the nuclear extract was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of the appropriate unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. Electrophoresis of the different samples was carried out on 6% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× TBE (45 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) and run at 15 V/cm for ∼2 h. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to Fuji Super RX film overnight at room temperature. Nucleotide sequences of the sense strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows: Oligo A (cyclin D1 promoter spanning nucleotides −117 to −99), 5′-GCGCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCC-3′; Oligo A-TA, 5′-GCGCCCGCCCTAGCCCCCC-3′; Sp1cons, 5′-TGAAGCCCCGCCCCAACGGA-3′, and NF1cons, 5′-CATATTGG- CTTCAATCCAAAA-3′. Nuclear extracts prepared as described previously (18Guillemot L. Levy A. Zhao Z.J. Béréziat G. Rothhut B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26349-26358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Reaction mixtures were size-fractionated by 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gels), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading of nuclear proteins and then probed with the indicated antibodies: monoclonal anti-Sp1 (1C6) or polyclonal anti-Egr-1 (C-19). Immunoblots were developed using appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Pierce). To map cis-elements that were required for Ang II-induced transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter, we used a panel of luciferase promoter/reporter gene constructs in transient transfection experiments. Quiescent CHO-AT1A cells were transfected with the 5′-deleted constructs and were treated with 10−7m Ang II for 24 h prior to lysis for luciferase assays. As shown in Fig.1, Ang II stimulated cyclin D1 promoter/reporter gene activity ∼6-fold for D1Δ-973 to D1Δ-136 promoter constructs. When the sequence between nucleotides −136 and −96 was deleted, the stimulatory effect was greatly diminished and further deletion to −29 bp did not reduce this activity. These results indicate that the region between nucleotides −136 to −96 contains critical sequences required for transcriptional activation of cyclin D1. A 2.4-fold stimulation was retained for D1Δ-96 and D1Δ-29 promoter constructs, suggesting that another Ang II sensitive region is located between nucleotides −29 and +139 of the 5′-untranslated region within the cyclin D1 promoter. The sequence between nucleotides −136 and −96 contains two putative early growth response protein (Egr) motifs and two potential Sp1 motifs that overlap with the 3′ putative Egr motif (Fig.2A). To examine more precisely the function of each putative binding site, we tested various constructs encompassing the region extending from nucleotide −137 to −99 subcloned into the heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene in the pT81 plasmid (7Yan Y.X. Nakagawa H. Lee M.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33181-33190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to the wild type region, we also tested three mutations affecting the putative Egr binding sites (Fig.2A). Quiescent CHO-AT1A cells transiently transfected with these constructs were incubated with 10−7m Ang II for 24 h prior to lysis for luciferase activity assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, the wild type (WT) construct was clearly induced by Ang II, and stimulation was maintained as long as the 3′ putative Egr/Sp1 motifs were preserved. The response to Ang II stimulation displayed by mutant 2 was fully conserved (2-fold). However, the basal level was clearly greater than with the wild type. Therefore, we hypothesize that the 5′ putative Egr motif may bind repressor protein(s) to flanking nucleotides. With mutant 1 and mutant 3, the basal activity was severely diminished, and Ang II was unable to stimulate the promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that only the 3′ putative Egr/Sp1 motif is responsible for cyclin D1 activation in the −136 to −96 bp promoter region. To determine whether Ang II induces an interaction between nuclear proteins from CHO-AT1A cells and the 3′ putative Egr/Sp1 motif, a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (32P-Oligo A) bearing the −117/−99 bp cyclin D1 promoter sequence (Fig. 2A) was incubated with nuclear extracts from CHO-AT1A cells exposed or not to 10−7m Ang II for different times. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the formation of two major distinct nucleoprotein complexes (A and B) (Fig. 3A). However, only complex B was induced in response to Ang II. Time course experiments defined the transient nature with which this nucleoprotein complex formed. Complex B was totally absent in nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells but appeared within 1 h after induction, reaching a maximum at 4 h, and then declined progressively until 24 h. Interestingly, induction of complex B seemed to be correlated with the earliest activation of the cyclin D1 promoter/reporter gene in CHO-AT1A exposed to Ang II (18Guillemot L. Levy A. Zhao Z.J.

The complete cellular protein, termed PSM, and respective sequence variants share additional Pro-rich and PH regions, as well as similarities with APS and Lnk. A role of these mediators has been implicated in signaling pathways found downstream of growth hormone receptor and receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. As a result of this report a total of four PSM/SH2-B sequence variants termed α, β, γ, and δ have now been identified in the mouse and have been compared with the available rat and human sequences. Variant differences are based on alternative splicing and define distinct last exons 7, 8, and 9 that result in reading frameshifts and unique carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences. Variant sequences have been identified from cDNA libraries and directly by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis predicts four distinctly sized protein products that have been demonstrated after cDNA expression. All were found phosphorylated on tyrosine specifically in response to IGF-I and PDGF stimulation. cDNA expression of the four variants caused variant-dependent levels of stimulation of IGF-I- and PDGF-induced mitogenesis. The most pronounced increase in mitogenesis was consistently observed for the γ variant followed by δ, α, and β with decreasing responses. In contrast, the mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor consistently remained unaffected. The variants are expressed in most mouse tissues, typically, most strongly in pairs of α and δ or β and γ.

PSM carries a number of domains, includingPro-rich putative SH3 domain binding regions, a pleckstrin homology region (PH), a src homology-2 (SH2) domain, and many potential Tyr and Ser phosphorylation motifs, which suggest a role as a putative signalingmediator. Such a role is also supported by the observation that PSM associates with activated but not with inactive forms of IR (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J.

An association with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) in response to PDGF activation was described for PSM/SH2-B that stimulated its phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine (9Rui L.

With regard to its physiologic role PSM cDNA expression has been shown to stimulate the mitogenic response to PDGF-BB, IGF-I, and insulin whereas introduction of a cell-membrane-permeable, putatively dominant-negative SH2 domain peptide interfered with the same response (10Riedel H. Yousaf N. Zhao Y. Dai H. Deng Y. Wang J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, microinjection of the SH2 domain into transformed fibroblasts partially restored a normal actin stress fiber pattern suggesting a stimulatory role of PSM in normal and malignant cell proliferation (10Riedel H. Yousaf N. Zhao Y. Dai H. Deng Y. Wang J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

The SH2-B gene structure and alternative splice sites have been reported in comparison with a third variant termed γ that specifically binds to Tyr-1146 of IR (13Nelms K. O'Neill T.J. Li S.

SH2-B shares a high degree of structural similarity with adaptor proteins, APS and Lnk, that have been shown to participate in signaling events initiated by B cell receptor and T cell receptor, respectively (14Iseki M.

Thus, the common structural relationship between PSM/SH2-B, APS, and Lnk may suggest functional similarities between these three proteins. APS is also expressed in insulin-responsive tissues such as skeletal muscle and fat and becomes phosphorylated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin (17Moodie S.A. Alleman-Sposeto J.

APS also associates with activated PDGFR or with c-Cbl and inhibits PDGF-induced mitogenesis (18Yokouchi M. Wakioka T. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Ohtsuka S. Sasaki A. Ohtsubo M. Valius M. Inoue A.

The present study has focused on the identification of additional mouse sequence variants, the comparison of the involved alternative splice junctions, the predicted differences in protein primary structure when compared with human and rat, and on the implicated putative biochemical and physiologic differences. As a result of this report a total of four PSM/SH2-B sequence variants termed α, β, γ, and δ have now been identified in the mouse and have been compared with the available rat and human sequences. Variant differences are based on alternative splicing and define distinct last exons 7, 8, and 9 that result in reading frameshifts and unique carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences. Variant sequences have been identified from cDNA libraries and directly by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis predicts four distinctly sized protein products that have been demonstrated after cDNA expression. All were found phosphorylated on tyrosine specifically in response to IGF-I and PDGF stimulation. cDNA expression of the four variants caused distinct levels of stimulation of IGF-I- and PDGF-induced mitogenesis. Stimulation was inducer dose-dependent in experiments involving ecdysone-regulated expression plasmids. With two alternative sets of expression plasmids, the most pronounced increase in mitogenesis was consistently observed for the γ variant followed by δ, α, and β with decreasing responses. In contrast, the mitogenic response to EGF consistently remained unaffected. The variants are expressed in most mouse tissues, typically, most strongly in pairs of α and δ or β and γ. Our findings implicate differential roles of the SH2-B/PSM splice variants in specific mitogenic signaling pathways. In combination, the existing data suggest that PSM/SH2-B represents a family of adapters of several known and possibly additional unknown members that belong to a superfamily of signaling mediators, including APS and Lnk. Their physiologic roles include the control of mitogenesis, neuronal differentiation and development, and likely other mechanisms of cell regulation. The isolation of complete PSM/SH2-B cDNA has been described earlier (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A 529-bp fragment containing the SH2 domain of PSM/SH2-B identified by yeast two-hybrid screening served as a hybridization probe to screen a mouse brain lambda Uni-Zap XR library (Stratagene). Positive clones were isolated, and the resulting plasmids were analyzed by fluorescence-automated DNA sequencing. The 5′-end of the cDNA was isolated by 5′ RACE-PCR (Life Technologies, Inc.) using mouse brain total RNA. The RACE-PCR products were inserted into a TA vector (Invitrogen), and a 1.5-kb insert was released by digestion with EcoRI. Five isolated clones were sequenced. One, TA3, served to assemble the cDNA containing the complete protein-coding region of the PSM variants. A 1.2-kb DrdI-EcoRI fragment containing part of the 5′-untranslated region (−130 bp) and of the coding region was isolated from TA3. The 5′-Drd I site was end-filled, and the resulting fragment was joined with the HincII andEcoRI cloning sites of pBluescript KS+(Stratagene). The resulting plasmid (clone 2) was digested withBspEI, at a unique site in the insert, and withSmaI within the multiple cloning site region of KS+ for the subsequent cDNA assembly described below. Clone 5-1 was originally obtained from a mouse brain lambda Uni-Zap XR library and carries a 1.9-kb PSM cDNA insert and a uniqueBspE I site at its 5′-end, which was used to join two parts of the PSM/SH2-B cDNA. This clone also carried the 153-bp insert representing the γ variant. A 1.5-kb 5′-BspEI/3′-ScaI fragment containing almost half of the protein-coding region was isolated from clone 5-1 and inserted into BspEI-SmaI sites in clone 2 carrying the 5′-end of the PSM/SH2-B coding sequence (described earlier). With this approach a subclone PSM/SH2-Bγ/KS+ (clone B23) was prepared, which carried the complete protein-coding cDNA for the γ isoform. A 2.5-kb KpnI-BamHI fragment, containing the complete PSM/SH2-B γ variant cDNA, was released from clone B23 and inserted into KpnI and BamHI cloning sites of the ecdysone-inducible expression vector pIND (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid PSM/SH2-Bγ/IND was used to generate the construct for the α variant cDNA. Clone 20 was obtained from the mouse brain lambda Uni-Zap XR library, which carries a 1.1-kb PSM/SH2-B cDNA insert and corresponds to the α variant. An 884-bp EcoRI-BspHI fragment was isolated from clone 20, end-filled at the BspHI site, and subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of KS+. From the resulting plasmid a 591-bpBstXI-NotI fragment was released and joined with a BstXI-NotI fragment of PSM/SH2-Bγ/IND. This step exchanged the region of the γ-specific cDNA with α variant sequences and resulted in an expression construct for PSM/SH2-Bα/IND. Because the PSM/SH2-Bα/IND plasmid had lost a unique BstXI site within the multiple cloning site region of the vector, the insert-specific BstXI site was used for the construction of complete protein-coding cDNA of the β and δ variants of PSM/SH2-B. Clones 34 and 33 were originally identified in the mouse brain lambda Uni-Zap XR library with 1.1-kb PSM cDNA inserts that corresponded to the β and δ variants, respectively. TwoBstXI-BstEII fragments, a 500-bp fragment from clone 34 containing β variant-specific sequences and a 453-bp fragment from clone 33 carrying δ variant-specific sequences, were individually exchanged with the corresponding α variant-specific 400-bp fragment in PSM/SH2-Bα/IND. These exchanges resulted in PSM/SH2-Bβ/IND and PSM/SH2-Bδ/IND constructs. At each step of the cDNA construction and assembly all resulting plasmids were analyzed by restriction analysis and all ligation junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All four variant constructs carried 91 bp of 5′-untranslated nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation start codon. The lengths of 3′-untranslated sequences after the stop codon differed between all variants with 149 bp for PSM/SH2- Bα/IND, 505 bp for PSM/SH2-Bβ/IND, 361 bp for PSM/SH2-Bγ/IND, and 298 bp for PSM/SH2-Bδ/IND. 2-kbNheI-BamHI restriction fragments of each variant carrying the complete protein-coding region were released and inserted into the XbaI and BamHI sites of an alternative expression plasmid (CVN) under control of constitutive early simian virus 40 transcriptional promoter elements (24Riedel H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 411-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The region containing the variant-related inserts was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 0.5 µg of mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) using oligo(dT) or from 2 µg of total RNA from mouse tissues. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim) was employed in buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 20 µl with the following parameters for one cycle: 42 °C for 60 min, 99 °C for 5 min, and 4 °C for 5 min. Following reverse transcription, PCR was carried out (where indicated at varying Mg2+ concentrations between 1 and 2 mm) using Taq DNA polymerase and primers flanking the insert, 5′-TTCGATATGCTTGAGCACTTCCGG-3′, including nucleotide positions 2081–2104, and 5′-GCCTCTTCTGCCCCAGGATGT-3′, including nucleotide positions 2345–2365 (GenBank™ accession numberAF020526) (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 66 °C for 40 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. For the experiment shown in Fig. 1C, the PCR products from mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA were cloned into pCR2.1 TA cloning vector or TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were analyzed by EcoRI digestion and fluorescence-automated DNA sequencing. For the experiment shown in Fig.2, PCR products from mouse tissue RNA were separated on a DNA-agarose gel. β-Actin as internal control is shown using the same amplification protocol and upstream primer 5′-CGTCTGGACCTGGCTGGCCGGGACC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTG- CGGTGGACGATG-3′.Figure 2Comparison of variant distribution in mouse tissues. After reverse transcription of mRNA from various mouse tissues, PCR was carried out with specific diagnostic primers (see “Experimental Procedures”) to amplify variant-specific fragments of carboxyl-terminal coding regions (indicated on theright) and in parallel to amplify a control β-actin fragment. Products were compared on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel with specific size markers (in base pairs) shown on theleft.

Subconfluent cultures of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were rinsed with serum- and antibiotic-free medium and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of transfection solution. This contained 2 µg of each plasmid, the variant-specific pIND and pVgRXR of the two-plasmid expression system, 10 µl of LipofectAMINE, and 8 µl of Plus reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies Inc.). One milliliter of complete culture medium was added, and cells were incubated for 12 h and, subsequently, for 5 h in fresh complete medium. For subsequent biochemical and mitogenic analysis, cells were treated as described in the following sections. For protein expression analysis, cells were cultured in fresh complete medium for an additional 36 h in the presence of the ecdysone analog ponasterone A (10 µm). Subsequently, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 100 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins (300 µg) were first mixed with PSM antiserum (10Riedel H. Yousaf N. Zhao Y. Dai H. Deng Y. Wang J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and co-precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were rinsed with lysis buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with PSM antiserum using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, to elucidate tyrosine phosphorylation, 5 × 105transfected cells were incubated in normal culture medium for 24 h before reaching quiescence in serum-free medium after 20 h. During both steps the ecdysone analog ponasterone A was present at the various indicated concentrations. Subsequently, IGF-I or EGF at 100 ng/ml or, alternatively, PDGF-BB at 25 ng/ml was added for 15 min. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were first mixed with PSM antiserum and co-precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed with lysis buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho Tyr antibody PY 20 (Transduction Laboratories). To assay for DNA synthesis, 2 × 106transfected cells were split into 24-well plates and incubated in complete medium in the presence or absence of the ecdysone analog ponasterone A at various concentrations for 24 h before they were starved for 20 h. Subsequently, IGF-I or EGF at 100 ng/ml or, alternatively, PDGF-BB at 25 ng/ml was added for 18 h, and finally 0.1 µCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine was added at 3 TBq/mmol for 5 h. Cells were rinsed three times in ice-cold PBS and incubated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were rinsed, and 0.5 ml of 0.2 nNaOH, 0.1% SDS was added at 37 °C for lysis 1 h before the pH was neutralized by addition of 0.5 ml of 2 m Tris, pH 6.8. Two milliliters of mixture (ScintiSafe econo-1, Fisher) was added to quantify the incorporated radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. To measure cell proliferation, 2 × 106 transfected cells were split into 24-well plates and incubated in complete medium for 24 h. Cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I or 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB in medium with 0.5% serum. After 3 days, 200 µl of 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added for 4 h. The resulting formazan was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol and quantified colorimetrically at A570(25Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Meth. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4320) Google Scholar). The result has been presented as a measure of the cell number. The SH2 domain-encoding region had earlier been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (1Hansen H. Svensson U. Zhu J. Laviola L. Giorgino F. Wolf G. Smith R.J. Riedel H. J. Biol.

It was used to screen a mouse brain Uni-Zap XR library (Stratagene) to isolate the complete PSM/SH2-B protein-coding cDNA (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A number of independent clones were identified, and eight were sequenced and compared with the originally reported sequence termed α (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J.

Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One clone represented the same α sequence, one clone carried a 100-bp insertion representing a variant termed β (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,4Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), five clones carried a 153-bp insert representing a variant termed γ (13Nelms K. O'Neill T.J. Li S. Hubbard S.R. Gustafson T.A. Paul W.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and one clone carried a 53-bp insert representing a variant termed δ. The 153-bp insert was composed of both the 100-bp and 53-bp inserts. All insertions were located downstream near the SH2 domain-coding sequence starting at nucleotide 1894 (when A of the initiation codon is defined as 1) of the complete mouse PSM/SH2-B α cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF421138) (2Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Starting from this position a comparison of the four variant sequences (Fig. 1A) suggested that the other isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of the longest primary PSM/SH2-B transcript carrying the 153-bp insertion (γ) (13Nelms K. O'Neill T.J. Li S. Hubbard S.R. Gustafson T.A. Paul W.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The observed sequence inserts result in reading frameshifts. All variant sequences predict unique protein carboxyl termini that carry specific motifs, including Pro-rich regions for α, γ, and δ; as well as a Ser/Trp-rich sequence and a nuclear localization signal for δ (Fig. 1A). A comparison with listed sequences representing human variants α (GenBank™ accession number AF227967), β (AF227968), and γ (AF227969), as well as rat variants α (GenBank™ accession number U57391) and β (AF047577) (2Riedel H.

Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), indicates highly conserved alternative splice variants and implicates functional differences of the existing isoforms (Fig.1B). To address whether mRNA representing the observed variant sequences could be independently demonstrated in mouse brain, poly(A)+ RNA sequences were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a set of diagnostic primers (see “Experimental Procedures”) to distinguish between the variant sequences by size. On agarose gels all resulting PCR products correlated well with the fragment sizes predicted for the four variants, 338 bp for γ, 285 bp for β, 238 bp for δ, and 185 bp for α (Fig. 1C). Fragments were introduced into a TA cloning vector either directly or after additional PCR amplification, and numerous clones were characterized by DNA sequence analysis. These studies independently established identical variant nucleotide sequences compared with those that had been found in the cDNA library. Variant sequences were identified repeatedly in independent clones for δ (9Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1978887881,"Binding of the extracellular matrix molecule fibronectin to the integrin receptor α5β1 elicits downstream signaling pathways that modulate cell function. Fibronectin-α5β1 interaction occurs via the conserved RGD sequence in the tenth FIII (FIII10) domain of fibronectin. A synergistic site containing the sequence PHSRN in the adjacent FIII9 domain has also been identified. Here we investigate the function of the eighth FIII domain in integrin-mediated cell adhesion using a wide range of methods, including biochemical, biological, and biophysical assays of integrin binding, cell adhesion, and protein denaturation. Mutation of the FIII9 synergistic site (PHSRN to PHAAA) in FIII9-10 reduced the binding activity for integrin α5β1 to levels observed for FIII10 alone, but the corresponding mutant in FIII8-9-10 showed no loss of binding activity. Cell adhesion assays also demonstrated enhanced functional activity of constructs containing FIII8. Equilibrium chemical denaturation studies indicated that FIII8 confers conformational stability upon FIII9, but only if the exposed loops, PHSRN and VKNEED on FIII9 and FIII8, respectively, are intact. These results demonstrate that the loss of integrin binding activity, observed upon alteration of the PHSRN synergistic site of FIII9-10, results partly from a loss of conformational stability of FIII9. Our data suggest a mechanism for integrin α5β1-fibronectin interaction, which in addition to the primary RGD binding event, involves a conformation-sensitive scanning by the integrin for accessible sites on the ligand, whereupon full activation of downstream signaling occurs.

The regulated adhesion of cells to FN thus has a key function in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, and aberrant regulation of this process is often associated with disease. The understanding of the molecular basis of FN-integrin interactions has wide implications for the manipulation of normal and disease tissue processes. FNs are large glycoproteins that are abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of most tissues (for a review, see Ref. 1Hynes, R. O. (1990) FibronectinsSpringer-VerlagNew York.Google Scholar). The mature FN molecules are dimers of two C-terminally disulfide-linked monomers of ∼220 kDa. Each monomer consists of homologous repeating units or domains, called type I, II, and III domains. The type III FN domains (FIII) are the most common and the largest, composed of around 90 amino acids arranged in seven anti-parallel β-strands (2Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). FIII domains occur in many diverse intra- and extracellular proteins (3Campbell I.D. Spitzfaden C. Structure. 1994; 2: 333-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimeric cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion receptors composed of one α-subunit and one β-subunit and classified into eight different groups according to the identity of their β-subunit (for a review, see Ref. 4Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9044) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated signal transduction occurring in response to ligand binding involves phosphorylation of intracellular molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) and paxillin, and consequent induction of second messenger pathways (5Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The central cell binding domain (CCBD) of FN contains binding sites for a number of integrins, including α5β1. The minimal cell recognition sequence in the CCBD is the RGD motif in the tenth FIII domain (FIII10). Synthetic peptides containing RGD exhibit some cell adhesive activity and block cell adhesion to FN. The RGD motif is a conserved sequence occurring in several other distinct extracellular matrix proteins (6Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). An additional site, PHSRN, that is required for activity close to that evoked by intact FN, has been identified in the adjacent FIII9 domain (7Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues associated with this site have been shown to act synergistically with RGD in α5β1- and αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion (8Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, deletion mutagenesis studies have suggested involvement of a further site, N-terminal to FIII9, in α5β1binding, although no specific amino acids were identified (9Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). More recently, additional α5β1 binding activity has been described in the fragment spanning domains FIII6 to FIII10 (10Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the specific functions of the individual FIII domains N-terminal to FIII9 in FN-integrin binding have not been reported. Resolution of the structure of the human FIII7-10 string of four domains by x-ray crystallography (11Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and heteronuclear NMR studies of the human FIII10 domain (12Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) have provided key information for the understanding of integrin-ligand recognition and binding. The NMR and crystal structures reveal that the RGD sequence of FIII10 resides in a loop extending from the domain surface, and NMR-derived data further suggest that this RGD loop is flexible (13Copié V. Tomita Y. Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Venable R.M. Pastor R.W. Krueger S. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This flexibility may contribute to the promiscuity of RGD-integrin interactions and provide an explanation for the blocking of cell adhesion function by small flexible RGD peptides. The PHSRN sequence in FIII9 and the RGD loop are on the same side of the FIII9-10 pair but PHSRN, which is also located on a loop, is less exposed. Structure-function studies have indicated that the relative spatial configuration of the RGD and PHSRN loops in FIII10 and FIII9 is critical for function (15Grant R.P. Spitzfaden C. Altroff H. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6159-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analysis of specific cellular events, elicited in response to cell adhesion to wild-type and mutant FIII9, FIII10, and FIII9-10 domains, suggests that cell attachment occurs primarily via FIII10, while maximal activation of pp125FAK and downstream signaling is dependent upon FIII9 (16Hotchin N.A. Kidd A.G. Altroff H. Mardon H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2937-2946PubMed Google Scholar). The two-site model of FN-integrin interaction implied in these studies is in agreement with earlier data proposing that the synergy site binds to the α5-subunit and the RGD site binds to the β1-subunit (10Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The characterization of binding sites on integrins that interact with the FIII domains has largely focused on the RGD and PHSRN motifs, although it is not clear whether or not these are the only motifs required for ligand-receptor interaction. Indeed, recent studies have suggested additional sites in FIII9 and FIII10 that contribute to ligand binding (17Redick S.D. Settles D.L. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the specific role of the FIII8 domain in integrin α5β1recognition by characterizing wild-type and mutant FIII8-9-10 proteins by the use of solid-phase binding studies, biological assays, and biophysical methods. Our data suggest that native FIII8 and various mutations in FIII8 and FIII9 can modulate FN binding to integrin α5β1. We show that there is a strong correlation between structural stability of FIII9 and its integrin-mediated function. The construction of pGEX-FIII9, pGEX-FIII10, and pGEX-FIII9-10 has been described elsewhere (18Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the FIII constructs were amplified from the plasmid pFHL1 (19Umezawa K. Kornblihtt A.R. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). pGEX-FIII8 was constructed using the primers GGCTGTTCCTCCTCCCACTGA (FIII8-5′) and TTATTATGTTTTCTGTCTTCCTCTAAG (FIII8–3′). The PCR product was ligated directly intoSmaI-restricted pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX-FIII8-9-10 was constructed by amplification of the FIII8-9-10 DNA sequence using the primers FIII8-5′ and TTATTATGTTCGGTAATTAATGGAAA (FIII10-3′). The amplified products were ligated into the pGEX2T vector restricted with SmaI. pGEX-FIII8-9 was constructed by amplification of the FIII8-9 DNA sequence using the primers ATAATTTAGCGGCCGCGGCTGTTCCTCCTCCCACT (FIII8-NotI-5′) and ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTATGTTGATTGTTGGCCAAT (FIII9-3′). The PCR product was then restricted with NotI and ligated into pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), linearized with NotI. Mutations to the C-C' loop (1274VKNEED1279) in FIII8 and to the C'-E loop (1376PHSRN1380) in FIII9 were made following the QuickChange™ protocol (Stratagene). The primers used to mutate Ser1378-Arg1379- Asn1380 to Ala1378-Ala1379-Ala1380 (PHSRN to PHAAA) were GTGCCCCACGCTGCGGCTTCCATCAC (forward) and GTGATGGAAGCCGCAGCGTGGGGCAC (reverse). The primers used to mutate Val1274-Lys1275-Asn1276 to Ala1274-Ala1275-Ala1276 (VKNEED to AAAEED) were GGTGCGTTACTCACCTGCGGCAGCTGAGGAAGATGTTGCAG (forward) and CTGCAACATCTTCCTCAGCTGCCGCAGGTCAGTAACGCACC (reverse). The primers used to mutate Glu1277-Glu1278-Asp1279to Ala1277-Ala1278-Ala1279 (VKNEED to VKNAAA) were CTCACCTGTGAAAAATGCGGCAGCTGTTGCAGAGTTGTC (forward) and GACAACTCTGCAACAGCTGCCGCATTTTTCACAGGTGAG (reverse). pGEX-FIII8-9-10 constructs containing the PHAAA mutation in the FIII9 domain were further mutated in the VKNEED loop of FIII8 using the primers described above. Notations used for the various mutants are as follows: PHSRN to PHAAA (mSRN); VKNEED to AAAEED (mVKN); VKNEED to VKNAAA (mEED); PHSRN to PHAAA and VKNEED to AAAEED (mSRN, mVKN); PHSRN to PHAAA and VKNEED to VKNAAA (mSRN, mEED) (see Table I). The DNA sequence of all created constructs was confirmed using Sanger DNA sequencing methodology (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Oxford).Table INotations used for mutant FIII constructsDomain Exposed loopsFIII8 1274VKNEED1279FIII91376PHSRN1380FIII101493RGD1495MutantSubstitutions–PHAAARGD[mSRN]FIII9-10VKNEEDPHAAARGD[mSRN]FIII8-9-10AAAEEDPHSRNRGD[mVKN]FIII8-9-10VKNAAAPHSRNRGD[mEED]FIII8-9-10AAAEEDPHAAARGD[mVKN,mSRN]FIII8-9-10VKNAAAPHAAARGD[mEED,mSRN]FIII8-9-10 Open table in a new tab GST·FIII fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described previously (18Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For cell spreading inhibition assays and equilibrium chemical denaturation studies, cleaved FIII proteins were obtained by thrombin digest of the respective GST fusion proteins bound to the GST-conjugated Sepharose resin (2.5 units of thrombin per mg of fusion protein). Cleaved FIII protein was subsequently washed off the resin with PBS, dialysed exhaustively in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (buffer A), and subjected to ion exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose resin developed with a NaCl gradient of 0–1 m in buffer A over 30 min. Purity and Mr of all proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE, visualized with Coomassie Blue. Protein concentration was calculated using absorption of the solution at 280 nm, with the extinction coefficient estimated using the program peptidesort (Wisconsin package ver. 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI), exploiting the procedure of Gill and von Hippel (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5083) Google Scholar). Integrin α5β1 was purified from human placenta as described previously (21Sharma A. Rao Z. Fry E. Booth T. Jones Y. Rowlands D.J. Simmons D.L. Stuart D.I. Virology. 1997; 239: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, a placenta was homogenized in 200 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing sodium vanadate (1 mm), leupeptin (10 µg ml−1), aprotinin (10 µg ml−1), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto protein A-conjugated Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequently onto Sepharose resin conjugated to antibody clone BIIG-2 raised against the α5 subunit, both resins having been pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The integrin was eluted in 2 bed volumes of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.1, containing 30 mm octyl-β-glucoside (Sigma-Aldrich). 1-ml fractions were collected and simultaneously neutralized in 10× lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and containing 300 mm octyl-β-glucoside. The integrin was stored in a buffer containing the divalent cations Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Nunc) were coated with a 10-fold dilution of the integrin stock solution (0.1 mg ml−1) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2(EB) and left overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then washed three times with EB and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in EB for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed as above, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the relevant GST·FIII fusion proteins diluted in EB containing 1% BSA. The wells were processed as above, and mouse anti-GST antibody (1:2000 dilution in EB containing 1% BSA) (Sigma) was added. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, the wells washed with EB, and sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Sigma) was added (1:2500 dilution in EB containing 1% BSA). The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, the wells washed as above, and incubated with the Sigma Fast™ HRP tablet set according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 405 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate, and background antibody binding in the absence of ligand was subtracted from the readings. Nonspecific binding of GST fusion proteins to uncoated wells containing BSA only was measured separately for each ligand concentration point and subsequently subtracted from the corresponding values for total binding. Dose-response data from the assays were analyzed by non-linear regression using a sigmoidal curve fit (Prism, GraphPad Software). Baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts were used in cell attachment and spreading assays and cell spreading inhibition assays, performed as described elsewhere (18Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The coating efficiencies of FIII8-9-10, FIII9-10, FIII8-9, FIII10, and FIII8 were assessed by ELISA and confirmed to be similar at all the concentrations used in the assays (data not shown). Spreading assays were performed in quadruplicate and attachment assays in triplicate in each experiment. Cell attachment was assessed by staining the adherent cells with 0.1% crystal violet as described elsewhere (18Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Spreading inhibition assays were performed using wells coated with 10 µg ml−1 of FN (Sigma) in PBS. Cells were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C in suspension in the presence of doubling dilutions of cleaved FIII proteins before plating, and the assays were performed as described above. The data obtained are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Differences between the means were calculated using a non-paired Student's t test for p < 0.05. BHK cells were seeded onto BSA-blocked glass coverslips coated with FIII9-10, [mSRN]FIII9-10, FIII8-9-10 or [mSRN]FIII8-9-10 at 12.5 µg ml−1, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The coverslip cultures of BHK cells were then washed in PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and washed again. Subsequent incubation with primary mouse anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma), diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, was followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), diluted 1:75 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Actin was visualized with the use of fluorescein-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, dilution 1:40). The coverslips were then washed in PBS and inverted over a drop of Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Mouse IgG (Coulter Immunotech), substituted for the primary antibody at 10 µg ml−1, was used as a negative control. Staining was viewed using a Leica DMRBE microscope. Image capture and analysis was achieved by the use of Openlab image capture and manipulation software (Improvision). Equilibrium unfolding experiments were performed on recombinant FIII proteins (cleaved from GST·FIII fusion proteins as described above) incubated in 0 to ∼8m GdnHCl in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The molarity of the GdnHCl solution was calculated by the weight of the solution (22Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Protein samples were rapidly diluted 11-fold in GdnHCl and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min at 25 °C before measuring fluorescence emitted at 350 ± 3 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 278 nm on a Shimadzu RF5001PC spectrofluorimeter, at 25 °C. All unfolding experiments were repeated independently, and the data were fitted for a two-state unfolding mechanism as described previously (22Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). The influence of FIII8 upon the interaction of FN with integrin α5β1 was analyzed in solid-phase ligand binding assays. An initial assessment of the integrity of the integrin preparation was made by comparing the binding affinities of the individual GST·FIII10, GST·FIII9, and GST·FIII8 domains, the GST·FIII9-10, and GST·FIII8-9 domain pairs, the GST·FIII8-9-10 domain triplet, and GST alone (Fig.1A). The observed binding affinities of the recombinant proteins were considered not to be perturbed by the GST carrier protein or its dimerization, since the isolated GST dimer had negligible binding activity to α5β1 integrin, and the same carrier GST was present in all the proteins tested. Of the individual FIII domains, only FIII10 exhibited α5β1 binding activity (Fig. 1A), as is consistent with previous data (18Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Comparison of the dose-response curves for FIII9-10 and FIII10 (Fig.1A) shows that addition of FIII9 increases the affinity for α5β1 (the apparent Kdwas ∼50-fold lower than for FIII10 alone), confirming the synergistic action of FIII9. No binding was observed for the FIII8-9 domain pair. The addition of FIII8 N-terminal to FIII9-10 did not significantly alter the integrin binding affinity (Fig. 1A). The integrin binding capacities of the synergy site mutants GST· [mSRN]FIII8-9-10 and GST·[mSRN]FIII9-10 (see TableI) were subsequently compared by ELISA. Alanine substitution of the amino acids SRN in the FIII9 synergy site reduced the α5β1 binding affinity of FIII9-10 to the level observed for the single FIII10 domain (Fig.1B). Comparison of the synergy site mutants GST· [mSRN]FIII8-9-10 and GST·[mSRN]FIII9-10, however, showed that the FIII8 domain can recover α5β1 binding activity that was lost as a result of mutation of part of the FIII9 synergy site (Fig. 1B). These data thus indicate a role for FIII8 in integrin α5β1 binding in the absence of a functional PHSRN site in FIII9. We further explored the possible contribution of FIII8 to FN-integrin interaction in biological assays of cell attachment and spreading (Fig. 2). Attachment assays with BHK fibroblasts (Fig. 2A) showed that neither FIII8 alone nor the FIII8-9 pair exhibited any cell attachment activity. The activity of FIII8-9-10 was greater than that of FIII9-10, although this difference was less pronounced at higher concentrations of coating protein. In comparison with cell attachment, cell spreading was more sensitive to the presence of FIII8 (Fig. 2B); the ability of FIII8-9-10 to induce cell spreading was ∼50 and ∼30% higher than that of FIII9-10 at coating concentrations of ∼0.2 and ∼2 µm, respectively. An alternative approach to the assays described above was adopted in which the binding of FIII domains in solution to the cell surface integrins was assessed, thus negating the effect of possible conformational constraints imposed by the immobilization of the protein ligand to the plastic substrate. Assays of inhibition of cell adhesion on FN-coated surfaces, testing the ability of FIII8 to enhance the inhibitory activity of FIII9-10, were performed using independent FIII domains cleaved from the GST carrier protein (Fig. 2C). The FIII8 and FIII10 domains in isolation had no effect upon cell adhesion at the concentrations tested, confirming our previous data (18Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Wild-type FIII8-9-10 had a more marked effect on cell spreading than FIII9-10, showing ∼20% more inhibitory activity at the concentration of ∼2 µm. These results thus differ from the ELISA data in which addition of FIII8 to the wild-type FIII9-10 ligand produces no enhancement of solid-phase integrin binding. This probably reflects the different nature of the two assays. ELISA only provides information about the requirements for primary ligand binding event and is not influenced by integrin responses secondary to the initial recognition, such as receptor clustering (23Yauch R.L. Felsenfeld D.P. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Sheetz M.P. Hemler M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and inside-out signaling, which affects ligand affinity (24Mehta R.J. Diefenbach B. Brown A. Cullen E. Jonczyk A. Gussow D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Biological assays were further employed to assess the contribution of FIII8 to the induction of downstream cellular responses in the absence of a functional synergy site in FIII9-10 (Fig.3). The FIII9-10 mutant carrying alanine substitutions in the synergy site (SRN to AAA: [mSRN]FIII9-10) exhibited reduced levels of cell attachment, approaching those observed for FIII10 (Fig. 3A). Addition of FIII8 to [mSRN]FIII9-10 (in the mutant [mSRN]FIII8-9-10) recovered the cell attachment activity lost upon mutation of the synergy loop (Fig. 3A). In cell spreading assays, the activity of [mSRN]FIII9-10 likewise dropped substantially (by at least 50% as compared with the wild-type FIII9-10), whereas [mSRN]FIII8-9-10 supported elevated levels of cell spreading in comparison with [mSRN]FIII9-10, rescuing the effect of the mutated synergy site in FIII9 (Fig. 3B). These observations are therefore in accordance with ELISA data for integrin binding activity of these mutants (see Fig. 1B). The ability of FIII8 to participate in integrin-induced cellular signaling was further determined by examining focal adhesion complex formation in response to [mSRN]FIII8-9-10 carrying the FIII9 synergy site mutation (Fig. 4). Vinculin-positive focal adhesion complexes observed in cells plated onto FIII9-10 and FIII8-9-10 (Fig. 4, A and C) did not form in response to the mutant domain pair [mSRN]FIII9-10 (compare Fig. 4,A and B). However, the ability to promote focal adhesion complex formation was restored by the presence of FIII8 in [mSRN]FIII8-9-10 (Fig. 4D), providing further evidence that FIII8 contributes specifically to the induction of integrin-dependent downstream signaling responses. The crystal structure of FIII7-10 (11Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) reveals a protruding loop between the β-strands C and C′ of FIII8, on the same face of the molecule as the exposed loops containing the RGD and PHSRN sites (Fig. 5). Given the location and configuration of this loop in FIII8, we tested the possibility that it contributes specifically to the integrin-binding activity of FIII8 observed in the GST·[mSRN]FIII8-9-10 mutant. The residues VKNEED within the loop were substituted with alanine both in the wild-type GST·FIII8-9-10 construct and in the GST·[mSRN]FIII8-9-10 synergy site mutant (Table I). The resultant mutants GST·[mVKN]FIII8-9-10 and GST·[mEED]FIII8-9-10 did not show any difference in α5β1 binding affinity when compared with the native GST·FIII8-9-10 protein (Fig.6A). The binding affinities of double mutants GST·[mSRN,mVKN]FIII8-9-10 and GST·[mSRN,mEED]FIII8-9-10 were also similar to that of GST·FIII8-9-10 (data not shown). These results therefore suggest that the VKNEED sequence in FIII8 is not a primary recognition motif for α5β1 integrin.Figure 6Assessment of functional activity of FIII8-9-10 mutants with perturbed VKNEED sequence.A, dose-response curves for binding of FIII8-9-10 (○), [mVKN]FIII8-9-10 (×) and [mEED]FIII8-9-10 (▪) to integrin α5β1.

In experiments comparing the activity of the VKN and EED mutants (Table I), lower numbers of cells spread on surfaces coated with [mVKN]FIII8-9-10 and [mEED]FIII8-9-10 than on those coated with wild-type FIII8-9-10 (∼65 and ∼80% of FIII8-9-10 activity, respectively, at the concentration of ∼0.1 µm) (Fig. 6B). Cell spreading in response to GST·[mSRN,mVKN]FIII8-9-10 and GST·[mSRN,mEED]FIII8-9-10 at low coating concentration (∼0.1 µm) was reduced to ∼5 and ∼35% of wild-type FIII8-9-10 activity, respectively, but remained higher than that supported by [mSRN]FIII9-10 (Fig. 6B). The mutants [mVKN]FIII8-9-10 and [mSRN,mVKN]FIII8-9-10 were biologically less active than [mEED]FIII8-9-10 and [mSRN,mEED]FIII8-9-"
https://openalex.org/W2014258271,"The Sko1p transcriptional repressor regulates a subset of osmoinducible stress defense genes inSaccharomyces cerevisiae by binding to cAMP-responsive elements. We have reported previously that in response to stress Sko1p is phosphorylated by the stress-activated Hog1p mitogen-activated protein kinase, which disrupts its interaction with the Ssn6p·Tup1p corepressor. Here we report that other mechanisms are essential for the regulation of the Sko1p repressor activity upon stress. The nuclear localization of Sko1p depends on the stress-inhibited protein kinase A (PKA). Sko1p is localized in the nucleus of unstressed cells, and it redistributes to the cytosol upon severe salt stress (1 mNaCl). Yeast mutants with low PKA activity localize Sko1p to the cytoplasm in the absence of stress and exhibit deregulated expression of cAMP-responsive element-regulated genes. The central part (315) of Sko1p, containing the PKA phosphorylation sites and the basic domain-leucine zipper domain, is essential for its nuclear localization. Salt-induced export of Sko1p from the nucleus is independent of Hog1p and of the Bcy1p regulatory subunit of PKA. Furthermore, phosphorylation by PKA slightly enhanced DNA binding affinity of Sko1p in vitro, whereas Sko1p dimerizationin vivo is not regulated by stress. Sko1p repressor activity is associated to its binding to the Ssn6p·Tup1p complex. Interestingly, the Sko1p NH2 terminus (1), containing the Hog1p phosphorylation sites, associates in vivo with Tup1p in the absence of Ssn6p, suggesting that Sko1p represses gene transcription by interacting directly with the Tup1p subunit of the Ssn6p·Tup1p complex.

Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Upon osmotic stress Sko1p is phosphorylated by the MAP kinase Hog1p, the interaction with Ssn6p·Tup1p is disrupted, and finally stress defense genes are up-regulated (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Apart from the HOG pathway, a second signal transduction pathway, the cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, has been shown to broadly modulate stress-induced gene expression in yeast. More specifically, efficient adaptation to osmotic stress depends on the cellular PKA activity (17Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2000; 16: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that is inhibited by salt stress (18Márquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One important mechanism by which PKA influences gene expression seems to be the modulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of transcription factors. For example, under normal growth conditions, high PKA activity prevents the nuclear import of Msn2p and Msn4p, transcriptional activators that enter the nucleus upon various stress conditions and activate the expression of many defense genes (19Martı́nez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 20Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown recently that protein kinase A phosphorylates Sko1p in vitro (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the connection between PKA activity and Sko1p-mediated gene regulation remained unknown. In this work we show that nuclear localization of Sko1p requires high PKA activity and that salt stress rapidly causes the export of Sko1p from the nucleus. The following yeast strains were used: SP1, MATα ura3 leu2 trp1 ade8 can1; S13–58A, SP1 with tpk2::HIS3 tpk3::TRP1 bcy1::LEU2; S13–58A-1, SP1 with tpk1w1tpk2::HIS3 tpk3::TRP1 bcy1::LEU2; W303–1A,MATa, his3–11, 15 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ura3–1 ade2–1 can1–100; MAP5, W303–1A withtup1::loxP-KAN-loxP; MAP6, W303–1A with ssn6::loxP-KAN-loxP; MAP19, W303–1A with sko1::loxP-KAN-loxP; MAP32, W303–1A withhog1-Δ1::TRP1; MAP37, W303–1A with chromosomal 3xHA-SKO1. Synthetic medium contained 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), and the amino acids, purine and pyrimidine, bases required by the strains. YPD medium contained 2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract. The yeast expression vector pYEX-4T (PCUP1-GST, URA3; 2 μm; AMRAD Biotech) was used to express GST-Sko1 fusion proteins. The full-length GST-SKO1 fusion plasmid pSKOYEX is described in Ref. 15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. GST-Sko1p expressed from pSKOYEX is fully functional as it complementssko1Δ mutant strains (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). pSKOYEX(E) contains a triple amino acid substitution, Ser108, Thr113, and Ser126 to Ala, and abolishes phosphorylation in vitro by Hog1p (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Truncated GST-SKO1 fusions were constructed by inserting polymerase chain reaction-generated SKO1fragments into pYEX-4T BamHI/SalI resulting in constructions pMP252 containing GST-SKO1 (315), pMP254 containing GST-SKO1 (486), and pMP255 containing GST-SKO1 (1). The 2xCREHAL1-CYC1-lacZ reporter was constructed by insertion of a tandem repetition of CREHAL1 (pPY17) (13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) into theCYC1-lacZ reporter plasmid pMP206 (PCYC1ΔUAS-lacZ, URA3; 2 μm) (12Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast strains were grown selectively until saturation in the appropriate SD liquid medium and were then diluted in YPD. Logarithmically growing cells (optical density at 660 nm of 0.5 to 0.8) were treated or not with 0.4 m NaCl for 20 min and permeabilized by ethanol/toluene treatment, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described in Ref. 21Gaxiola R. deLarrinoa F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar. GST-Sko1 fusion protein was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Expression of GST-SKO1 (wild type, point mutated, and truncated versions) in wild type and mutant yeast cells from plasmid pYEX-4T was induced for 1 h by addition of 0.5 mm CuSO4. Cells were fixed by addition of 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min and washed in PS buffer (100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1.2 m sorbitol). Protoplasts were formed in PS buffer plus 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1000 units of zymolyase. Cells were spotted onto polylysine-treated microscope slides and incubated for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The primary antibody was polyclonal anti-GST (1:500; Molecular Probes), and the secondary antibody was an anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (1:200; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The preparations were covered with 80% glycerol with 1.5 nm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and 1 mg/ml p-phenyldiamine. Preparations were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope using a 100× oil immersion lens. Photographs were taken, and images were scanned and processed in Adobe PhotoShop 4.0. Recombinant GST-Sko1 protein from bacteria was either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated in vitro by Hog1p or protein kinase A as described in Ref. 15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. The phosphorylation mixture containing 40 ng of GST-Sko1 was then incubated with radiolabeled CREHAL1 probe, protein·CRE complexes were resolved in native polyacrylamide gels as described in Ref. 13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, and signals were quantified using a Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphorimager. Full-length and truncated GST-SKO1 expression from pYEX-4T vector was induced for 1 h by adding CuSO4 to a final concentration of 0.5 mmto the growth medium. Cells (100 ml) were broken with glass beads in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture;Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein extracts (around 3 mg of total protein) were incubated over night with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were washed extensively with Buffer A and finally resuspended in 50 μl of SDS loading buffer. GST and GST-Sko1 proteins were detected with polyclonal anti-GST antibody (1:5000; Molecular Probes) and secondary anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5000; Promega). Copurified Tup1 or Ssn6 proteins were detected with polyclonal anti-Tup1 and anti-Ssn6 antibodies (1:4000; kind gifts of S. Y. Roth and D. Edmondson). To measure Sko1p homodimerization in vivo we expressed GST-SKO1 in yeast strain MAP37 that has the genomic SKO1 locus tagged with 3xHA, purified GST-Sko1p as described above, and assayed for HA-Sko1p copurification by detecting it using the monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). GRE2 and TBP1 mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis using total RNA from yeast cells as described in Ref. 15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. To detect the subcellular localization of the Sko1p transcription factor we expressed an NH2-terminal GST-Sko1 fusion protein in wild type andsko1Δ mutant yeast cells and followed its localization by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-GST antibody. The GST-Sko1 protein has been demonstrated to be fully functional (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). When yeast cells were grown in SD medium, GST-Sko1p localized exclusively to the nuclei (Fig. 1). No differences were observed using Δsko1 mutant instead of wild type cells (data not shown). As a control, we expressed GST alone from the same expression vector and detected it distributed over the entire cell volume, whereas untransformed yeast cells showed only a very weak background fluorescence (data not shown). We next tested whether stress conditions altered Sko1p localization and applied mild hyperosmotic (0.4 m NaCl), hypo-osmotic (distilled water), heat (42 °C), oxidative (0.1 mmH2O2), and nutritional (SC medium without carbon source) stress. The GST-Sko1p did not change its nuclear localization under any of these conditions (data not shown). However, upon severe salt stress (1 m NaCl) GST-Sko1p was detected in the entire cell (Fig. 1), indicating that Sko1p is exported from the nucleus under these conditions. This change in localization occurs quickly (5 min after salt treatment), is maintained as long as cells are challenged with 1 m NaCl, and is fully reversible, as GST-Sko1p reconcentrates in the nucleus after washing the cells with normal medium (data not shown). Nuclear localization of transcription factors is often regulated by phosphorylation. Sko1p is phosphorylated by at least two different kinases, the Hog1p MAP kinase and protein kinase A (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We tested whether the salt stress-regulated localization of Sko1p depends on either the HOG or the cAMP protein kinase A signaling pathway. The localization of GST-Sko1p in Δhog1 mutant cells under normal and severe salt stress conditions was indistinguishable from that of wild type cells (Fig.2). Also, a point-mutated GST-Sko1p unphosphorylatable by Hog1p (GST-Sko1(E)) (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was localized as the wild type protein (data not shown). PKA activity is essential for yeast growth, but mutants with high or low constitutive activity of this kinase are viable (22Nikawa J. Cameron S. Toda T. Ferguson K.M. Wigler M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this study we used a yeast mutant strain with a deletion of the negative regulatory subunit Bcy1p and deletions in two of the three catalytic subunits (Tpk2, 3p) of PKA. This genetic manipulation completely disconnects the remaining Tpk1p catalytic subunit from its cAMP dependence and results in constitutive high PKA activity (23Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). By further introduction of thetpk1w point-mutated allele, PKA activity is reduced dramatically (24Cameron S. Levin L. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1988; 53: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells with low protein kinase A activity failed to localize GST-Sko1p to the nucleus so that the protein was cytoplasmic under normal, as well as salt stress conditions (Fig. 3). Furthermore, cells with constitutively high protein kinase A activity showed a normal localization pattern of Sko1p (Fig. 3).Figure 3Nuclear accumulation of GST-Sko1p requires normal PKA activity. Localization of GST-Sko1p in yeast cells with constitutively low (S13–58A-1, tpk1w1Δtpk2,3 Δbcy1) or constitutively high PKA activity (S13–58A, Δtpk2,3 Δbcy1 TPK1); was detected as described in the legend for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having found that normal PKA activity is necessary for the nuclear accumulation of Sko1p under normal growth conditions, we tested whether PKA activity is also needed for the regulated gene expression from CRE sites that are the natural DNA target sequences for the Sko1p repressor. We made use of a CYC1-lacZ-based reporter assay where we measured expression of lacZ driven by two CRE sequences from the Sko1p-regulated HAL1 gene (13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CREHAL1-CYC1-lacZ construct completely depends on Sko1p; therefore it can be used as a specific measure for Sko1p activity in vivo (13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, the reporter construct is repressed under normal conditions and activated upon salt shock. Normal PKA activity is required for repression from the CRE sites, because mutants with low PKA activity show constitutively activated reporter gene expression (Fig. 4). Up-regulated PKA activity did not seem to interfere with the repression/activation pattern of CRE-mediated expression (Fig. 4). To test the possibility that the DNA binding capacity of Sko1p is regulated by Hog1p- or PKA-dependent phosphorylation, we performed in vitro binding assays using bacterially expressed and purified GST-Sko1p that was either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated in vitro by either one of the two kinases. As described in (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), GST-Sko1p is phosphorylatedin vitro by the Hog1p MAP kinase (that is activated by the Pbs2p MAP kinase kinase) or by PKA at multiple residues. Measurements of incorporated radioactive phosphate into GST-Sko1p by either Hog1p or PKA showed that more than 60% of the sites used by either kinase were phosphorylated in the in vitro system used (data not shown). We followed binding of GST-Sko1p to the CREHAL1promoter element (13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GST-Sko1p bound specifically to CREHAL1, but Hog1p-dependent phosphorylation did not change the affinity of Sko1p for CREHAL1 (Fig. 5,lanes 3 and 4). When GST-Sko1p was phosphorylated by PKA, it increased its affinity to CREHAL1 by about 2-fold (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). To determine the function of different Sko1p domains for nuclear localization and in vivo repressor activity, we expressed truncated GST-Sko1p versions in yeast and followed their cellular localization by immunofluorescence and their capacity to repress gene expression by detecting mRNA levels of the Sko1p-dependent GRE2 gene (14Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Rep M. Proft M. Remize F. Tamás M. Serrano R. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Deletion of the NH2-terminal cluster of Hog1 phosphorylation sites in GST-Sko1p (315) resulted in normal nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein and repression of GRE2 transcription (Fig.6, A and B). An additional deletion of the Sko1p central domain containing the cluster of PKA phosphorylation sites and the adjacent bZIP motif in GST-Sko1p (486) did not allow nuclear localization of the protein, and accordingly, it did not complement a Δsko1 mutant for repression of GRE2 transcription (Fig. 6B). We followed additionally the interaction capacity of the different Sko1p truncations with the Ssn6p·Tup1p corepressor by GST pull down assays detecting coprecipitated Tup1p (see Fig. 6C). As reported recently (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), GST-Sko1p coprecipitates specifically and efficiently with Tup1p. However, the deletion of the Sko1p NH2-terminal domain (1) strongly diminished, but not abolished completely, the association with Tup1p (Fig. 6C). A further deletion of the central part of Sko1p expressing GST-Sko1p (486) nearly abolished all binding to Tup1p. The NH2-terminal region (1) alone was sufficient to associate strongly with Tup1p (Fig.6C, last lane). CREB transcription factors bind to their CRE recognition sequences as homo- or heterodimers (11Vincent A.C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5394-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether dimerization of Sko1p in vivo plays a role in the regulation of this transcriptional repressor by osmotic stress, we assayed for Sko1p-Sko1p interaction by coprecipitation experiments. We co-expressed GST-Sko1p and HA-Sko1p in yeast cells, purified GST-Sko1p, and detected the amount of copurified HA-Sko1p (Fig.7). In these experiments HA-Sko1p specifically copurified with GST-Sko1p from yeast extracts. The amount of Sko1-Sko1 interaction, however, was not much affected by osmotic stress, even though there was a slightly enhanced interaction detectable after treatment with 0.4 m NaCl. We finally addressed the question whether Sko1p interacts with the Ssn6p or the Tup1p subunit of the Ssn6·Tup1p corepressor complex. We therefore expressed GST-SKO1 in wild type,ssn6Δ, and tup1Δ cells. After purification of GST-Sko1p we tested for Ssn6p and Tup1p coprecipitation by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 8, interaction of Sko1p with Tup1p was not affected when Ssn6p was deleted. However, in the absence of Tup1p the association of Sko1p with Ssn6p was abolished. These results suggest that Sko1p recruits the Ssn6-Tup1p corepressor by interaction with the Tup1p subunit. CREB transcription factors are downstream effectors that connect various signal transduction pathways with regulated gene expression. CREB factors receive inputs from upstream kinases and transduce them into specific gene expression patterns, a system that is conserved from yeast to man (for review see Ref. 3Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Because one CREB factor can be phosphorylated by various signal kinases, it is important to find out at which level(s) distinct signaling pathways modulate CREB activity. We have characterized the mechanisms of regulation by salt stress of the CREB repressor Sko1p of S. cerevisiae. Sko1p, by recruiting the Ssn6p·Tup1p corepressor, inhibits the transcription of genes important for ion homeostasis, likeENA1 (12Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or HAL1 (13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and genes with protective function against oxidative stress (16Rep M. Proft M. Remize F. Tamás M. Serrano R. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here we characterize this recruitment more in detail by showing that Sko1p can interact in vivo with Tup1p in the absence of Ssn6p. It is therefore likely that Sko1p contacts directly the Tup1p subunit of the corepressor, which then recruits histone deacetylase activities as shown recently (25Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, both subunits of Ssn6-Tup1p seem to be equally important for repression of Sko1p-regulated genes (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Rep M. Proft M. Remize F. Tamás M. Serrano R. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), arguing for an essential role of Ssn6p in the corepressor complex although it is not directly recruited by Sko1p. The NH2-terminal (1) domain of Sko1p is required and sufficient for efficient interaction with Tup1p (Fig. 6C). However, the interaction is not completely abolished, explaining that a truncated Sko1p lacking that region still can repress GRE2 transcription. Interestingly, Sko1p domain (1) contains the three Hog1p phosphorylation sites (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), pointing to the possibility that modification of these sites by the Hog1p MAP kinase directly triggers changes in the affinity of Sko1p to Tup1p. Activation of the HOG pathway upon osmotic stress disrupts the Sko1p-Ssn6p·Tup1p interaction (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but here we present evidence that in addition to this mechanism, Sko1p activity is regulated at other levels. Favorable growth conditions lead to high protein kinase A activity and the subsequent accumulation of Sko1p in the nucleus (Fig.1). This nuclear targeting is crucial for the repression of Sko1p-regulated genes, and we show that yeast mutants with low PKA activity are not able to target Sko1p to the nucleus and consequently fail to repress CRE-regulated gene expression (see Figs. 3 and 4). This observation is in agreement with previous findings showing that low PKA activity favors HAL1 transcription even under non-stress conditions (26Márquez J.A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We identify a central region of Sko1p (315) that is essential for its nuclear localization (Fig. 6). Within this domain a possible bipartite nuclear localization sequence is present that partially overlaps with the bZIP domain,430RKRKX13RKRKK451. Whether this sequence is responsible for nuclear import of Sko1p will require further analyses, but for the plant CREB protein OPAQUE2 a very similar nuclear target sequence overlapping with bZIP has been functionally proven (27Varagona M.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant J. 1994; 5: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, under normal growth conditions high PKA activity seems to favor the binding of Sko1p to its CRE target sequences, because we show that phosphorylation of Sko1p by PKA stimulates the in vitroassociation of Sko1p to CRE (Fig. 5). This result is in agreement with stronger repression of CRE-driven reporter genes (reported here in Fig.4) or natural Sko1p-regulated stress genes like HAL1 (26Márquez J.A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in cells with high PKA activity. Under salt stress conditions the Sko1p repressor activity has to be decreased to allow defense gene expression. This release from repression seems to be dominantly regulated by the HOG pathway, becausehog1 mutants are completely unable to overcome Sko1p-mediated repression upon stress (12Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Rep M. Proft M. Remize F. Tamás M. Serrano R. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mutants with high PKA activity, however, readily derepress Sko1p target genes upon stress (Fig. 4) (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Garay-Arroyo A. Covarrubias A.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 879-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We can summarize this stress-induced derepression process as coordination of several mechanisms; thus upon stress-activated Hog1 MAP kinase phosphorylates Sko1p and disrupts the interaction of Sko1p with the Ssn6p·Tup1p corepressor (15Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but HOG neither interferes with the association of Sko1p with CRE nor with the subcellular localization of Sko1p. Additionally, the decrease of PKA activity results in decreased affinity of Sko1p for CRE sites. Finally, under severe salt stress conditions Sko1p is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in complete derepression of Sko1p-dependent genes.

While HRC resides in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the physiological function of HRC is largely unknown. In the present study, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and show that HRC binds directly to triadin, which is an integral membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Using a fusion protein binding assay, we further identified the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC as responsible for the binding of HRC to triadin. These motifs may represent a novel protein-protein interaction domain. The HRC binding domain of triadin was also localized by fusion protein binding assay to the lumenal region containing the KEKE motif that was previously shown to be involved in the binding of triadin to calsequestrin. Notably, the interaction of HRC and triadin is Ca2+-sensitive. Our data suggest that HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca2+release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by interaction with triadin.

However, HRC did not appear to function as a lipoprotein receptor, as it was localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it has no access to plasma lipoproteins (1Hofmann S.L. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18083-18090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported compelling evidence supporting that HRC resides in the lumen of the SR (2Suk J.Y. Kim Y.S. Park W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), consistent with the results of the earlier immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies (3Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Lee E. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8260-8270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that HRC may play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis in the SR, although its physiological function is largely unknown. The deduced amino acid sequence of a full-length HRC cDNA reveals several unique features (1Hofmann S.L. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18083-18090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 1) an amino-terminal signal sequence; 2) in the middle, nine nearly identical repeats of 29 residues containing a histidine-rich sequence HRHRGH and a stretch of 10 to 11 acidic amino acids; 3) a 13-residue stretch of polyglutamic acid near the carboxyl terminus; and 4) a cluster of 14 closely spaced cysteine residues in the carboxyl terminus. High contents of acidic amino acids may account for the high capacity Ca2+ binding of HRC, which is reminiscent of calsequestrin, a well characterized Ca2+-binding protein of the SR. Triadin was also first identified from rabbit skeletal muscle and found to be a single span membrane protein localized to skeletal muscle triads (4Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Brunschwig J.P.

Triadin was shown to be associated into a stable quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and junctin at the junctional membrane (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G.

Previous studies suggest that calsequestrin, the high capacity Ca2+-binding protein, actively participates in muscle contraction by regulating the amounts of Ca2+ released by the ryanodine receptor, the Ca2+ release channel (7Ikemoto N.

Several triadin isoforms appear to arise from alternative splicing of the single triadin gene (5Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12646-23654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

This common region encompasses the short amino-terminal cytoplasmic region, the membrane-spanning region, and the highly charged lumenal domain. Particularly, the lumenal domain contains several clusters of charged amino acids, which are referred to as “KEKE” motifs (17Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to facilitate protein-protein interactions by acting as polar zippers (18Realini C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29664-29667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A recent study has demonstrated that a single KEKE motif of the lumenal domain of triadin is indeed essential for the binding of triadin to calsequestrin (21Kobayashi Y.M. Alseikhan B.A. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17639-17646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since HRC shares many biochemical and structural features with calsequestrin, we reasoned that HRC might be involved in Ca2+ release from the SR by playing a similar role as calsequestrin. In addition, several lines of circumstantial evidence suggested that HRC might be associated with triadin (22Kim K.C. Caswell A.H. Talvenheimo J.A. Brandt N.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9281-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Damiani E. Picello E. Saggin L. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized immunoprecipitation and fusion protein binding assays to investigate the alleged interaction between HRC and triadin. Our data demonstrate that HRC indeed binds to triadin, and this binding occurs between the histidine-rich acidic region of HRC and the lumenal region of triadin containing the KEKE motif, which is also critical for binding to calsequestrin. Heavy SR vesicles were isolated from skeletal muscle of male New Zealand White rabbit according to the heavy SR preparation method described previously (25Kim D.H. Sreter F.A. Ohnishi S.T. Ryan J.F. Roberts J. Allen P.D. Meszaros L.G. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 775: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Protein assays were performed using bovine serum albumin as a standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal heavy SR vesicles were solubilized at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in a buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized proteins were obtained by centrifugation (a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor) at 60,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. Triton X-100 solubilized rabbit skeletal heavy SR proteins were diluted 10-fold in 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). One ml of the diluted extracts was incubated with purified sheep polyclonal antibody raised against HRC (a gift from Dr. Sandra Hoffman, Southwestern Medical Center) or sheep polyclonal antibody raised against triadin (a gift from Dr. Kevin Campbell, University of Iowa College of Medicine) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by further incubation with 50 µl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed several times with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted from the affinity beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Purified sheep preimmune IgGs were used as a control. Fragments of HRC and triadin were amplified by PCR, digested with EcoRI andXhoI and subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX 4T-1 (Pharmacia). Primer sets used for PCR are as follows: HRC-N (27–199 residues), 5′-ATCCG AATTC ACCCA GCAGC TGAGA GG-3′, 5′-ATTCG TCGAC CTGTG CTCTG GGGAG ACC-3′; HRC-M (193–357 residues), 5′-TTCGG AATTC GAGGA GGTCT CCCCA GAGC-3′, 5′-AACGG TCGAC GACGT GATGG TGTTC ACC-3′; HRC-C (471–847 residues), 5′-ATGCG AATTC CACCA TCACG TCCCT CACC-3′, 5′-TTAGC TCGAG GGCGT CTCCA GCATG TCC-3′; Tri-a (1–66 residues), 5′ ATGAAT TCATGACTGAGATCACTGC-3′, 5′ATGTC GACTA ACAAC GGCAA CTGC-3′; Tri-b (79–160 residues), 5′-ATCCG AATTC TCTAT TGCCA AGATG GGC-3′, 5′-TTAGC TCGAG TGGTA TTTTC CTCTC AGG-3′; Tri-c(151–260 residues), 5′-AGTCG AATTC CAGGA AAAAC CTGAG AGG-3′, 5′-TTAGC TCGAG GTTTT GAAAC AGCAG CAG-3′; Tri-c1 (151–204 residues), 5′-AGTCG AATTC CAGGA AAAAC CTGAG AGG-3′, 5′-TCTTC TCGAG TTTTG TCACT GTCTT TGTTT CTGG-3′; Tri-c2 (204–260 residues), 5′-AGTCG AATTC GAGGA GAAGA AAGCT CG-3′, 5′-TTAGC TCGAG GTTTT GAAAC AGCAG CAG-3′. To produce more GST fusion proteins containing various numbers of histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC, one forward and two backward primers were synthesized in addition to the HRC-M primer set. The primers were used in combinations. The additional forward primer is: 5′-TTCGG AATTC CACAG GCACC GGGGC CAC-3′. The additional backward primers are: 5′-AACGG TCGAC GGCCC TGGTG ACGGT CGCT-3′ and 5′-AACGG TCGAC TTCAC CTTCG TCATC ATC-3′. GST fusion constructs were induced in Escherichia coli JM109 with 0.5 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, lysed by sonication on ice, and then incubated in 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The fusion proteins were immobilized by incubating 1 ml of the soluble E. coli fraction with 50 µl of bead volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) for 3 h and washed three times with 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline. The immobilized fusion proteins were incubated with 1 ml of heavy SR proteins solubilized with Triton X-100 for 5 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were separated by 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters by a semidry-transfer unit (Hoefer) by following the manufacturer's manual. The blots were rinsed briefly with TNT buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/TNT and then incubated with the primary antibody in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/TNT for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The blots were washed with three changes of TNT for 15 min each and incubated with the horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/TNT for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The blots were then washed again 3–4 times with TNT for 20 min each. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Pierce). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against rabbit skeletal triadin and SERCA1 were purchased from Affinity BioReagents. The interaction of HRC and triadin was first examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies. Solubilized heavy SR proteins were immunoprecipitated with either anti-HRC or anti-triadin antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1) with anti-HRC, anti-triadin, or anti-SERCA antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of HRC (Fig. 1 A, left panel, lanes 2, 4) led to the co-precipitation of triadin (Fig.1 A, mid-panel, lanes 2, 4), whereas preimmune serum was unable to precipitate either of these proteins (Fig. 1 A, left andmid-panels, lane 3). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of triadin (Fig. 1 B, left panel, lanes 2, 4) led to the co-precipitation of HRC (Fig. 1 B, mid-panel,lanes 2, 4). Once again, preimmune serum precipitated none of these proteins (Fig. 1 B,left and mid-panels, lane 3). These results show that HRC indeed binds to triadin. SERCA, another SR protein, was co-precipitated by neither HRC nor triadin (Fig. 1,A and B, right panels), implying that the interaction between HRC and triadin is specific. Three segments of HRC were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins to determine the triadin binding domain of HRC (Fig.2A). HRC-N does not contain any notable domains. HRC-M contains five of the nine nearly identical histidine-rich acidic repeats (see below), each consisting of a histidine-rich sequence HRHRGH, a stretch of 10 to 11 acidic amino acids and a sequence containing two serines and one threonine in a negatively charged context. HRC-C contains a 13-residue stretch of polyglutamic acids and a cluster of 14 closely spaced cysteine residues. The three GST fusion proteins and a GST control were incubated with solubilized heavy SR and precipitated using glutathione beads. The resulting precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue (Fig. 2 B, left panel), and the same samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-triadin antibody (right panel). The result indicates that only the HRC-M region binds to triadin. Thus, the histidine-rich acidic repeats may represent a novel domain that is involved in protein-protein interaction. The repeats are highly homologous in their amino acid sequences and the tenth repeat is an incomplete one (Fig. 3A). To analyze the triadin binding domain in the repeats with greater precision, we have generated more GST fusion proteins containing various sets of repeats by PCR (Fig. 3 B). Internal deletions of repeats in some fusion proteins might arise probably due to the highly repetitive nature of the template sequence. Protein binding assays were performed as described above (Fig. 3 C). GST fusion proteins a through i did not bind to triadin, suggesting that no particular repeat is uniquely essential for the triadin binding. This is consistent with the fact that all the repeats are nearly identical with a few conservative amino acid substitutions or deletions. GST fusion proteins, j, k, andl contained more than four and a half repeats and were shown to bind to triadin (HRC-M in Fig. 2 is identical to the fusion protein l). Based on these observations, we suggest that more than four and a half repeats are required for the triadin binding of HRC. Further structural studies should be necessary to reveal the exact mechanism of the protein binding activity of the repeats.Figure 3Analysis of the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC for triadin binding. Panel A, sequences of the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC are aligned. Panel B, structures of the analyzed GST-repeats fusion proteins are shown.Panel C, the GST-repeats fusion proteins were incubated with solubilized heavy SR. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (left panel) or probed with anti-triadin antibody (right panel). GST and GST fusion proteins are denoted by dots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calsequestrin, a Ca2+-binding protein of SR, binds to triadin and junctin in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. We therefore tested whether the interaction between HRC and triadin is also affected by Ca2+ concentration. HRC was immunoprecipitated from solubilized heavy SR in the presence of EGTA or various concentrations of Ca2+. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-HRC and anti-triadin antibodies (Fig.4A). The interaction between HRC and triadin was strongest when assayed in the absence of Ca2+ and inhibited by millimolar concentrations of Ca2+. This behavior is similar to the interaction between calsequestrin and triadin. Identical results were obtained when the HRC-M fusion protein was utilized to pull down the triadin protein (Fig. 4 B), showing once again that HRC-M is the domain responsible for triadin binding of HRC in a Ca2+ sensitive manner. All triadin isoforms in a given species have identical amino acid sequence over the first 250–260 residues. This common region contains a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a membrane-spanning region, and highly negatively charged luminal domains. The charged luminal domain has been shown to be responsible for binding to calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor. We therefore assumed that this common region might also contain the HRC binding domain. Three GST fusion proteins were first generated: Tri-a contains the amino-terminal cytoplasmic region and part of the membrane-spanning region; Tri-b contains the proximal half of the common luminal domain; and Tri-c contains the distal half of the common luminal domain (Fig.5A). GST fusion proteins and GST alone were purified and incubated with solubilized heavy SR. The protein complexes were then recovered on glutathione beads, separated on SDS-PAGE, and then stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 5 B,left panel), or probed with anti-HRC antibody (mid-panel) or anti-triadin antibody (right panel). Only the Tri-c fusion protein was able to pull down HRC. We then generated two more GST fusion proteins, Tri-c1 and Tri-c2, which are the proximal and distal halves of the Tri-c region, respectively. The results of a similar binding assay showed that the Tri-c2 region contains the HRC binding activity (Fig. 5 B,mid-panel). Interestingly, the Tri-c2 region contains the KEKE motif that was previously shown to bind directly to calsequestrin (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet certain that this particular KEKE motif also binds to HRC as well as to calsequestrin. Tri-c fusion protein also pulled down triadin itself (Fig. 5 B, right panel), implying that triadin can form a homo-oligomer. Unlike the HRC-triadin and calsequestrin-triadin interactions, the domains for triadin-triadin association appear to be dispersed throughout the Tri-c region. The Tri-c2 fusion protein was also used to test whether the interaction between HRC and triadin is Ca2+-sensitive, as shown in Fig.4. As expected, the interaction was strongest in the absence of Ca2+ and inhibited by increasing Ca2+concentration (Fig. 6,mid-panel). The triadin-triadin interaction, however, was rather Ca2+-resistant (right panel). It was shown that the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, triadin, and junctin form a stable quaternary structure at the inner surface of the junctional SR membrane (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In this protein complex, triadin and junctin are suggested to serve as a scaffold structure that brings the Ca2+-binding protein (calsequestrin) into the proximity of the Ca2+ channel (ryanodine receptor). Because of this structural feature, it is postulated that a high concentration of Ca2+ can be stored at the inner surface of the junctional SR membrane, and thus Ca2+ ions can be rapidly released through the ryanodine receptor upon activation of Ca2+release in muscle cells. In the present study, we have shown that HRC, another SR Ca2+-binding protein, directly binds to triadin, suggesting that HRC could be an additional component of this protein complex. HRC is a high capacity and low affinity Ca2+-binding protein (27Picello E. Damiani E. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) like calsequestrin. We do not yet understand the role of HRC, as the more abundant Ca2+-binding protein calsequestrin appears to serve its role as a Ca2+ store perfectly well. It was shown that calsequestrin plays a role in the regulation of the ryanodine receptor (28Ohkura M. Furukawa K. Fujimori H. Kuruma A. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Kuniyasu A. Nakayama H. Ohizumi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12987-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Groh S. Marty I. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Chapel A. Villaz M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12278-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in addition to the Ca2+ store function. Thus, HRC may perhaps also have a regulatory role. It remains to be seen whether this hypothesis is correct or whether HRC functions as a mere auxiliary Ca2+ store. The first evidence of an interaction between HRC and triadin was presented in an earlier study (22Kim K.C. Caswell A.H. Talvenheimo J.A. Brandt N.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9281-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this study, the authors observed by using affinity chromatography that a 95-kDa protein, now known as triadin, bound to the α1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor and to a novel 170-kDa protein. This 170-kDa protein was strongly stained with Stains-all, which specifically stains Ca2+-binding proteins (30Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because HRC shows similar electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE, and it is the only Stains-all stained SR protein in this molecular range, we reasoned that this 170-kDa protein is most likely HRC. Recently, Sacchetto et al. (24Sacchetto R. Turcato F. Damiani E. Margreth A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) performed filter binding assays with digoxigenin-labeled HRC and drew the conclusion that HRC binds to the short amino-terminal cytoplasmic region of triadin. This is inconsistent with our data and also with the earlier immunofluorescent and electron microscopic studies (3Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Lee E. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8260-8270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tryptic digestion and biotinylation experiments (2Suk J.Y. Kim Y.S. Park W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which suggested that HRC resides in the lumen of the SR. It is possible that denaturation of the protein samples during the filter binding assay may alter the specificity of protein-protein interactions and even generate false fortuitous interactions. Therefore, the results of filter binding assays should probably be interpreted with much caution. Our data show that HRC binds to the lumenal domain of triadin, which is highly enriched in charged amino acids. We further narrowed the interaction domain to the Tri-c2 region (205–260 residues) of triadin (Fig. 5). Notably, this region contains the KEKE motif that was shown to directly bind to calsequestrin (21Kobayashi Y.M. Alseikhan B.A. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17639-17646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). KEKE motifs are defined as regions of sequences greater than 12 residues in length, devoid of tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and proline, with more than 60% alternating lysine and glutamate/aspartate residues and lacking five positively or negatively charged residues in a row (17Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This motif was suggested to promote association between proteins (18Realini C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29664-29667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The subdomains Tri-b, Tri-c1, and Tri-c2 of triadin contain one, two, and two KEKE motifs, respectively (Fig. 5). Of these, the proximal KEKE motif of Tri-c2 is responsible for interaction with calsequestrin (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 5). Our data are not able to distinguish whether this proximal KEKE motif alone, the distal one, or both KEKE motifs are involved in the HRC-triadin interaction. HRC contains nine nearly identical tandem repeats of 29 residues, each consisting of a histidine-rich sequence HRHRGH, a stretch of 10 to 11 acidic amino acids, and a sequence containing two serines and one threonine in a negatively charged context (1Hofmann S.L. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18083-18090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that this domain directly binds to triadin and thus seems to represent a novel motif for protein-protein interactions. However, the mechanism underlying the interaction between HRC and triadin is unclear. It was suggested that KEKE motifs often stabilize protein-protein interactions by acting as polar zippers. It appears that the histidine-rich acidic repeats are unable to form such a zipper, therefore the HRC-triadin interaction may be facilitated by other mechanisms. Both the HRC-triadin interaction (this study) and the calsequestrin-triadin interaction (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 13Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) are Ca2+-sensitive, implying that a common mechanism underlies both of these interactions. Intriguingly, the triadin binding region of calsequestrin was localized to the carboxyl-terminal stretch of glutamate residues (31Shin D. Ma J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, the stretch of acidic amino acids in the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC may be essential for triadin binding of HRC. However, it should be noted that the other stretch of glutamate residues (721–733 residues) in HRC does not bind to triadin, thus implying that the mode of HRC-triadin and calsequestrin-triadin interactions seems more complex. We report here that triadin-triadin association occurs through the Tri-c (151–260 residues) region of triadin and this interaction is not affected by high Ca2+ concentration. Similarly, triadin was shown to associate with junctin in a Ca2+-resistant manner (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We propose that triadin and junctin constitute a possibly huge scaffold structure by associating with each other and themselves and that the integrity of this scaffold is not affected by changes in intralumenal Ca2+ concentrations. It seems possible that triadin-triadin or triadin-junctin interactions are facilitated by forming polar zippers that are in this case Ca2+-resistant. In conclusion, we have shown that HRC binds to triadin in a Ca2+-sensitive manner in SR lumen. This and other biochemical characteristics of HRC suggest that HRC may play a similar role to calsequestrin during excitation-contraction coupling. Further investigation will be required to address this issue including production of transgenic mice that overexpress HRC, which is currently in progress."

Using the technique of differential display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), we have identified a novel gene whose expression is increased during BMP-2-induced differentiation of the prechondroblastic cell line, MLB13MYC clone 17, to an osteoblastic phenotype. The 6.5-kilobase mRNA recognized by this ddPCR product is increased 10-fold by BMP-2 treatment of the MLB13MYC clone 17 cells. The mRNA recognized by this ddPCR product is also increased as MC3T3-E1 cells recapitulate the program of osteoblast differentiation during prolonged culture. The full-length transcript corresponding to this ddPCR product was cloned from a MLB13MYC clone 17 cell cDNA library. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated that this gene encodes a novel 126-kDa putative serine/threonine protein kinase containing a nuclear localization signal. The kinase domain, expressed in Escherichia coli, is capable of autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. The gene was, therefore, named BIKe(BMP-2-InducibleKinase). The BIKe nuclear localization signal is able to direct green fluorescent protein to the nucleus in transfected COS-7 cells. When stably expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells, BIKe significantly decreases alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin mRNA levels and retards mineral deposition relative to vector control. This novel kinase, therefore, is likely to play an important regulatory role in attenuating the program of osteoblast differentiation.

Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)1 are potent local factors that promote osteoblast differentiation during development as well as during bone remodeling (2Reddi A. Curr. Biol. 1992; 4: 850-855Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The molecular events downstream of BMP signaling that result in tissue-specific gene expression and skeletal development have only been partially elucidated. The binding of BMPs to their receptors leads to the assembly of a receptor complex in which the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. As a result, pathway-restricted SMADs are phosphorylated, leading to interactions with the common mediator SMAD, smad4 (3Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). This complex is then translocated to the nucleus, where it modulates transcription of target genes. BMP signaling can also interfere with the effects of other growth and differentiation factors. It has been demonstrated that BMP-2 treatment of mesangial cells prevents phosphorylation of a transcription factor, Elk1, in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. This effectively inhibits PDGF-induced Elk-1-mediated transcription, and blocks PDGF-induced transcription of c-fos, an Elk-1 target (4Ghosh-Choundhury G. Kim Y.-S. Simon M. Wozney J. Harris S. Gosh-Choundhury N. Abboud H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10897-10902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). BMP-7 has been shown to be a potent inducer of Cbfa1, a transcription factor belonging to the runt-domain gene family that, in turn, regulates the expression of several genes in the osteoblast (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Although Cbfa1 expression is necessary, it alone is not sufficient for osteoblast differentiation (6Lee M.-H. Javed A. Kim H.-J. Shin H.-I. Gutierrez S. Choi J.-Y. Rosen V. Stein J. van Wijnen A. Stein G.S. Lian J. Ryoo H.-M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). BMPs regulate the program of osteoblast differentiation at several levels. They play a critical role in the induction of several transcription factors that promote differentiation, such as Cbfa1 (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) and Dlx5 (7Miyama K. Yamada G. Yamamoto T. Takagi C. Miyado K. Sakai M. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Dev.

Development. 1996; 122: 3607-3616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMPs have also been shown to induce the expression of follistatin(10Fainsod A. Deissler K. Yelin R. Marom K. Epstein M. Pillemer G.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12141-12145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), both of which are BMP-binding proteins that serve to modulate the actions of locally synthesized BMPs. A third level at which BMPs modulate osteoblast differentiation is exemplified by the induction of Tob by BMP-2. This protein negatively regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation at the level of BMP signaling by interacting with receptor-regulated SMADs (13Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Tetsuo N. Yamamoto T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Like BMPs, growth factors may also play a dual role in regulating the program of osteoblast differentiation. Notable in this respect is the observation that fibroblast growth factor-1 stimulates the proliferation of immature osteoblasts, whereas it limits the number of osteoblasts undergoing terminal differentiation by promoting apoptosis in this latter cell population (14Mansukhani A. Bellosta P. Sahni M. Basilico C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Studies of cranial suture closure have provided critical in vivo correlates for the in vitro studies demonstrating the effects of growth and transcription factors on osteoblast differentiation. Haploinsufficiency of Cbfa1 delays intramembranous bone formation and ossification of cranial sutures, which is consistent with the role of this transcription factor in promoting osteoblast differentiation (15Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S. Lindhout D. Cole W.G. Henn W. Knoll J.H.M. Owen M.J. Mertelsmann R. Zabel B.U. Olsen B.R.

Luo W. Haworth I. Klisak I. Sparkes R. Warman M. Mulliken J. Cell. 1993; 75: 443-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Craniosynostosis is also seen in patients with mutations that increase the activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor-2, notably Aperts and Crouzons syndromes (18Anderson J. Burns H. Enriquez-Harris P. Wilkie A. Health J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 19Neilson K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the induction of Cbfa1 by BMPs has been shown to be a pivotal event in endochondral bone formation, the identification of genes induced prior to and after Cbfa1 will be essential to elucidate other factors, the interaction of which is required for normal skeletal differentiation. These factors are likely to play an important role in skeletal homeostasis postnatally as well. Fracture healing models have demonstrated that BMPs play a key role in skeletal remodeling, and studies in transgenic mice have suggested an important role for Cbfa1 in skeletal homeostasis (20Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, it is likely that other factors involved in osteoblast differentiation will play a pivotal role in the maintenance of skeletal homeostasis in the maturing and aging skeleton. We, therefore, undertook studies to identify novel genes that are induced during the cascade of molecular events that occur as a cell acquires the markers of a mature osteoblast, using an in vitro cellular model. We have identified a novel protein kinase containing a nuclear localization signal and a glutamine-rich region characteristic of many transcription factors. When stably expressed, this kinase markedly attenuates the program of osteoblast differentiation recapitulated during prolonged culture of MC3T3-E1 cells. The MLB13MYC clone 17 cells and rhBMP-2 were kindly provided by Dr. Vicki Rosen (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At confluence, cells were treated with 200 ng/ml rhBMP-2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, adding fresh medium and rhBMP-2 daily as described previously (21Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies R.S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Conditionally immortalized murine bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes (Dr. F. R. Bringhurst, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were isolated and cultured as reported previously (22Divieti P. Lanske B. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Liu B. Guo J. Lanske B. Divieti P. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1952-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary calvarial osteoblasts form 18.5-days post-coital embryos were cultured as described previously (22Divieti P. Lanske B. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in α-minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments directed at addressing the role of BIKe (BMP-2-InducibleKinase) on mineralization, medium was supplemented with ascorbic acid and β-glycerol phosphate (24Quarles L.D. Wenstrup R. Castillo S. Drezner M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3144-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Total RNA was isolated from parallel cultures of MLB13MYC clone 17 cells, untreated, and treated with 200 ng/ml rhBMP-2 for 72 h using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After treating with RNase-free DNaseI to eliminate contaminating chromosomal DNA (MessageClean, GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN), differential display PCR was performed using the RNAimage system (GenHunter Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the presence of [α33P]dATP. The radioactive products were resolved by electrophoresis on a denaturing urea 6% polyacrylamide gel. After overnight autoradiography, differentially expressed bands were identified by comparison of the products obtained using RNA from untreated and rhBMP-2-treated cells. Products found to be reproducibly differentially expressed were reamplified and subcloned into pGEM easy-T (Promega, Norwalk, CT). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells or mouse tissues using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Electrophoresis of 10 μg of total RNA was performed in formaldehyde-agarose gels. The RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Biotrans ICN, Aurora, OH) by capillary action. Hybridization was performed with QuikHyb Solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). To confirm equal loading of RNA, the membranes were also hybridized either with an antisense oligonucleotide probe that recognizes the 18S rRNA subunit or with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase random primed probe. Densitometric analysis was performed by scanning autoradiographs with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet ADF scanner and determining image density with Scion Image. After 72 h of treatment with rhBMP-2 as described above, MLB13MYC clone 17 cell mRNA was isolated using a Fast-Track mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mRNA was reverse-transcribed using an (dT)-oligomer primer with 5′ sequences that introduced an XhoI site at the 3′ end of the cDNA after second strand synthesis (Lambda ZapII XR Library Construction kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following blunt-ending of the cDNA, ligating, and phosphorylation of EcoRI adapters, the cDNA population was digested with XhoI. Size fractionation was performed on a Sepharose CL-2B column. Fractions containing cDNAs greater than 1 kilobase pairs in length were pooled and ligated into the Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). Following ligation, the phage were packaged with Gigapak Gold Plus (Stratagene). Primary screening of 500,000 plaques using the BIKe ddPCR product as a probe identified seven potential positives. Tertiary and quaternary screening resulted in plaque purification of six. Following in vivo excision of the insert and pBluescript from the phage, the four longest positive clones were characterized, and both strands were sequenced. Sequence alignments were performed using SeqMan. DNA and protein homology searches were performed using BLAST (NCBI). Peptide motifs were identified using ExPASY. A fusion protein was produced by cloning the kinase domain of BIKe, base pairs 239–1330 (amino acids 1–364) in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by expression in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein (GST-BIKeKD) was purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Kinase activity was determined by incubating GST-BIKeKD with myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed. The 358-base pair fragment from 2952 to 3310 of BIKe (BIKeNLS) that contains the nuclear localization signal was amplified by PCR and cloned in frame with the C terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was performed by electroporation. Fluorescence was visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510 Confocal microscope, Carl Zeiss). Digital image analyses were performed using Zeiss KS400 Image Analysis software. Staining with Hoescht 2495 dye was performed to identify nuclei. The cDNA sequences encoding amino acids 1–1087 of BIKe were inserted downstream of the CMV promoter in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1/BIKe. MC3T3-E1 cells were stably transfected (using calcium phosphate precipitation) with pcDNA3.1/BIKe or pcDNA3.1 without cDNA insert (EV, empty vector). Pools of stably transfected clones were obtained by selection with 300 μg/ml G418. After 14 days of G418 selection, pools of 18 G418-resistant clones were obtained from the pcDNA3.1/BIKe (MC3T3-E1-BIKe) and empty vector (MC3T3-E1-EV) transfected cells. For all subsequent analyses, pools of clones between passages 2 and 5 were used. MC3T3-E1-BIKe and MC3T3-E1-EV pooled clones were plated at a density of 5 × 103cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 3 to 28 days. At each time point, cell lysates were incubated with assay buffer containing 1.5 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propyl alcohol for 30 min at 37 °C using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Alkaline phosphatase activity was quantitated by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol by absorbance at 405 nm. MC3T3-E1-BIKe and MC3T3-E1-EV pooled clones were plated at a density of 5 × 103cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 3 to 36 days. The formation of mineralized matrix nodules was determined by alizarin red-S staining (25Gori F. Thomas T. Hicok K. Spelberg T. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, calcium accumulation in the matrix was quantitated by solubilizing the deposited calcium with 0.6 n HCl overnight at room temperature. The samples and a standard curve of calcium carbonate were reacted with methylthymol blue and measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm (26Gindler E. King J. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1972; 58: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student’s paired t test was used to evaluate differences between MC3T3-E1-EV and MC3T3-E1-BIKe pools at each time point. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Confluent MLB13MYC clone 17 cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with 200 ng/ml rhBMP-2 every 24 h for 72 h. This concentration and duration of treatment is sufficient for these cells to acquire markers of osteoblast differentiation, including expression of the osteocalcin gene (21Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies R.S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RNA isolated from cells, treated with rhBMP-2 for 72 h, or left untreated was used for differential display PCR. After overnight autoradiography, several bands representing differentially expressed mRNAs were identified. A prominently up-regulated band (Fig. 1 A) was chosen for further characterization. This band was excised from the gel and used as a probe for Northern blotting analyses following reamplification. The mRNA encoded by the ddPCR product was ∼7 kilobases in size, barely detectable in untreated MLBMYC clone 17 cells and markedly increased following 72 h of rhBMP-2 treatment (Fig. 1 B). The peak level of expression of this transcript post-BMP-2 treatment was later than that observed for Cbfa1 in this cell line (peak level at 48 h, data not shown) and earlier than induction of osteocalcin (first detected at 48 h post-treatment (Ref. 21Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies R.S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and data not shown). To investigate whether the expression of this transcript was specific to bone or was expressed in other mouse tissues, multitissue Northern blotting analysis was performed. The mRNA corresponding to this ddPCR product was expressed in spleen, kidney, lung, brain, heart, diaphragm, and calvaria but not in liver (data not shown). The transcript was also expressed in conditionally immortalized osteocytes (C59), osteoblasts (F10), and marrow stromal cells (MS1) as well as in primary osteoblasts (POB) isolated from 18.5-days post-coital mouse embryos (Fig. 1 C). Since the original 322-base pair sequence of the ddPCR product was not present in the GenBankTM data base, a cDNA library was constructed using mRNA isolated from rhBMP-2-treated MLBMYC clone 17 cells and screened to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence. Six positive phage were isolated following which the cDNA inserts and pBluescript were excised using ExAssit helper phage. The four clones containing the longest cDNA inserts were further characterized. Sequence analysis was obtained from both strands of at least two independent cDNA inserts, and alignment was performed using SeqMan. The 6.5-kilobase pair cDNA has an open reading frame of 1138 amino acids (Fig. 2) with a predicted molecular size of 126 kDa. Because the N-terminal region contains a putative serine/threonine kinase domain, the novel gene was named BIKe. Protein sequence analysis (PROSITE, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) predicts a nuclear location for BIKe based on the bipartite nuclear localization signal in the C-terminal region of the peptide (underlined). Analysis of the BIKe protein also reveals a glutamine-rich region, analogous to that found in several transcription factors (27Smith R. Johnson A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28Das D. Scovell W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32597-32605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and thought to be important for protein-protein interactions (29Michelitsch M. Weissman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11910-11915Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A search of the BLAST protein data base (NCBI) identified significant homology between BIKe and partial human cDNA clones of unknown function. Furthermore, the kinase domain of BIKe was evolutionarily conserved with significant homology to Xenopus and Drosophila kinases (U58205 andAF197910). Drosophila Numb-associated kinase was identified as the most homologous protein of known function. However, the absence of significant homology between the nonkinase domains of BIKe and Numb-associated kinase suggests that BIKe is unlikely to be a vertebrate homolog of this Drosophila kinase. To demonstrate that the BIKe kinase domain was functional, in vitro kinase assays were performed. A fusion protein of GST and the BIKe kinase domain (GST-BIKeKD) was expressed in E. coliand purified. Following incubation of GST-BIKeKD with myelin basic protein and [γ32P]ATP, labeled proteins corresponding to GST-BIKeKD and myelin basic protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography of the gel demonstrated the ability of BIKe to autophosphorylate (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 4; GST-BIKeKD) as well as to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 2; MBP), a general protein kinase substrate. A GST fusion protein encoding a transcription factor (30Martin K. Cooper W. Metcalfe J. Kemp P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was unable to phosphorylate itself or myelin basic protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). After thrombin cleavage to remove GST, the BIKeKD retained its ability to autophosphorylate; however, heat inactivation of GST-BIKeKD prevented phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). To evaluate the function of the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminal region of BIKe, the cDNA sequences encoding amino acids 906–1025 were inserted in frame to that encoding GFP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the NLS of BIKe can direct GFP expression (left upper panel) to the nucleus of COS-7 cells (visualized with Hoescht dye in the right upper panel), whereas GFP expressed without the BIKeNLS remains diffuse (Fig. 4 A, left upper panel). To identify a role for this novel kinase in osteoblast differentiation, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1/BIKe Fig. 5 (panels B and C, lane B) or pcDNA3.1 lacking insert (lane EV). This cell line was chosen because when plated at low density, the MC3T3-E1 cells have features of a preosteoblastic cell. When left in culture for approximately a month, these cells acquire characteristics of a fully differentiated osteoblast without the addition of exogenous differentiating agents such as BMPs. It is also notable that the endogenous mRNA encoding BIKe in this cell line increases as the program of osteoblast differentiation is recapitulated with prolonged culture with peak levels seen at 20 days in culture (Fig. 5, panel A). Several classical markers of osteoblast differentiation were evaluated in the MC3T3-E1-BIKe and MC3T3-E1-EV clones. Although no change was observed in the expression of type I collagen (not shown) or CbfaI (Fig. 5, panel B) in the MC3T3-E1-BIKe pooled clones relative to the MC3T3-E1-EV pools, there was attenuation in the expression of osteocalcin mRNA in the MC3T3-E1-BIKe pooled clones (Fig. 5, panel C), including a decrease in the peak level of expression at 20 days in culture, when compared with the MC3T3-E1-EV pooled clones. The acquisition of alkaline phosphatase activity was also dramatically impaired in the MC3T3-E1-BIKe clones relative to the MC3T3-E1-EV clones (Fig. 6). The end point of osteoblast differentiation is considered to be the formation of a mineralized matrix. The MC3T3-E1-BIKe clones demonstrated a dramatic impairment in mineral deposition into the culture, as assessed by alizarin red-S staining (not shown) and quantitation of calcium deposited into the matrix by methylthymol blue analysis (26Gindler E. King J. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1972; 58: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7).Figure 6Assessment of alkaline phosphatase activity in pooled clones.

Investigations aimed at identifying BMP-regulated genes have been performed in various cellular systems. Studies directed at identifying immediate early genes regulated by BMPs in embryonic stem cells have demonstrated that several regulators of skeletal development are regulated by BMP-4 in these cells. Notably, the homeobox genes, Msx-1 and Msx-2, are rapidly induced, as is JunB (31Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V. Heymer J. Ruther U. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19838-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The negative regulators of helix-loop-helix transcription factors,Id1, Id2, and Id3, were also found to be BMP-responsive in embryonic stem cells (31Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V. Heymer J. Ruther U. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19838-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In contrast to these investigations, our studies were biased toward identification of distal actions of BMP-2 because the initial ddPCR reaction was performed using RNA isolated from cells treated with BMP-2 for 72 h. The cell line used for our studies was a prechondroblastic cell line that responds to BMP-2 with an increase in Cbfa1 mRNA levels, similar to that seen in BMP-2-treated immortalized articular and primary costal chondrocyte cultures (32Takazawa Y. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Kurosawa H. Ito Y. Noda M. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and pluripotential mesenchymal cells (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). During prolonged treatment with BMP-2, the MLB13MYC clone 17 cell line loses markers of a prechondroblast and acquires markers characteristic of an osteoblast (21Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies R.S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mRNA encoding the novel kinase we identified increases as the osteoblast differentiation program is recapitulated during prolonged culture of MC3T3-E1 cells, supporting the hypothesis that its induction by BMP-2 in the MLB13MYC clone 17 cells parallels its expression during osteoblast differentiation. However, BIKe attenuates rather than promotes the osteoblast differentiation program of the MC3T3-E1 cells, most dramatically affecting the level of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin mRNA as well as inhibiting mineral deposition into the cultures. Several studies of osteoblast differentiation have focused on factors that promote the differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal stromal cells into osteoblasts. It has been shown that Cbfa 1 is required for the development of an osseous skeleton and regulates the expression of many osteoblast genes (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

However, stable transfection of BIKe did not change the pattern of Cbfa1 expression in the MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting that the mechanism of BIKe action is independent of or downstream to Cbfa1. Little is known about the factors that prevent or retard the commitment of pluripotential mesenchymal stromal cells to the osteoblast lineage; however, the mechanisms by which these cells are diverted into alternative pathways has largely been clarified. It has been demonstrated that the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ plays a pivotal role in directing these stromal cells to the adipocyte lineage (34Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) and that several helix-loop-helix transcription factors are involved in the differentiation of these cells along the myogenic pathway (35Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Our studies, however, were performed in cells that had already acquired markers of chondroblasts (the MLB13MYC clone 17 cells are prechondroblastic) or osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cells). These studies were not directed at addressing the effect of BIKe on the commitment of stromal cells to the osteoblast versus adipocyte or myocyte pathway; however, our finding that BIKe is expressed in marrow stromal cells does not exclude this possibility. The data presented here are consistent with BIKe playing a role in attenuating differentiation of and mineral deposition by the maturing osteoblast. The induction of BIKe during osteoblast differentiation may serve as a brake to control the rate of osteoblast differentiation, which is critical for normal skeletal development and morphogenesis. Negative regulation almost certainly plays a key role in skeletal development. The program of osteoblast differentiation involves an early proliferative phase not associated with the expression of markers of terminal differentiation or mineralized matrix formation (36Malaval L. Modrowski D. Gupta A. Aubin J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 555-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 37Malaval L. Liu F. Roche P. Aubin J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 38Pockwinse S. Stein J. Lian J. Stein G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 244-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the laying down of mineralized matrix is considered to be the terminal phase of osteoblast differentiation, this is not the major in vivo role of the lining osteoblasts or osteocytes. Therefore, factors that seem to attenuate osteoblast differentiation in traditional assays, such as the MC3T3-E1 and rat calvarial cells, may actually play a role in the transition from an active matrix-synthesizing osteoblast to a cell that serves a different function in vivo. Notable in this respect is the observation that conditionally immortalized osteocytes express the BIKe transcript. The kinase activity, nuclear localization signal, and glutamine-rich domain of BIKe suggest potential molecular mechanisms by which this novel protein influences osteoblast differentiation. Phosphorylation is a critical posttranslational modification that regulates the activity of several proteins involved in signal transduction, cellular proliferation, and gene transcription. The presence of a nuclear localization signal and of a glutamine-rich region, often found in transcription factors, raises the interesting question as to whether BIKe acts a transcription factor. Alternatively, the nuclear localization of this protein could reflect its role as a kinase involved in phosphorylation of histones and/or transcription factors with protein-protein interactions mediated by the glutamine-rich region. In addition to being present in numerous transcription factors, glutamine-rich regions have a high propensity to form self-propagating amyloid fibrils (29Michelitsch M. Weissman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11910-11915Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). They are also hot spots for the trinucleotide repeat expansions involved in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including Huntington's disease, Kennedy's disease, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. Currently, however, there are no diseases linked to chromosome 4q21 (the locus for the human homolog of BIKe, NCBI) to suggest that BIKe is involved in the pathogenesis of human disease. The identification of potential BIKe substrates and characterization of its other functional domains will serve to define the molecular mechanism by which this novel kinase modulates the program of osteoblast differentiation.

The 180-kDa (p180) and 68-kDa (p68) subunits of the human four-subunit enzyme are phosphorylated by Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cyclin A-Cdk2 physically interacts with pol-prim and phosphorylates N-terminal amino acids of the p180 and the p68 subunits, leading to an inhibition of pol-prim in initiating cell-free SV40 DNA replication. Mutation of conserved putative Cdk phosphorylation sites in the N terminus of human p180 and p68 reduced their phosphorylation by Cyclin A-Cdk2 in vitro. In contrast to wild-type pol-prim these mutants were no longer inhibited by Cyclin A-Cdk2 in the initiation of viral DNA replication. Importantly, rather than inhibiting it, Cyclin A-Cdk2 stimulated the initiation activity of pol-prim containing a triple N-terminal alanine mutant of the p180 subunit. Together these results suggest that Cyclin A-Cdk2 executes both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the activity of pol-prim in initiating DNA replication.

Cyclin E-Cdk2 activity peaks in late G1, whereas Cyclin A-Cdk2 activity appears later with the onset of DNA synthesis and then rises throughout S phase.

Functional studies with purified recombinant human pol-prim showed that its phosphorylation by Cyclin A-Cdk2 and Cyclin A-Cdk1 in vitrostrongly inhibited its ability to initiate cell-free DNA replication on simian virus 40 (SV40) origin DNA, whereas on single-stranded DNA templates the primase and DNA polymerase activities were hardly affected (18Voitenleitner C.

Duplication of the small genome of the SV40 depends on host replication factors and has led to a useful model system to study the molecular mechanism of eukaryotic cellular DNA replication. By using the cell-free SV40 system, which resembles the DNA replication of host chromosomes, a model for the initiation and elongation steps during eukaryotic DNA replication has been established (for reviews see Refs.21Hübscher U.

Our findings show that Cyclin A-Cdk2 differentially controls SV40 origin-dependent initiation activity of pol-prim. Pol-prim is maximally active when its p68 subunit is phosphorylated by Cyclin A-Cdk2 and the N terminus of p180 remains unmodified. Modification of both large subunits by Cyclin A-Cdk2 abolishes the initiation of leading strand DNA synthesis by pol-prim.

Expression of GST-suc1 fusion protein in Escherichia coli (containing pGEX2T-suc1) was induced by addition of 1 mmisoprooyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA595 of 1.0 in 500 ml LB. After 4 h at 37 °C the bacteria were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min) and washed twice with 20 ml STE (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA).

The initiation products were then electrophoretically separated and visualized by a PhosphorImager, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Shortly before using the different pol-prim preparations in the SV40 reaction their primase activities were assayed in on single-stranded poly(dT) to use equal priming activities. Since earlier reports suggested a modification of human pol-prim by Cdks (17Nasheuer H.P. Moore A. Wahl A.F. Wang T.S. J. Biol.

Using the monoclonal antibody SJK237–71 against the human p180 subunit we could precipitate Cyclin A-Cdk2 bound to pol-prim (Fig. 1,lane 5). However, when Cyclin A-Cdk2 was expressed without pol-prim and incubated with SJK237–71 no Cdk complex was eluted (lane 6). The same interactions were determined with Cyclin E-Cdk2, Cyclin A-Cdk1, and Cyclin B-Cdk1 (data not shown). Cdks bind to and phosphorylate heterotetrameric pol-prim in vitro (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). The p180 subunit of pol-prim contains several potential Cdk recognition sites, and to identify the parts of the p180 subunit that is phosphorylated by Cyclin A-Cdk2 overlapping p180-GST fusion proteins (49Dornreiter I. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 809-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were phosphorylated with purified Cyclin A-Cdk2 in vitro (Fig. 2B). This kinase modified the N-terminal p180 GST fusion protein 1α (Fig.2B, lane 4) but did not modify other regions of p180 or GST itself (lanes 5–8; data not shown). To narrow down the phosphorylation region the fusion protein 1α was split into smaller polypeptides A, B, and C (Fig. 2B). Only the peptides B and C, which contain the conserved residues Thr-174, Ser-209, and Thr-219, were modified (Fig. 2B,lanes 2, 3). These data indicate that Cyclin A-Cdk2 preferentially phosphorylates the N terminus of the p180 subunit. Since pol-prim associates with PP2A in vivo (16Dehde S. Rohaldy G. Schub O. Nasheuer H.P. Bohn W. Chemnitz J. Deppert W. Dornreiter I. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we tested whether PP2A could dephosphorylate the phosphorylated p180 GST fusion proteins 1α, B, and C in vitro. The radioactive label of these proteins was readily removed by PP2A (Fig. 2C,lanes 2, 4, 6). Furthermore, PP2A removed phosphate groups from the p68 subunit and coexpression of the PP2A core (an active enzyme complex consisting of the structural and catalytic subunits A and C, respectively) with pol-prim and Cyclin A-Cdk2 eliminated the phosphorylation-induced shift of the p68 subunit in baculovirus-infected cells (Fig. 2D, lane 3; Ref. 16Dehde S. Rohaldy G. Schub O. Nasheuer H.P. Bohn W. Chemnitz J. Deppert W. Dornreiter I. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PP2A reverses the phosphorylation of the p180 and the p68 subunits by Cyclin A-dependent kinases. To reveal the contribution of single amino acids of the p180 subunit in the Cyclin A-Cdk2-mediated regulation of cell-free SV40 DNA initiation, the three conserved putative Cdk phosphorylation sites Thr-174, Ser-209, and Thr-219 (Fig. 2A) were changed either alone or in combination to alanine to yield the following mutant p180 subunits: T174A, S209A, S209A/T219A (p180–2×A) and T174A/S209A/T219A (p180–3×A). These mutants were coexpressed with the three smaller wild-type (wt) pol-prim subunits. Each mutant complex was coexpressed with or without Cyclin A-Cdk2 and purified to near homogeneity. All pol-prim complexes consisted of four subunits (Fig.3A; data not shown) and had high specific primase and DNA polymerase activities comparable with those of the wt recombinant enzyme (data not shown), proving that all mutant pol-prim complexes are fully active in their basic replication functions. The p180 subunit of pol-prim is sensitive to proteolysis especially its N terminus (50His K. Copeland W. Wang T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6231-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since we modified p180 by the alanine mutations we wondered whether this would destabilize the mutant proteins. However, we did not detect more than average degradation of the purified p180 mutants either by Coomassie-stained protein gels (Fig. 3A) or in Western blotting (data not shown). In addition, their specific enzyme activities were not changed in comparison to wt pol-prim. Therefore, we assume that the mutations did not dramatically change the three-dimensional structure of the polypeptide. Phosphopeptide maps of the p180 and p68 subunits phosphorylated by Cdks in vitro are similar to those ofin vivo-phosphorylated subunits (17Nasheuer H.P. Moore A. Wahl A.F. Wang T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7893-7903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Voitenleitner C. Rehfuess C. Hilmes M. O'Rear L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Ott R. Nasheuer H.P. Fanning E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 646-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutated phosphorylation sites of the p180 subunit are targets of Cyclin A-Cdk2, purified wt pol-prim and pol-prim complexes with a mutated p180 subunit were phosphorylated by Cyclin A-Cdk2. The single mutations, T174A and S209A, reduced the incorporation of radioactive phosphate to about 60% of the level of wt p180 (Fig.3B, black columns 2 and 3). The double alanine mutants (p180–2×A) and triple alanine mutants (p180–3×A) were phosphorylated only to about 30 and 5%, respectively, of the level of wt p180 (Fig. 3B, black columns 4 and5). In agreement with earlier results Cyclin A-Cdk2 phosphorylated the p68 subunit of wt pol-prim to a 2-fold higher level than wt p180 (Fig. 3B; compare gray andblack column 1; Ref. 18Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pol-prim complexes by Cyclin A-Cdk2 diminishes its origin-dependent initiation activity (18Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,19Voitenleitner C. Rehfuess C. Hilmes M. O'Rear L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Ott R. Nasheuer H.P. Fanning E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 646-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether phosphatases can reverse this inhibition we coexpressed pol-prim with Cyclin A-Cdk2 and PP2A core and determined the SV40 initiation activity of the purified enzyme complex (Fig.4A). Pol-prim coexpressed with PP2A core had a reduced initiation activity on DNA containing an SV40 origin (Fig. 4A, compare column 1 and2), whereas the initiation activity of Cyclin A-Cdk2-phosphorylated enzyme complex was nearly completely abrogated (Fig. 4A, column 3). Coexpression of pol-prim with Cyclin A-Cdk2 and PP2A core did not only abolish the phosphorylation-induced shift of p68 (Fig. 2D) but enabled pol-prim to synthesize primers in the SV40 origin of replication (Fig.4A, column 4) with a similar activity as the untreated enzyme (Fig. 4A, column 1). To investigate whether the mutant pol-prim complexes are still inhibited by Cyclin A-Cdk2 in initiating cell-free SV40 DNA replication (Fig. 4A, 18), SV40 initiation assays were performed with our pol-prim mutants modified by Cyclin A-Cdk2 and pol-prim expressed without this kinase, and then the initiation products were quantified (Fig. 4B). The mutant enzyme complexes containing the p180-T174A, p180-S209A, or p180–2×A subunits, which were not coexpressed with Cyclin A-Cdk2, were less active in origin-dependent initiation than wt pol-prim (Fig.4B, compare column 1 with columns 3, 5, and 7). In contrast to the inhibition seen with wt pol-prim, C"

Wong Y.H. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Activation of μ-opioid receptors leads to the regulation of several intracellular effectors including the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (2Kazmi S.M. Mishra R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 132: 109-118Google Scholar), the closing of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (3Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar), and the activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels (4Henry D.J. Grandy D.K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). All of these events are mediated by pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-proteins. Although the analgesic effect of clinically relevant opioids is mediated by the μ-opioid receptor, this receptor also appears to be critically involved in mediating the tolerance and dependence that occurs upon the chronic use of opioids (5Mattes H.W.D. Maladonado R. Simonin F. Valverde O. Slowe S. Kitchen J. Befort K. Kieffer B.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Although the development of opioid tolerance and dependence has been studied extensively, the exact mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unknown. Many GPCRs exhibit constitutive activity, producing spontaneous regulation of effectors in the absence of activation by agonists (6Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samma P. Costa T. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Ligands that can reduce or abolish this spontaneous, agonist-independent activity are termed inverse agonists. Inverse agonists have been observed for several GPCRs including 5-HT2c, α2-adrenergic, β2-adrenergic, D2-dopaminergic, and retinoic acid receptors (7Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Definitive evidence for constitutive activity of δ-opioid receptors has also been well established by use of the inverse agonist ICI-174,864 (8Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 9Mullaney I. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Chiu T.T. Yung L.Y.

In contrast, demonstration of constitutively active μ-opioid receptors has been less conclusive, perhaps because of the lack of a fully efficacious inverse agonist. The most convincing evidence for such spontaneous, agonist-independent activity to date is the ability of putative inverse agonists to decrease basal G-protein activity in membrane preparations containing relatively high densities of μ-opioid receptors (13Burford N.T. Wang D. Sadee W. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang D. Christopher R.S. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether constitutive activation of μ-opioid receptors in isolated membrane preparations containing unusually high receptor densities has any physiological relevance in intact cells. Such evidence might be provided by employing a cellular model expressing physiological levels of μ-opioid receptors and demonstration of the effector(s) regulated by constitutively activated receptors and G-proteins. Interestingly, it has also recently been reported that chronic treatment with morphine increases basal [35S]GTPγS binding in HEK 293 cells transfected with μ-opioid receptors (14Wang D. Christopher R.S. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that prolonged exposure of GH3 cells expressing μ-opioid receptors (GH3MOR) to either of the agonists morphine or [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) converts the antagonists naloxone and β-chlornaltrexamine into inverse agonists. This was indicated by production of a concentration-dependent inhibition of basal [35S]GTPγS binding by these ligands (15Liu J.G. Prather P.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, chronic opioid treatment may produce and/or enhance constitutive activation of μ-opioid receptors, and this process may play a role in the development of tolerance and/or dependence that occurs upon their prolonged use. It is well established that certain ligands can bind irreversibly to (i.e. alkylate) μ-opioid receptors (16Broadbear J.H. Sumpter T.L. Burke T.F. Husbands S.M. Lewis J.W. Woods J.H. Traynor J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 933-940PubMed Google Scholar). Once alkylated, receptors are no longer able to bind agonist (or antagonist) and thus cannot be activated subsequently. Consequently, this technique has been used selectively to reduce the number of available μ-opioid receptors and monitor the effect on effector coupling (17Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). According to the two-state receptor model, to account for constitutive activity of certain GPCRs, it has been postulated that a high density of receptors would result in a greater degree of constitutive activity (18Leff P. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This is due to a greater chance of encounter of a receptor in the active conformation with a G-protein. Therefore, it is possible that irreversible binding by specific ligands to constitutively active μ-opioid receptors might produce an inactive conformation of the receptor and thereby constrain spontaneous activity. If true, this technique might be utilized to demonstrate constitutive activity of GPCRs when no inverse agonists are available. β-Funaltrexamine (β-FNA) is a well characterized antagonist that selectively and irreversibly binds to μ-opioid receptors (19Liu-Chen L.Y. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 321-329PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mjanger E. Yaksh T.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 258: 544-550PubMed Google Scholar). GH3MOR cells express a relatively moderate physiological density of μ-opioid receptors (0.39 pmol/mg) (3Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar) and exhibit higher basal G-protein activity and lower basal cAMP levels that wild-type GH3 cells. These observations suggest the potential presence of constitutively active μ-opioid receptors. However, our previous study failed to detect constitutive activity in opioid naive GH3MOR cells after screening several ligands for potential inverse agonist activity (15Liu J.G. Prather P.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether alkylation of μ-opioid receptors by β-FNA would reveal constitutive activity in intact GH3MOR cells. This was accomplished by reducing available μ-opioid receptor number in a concentration-dependent manner using β-FNA pretreatment. Following the removal of unbound β-FNA by extensive washing, constitutive activity was assessed by correlating reductions in μ-opioid receptor density with basal G-protein activation and adenylyl cyclase activity. We report that constitutively active μ-opioid receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in intact cells and activate individual G-proteins differently than those stimulated by the agonist DAMGO. Furthermore, because GH3MOR cells express physiologically relevant levels of μ-opioid receptors, it is likely that constitutive activation of μ-opioid receptors is not limited to artificially transfected systems, but rather it may serve important functions in the brain. GH3 (CCL 82.1) or stably transfected GH3MOR (3Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/ml Geneticin (for GH3MOR cells). Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. For receptor and GTPγS binding experiments, cells from separate T175 flasks were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing various concentrations of β-FNA (0.1–100 nm). Following incubation at 37 °C for 45 min in an orbital shaker (150 rpm), cells were washed three times with 50 ml of warmed phosphate-buffered saline to remove residual β-FNA, and cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C. For adenylyl cyclase assays, cells were cultured in 24-well plates. On the day of the assay, the medium was replaced with a warmed incubation mixture containing [8-3H]adenine (26 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and different concentrations of β-FNA for 45 min. The incubation mixture was removed, cells were washed three times with 1.5 ml of warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove residual β-FNA, and the assay was performed. In some cases, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml PTX for 24 h. Membrane preparation and receptor binding experiments were conducted as described previously (15Liu J.G. Prather P.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 200 μg of membrane protein/sample were incubated with 1 nm [3H]diprenorphine (36 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 10 mm MgCl2 at room temperature for 90 min. Nonspecific binding was defined by the inclusion of 10 μmnaloxone. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration, and bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). [35S]GTPγS binding was performed as detailed elsewhere (15Liu J.G. Prather P.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Membranes (50 μg/sample) were incubated with [35S]GTPγS (0.1 nm) in a binding buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2 100 mm KCl or NaCl, and 10 μm GDP at 30 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of nonradioactive GTPγS (10 μm). The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration, and bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The effect of the absence or presence of opioids on the conversion of [3H]adenine-labeled ATP pools to cAMP in whole, intact cells was measured as described previously (21Prather P.L. Song L. Piros E.T. Law P.Y. Hales T.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured until ∼80% confluent. On the day of the assay, the medium was removed and replaced with a warmed (37 °C) incubation mixture containing [3H]adenine and β-FNA for 45 min (for all ingredients see previous “β-FNA Pretreatment”). After incubation and extensive washing to remove residual β-FNA, the mixture was replaced with an ice-cold assay mixture (Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer containing 500 μm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and the absence or presence of the opioid ligand to be tested). Plates were then floated on a water bath at 37 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2.2 n HCl. cAMP was separated using Alumina column chromatography, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Importantly, in all assays presented, the effect of treatments on basal adenylyl cyclase activity was examined (i.e. in the absence of any exogenous stimulator of adenylyl cyclase). The photoaffinity labeling of Gα-subunits with AA-[32P]GTP was performed as detailed elsewhere (21Prather P.L. Song L. Piros E.T. Law P.Y. Hales T.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar, 22Prather P.L. McGinn T.M. Erickson L.J. Evans C.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol.

Claude P.A. Liu-Chen L.Y. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Brain. Res. 1995; 29: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Membranes (50 μg/sample) were incubated in the presence or absence of the drugs to be tested for 6 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of buffer I (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 10 or 50 μm GDP). GDP (50 or 10 μm) was included in buffer I to reduce basal G-protein labeling to allow optimal measurement of agonist stimulated or constitutive activation, respectively. After incubation, AA-[32P]GTP (1 μCi/sample) was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 6 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by placing samples on ice, and membranes were then collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Following resuspension in 100 μl of buffer II (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol), samples were irradiated at 4 °C with 240 mJ from an ultraviolet lamp (254 nm, 150 w) at a distance of 15 cm. Membranes were collected by centrifugation as before, resuspended in electrophoresis loading buffer, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 10% acrylamide and 6 m urea. AA-[32P]GTP labeled Gα-subunits were visualized autoradiographically by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445 (Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified by densitometry using the NIH Image software program (version 1.56). To determine the amount of relative radioactivity incorporated by individual Gα-subunits (i.e. optical density units), the area of each band was traced and multiplied by its mean optical density. In instances where photoaffinity labeling of total G-proteins was determined, the optical density units for all individual Gα-subunits from a single sample were summed. Unless otherwise stated, data reported represent the mean ± the standard error of at least three separate experiments that were each performed in triplicate. The ED50 and Emax values were obtained from full dose-response curves, subjected to sigmoidal curve fitting. For statistical comparisons involving three or more groups, differences between means were determined by a one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons using Dunnett's or Tukey's tests. When only two groups were compared, differences between the means were determined by the nonpaired Student's t test. The basal level of [35S]GTPγS binding was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in membranes prepared from GH3MOR (50.3 fmol/mg) relative to wild-type GH3 cells (30.3 fmol/mg) (Fig.1). Replacement of Na+ with K+ ions in the assay buffer led to a further increase in basal [35S]GTPγS binding in both GH3 and GH3MOR cells lines to 42.8 and 74.6 fmol/mg, respectively. Pretreatment with 100 ng/ml PTX (24 h) abolished the enhanced basal [35S]GTPγS binding produced by KCl in both cell lines. These results indicated the presence of substantial spontaneous activity of receptors coupled to Gi/Goα proteins in GH3MOR, relative to wild-type GH3 cells. Because greater constitutive activity was observed in the presence of K+ ions, all subsequent [35S]GTPγS binding experiments included KCl instead of NaCl in the assay buffer. The ability of β-FNA to alkylate μ-opioid receptors in GH3MOR cells was examined first. Saturation binding with the opioid antagonist [3H]diprenorphine previously showed that GH3MOR cells express a moderate density of μ-opioid receptors of 0.39 pmol/mg (3Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with increasing amounts of β-FNA (0.1–100 nm; 37 °C for 45 min) followed by complete drug washout resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of specific [3H]diprenorphine binding with an ED50 of 0.98 nm and Emax of 77% (Fig.2A; Table I). The ED50 presented is similar to the affinity of β-FNA for μ-opioid receptors (16Broadbear J.H. Sumpter T.L. Burke T.F. Husbands S.M. Lewis J.W. Woods J.H. Traynor J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 933-940PubMed Google Scholar). The observed decrease in binding reflected a loss of available functional μ-opioid receptors because pretreatment of cells with a maximal concentration of β-FNA (100 nm) resulted in abolishment of the ability of the selective μ-opioid agonist DAMGO (1 μm) to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding (64.2 versus6.3% stimulation; p < 0.01) and to inhibit basal adenylyl cyclase activity (45.2 versus 4.5% inhibition;p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). DAMGO (1 μm) produced no effect in either functional assay in wild-type GH3 cells (data not shown). Pretreatment with 100 nm β-FNA was used in all subsequent experiments to examine the effect of a maximal reduction in available μ-opioid receptors on several functional assays.Table IComparison of the concentration of β-FNA pretreatment required to reduce specific μ-opioid receptor binding by 50% with that needed to produce half-maximal effects on the basal activity in several functional assaysβ-FNA pretreatmentED50Emaxnm% controlReceptor alkylation Inhibition of [3H]diprenorphine receptor binding0.98 ± 0.1877.0 ± 0.791-a[35S]GTPγS binding;1-badenylyl cyclase assays; orFunctional assay Inhibition of basal [35S]GTPγS binding1.59 ± 0.6635.7 ± 3.351-c[3H]diprenorphine binding; p < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA plus Tukey's post hoc test).

Open table in a new tab a,b,c Significantly different from the corresponding value determined for: Similar to that observed in Fig. 1, basal [35S]GTPγS binding was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in GH3MOR (66.6 fmol/mg) relative to wild-type GH3 cells (46.9 fmol/mg) (Fig.3B). To determine whether the elevated basal [35S]GTPγS binding activity in GH3MOR cells could be correlated with the density of available μ-opioid receptors, cells were pretreated with β-FNA (0.1–100 nm), and basal G-protein activation was measured in membranes prepared from cells following complete drug removal by extensive washing. This resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in basal [35S]GTPγS binding with an Emaxof 35.7% and an ED50 of 1.59 nm (Fig.3A; Table I). The decrease in G-protein activation produced by β-FNA pretreatment paralleled the reduction in μ-opioid receptor binding, requiring a similar concentration to produce a half-maximal response. Pretreatment of GH3MOR cells with a maximal concentration of β-FNA (100 nm) reduced basal G-protein activation to a level (43.2 fmol/mg) not statistically different from that observed in GH3 cells (Fig. 3B, right panel). The effect of β-FNA on basal [35S]GTPγS binding in GH3MOR cells was reversed by inclusion of the opioid antagonist naloxone (10 μm) during pretreatment. Importantly, exposure of wild-type GH3 cells to 100 nm β-FNA produced no effect on basal [35S]GTPγS binding (Fig. 3B, left panel). Another approach to measure activation of G-proteins by GPCRs is to examine agonist-stimulated incorporation of AA-[32P]GTP into Gα-subunits (21Prather P.L. Song L. Piros E.T. Law P.Y. Hales T.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar, 22Prather P.L. McGinn T.M. Erickson L.J. Evans C.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol.

Claude P.A. Liu-Chen L.Y. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Brain. Res. 1995; 29: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An advantage of this technique is that the activation of individual Gα-subunits can be examined following separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of bands obtained by autoradiography with those detected by Western analysis of the same immunoblot, we have previously reported (21Prather P.L. Song L. Piros E.T. Law P.Y. Hales T.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar) and the autoradiograms presented in Figs.4, 6, and 7 demonstrate that GH3 cells express four pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins labeled by AA-[32P]GTP. The identity of these Gα-subunits from higher to lower molecular weight were Giα3, Goα1, Giα2, and Goα2, respectively (21Prather P.L. Song L. Piros E.T. Law P.Y. Hales T.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar). When the activation of all Gα-subunits are considered together (i.e. total G-protein activation), basal photoaffinity labeling of G-proteins with AA-[32P]GTP was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in GH3MOR (8.35 OD units) relative to wild-type GH3 cells (3.1 OD units) (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment with β-FNA (0.1–100 nm) resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in labeling of all G-proteins, resulting in a maximal inhibition of 46.5% and an ED50 of 7.72 nm(Fig. 4A; Table I). The maximal decrease in labeling produced by 100 nm β-FNA was significantly reversed (p < 0.01) by the addition of the opioid antagonist naloxone during pretreatment. As expected, these results are virtually identical to those presented for [35S]GTPγS binding.Figure 6Concentration-dependent photoaffinity labeling of total G-proteins by AA-[32P]GTP in response to the μ-opioid agonist DAMGO in GH3MOR membranes.

As predicted, basal intracellular cAMP levels were statistically reduced (p < 0.01) in GH3MOR (6.1 fmol/mg/min) relative to GH3 cells (11.9 fmol/mg/min) (Fig.5B). Furthermore, β-FNA pretreatment (0.1–100 nm) produced a concentration-related increase in basal cAMP (Fig. 5A) to a level (10.4 fmol/mg/min) that did not statistically differ from wild-type GH3 cells (Fig.5B). Concentrations of β-FNA pretreatment that produced 50% alkylation of μ-opioid receptors (ED50 = 0.98 nm) also resulted in half-maximal increases in cAMP levels (ED50 = 2.2 nm) (Table I). Importantly, a maximal concentration of β-FNA (100 nm) produced no effect on basal cAMP levels in GH3 cells, and the effect in GH3MOR cells could be reversed by inclusion of naloxone (10 μm) during pretreatment (Fig. 5B). When GH3MOR cells were pretreated with a maximal concentration of β-FNA (100 nm) for only a short duration (10 min), no effect on basal [35S]GTPγS binding or cAMP levels was observed (data not shown). Interestingly, acute addition of β-FNA (100 nm) to the [35S]GTPγS binding buffer or to the cAMP assay mixture resulted in a slight stimulation (16.1 ± 1.5%) of [35S]GTPγS binding and had no effect on basal cAMP levels. Therefore, β-FNA does not appear to act acutely as an inverse agonist but rather, possibly, as a partial agonist in these assays. To determine whe"

An allosteric interaction between RyR1 and dihydropyridine receptors located in the plasma membrane mediates voltage-induced Ca2+ release (VICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. RyR3, which disappears in adult muscle, is not involved in VICR, and the role of the transiently expressed RyR3 remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that RyR1 participates in both VICR and Ca2+-induced Ca2+release (CICR) and that RyR3 amplifies RyR1-mediated CICR in neonatal skeletal muscle. Confocal measurements of intracellular Ca2+ in primary cultured mouse skeletal myotubes reveal active sites of Ca2+ release caused by peripheral coupling between dihydropyridine receptors and RyR1. In myotubes lacking RyR3, the peripheral VICR component is unaffected, and RyR1s alone are able to support inward CICR propagation in most cells at an average speed of ∼190 µm/s. With the co-presence of RyR1 and RyR3 in wild-type cells, unmitigated radial CICR propagates at 2,440 µm/s. Because neonatal skeletal muscle lacks a well developed transverse tubule system, the RyR3 reinforcement of CICR seems to ensure a robust, uniform, and synchronous activation of Ca2+ release throughout the cell body.

RyR is a large homotetrameric protein (subunit molecular mass ∼500 kDa) with a transmembrane domain at the carboxyl-terminal end that inserts into the SR and forms the conduction pore of a Ca2+ release channel (5Wagenknecht T.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The bulk of the RyR protein is in the cytosol, which spans the junctional gap between TT and SR membranes. Three genetically distinct isoforms of RyR have been identified in various mammalian tissues. RyR1, the primary isoform in skeletal muscle (8Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H.

RyR2, the primary isoform in cardiac muscle (10Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Otsu K.

RyR3, or the brain isoform (12Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), is widely distributed in many tissues, but its physiological function is less well understood. Although RyR3 is usually not the predominant RyR protein, it often co-expresses with RyR1 or RyR2 in different tissues. For example, in adult diaphragm muscle, RyR3 constitutes 1–4% of the total [3H]ryanodine binding sites (the remainder being RyR1) (13Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M. Wu G.M. Grassucci R. Wagenknecht T. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

The expression pattern of RyR3 usually follows a distinct developmental profile (16Bertocchini F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R. Bottinelli R. Reggiani C. Sorrentino V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Flucher B.E. Conti A. Taheshima H. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In mice, the RyR3 protein can be detected in skeletal muscles starting at embryonic day 18 through postnatal day 15. At later stages of development there is a marked decline in RyR3, which is most noticeable in fast-twitch muscles (18Tarroni P. Rossi D. Conti A. Sorrentino V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19808-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of these expression patterns are not known. In neonatal skeletal muscle isolated from mutant mice lacking the ryr3 gene (ryr3(−/−)), both tension development in response to caffeine (an RyR agonist) and contractile force in response to voltage stimulation are reduced (16Bertocchini F.

However, in adult skeletal muscle from the ryr3(−/−) mice, E-C coupling is essentially normal compared with wild type (16Bertocchini F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R. Bottinelli R.

These data suggest that RyR3 may have an important accessory role in both muscle development and contraction in neonatal cells (16Bertocchini F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R.

In this work, we examined the differential function of RyR1 and RyR3 in Ca2+ signaling of muscle cells using primary cultured skeletal myotubes derived from the neonates of mutant mice lacking theryr1 or ryr3 genes. By employing high spatially and temporally resolved imaging of the fluorescent Ca2+indicator, we observed different patterns of VICR and CICR in cells with and without RyR3. Our data suggest that a functional interplay between RyR1 and RyR3 may serve important roles in the regulation of Ca2+ movements in neonatal muscle cells. Mutant mice that contain one allele ofryr1 and null allele of ryr3, ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−) (19Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H. Endo M.

Genotyping of the neonates was performed by polymerase chain reaction using established protocols (19Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H.

Myoblasts were dissociated from limb muscles of neonates or embryos (embryonic day 19) of the different strains of mice by using 0.2% trypsin digestion and seeded onto collagen-coated ΔT3 dishes (Bioptechs, Inc.). The cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 2.5 ng/ml rh-fibroblast growth factor (Promega, Madison, WI). After reaching ∼90% confluence, the myoblasts were allowed to fuse and differentiate into myotubes in a culture medium containing 2% horse serum. Myotubes at day 4 were used for all experiments. The intracellular distribution of RyR was visualized in cultured myotubes by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Myotubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary monoclonal antibody that recognizes both RyR1 and RyR3 (34C antibody, see Ref. 33Ward C.W. Schneider M.F. Castillo D. Protasi F. Wang Y. Chen S.R. Allen P.D. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) followed by a 1-h incubation with Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in the dark. Immunofluorescence was detected by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss 410, excitation wavelength 613 nm and emission wavelength > 650 nm) with an optical section thickness of 1.0 µm. Myotubes were placed on the stage of a Zeiss 410 inverted confocal microscope and excited by the 488-nm line laser. The objective was a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar ×40 oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.3), and the confocal pinhole was set to a spatial resolution of 0.4 µm in the horizontal plane and 1.0 µm in the axial direction. Unless indicated otherwise, all images were taken in the line-scan mode with the line focused halfway into the cell and placed perpendicular to the cell length (see Fig. 1A). Each image consisted of 512 line scans (2.09 ms/line scan), and each line consisted of 512 pixels spaced at 78-nm intervals. Image processing and data analysis were performed using IDL 5.4 software (Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, CO). Myotubes were loaded with 5 µm Fluo-4/AM (Ca2+ indicator) for 15 min, prepared in 2 mm Ca2+ Hepes-buffered solution. Ca2+-free perfusion solution contained 137 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mmEGTA, 20 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Field stimulation at 1 Hz was employed to induce Ca2+release from the cells. In some experiments, 0.5 mmcaffeine was used to sensitize CICR. To detect localized Ca2+ release sites, as shown in Fig. 3, cells were perfused with 30 µm EGTA/AM for more than 20 min. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). Data were reported as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was applied to determine differences between mean values. A p value of <0.05 was taken as the statistically significance level. We derived primary cultured skeletal muscle myotubes from the neonates of four strains of mice: ryr1(−/−)ryr3(−/−), ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−), ryr1(+/+)ryr3(−/−), and wild-type (wt) control (ryr1(+/+)ryr3(+/+)). For the measurement of changes in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), the myotubes were loaded with 5 µm Fluo-4/AM Ca2+indicator for 15 min. The ryr1(−/−)ryr3(−/−) cells do not release intracellular Ca2+ in responses to voltage or caffeine stimulation but maintain intact response to thapsigargin treatment (data not shown). Thus, this type of mutant cells was not included in subsequent experiments. Fig. 1 B compares the changes in spatial and temporal distribution of [Ca2+]iin response to the electrical stimulation of ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−) and ryr1(+/+)ryr3(+/+) cells. Both sets exhibit VICR reflected by peripheral coupling of DHPR and RyR. This VICR is independent of the presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular solution and thus reflects mainly the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (i.e. the SR). In the absence of RyR3, propagation of Ca2+ release from the cell periphery to the center creates a crescent appearance in the line-scan image of the Ca2+transient (Fig. 1 B, right). In the wt myotube with both RyR1 and RyR3 present, the periphery-to-center propagation of Ca2+ transients is too fast to be resolved, giving rise to a flat wave-front in the image (Fig. 1 B, left). The half-decay time (t 50) of Ca2+transients was 217.6 ± 30.2 ms (n = 12) in wt cells, and it was prolonged by 24% (175.3 ± 16.8 ms (n = 23)) in cells without the presence of RyR3. The amplitudes of Ca2+ transients at cell edges, however, are similar among ryr3(−/−) and wt cells (Fig. 1 C). This suggests that RyR3 contributes little to peripheral E-C coupling in the neonatal myotube preparation, which is consistent with the observation that RyR3 may not couple directly to the DHPR/voltage sensors (23Protasi F. Takekura H. Wang Y. Chen S.R. Meissner G. Allen P.D. Franzini-Armstrong C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2494-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of RyR1 (or RyR3) in both the peripheral and central regions of the primary cultured myotubes (Fig. 2). Stained with the 34C antibody, which recognizes both RyR1 and RyR3, punctated distribution of RyR1 was observed in both ryr1(+/+)ryr3(+/+) (Fig. 2 A) and ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−) cells (Fig. 2 B). The peripherally distributed RyR1 is likely coupled to DHPR on the cell surface membrane and is responsible for VICR, and the centrally distributed RyR1 (or RyR3) would support the propagation of CICR toward the cytoplasm of the myotubes. The inward propagation of Ca2+ transients is similar to the CICR observed in cardiac atrial myocytes devoid of TT (24Huser J. Lipsius S.L. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and therefore must be a property of RyR1, because it is observed in cells completely lacking RyR3 (Figs. 1 and Fig.3). Further quantitative analyses suggest that RyR3 not only enhances the RyR1-mediated CICR process but also appears to synchronize the Ca2+ release events across the whole cell body. First, the ratio of Ca2+ transients in the central to peripheral regions is nearly unity in wt cells with RyR3 present but is reduced to ∼0.62 with the deletion of RyR3 from the ryr3(−/−) cells (Fig. 1 C). Second, in cells lacking RyR3, the time difference in activation of Ca2+ transients in the central versus peripheral regions (t lag) is 29.8 ± 9.2 ms (n= 23, Fig. 1 D), which is about 8.5 times faster than the expected passive diffusion time (L 2/2D, given a radiusL = 5.6 µm and an apparent Ca2+ diffusion coefficient D = 50 µm2/sec in the cytoplasm). Furthermore, the delay time t lag is 2.1 ± 0.8 ms (n = 12) in cells containing both RyR1 and RyR3. The average speed of radial propagation (t lag/radius) is 2,440 (n = 12) and 190 µm/s (n = 23) in wt and ryr3(−/−) myotubes, respectively. Thus, in addition to prolonging the Ca2+transient, the presence of RyR3 provides a novel alternative mechanism to ensure a synchronous activation of CICR throughout the wt cell in the absence of TT system. The peripheral coupling between DHPR and RyR1 was robust in all cells examined and did not vary significantly between ryr1(+/+)ryr3(−/−) and ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−) cells (Figs. 1 and 3). Although CICR was observed in most cells lacking RyR3 (23 of 26 experiments), a subset did not show apparent CICR (3 of 26 experiments). In this subset of ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−) (Fig. 3 A) and ryr1(+/+)ryr3(−/−) cells (Fig. 3 B), localized Ca2+ release is restricted to the cell periphery, indicating that the radial propagation of CICR, if any, is aborted prematurely in these cells. Under these circumstances, the addition of a low concentration of caffeine (0.5 mm) to the bathing solution not only inducesde novo propagation of CICR toward the central region but also prolongs the duration of intracellular Ca2+ transient after voltage stimulation (Fig. 3 B, right). The data further substantiate the notion that RyR1 is capable of supporting both VICR and CICR in neonatal myotubes. In a few experiments (3 of 23 ryr3(−/−) cells), we also observed a spontaneous localized increase in [Ca2+]i under resting conditions (data not shown), resembling “Ca2+ sparks” that have been observed in all types of muscle cells (25Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C148-C159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Conklin M.W. Ahern C.A. Vallejo P. Sorrentino V. Takeshima H. Coronado R. Biophys.

Physiol. 1999; 521: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further study the spatial and temporal distribution of the Ca2+ signal in the myotube, we employed the imaging method developed by Song et al. (28Song L.S. Sham J.S. Stern M.D. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with modifications. Here, a low concentration of EGTA/AM Ca2+ buffer, which adds Ca2+ buffering power and allows for the direct monitoring of Ca2+ release flux from the SR, was introduced into the cytosol of the ryr1(+/+)ryr3(+/+) myotubes (30 µm for 20 min.). Under these conditions, we observed a localized pattern of Ca2+ release near the periphery of the cells (Fig.4A), indicating that VICR remains intact, and the RyR1- and RyR3-mediated propagation of CICR is susceptible to Ca2+ buffering. With a longitudinal scan along the cell edge, discrete voltage-induced Ca2+ release sites that are separated ∼5 µm apart can be observed clearly (Fig.4 B). These Ca2+ release sites presumably correspond to the active domains of peripheral coupling between DHPR and RyR1. This peripherally coupled VICR observed in wt myotubes has a distinct early peak followed by a plateau phase (Fig. 4 B,right). This property is similar to previous measurement of SR Ca2+ release flux with intact adult muscle fibers (29Rios E. Pizzaro G. Stefani E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 109-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our studies present two main conclusions. First, RyR1s alone are capable of supporting CICR in addition to VICR in neonatal skeletal muscle. Second, RyR3 can amplify the CICR process and seems important for the propagation and synchronization of Ca2+ release across the whole cell body in neonatal skeletal muscle. These results provide novel insight into the role of RyR isoforms, RyR3 in particular, in Ca2+ signaling and the myogenesis of skeletal muscle. It is well known that VICR, which is the primary activation mechanism of skeletal muscle contraction, is triggered directly or indirectly by conformational changes of the DHPR/voltage sensor (1Rios E. Ma J. Gonzalez A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). And CICR, the primary mechanism for E-C coupling in cardiac muscle, is gated by Ca2+ influx through the DHPR/Ca2+ channel or by the opening of neighbor RyR channels (24Huser J. Lipsius S.L. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C148-C159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the functional correlation between VICR and CICR and its underlying molecular mechanism of interaction between RyR1 and RyR3 represent a major research effort in current E-C coupling studies in skeletal muscle. The contribution of RyR1 and RyR3 to E-C coupling in skeletal muscle has been addressed using ryr1 or ryr3knockout mice (16Bertocchini F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R. Bottinelli R.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The absence of RyR1 leads to the loss of E-C coupling function, paralysis of skeletal muscles, and perinatal lethality (22Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 31Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The E-C coupling function is unique to RyR1, because neither RyR2 nor RyR3 support skeletal type E-C coupling when expressed in ryr1(−/−) skeletal muscle cells (32Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F.

The absence of RyR3 affects some dynamic aspects of embryonic muscle tension but is not essential for mouse survival (16Bertocchini F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R. Bottinelli R.

In developing skeletal muscle, transmitting the sarcolemmal excitation into Ca2+ excitation throughout the cytoplasm, including the nuclei, might be important to the development of contractile apparatus and to the regulation of gene expression in an activity-dependent manner. Our imaging study indicates that the signal transduction is achieved in two separable steps: an activation of the peripheral RyR1 followed by RyR3 reinforcement of CICR relay. RyR1 and RyR3 are coded by separate genes, and share ∼70% identity in primary amino acid sequence. The RyR1 and RyR3 Ca2+release channels exhibit different gating properties by cytosolic Ca2+. When expressed in the null background of “dyspedic” 1B5 myotubes, RyR3 alone is able to generate Ca2+ sparks (33Ward C.W. Schneider M.F. Castillo D. Protasi F. Wang Y. Chen S.R. Allen P.D. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is evidence that RyR3 is more sensitive to activation by Ca2+ than RyR1 (13Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and RyR3 is activated with a Hill coefficient of ∼2.7 (35Sonnlitner A. Conti A. Bertocchini F. Schindler H. Sorrentino V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2790-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which is much higher than that reported for RyR1 channels (36Gyorke S. Velez P. Suarez-Isla B. Fill M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1879-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both features render RyR3 well suited for supporting a low-threshold rapid CICR propagation in a Ca2+-excitable medium. Indeed, with the co-presence of RyR1 and RyR3, the inward CICR relay becomes robust, and the Ca2+ signal becomes uniform in both the center and peripheral regions. Remarkably, the CICR relay in wt cells occurs with a speed of 2.4 mm/sec, which is an order of magnitude faster that CICR relay in ryr1(+/−)ryr3(−/−) or ryr1(+/+)ryr3(−/−) cells. As a result, the entire cytoplasm of the myotube is excited within a few milliseconds. This is a unique property of RyR3, because RyR2-supported CICR in cardiac myocytes propagates at a speed between 50 and 150 µm/sec (25Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C148-C159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to those for RyR1. Ultrafast RyR2-supported CICR, with a speed in the range of mm/sec, has been documented only under special experimental conditions (37Miura M. Boyden P.A. Ter Keurs H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H266-H276PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, we suggest that the transiently expressed RyR3 in the developing skeletal muscle plays a prominent role to ensure a robust, synchronous, and uniform activation of the SR throughout the cell. It is noteworthy that RyR3 disappears in the adult, when TT is available to spread membrane excitation into the cell. The RyR3-mediated CICR in the neonatal skeletal muscle could have important implications on the regulation of activity-dependent gene expression during development and differentiation. These findings may also have general implications for understanding the role of RyR3 in other types of cells that require a low threshold synchronous activation of the entire cytoplasm as a Ca2+-excitable medium.

Clements J.A. Macklem P.T. Reed J. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1986: 247-261Google Scholar). Surfactant secreted into the air space forms a phospholipid-rich film between the epithelial lining fluid and the gas in the lumen of the alveolus, which reduces the natural interfacial surface tension forces. The most abundant protein component of surfactant (by weight) is surfactant protein A (SP-A),1 a highly conserved glycoprotein that is synthesized and secreted by the alveolar type II cells and Clara cells of the distal lung epithelium (2King R.J. Klass D.J. Gikas E.G. Clements J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 224: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). SP-A is a hydrophilic, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with in vitro activities that suggest contributions to surfactant function and macrophage-dependent microbial clearance (3Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The understanding of the role of SP-A in pulmonary homeostasis has evolved significantly over the past decade due in part to the development of improved in vivo models of SP-A function. Although the importance of SP-A in pulmonary host defense has become clearer, there is still no consensus regarding the role of SP-A in surfactant function, where the greatest discrepancies between in vitroand in vivo data exist. Early experimental evidence that SP-A regulates the uptake and secretion of surfactant from isolated type II cells suggested that the protein might play a role in the regulation of intra-alveolar levels of surfactant phospholipids (4Dobbs L.G.

However, neither the absence of SP-A or a 7-fold overexpression of SP-A significantly affected surfactant phospholipid pool sizes in recently developed genetically engineered mice (6Korfhagen T.R.

Previous in vitro analyses from several laboratories have indicated that SP-A is necessary for the formation and/or stability of tubular myelin (TM), a lattice-like structure that functions as the phospholipid reservoir for the surfactant monolayer (8Suzuki Y. Fujita Y. Kogishi K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). As predicted, TM was absent in the SP-A−/− mice, but normal survival and resting respiration in the presence of TM deficiency was unexpected (6Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Early in vitro studies indicated that SP-A preserves the surface activity of surfactant during challenge with serum protein inhibitors in vitro (9Cockshutt A.M. Weitz J. Possmayer F.

Lipids. 1990; 56: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This finding was supported by examination of surfactant isolated from mouse models of SP-A deficiency and excess, which revealed impaired and improved surfactant function in the presence of protein inhibitors, respectively (7Elhalwagi B.M.

Recent data from SP-A−/− mice suggest that SP-A does not play a major role in surfactant homeostasis or surface activity with exercise, exposure to hyperoxia, or chemically induced lung injury (12Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Whitsett J. Korfhagen T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that SP-A contributes to surfactant structure and function under other conditions of lung stress or injury. Mutagenesis studies have elucidated the interactions between SP-A and phospholipids that are important for surfactant structural and functional integrity (13Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T. Ogasawara Y.

Rat SP-A is a large oligomer composed of 18 subunits derived from a single gene, which are distinguished by variable glycosylation at one or both N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (16Whitsett J.A. Ross G. Weaver T. Rice W. Dion C. Hull W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15273-15279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and minor heterogeneity in the N-terminal amino acid sequences (17Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The predicted primary structure for rat SP-A is composed of several discrete domains including (18White R.T. Damm D. Miller J. Spratt K. Schilling J. Hawgood S. Benson B. Cordell B. Nature. 1985; 317: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar): 1) a short N-terminal segment, 2) a collagen-like sequence of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats containing a midpoint interruption (Gly44) and abundant hydroxyproline, 3) a hydrophobic neck domain, and 4) a carbohydrate recognition domain. Trimeric association of monomeric subunits occurs by the folding of the collagen-like domains into triple helices (19King R.J. Simon D. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The role of the neck domain in the oligomeric assembly of SP-A has not been reported, but in related collectins, the formation of α-helical coiled-coil bundles in this region is critical for trimerization (20Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fully assembled SP-A is a hexamer of trimers that are laterally associated through the N-terminal segment and the first half of the collagen-like domain and are stabilized by inter- and intratrimeric interchain disulfide bonds at Cys−1 and Cys6 (21Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Data from several laboratories indicate that the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A mediates binding to phospholipid vesicles (15McCormack F.X. Stewart J.J. Voelker D.R.

The affinity of the protein for multivalent ligands such as membranes is greatly enhanced by the simultaneous binding of multiple carbohydrate recognition domains of oligomers to the target. Deletion of the collagen-like domain (ΔG8-P80) reduces but does not extinguish lipid binding (14McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J.J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), probably by limiting the extent of oligomerization to simple trimers and hexamers (25Palaniyar N. McCormack F.X. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6310-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most notably, the ΔG8-P80 mutation does not affect aggregation of lipid vesicles by the protein or the enhancement of the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant lipids in the bubble surfactometer (14McCormack F.X.

These in vitro data suggested that a partial SP-A molecule containing a deletion of the collagen-like domain retained the structural elements that are required for the surface tension enhancing properties of SP-A. To extend the structural analyses to the whole animal, we developed mice in which endogenous mouse SP-A was replaced with either full-length rat SP-A or a collagen-region deleted rat SP-A. The objectives of this study were 2-fold: 1) to determine whether genetic replacement of SP-A in the SP-A−/− mouse corrects surfactant structural and functional defects and 2) to determine whether the collagen-like region of SP-A is required for tubular myelin formation and resistance of surfactant to protein inhibitors. The construction of a chimeric transgene composed of the 3.7-kb human surfactant protein C promoter (SP-C) (26Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams D.K. Vorbroker D.K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using the same approach, a 1.4-kb mutant cDNA for SP-A containing a deletion of the collagen-like domain (ΔG8-P80) (14McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J.J. Possmayer F. Inchley K.

Orientation was confirmed withBamHI, and portions of the recombinant plasmid that were unnecessary for expression in mammalian cells were removed by digestion with NdeI and NotI. The gel-purified fragment containing the promoter and the ΔG8-P80 transgene was used to produce transgenic mice (7Elhalwagi B.M. Zhang M. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Morris R.E. Miller M.L. Dienger K. McCormack F.X. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Swiss Black SP-A−/− mice were developed from embryonic stem cells after disruption of the mouse SP-A gene by homologous recombination as described previously (6Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Lung-specific overexpression of rat SP-A in FVB/N mice was accomplished using the hSP-C promoter as described (7Elhalwagi B.M.

The rat SP-A transgene was bred into the null background by crossing the rat SP-A transgene bearing FVB/N mice (SP-A+/+,rSP-A) with Swiss Black SP-A−/−mice. Progeny that screened positively for the rat SP-A transgene in the first round were bred again with SP-A−/− mice. Progeny of the second generation that screened positively for the rat SP-A transgene and that were homozygous for the gene-targeted allele by Southern analysis (SP-A−/−,rat SP-A) were then bred with Swiss Black SP-A−/− mice through multiple (4Dobbs L.G.

SP-A+/+,ΔG8-P80 and SP-A−/−,ΔG8-P80mice were developed in a similar manner. Controls used for all experiments were transgene negative littermates. For identification of the targeted mouse SP-A gene and the rat SP-A transgene in the genomic DNA of mice, both PCR and Southern analysis were used. Tail clips (0.5–1 cm) were digested overnight in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 µg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C and purified using the Wizard genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was performed using primers that were complementary to the neomycin insert (5′-TTTTGTCAAGACCGACCTGTCC-3′ and 5′-AACTCGTCAAGAAGGCGATAGAAG-3′) for amplification of the targeted mouse SP-A gene and to the 3′-end of the hSP-C promoter and nucleotides 628–652 of the rat SP-A cDNA (5′-CTCAACTCACCCAGGTTTGCTC-3 and 5′-TTCACAGAAGCCCCATCCAGGTAG-3′) for amplification of the rat and ΔG8-P80 transgenes. For Southern analysis, DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted, digested with BamHI, size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose by capillary action. The membrane was cross-linked with ultraviolet light and blocked with prehybridization solution at 65 °C. Random primer 32P-labeled probe was synthesized from the PstI fragment of the rat SP-A cDNA (probe 1) or from nucleotides 2840 through 3339 of the endogenous mouse SP-A gene (amplified with primers 5′-GGAATCCAGGCAGACAGTTGTG-3′ and 5′-CCTTACCTCCCATTGTTTGCAG-3′) (probe 2) (Prime-It II, Stratagene). The membrane was hybridized with the probe overnight at 65 °C, washed three times with 20 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS and placed on film. The rat SP-A transgene was identified by PCR or Southern analysis, using probe 1 as described previously (7Elhalwagi B.M. Zhang M. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Morris R.E. Miller M.L. Dienger K. McCormack F.X. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For surfactant studies, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with pentobarbital sodium and exsanguinated by transection of the abdominal aorta. After the chest was opened, the proximal trachea was cannulated with a 20-gauge blunt needle. Alveolar lavage was performed by three cycles of instillation of saline to full lung expansion followed by gentle aspiration, repeated five times (total ∼5 ml) for each animal (11Ikegami M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Bruno M.D. Wert S.E. Wada K. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L247-L254PubMed Google Scholar). Surfactant was fractionated into small and large aggregate forms by centrifugation of pooled or single mouse alveolar washes at 40,000 ×g over an 0.8 m sucrose in 0.15 mNaCl cushion for 15 min. The supernatant containing the small surfactant aggregates was harvested and stored at −20 °C. The large aggregate surfactant then was collected from the interface, diluted with 0.15 m NaCl, and centrifuged again at 40,000 ×g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in normal saline and stored at −20 °C. Large aggregate surfactant samples (four mice/pellet) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 4% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmCaCl2 for 18 h at 4 °C and 1% OsO4 and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h at 23 °C. Pellets were washed and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of acetone (0–100%) and ethanol (0–100%). At the 75% ethanol dehydration step, 2% uranyl acetate was included and incubated for 2 to 18 h at 4 °C. Fixed and dehydrated pellets were embedded in epoxy resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA), sectioned, and stained with lead citrate and 2% uranyl acetate. Dried specimens were examined and photographed using a JEOL JEM-100CX-II TEM at 8,000–40,000 × nominal magnification (25Palaniyar N. McCormack F.X. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6310-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At least four specimen grids with different sections were systematically examined by EM for each genotype. Dimensions of TM figures were measured from magnified images (final magnification of ∼3 × 105) captured on scanned micrographs using Canvas 6 software (Deneba Software, Miami, FL). Clearly identifiable cross-sections of TM from 3–5 micrographs at different magnifications (10,000, 20,000, and 40,000×) were selected to measure lattice dimensions for each genotype. The smallest side of a randomly selected lattice was considered as side 1, and all of the membranes parallel to that side in the row were measured (n = 50). Rows of membranes perpendicular to side 1 were measured as side 2 (n = 50). All dimensions reported were rounded off to the nearest 0.1 nm (1 Å). Surface activity was measured with the captive bubble surfactometer (27Schurch S. Bachofen H. Goerke J. Possmayer F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2389-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) using large aggregate surfactant pooled from three mice of the same genotype. The concentration of each sample was adjusted to 3 nmol of saturated phosphatidylcholine (sat PC)/µl, and 3 µl of surfactant was applied to the air-water interface of the bubble by microsyringe. Sensitivity to protein inhibition was measured in the presence of 0.93 mg/ml sheep plasma protein. SP-A levels in bronchoalveolar lavage were determined with a rabbit polyclonal IgG against rat SP-A using a sandwich ELISA (22McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay was 0.20 ng/ml, and the linear range extended from 0.16 to 10.0 ng/ml. Routine protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic protein assay kit (BCA, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified SP-A proteins were separated by 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analyses, protein species were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and reacted serially with rabbit anti-rat SP-A IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Blots were developed by horseradish peroxidase/H2O2-dependent oxidation of Luminol and autoradiography using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sat PC was measured by extracting the alveolar wash or lung homogenates with chloroform/methanol (2:1), treatment with OsO4, Alumina column chromatography, and phosphorus analysis as described (6Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into sat PC was determined 8 h after a 25 µl/g body weight intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 µCi/g [3H]choline chloride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 0.8 µCi/g [14C]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) by scintillation counting of half of the sat PC isolated from alveolar washes and lung homogenates of each animal as reported previously (6Korfhagen T.R.

Pressure volume relationships of the lungs of SP-A−/−, SP-A−/−,rSP-A, and SP-A−/−,ΔG8-P80 mice were determined as described (12Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Whitsett J. Korfhagen T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and placed in a chamber containing 100% O2 to collapse the alveoli. After sacrifice by exsanguination, the trachea were cannulated and connected to a pressure sensor (Mouse Pulmonary Testing System, TSS, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). After the diaphragm was opened, the lungs were inflated in 75-µl increments every 10 s to a maximum pressure of 34 ± 1 cm H2O and then were deflated in a similar fashion (12Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Whitsett J. Korfhagen T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) The SP-A−/−, SP-A−/−,rSP-A, and SP-A−/−,ΔG8-P80 lines were compared using two-tailed t tests. The variables included SP-A, sat PC, radiolabel content of sat PC, surface tension, and dimensions of TM lattices. All data were expressed as mean ± S.D., and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant The human SP-C promoter was used to direct the expression of rat and mutant SP-A transgenes in the distal lung epithelium of transgenic mice (Fig. 1). The development of SP-A−/− gene-targeted mice and rat SP-A overexpressing transgenic lines (SP-A+/+,rSP-A) has been described previously (6Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M.

Of the two previously reported SP-A+/+,rSP-A lines, only the higher producing rSP-A mice (SP-A2) were used for breeding into the SP-A−/−background. To develop mice that overexpressed the collagen region deleted form of SP-A (ΔG8-P80), a hSP-C/ΔG8-P80 chimeric gene was constructed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” and injected into fertilized FVB/N oocytes. From a total of three separate rounds of injection and uterine implantation, only one SP-A+/+,ΔG8-P80 founder mouse was identified from 120 mice screened. This mouse transmitted the transgene to ∼50% of offspring with equal distribution between male and female mice. To produce mice that expressed rat SP-A or ΔG8-P80 in the null background, the SP-A+/+,rSP-A and SP-A+/+,ΔG8-P80 mice were bred with Swiss Black SP-A−/− mice (Fig. 2). Progeny from the first generation were screened for the presence of the transgenes by PCR and Southern analysis and then bred again with the SP-A−/− line. Transgene-positive F2 mice that were homozygous for the gene-targeted mouse SP-A allele were identified by Southern analysis and then bred through 4–8 generations with the SP-A−/− line to provide for a more homogeneous genetic background.Figure 2Southern analysis of SP-A−/−,rSP-Aand SP-A−/−,ΔG8-P80transgenic mice. Tail DNA from parental strains SP-A+/+,rSP-A (lane 1), SP-A+/+,ΔG8-P80 (lane 4), and SP-A−/− (lanes 2 and 5) were digested with BamHI and hybridized with probe 1 to identify the targeted alleles (panels A and C) or digested with EcoRI and hybridized with probe 2 to identify the rat SP-A (1.6 kb; panel B) and ΔG8-P80 (1.4 kb; panel D) transgenes. The genotypes of transgene-bearing mice that were homozygous for the null alleles were verified by Southern analysis after breeding with the SP-A−/− mice through multiple generations (lanes 3 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The level of SP-A in the alveolar wash of all mouse lines was compared with wild type mice. Three to six age-matched (6–8-week old) mice/genotype were lavaged with 5 ml of normal saline, and SP-A was measured in the recovered lavage fluid by ELISA (4.6–4.9 ml in all cases). The SP-A−/−,rSP-A mice had 849 ± 121 ng SP-A/ml lavage, 6-fold higher than SP-A+/+ mice (138 ± 6 ng SP-A/ml). The level of SP-A in the SP-A−/−,ΔG8-P80 mice (179 ± 24 ng/ml) was 1.3-fold higher than SP-A+/+ control mice. No SP-A was detected in the lavage of SP-A−/− littermate control mice from the SP-A−/−,rSP-A or the SP-A−/−,ΔG8-P80 lines.

https://openalex.org/W2035670307,"MEF, a recently identified member of the E74 family of ETS-related transcription factors, is a strong transcriptional activator of cytokine gene expression. Using a green fluorescent protein gene reporter plasmid regulated by an MEF-responsive promoter, we determined that the transcriptional activity of MEF is largely restricted to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. MEF-dependent transcription was suppressed by the expression of cyclin A but not by cyclin D or cyclin E. This effect was due to the kinase activity generated by cyclin A expression, as co-expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 or p27, or a dominant negative form of CDK2 (DNK2), abrogated the reduction of MEF transcriptional activity by cyclin A. Cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylated MEF protein in vitromore efficiently than cyclin D-CDK4 or cyclin E-CDK2, and phosphorylation of MEF by cyclin A-CDK2 reduced its ability to bind DNA. We determined one site of phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 at the C terminus of MEF, using mass-spectrometry; mutation of three serine or threonine residues in this region significantly reduced phosphorylation of MEF by cyclin A and reduced cyclin A-mediated suppression of its transactivating activity. These amino acid substitutions also reduced the restriction of MEF activity to G1. Phosphorylation of MEF by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex controls its transcriptional activity during the cell cycle, establishing a novel link between the ETS family of proteins and the cell cycle machinery. MEF, a recently identified member of the E74 family of ETS-related transcription factors, is a strong transcriptional activator of cytokine gene expression. Using a green fluorescent protein gene reporter plasmid regulated by an MEF-responsive promoter, we determined that the transcriptional activity of MEF is largely restricted to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. MEF-dependent transcription was suppressed by the expression of cyclin A but not by cyclin D or cyclin E. This effect was due to the kinase activity generated by cyclin A expression, as co-expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 or p27, or a dominant negative form of CDK2 (DNK2), abrogated the reduction of MEF transcriptional activity by cyclin A.

Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Transcription factors play a key role in these events, and their activity can be modified during G1 by a variety of intracellular and extracellular signals that alter their amount or their ability to interact with other proteins or with DNA (2Dynlacht B.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 play a critical role in the commitment of a cell to proliferate; commitment occurs during the G1 to S transition, at a time called the restriction point. CDKs are activated by their association with regulatory subunits known as cyclins. The transition from G1 to S requires the temporal activation of cyclin D-CDK4 or cyclin D-CDK6, cyclin E-CDK2, and cyclin A-CDK2, while cyclin B-CDK1 (CDC2) is essential for the G2/M transition (3Matsushime H.

Cyclin D- and cyclin E-dependent kinases regulate the activity of the transcription factor E2F, which controls the expression of a variety of genes necessary for DNA synthesis (4Nevins J.R.

Cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), releasing E2F from its sequestration by Rb and allowing E2F to transactivate genes essential for S phase, such as DNA polymerase-α, thymidine kinase, and cyclins E and A. Both cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 can form quaternary complexes with the Rb-related protein p107 and with E2F during S phase; the exact function of these complexes remains obscure (6Beijersbergen R.L.

The ETS family of transcription factors has been shown to play key roles in the growth and differentiation of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Disruption of PU.1 or Ets-1 by homologous recombination can block the development of granulocyte and monocyte lineages or reduce the number and proliferative capacity of mature T cells (8Bories J.C.

Genet. 1994; 6: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). We recently cloned an ETS-related factor called MEF (myeloid elf-1-like factor), which is expressed in a variety of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells (21Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). MEF binds to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion and potently transactivates the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-3 promoters. We have demonstrated that MEF physically and functionally interacts with members of the AML1/RUNX1 family of hematopoietic regulatory proteins and showed that its activity is repressed by the t(8;21) AML-associated fusion protein AML1-ETO (22Mao S. Frank R.C. Zhang J. Miyazaki Y. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Very recent studies of MEF homozygous null mice (−/−), generated by homologous recombination, demonstrate a role for MEF in hematopoietic stem cell and NK-T cell behavior. 2D. Lacorazza et al., unpublished data. ELF-1, another member of the E74 family of ETS proteins, is highly homologous to MEF in the ETS (DNA binding) domain, and ELF-1 binds to identical sequences in the granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and IL-3 promoters, but has minimal transactivating activity (23Gottschalk L.R. Giannola D.M. Emerson S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Nimer S. Zhang W. Kwan K. Whang Y. Zhang J.

ELF-1 binds to Rb via an LXCXE motif, and this interaction is disrupted by Rb phosphorylation (26Wang C.Y. Petryniak B. Thompson C.B. Kaelin W.G. Leiden J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although not formally shown, it has been suggested that the function of ELF-1 is regulated by its interactions with Rb. This led us to examine whether the activity of MEF was also regulated during the cell cycle, and in this report we describe the phosphorylation of MEF, by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, and the in vitro and in vivo physical interactions between cyclin A and MEF. Furthermore, we have shown that the DNA binding and transcriptional activating properties of MEF are regulated by cyclin A-CDK2, largely restricting MEF function to the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. MEF activity, like E2F, is linked to the cell cycle. Our ongoing search for MEF-regulated target genes should identify important cell cycle-regulated proteins. To create reporter gene plasmids that were transcriptionally responsive to MEF, double-stranded complementary oligonucleotides (called APET) containing enhancer sequences from the human IL-3 promoter, were subcloned in front of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Tk) minimal promoter followed by either the CAT or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The sequence of the APET oligonucleotide is CTCAGTGAGCTGAGTCAGGCTTCCCCTTCCTGCCACAGGG, whereas the sequence of the mutant APET oligonucleotide, that lacks an ETS binding site (ETS mutant APET oligonucleotide), is CCTCAGTGAGCTGAGTCAGGCTgagCTcgacGCCACAGGG (mutated sequences are indicated in lowercase, bold letters). Sequence-specific binding of MEF to the APET oligonucleotide, but not the ETS mutant APET oligonucleotide, has been demonstrated previously (21Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). Four distinct reporter plasmids were used to assess the transcriptional activity of MEF; two contained one copy of the APET or ETS mutant APET oligonucleotide subcloned in front of the Tk promoter and the CAT gene (named APET or ETS mutant APET-Tk-CAT), and two contained the same sequences subcloned upstream of the GFP gene (isolated from the pGFP-C3 plasmid (CLONTECH) and named APET- or ETS mutant APET-Tk-GFP). The following cDNAs were subcloned into a CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter-based expression plasmid: MEF, mouse cyclin D1 (27Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). A mutant MEF, that lacks three potential phosphorylation sites (MEF-TRI-A), was created using a standard polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis method; MEF-TRI-A contains three amino acid substitutions (serine 640, threonine 642, and serine 648 were all changed to alanine). Following dideoxy DNA sequencing, to confirm that all three mutations were correctly introduced, the MEF-TRI-A cDNA was subcloned into the CMV promoter-based expression plasmid. COS cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics and were trypsinized and re-plated the day prior to transfection. Ten µg of the empty, MEF, or MEF-TRI-A expression plasmid and 10 µg of reporter plasmid (APET-Tk-CAT or ETS mutant APET-Tk-CAT or GFP) were introduced into COS cells with or without 5 µg of an expression plasmid for the cyclins or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors by electroporation, using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 300 mV and 960 microfarads. The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant in each sample by adding empty pCMV5 expression vector. Two micrograms of the reporter plasmid pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) (which is regulated by the MEF unresponsive CMV promoter), rather than 10 µg, were used for the experiments shown in Fig. 1, because of the stronger fluorescent signal. 20–24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for CAT assay (performed as described previously (21Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar)) or for the detection of GFP expression. To assay for green fluorescence-positive cells, COS cells transfected with a GFP or EGFP reporter plasmid were trypsinized 24 h after electroporation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 5% FBS. The intensity of green fluorescence in these cells was analyzed, and cells were sorted into various fractions using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) fluorescent-activated cell sorter. The cell cycle profile was analyzed using a FACStar (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer, after nuclear preparation and staining with ethidium bromide (34Nusse M. Beisker W. Hoffmann C. Tarnok A. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Anti-MEF antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with the C-terminal portion of bacterially expressed MEF protein (amino acids 420–663) generated by the pET-30(b) expression plasmid (Novagen) and purified using nickel-agarose beads. The antiserum was affinity-purified using Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) columns coupled to the same antigen. The coding region of the MEF cDNA was subcloned into the pBlueBac-HisB plasmid (Invitrogen), and recombinant baculovirus was prepared that expresses MEF protein with a histidine tag. Recombinant baculoviruses that express cyclin A and CDK2 were kindly provided by D. O. Morgan (35Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and those that express cyclin D and CDK4 were kindly provided by C. J. Sherr (36Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). The Sf9 insect cells were plated in six-well, tissue culture plates at 1.5 × 106 cells per well and infected with recombinant baculoviruses. After 48 h of infection, the cells were metabolically labeled with 200 µCi of [35S]methionine (ICN) for 4 h in Grace's medium with 5% dialyzed FBS but without methionine. Cells were washed with PBS once, lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mmEDTA) in the presence of proteinase inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then clarified by centrifugation. After incubation with specific antibodies against MEF, cyclin A (Santa Cruz), or CDK2 (Santa Cruz) for 1 h, protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the extracts and mixed for 45 min at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, once with high salt buffer (1 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and once with low salt buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5); they were released by adding SDS sample buffer. To detect the protein complexes in vivo, 24 h after electroporation, COS cells transfected with the expression plasmids for MEF, cyclin A, and p21 were labeled with 200 µCi of [35S]methionine for 4 h in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium minus methionine with 10% dialyzed FBS. The immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. After four washes with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, the immune complexes were released from protein A-Sepharose beads by adding 100 µl of denaturation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm DTT) and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein complexes were sequentially immunoprecipitated, using specific antibodies, in IP-2 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet-P 40, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads and were washed four times with IP-2 buffer. After SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film at room temperature. To detect the in vivo interaction between endogenous MEF and the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, Kasumi-1 cells (a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line) were synchronized at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle by treatment with 2 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. The cells were then lysed with NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations using rabbit preimmune serum, anti-MEF, anti-CDK2, and anti-cyclin A antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were electrophoretically separated using SDS-12% PAGE, and MEF protein was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-MEF antiserum. Full-length MEF protein was expressed in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus, then purified and fixed on nickel-agarose beads (Novagen). After 48 h of infection, cells were washed with PBS, then lysed with high salt lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet-P) containing proteinase inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and clarified by centrifugation. Imidazole was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 5 mm, then the cellular extract was mixed with nickel-agarose beads for 18 h. After washing with 1× binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm imidazole) and 1× washing buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm imidazole), beads carrying MEF protein were resuspended in NT buffer (150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Two microliters of Sf9 cellular extract containing a combination of cyclin D2 and CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2, or cyclin A and CDK2 were incubated with 0.2 µg of GST-Rb (Santa Cruz) or 20 µl of nickel-agarose beads bearing histidine-tagged MEF protein in a 30-µl kinase reaction mixture (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 20 µm lithium-ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. After adding 10 µl of 4× SDS sample buffer, samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, then separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed. The relative intensity of each band was measured using a Fuji phosphoimager, and the ratio of MEF:Rb phosphorylation for each reaction was calculated. In later experiments, a histidine-tagged mutant MEF protein (MEF-TRI-A) was evaluated for its ability to be phosphorylated by cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro. MEF, cyclin A, and CDK2 proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells, in various combinations, using recombinant baculoviruses. After 48 h of infection, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in buffer S (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) containing proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (mentioned above), then disrupted by repeated freeze-thawing. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the amount of MEF protein in each extract was assessed by Western blotting, using serially diluted samples. Complementary strands of the APET oligonucleotide were annealed and labeled using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [γ-32P]ATP. One ng of labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with Sf9 cellular lysates containing a constant amount of MEF protein with or without cyclin A and/or CDK2 protein in a 25-µl reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT, 10% glycerol, and 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice. Samples were loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× TBE buffer (Tris borate-EDTA) at room temperature. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. The Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses that overexpress MEF protein, and the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, were lysed with K-lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet-P 40, 10% glycerol) containing the proteinase inhibitors mentioned above. MEF and the cyclin A-CDK2 complex were immunoprecipitated and recovered from the lysates using specific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads.In vitro kinase reactions were performed by mixing protein A-Sepharose beads bearing MEF and cyclin A-CDK2 in a 50-µl kinase reaction mixture at 30 °C. After a 1-h incubation, followed by brief centrifugation, the protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in 45 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The bands of interest were excised from the nitrocellulose and processed for internal amino acid sequence analysis as described (37Tempst P. Link A.J. Riviere L.R. Fleming M. Elicone C. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 537-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with modifications (38Lui M. Tempst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, in situ proteolytic cleavage was done using 0.2 µg of trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Promega) in 25 µl of 100 mmNH4HCO3 (supplemented with 1% Zwittergent 3-16) for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptide mixture was reduced and S-alkylated with, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad) and 0.3% 4-vinyl pyridine (Aldrich), respectively, and fractionated by reversed phase HPLC (39Elicone C. Lui M. Geromanos S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 676: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An enzyme blank was done on an equally sized strip of nitrocellulose. Purified, 32P-labeled peptides (selected by scintillation counting) were analyzed by a combination of automated Edman degradation and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; details about this combined approach can be found elsewhere (39Elicone C. Lui M. Geromanos S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 676: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Tempst P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chemical sequencing (on 90% of the sample) was done using a model 477A instrument from Applied Biosystems. Stepwise liberated phenylthiohydantoin-derivative acids were identified using an “on-line” 120A HPLC system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a PTH C18 (2.1 × 220 mm; 5-micron particle size) column (Applied Biosystems). Instruments and procedures were optimized for femtomole level phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis as described (39Elicone C. Lui M. Geromanos S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 676: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Tempst P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Theoretical monoisotopic masses of predicted tryptic MEF peptides were calculated using ProComp version 1.2 software (obtained from Dr. P. C. Andrews, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI); to account for possible phosphorylation, 79.366 Da (or multiples thereof) was added to the predicted masses for comparison with experimental values. Several methods have been used to study changes in the transcriptional activity of proteins during the cell cycle, but these often involve serum deprivation or the use of reversible agents that block the cell cycle. Although these techniques synchronize the growth of cells in culture, they can alter cell physiology in other subtle or not so subtle ways. To overcome this problem, we developed a reporter system based on the detection of GFP (41Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar), whose expression is governed by an MEF-responsive promoter. The reporter plasmid, called APET-Tk-GFP, contains MEF-responsive enhancer sequences (which we call APET) derived from the human IL-3 5′-flanking region in front of the herpes simplex virus Tk promoter. The sequence-specific binding of MEF to these IL-3 sequences was shown previously (21Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar), and this reporter system accurately measures the transcriptional activity of MEF. The APET-Tk-GFP reporter plasmid has minimal background activity in the absence of MEF, and a mutant APET-Tk-GFP reporter plasmid that lacks the MEF binding site has minimal activity in the presence or absence of MEF (see below). These features enable us to fractionate cell populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) according to the level of GFP expression, which correlates directly with the amount of MEF activity. COS cells were transfected with the APET-Tk-GFP reporter plasmid and an MEF expression plasmid and were separated by FACS sorting into three fractions 24 h later, based on the level of green fluorescence (Fig. 1A). Cell nuclei in each fraction were then stained with ethidium bromide, to analyze the cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Approximately 13% of the total cells (the sum of the high (H), middle (M), and low (L) fractions) exhibited significant fluorescence, reflecting the transactivating activity of MEF. Cells with the greatest intensity of fluorescence showed a 2.0- or 3.6-fold enrichment in the number of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, compared with the unsorted total cell population (high (H)/total) or the cells with low intensity (high (H)/low (L)), respectively (Fig. 1A). Thus, the transactivating activity of MEF, as defined by the intensity of fluorescence, clearly correlated with the proportion of cells in G1. As shown in TableI, cells transfected with the APET-Tk-GFP reporter plasmid and an empty expression plasmid did not contain a significant number of cells in the high, medium, or low intensity fractions, and cells transfected with the MEF expression plasmid and the ETS mutant APET-Tk-GFP reporter plasmid (with mutated MEF binding sites) did not display any high intensity fluorescence. The peak activity of MEF during G1 suggests that MEF transactivating activity is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion, being higher in G1 than during the rest of the cell cycle. Another explanation is that overexpression of MEF in COS cells causes the accumulation of cells in G1.Table IPercentage of green fluorescence positive cells in each fractionExpression plasmidReporter plasmidTotalHighMediumLowEmpty vectorAPET-Tk-GFP1.31-aCell sorting was not done due to the small population of cells in each fraction.ETS mutant APET-Tk-GFP0.51-aCell sorting was not done due to the small population of cells in each fraction.MEFAPET-Tk-GFP13.24.15.23.9ETS mutant APET-Tk-GFP7.00.62.93.51-a Cell sorting was not done due to the small population of cells in each fraction.

The basis for Gαi2regulation of insulin signaling was explored in transgenic mice with targeted expression of the GTPase-deficient, constitutively active Q205L Gαi2 in fat and skeletal muscle. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 in response to insulin challenge in vivo was markedly amplified in fat and skeletal muscle expressing Q205L Gαi2. The expression and activity of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), but not protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, and LAR, were constitutively decreased in tissues expressing the Q205L Gαi2, providing a direct linkage between insulin signaling and Gαi2. The loss of PTP1B expression may explain, in part, the loss of PTP1B activity in the iQ205L transgenic mice. Activation of Gαi2 in mouse adipocytes with lysophosphatidic acid was shown to decrease PTP1B activity, whereas pertussis toxin inactivates Gαi2, blocks lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated inhibition of PTP1B activity, and blocks tonic suppression of PTP1B activity by Gαi2. Elevation of intracellular cAMP in fat cells is shown to increase PTP1B activity, whereas either depression of cAMP levels or direct activation of Gαi2 suppresses PTP1B. These data provide the first molecular basis for the interplay between Gαi2 and insulin signaling, i.e. activation of Gαi2 can suppress both the expression and activity of PTP1B in insulin-sensitive tissues."

In general, bHLH domains bind a consensus DNA element, the so-named E-box (CANNTG), and are required for oligomerization. PAS domains, which are found in all kingdoms, are involved in protein-protein interactions and ligand/inducer binding, acting as environmental sensors (1Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). PAS-containing proteins typically have two such conserved, repeated domains that are separated by a spacer region. PAS domains are not always contiguous with the bHLH DNA binding domain. ARNT heterodimerizes in vivo with other bHLH PAS proteins, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), to form activated DNA binding complexes (11Gradin K. McGuire J. Wegner R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgård R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Formation of the AHR/ARNT heterodimer requires the binding of polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which are known exogenous ligands for AHR and mediate carcinogenesis via AHR·ARNT complex activation (reviewed in Ref. 12Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The resulting AHR·ARNT complex binds an atypical E-box DNA sequence, TNGCGTG, thereby activating the transcription of a number of target genes by direct interaction with general transcription factors, such as transcription factor IIB (13Swanson H.I. Yang J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar). Among the activated genes are CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, cytochrome oxidases that metabolize polycyclic and aromatic compounds to electrophilic derivatives, which are the ultimate chemical agents that attack DNA. The AHR/ARNT heterodimer also activates transcription of the mdr1 multidrug transporter, albeit indirectly (14Mathieu M.-C. Lapierre I. Brault K. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4819-4827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The HIF1α/ARNT heterodimer (HIF1) senses the oxygen tension in cells and, under hypoxic conditions, activates the transcription of a number of genes, the promoters of which contain the E-box sequence, TACGTGCT. Transcription is activated by formation of a HIF1-(CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)/ATF1)-(p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein)) complex on the cognate DNA (15Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Among the genes regulated are erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glycolytic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and heme oxygenase-1, all of which allow the cell to cope with lower oxygen levels (reviewed in Ref. 16Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). HIF1 also plays a role in iron homeostasis by its activation of the ceruloplasm gene (17Mukhopadhyay C.K. Mazumder B. Fox P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21048-21054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This HIF1-mediated response has been found to be crucial for angiogenesis and solid tumor formation (18Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S.

Neither AHR or HIF1α homodimers nor AHR/HIF1α heterodimers have been observed. In contrast to the in vivo importance of AHR/ARNT and HIF1α/ARNT heterodimers, the biological relevance of ARNT homodimers is unclear. No physiological role for ARNT homodimers has yet been defined, and in vitro coimmunoprecipitation studies have been unable to detect the homodimeric ARNT complex (21Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However,in vivo reporter gene assays have demonstrated that putative ARNT homodimers can activate transcription via E-box binding (3Antonsson C. Arulampalam V. Whitelaw M.L. Pettersson S. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13968-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is expected that ARNT homodimers would bind to the CACGTG E-box as do other canonical bHLH proteins, whereas ARNT in one of its heterodimeric complexes would bind one half-site of an asymmetric consensus binding site, with the heterodimeric partner binding the other, nonconsensus half-site. As demonstrated for the AHR/ARNT heterodimer, ARNT is located on the GTG E-box half-site, and AHR is situated on the less restrictive (A/C)(G/C/T)(A/T) non-E-box half-site (24Basci S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432-438PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of several bHLH domain-containing peptides bound to DNA have been determined by x-ray crystallography, including MAX, USF, MyoD, Pho4, E47, and SREBP1 (5Ferré-D'Amaré A.R.

From these structures, it has been determined that the basic region is helical, and its residues make the primary contacts to the DNA, whereas the helix-loop-helix region is largely responsible for dimerization. Additionally, synthetic peptides of several bHLH domains have been characterized biochemically and biophysically, of which the Deadpan bHLH was perhaps the most rigorously investigated (25Wendt H. Thomas R.M. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5735-5743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Muhle-Goll C. Nilges M. Pastore A.

However, these latter studies do not address the biochemical and biophysical properties of the bHLH-PAS family members, in particular ARNT. To delineate the structural mechanism of transcription regulation by ARNT either as a homodimer or an AHR/ARNT or HIF1α/ARNT heterodimer, we have undertaken a series of biophysical and biochemical studies on a chemically synthesized, 56-residue peptide that encompasses the ARNT-bHLH domain. Specifically, we have used circular dichroism (CD) to determine the extent to which the peptide is folded in both the presence and absence of DNA and equilibrium sedimentation to determine its oligomerization state. Furthermore, using fluorescence anisotropy, we have determined the binding affinity of this peptide for E-box DNA under a variety of experimental conditions. As a complement to our sedimentation equilibrium experiments, we conducted dynamic light scattering studies to evaluate the oligomerization state and monodispersity of the peptide at higher concentrations. Unexpectedly, significant biochemical differences from other bHLH proteins such as Deadpan and Tal were found. Moreover, the data provide evidence that the bHLH of ARNT can form homodimers, which might have biological relevance. A peptide encompassing residues 90–145 of ARNT (ARNT-bHLH) was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a Milligen/Biosearch peptide synthesizer. Cleavage and deprotection reactions were carried out in trimethylsilane bromide, ethanediol, m-cresol, thioanisol, and trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h at 0 °C under a nitrogen blanket to ensure that cysteine residues remained reduced after removal of the trityl protection groups. The cleaved peptide was filtered through a medium-sintered glass filter to separate it from resin. The peptide was then washed with trifluoroacetic acid. The filtrate and washings were combined, and all liquid was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The peptide was precipitated with diethyl ether and filtered through a medium-sintered glass funnel. The peptide was dried under a stream of nitrogen, dissolved in 10% acetic acid, and lyophilized. The peptide was then dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified on a Vydac C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column with a mobile phase of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and a linear 60-min gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile. Chromatography runs were recorded with a diode array detector and analyzed using Millennium 2000 software (Waters). The peptide eluted at 73% acetonitrile. Fractions from 70 to 74% were pooled and rechromatographed. The purity of the peptide was ascertained by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Circular dichroism experiments were performed with a Jasco-J500 instrument. An E-box-containing oligonucleotide, ARNDNA (5′-GGCTCAGTCACGTGACTGAGC-3′), was purchased from Oligos, Etc. This sequence was chosen to contain the consensus RTCACGTGAY sequence determined to be recognized by ARNT using a site affinity and amplification assay (23Swanson H.I. Yang J.-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide, which has an unpaired 5′ guanosine upon duplex formation, was resuspended from the lyophilized pellet in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, such that the final concentration of single-stranded oligonucleotide was 2.0 mm. The concentration was calculated using data that were provided by Oligos, Etc. for each strand. The palindromic strands were annealed by heating to 80 °C, followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. Complete annealing was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The final concentration of duplex DNA was determined by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 260 nm and using the equation A = εcl, where A is the absorbance at 260 nm, ε is the known extinction coefficient for double-stranded DNA, 0.02 µg−1 cm−1 (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatas T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: E5Google Scholar), c is the concentration of DNA in µg/ml, and l is the path length through the cuvette, 1 cm. The molecular weight of the duplex oligonucleotide (13.0 kDa) was subsequently used to calculate the molar concentration of ARNDNA. The CD spectra of both 100 µmARNT-bHLH peptide, calculated for a monomer, and 50 µmduplex ARNDNA in Buffer A (50 mm NaCl or 50 mmNaF, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) were measured from 260 to 180 nm at 20 °C in a 0.01-cm cell. The substitution of NaF for NaCl had no impact on the spectra (data for NaCl not shown). The spectrum of 100 µm ARNT containing 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE) or 50 µm duplex ARNDNA oligonucleotide was also measured. The final reported spectra are averages of 10 runs. To measure any changes in peptide secondary structure upon binding DNA, the CD difference spectrum was calculated by subtracting the spectrum of ARNDNA alone from that of the ARNDNA/ARNT mixture. The concentration of the peptide solution was verified by amino acid analysis. The secondary structures were analyzed using the variable selection method (32Compton L.A. Mathews C.K. Johnson W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization experiments were done with a PanVera Beacon fluorescence polarization system (PanVera Corp.). 5′-Fluoresceinated oligonucleotides corresponding to ARNDNA and theEscherichia coli purF operator (Oligos, Etc.) (ARNDNA, 5′-F-GCTCAGTCACGTGACTGAGCCCCTTGCTCAGTCACGTGACTGAGC-3′,purF 5′-F-AAAGAAAACGTTTGCGTACCCCCTACGCAAACGTTTTCTTT-3′) were self-annealed in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, by heating to 80 °C followed by flash cooling to form a stem-loop structure with the E-box motif (underlined) or purF operator motif, respectively, at the center of the stem. Oligonucleotide concentrations were calculated as described for ARNDNA used in CD experiments. Binding was assayed in a 1-ml volume at 25 °C. Unless otherwise noted in the text, the components of each binding experiment were 2 nm fluoresceinated DNA and 1.0 µg/ml poly(d[I·C]) in Buffer A (50 mm NaCl or NaF, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Poly(d[I·C]) (Sigma) was included as a control for nonspecific DNA binding. It is expressed in µg/ml rather than molar to reflect the fact that the exact length of the poly(d[I·C]) molecules is not discrete but averages between 1200 and 3000 base pairs. In one set of experiments, the amount of poly(d[I·C]) included was varied to 0.0, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/ml. After each addition of peptide, samples were incubated in the Beacon instrument at 25 °C for 30 s before a measurement was taken. The 30-s incubation allowed equilibrium to be reached. The millipolarization (P ×10−3 where Pis polarization) at each titration point represents the average of eight measurements integrated over 6 s. Samples were excited at 490 nm, and emission was measured at 530 nm. The data of each binding isotherm were analyzed by curve fitting using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Corp.). Because the calculated dissociation constants were all greater than 20 nm and the experimental DNA concentration was 10-fold less than this value, it was assumed that the concentration of protein bound to DNA was negligible in comparison with the total protein concentration. Therefore, the following equation could be applied (33Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), P=((Pbound−Pfree)[ARNT]/(Kd+[ARNT]))+PfreeEquation 1 where P is the polarization measured at a given total concentration of peptide ([ARNT]), Pfree is the initial polarization of the free DNA, andPbound is the maximum polarization of specifically bound DNA. Nonlinear least squares analysis was used to determine Pfree, Pbound, and Kd. Anisotropy studies at higher salt concentrations (Buffer B: 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4) were done with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer with T optics at 25 °C. The sample was excited at 480 nm, and the parallel and perpendicular polarization components of fluorescein emission were measured at 520 nm. Except for the buffer, the components in the assay were the same as those used in measuring anisotropy in lower salt buffer. After each addition of peptide, the solution was incubated for 1 min to attain equilibrium. Each titration point is an average of 12 measurements, each integrated over 30 s. Data were analyzed using Scientist MicroMath software. Anisotropy was measured as the function of concentration of ARNT-bHLH (µm) added to the binding reaction, and the data were fit using a two-step binding model that follows. Anisotropy,A, is related to polarization, P, byA = 2P/(3 − P) (Ref.33Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The equilibrium model that best describes the initial phase of the higher salt binding isotherm is two ARNT-bHLH monomers binding to the ARNDNA duplex, i.e. 2 ARNT-bHLH monomers + ARNDNA ↔ ARNT-bHLH·ARNDNA + ARNT-bHLH ↔ ARNT-bHLH dimer·ARNDNA. The equation to describe this cooperative binding is as follows, ν1=CP/CHALFP+CPEquation 2 where ν1 is the average number of bound ARNT-bHLH molecules per molecule of ARNDNA, C is the peptide concentration (µm), and CHALF is the concentration at half-saturation of the cooperative binding event.P, the Hill coefficient, is the average number of interacting sites on ARNDNA, which is two. P is also the measure of cooperativity in a binding event. The following equilibrium model describes the second phase of binding: 1 ARNT-bHLH dimer·ARNDNA + 1 ARNT-bHLH dimer ↔ 2 ARNT-bHLH dimers·ARNDNA. In noncooperative binding, all binding sites are equivalent and independent of each other. The binding curve is a rectangular hyperbola (34van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1985: 598-628Google Scholar) and is defined by the equation, ν2=K[ARNT]/(1+K[ARNT])Equation 3 where ν2 is the average number of ARNT-bHLH dimers bound to the ARNT-bHLH dimer·ARNDNA complex formed in the first step.K is the association constant of the noncooperative event, and [ARNT] is the concentration of free ARNT-bHLH monomers. At high concentrations (>23 µm), ARNT-bHLH is dimeric. In this step of binding, only the dimer-bound DNA is available for further binding of ARNT. Dynamic light scattering studies were done using a DynaPro-801 instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc.). All solutions were filtered through 0.1-µm Anotop filters (Whatman) to remove aggregated peptide and other particulates. Scattering of the ARNT-bHLH peptide was analyzed at concentrations of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/ml (0.78 and 1.56 mm ARNT-bHLH monomer, respectively) in its storage buffer (40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Peptide-DNA experiments were performed by mixing 1.56 mmARNT-bHLH peptide with 1.0 mm oligonucleotide (in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5), resulting in final concentrations of 0.78 and 0.50 mm each molecule, respectively. Under these experimental conditions, there is stoichiometric binding (data not shown). Reported scattering values are the averages of at least 25 scans of 30 s each. All data were analyzed using AutoPro 4.0 PC software (Protein Solutions, Inc.). Dynamic light scattering uses the Brownian motion of molecules in solution, which causes scattered light intensity to fluctuate (35Schurr J.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 4: 371-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These fluctuations are measured by the DynaPro instrument at 20 different times between 3 and 3000 µs. An exponential decay function is generated from the scattering data. The rate of decay of this function is used to determine the translational diffusion coefficient,DT. The radius of hydration, RH, is then calculated using the following DT =kT/6πηRH, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and η is the solvent viscosity. RH is defined as the radius of a hypothetical hard sphere that diffuses with the same speed as the particle under examination. However, macromolecules are non-spherical and solvated. Therefore, the molecular weight (Mr) of a macromolecule is estimated usingMrversus RHcalibration curves developed from standards of known molecular weight and size. Thus, the Mr estimate of a given particle is subject to error if it deviates from the shape and solvation of the molecules used as standards. The molecular weight for protein macromolecules is estimated from a curve that fits the equation Mr = [1.6800 ·RH]2.3398, as implemented in the AutoPro software. A similar calibration curve for oligonucleotides has not yet been developed and, hence, precludes an analysis of the ARNDNA alone. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were done with a Model E analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Corp.) at 25 °C. A solution of 5 µm ARNDNA and 10 µm ARNT-bHLH was diluted 1:1 and 1:2 in Buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris, pH 7.4). Buffer B was placed in the reference compartment, and sample solutions were loaded into sample compartments of double sector cells. The initial experiment was run at 20,000 rpm for 24 h because the heaviest species expected was a 38-kDa complex of an ARNT-bHLH tetramer bound to double-stranded DNA. The distribution of the components at equilibrium was determined by measuring the UV absorption of each cell at 280 nm. However, at this wavelength we were unable to differentiate between peptide or DNA alone and peptide-DNA complexes. Given the inability to distinguish DNA from poly(d(I·C]) peptide at 280 nm, we used 5′-fluorescein-labeled DNA in some studies. Samples with 10 µm fluoresceinated ARNDNA and 40 µm ARNT-bHLH peptide were allowed to equilibrate for 20 h at 20,000 rpm. The samples were monitored at 494 nm, the absorption maximum of fluorescein. Only fluoresceinated DNA and peptide-DNA complexes are observed at this wavelength, without interference from free peptide. Data acquisition and analyses were done with Ultrascan software (Borries Demeler), and Scientist (MicroMath) was used for experimental data fitting. Weight average molecular weight for a single species model was calculated using the formula. C=C0+(CM−C0)·eMA(1−νρ)ω2(r2−rM2)/2RTEquation 4 The value MA represents the average molecular weight of all sedimenting species. rM is the distance from the meniscus to the axis of the rotor, ris the distance between each point along the concentration gradient and the rotor axis, and C0 and CMare the concentrations at points r andrM, respectively. ω, ν, ρ, (1 − νρ),R, and T represent angular velocity, partial specific volume, density, buoyancy, gas constant, and temperature, respectively. We synthesized a 56-aminoacyl residue polypeptide that corresponds to the bHLH DNA binding domain of the ARNT protein as determined by amino acid sequence homology with other bHLH proteins (Refs. 5Ferré-D'Amaré A.R.

CD spectra were measured to determine the secondary structure content of the ARNT-bHLH peptide and to observe any changes in secondary structure upon binding to DNA. CD spectra were also taken in the presence of TFE. TFE increases helicity of polypeptides by selectively destabilizing solvent-amide group interactions. Compact conformations such as α helices, which maximize intramolecular polypeptide backbone hydrogen bonding and lessen solvent exposure are favored (36Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen J.T. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Medium-sized peptides with an intrinsic tendency to assume a helical conformation in water show an increase in helicity upon the addition of TFE. Hence, the CD spectra of the peptide with and without 50% TFE were measured to affirm that the synthetic peptide had the ability to adopt a helical structure. In both cases, spectra were obtained with strong maxima at 190 nm and double minima at 200–210 and 222 nm, characteristic of α helices. The amplitude of the spectrum for ARNT-bHLH with TFE was approximately three times that of peptide in buffer alone (Fig.2A). Secondary structure analysis using the variable selection method showed that the helicity increased from 12.8 to 68.0% upon the addition of TFE (TableI). The predicted maximum helicity attainable by the peptide is 82.1%. This maximum is calculated by assuming that the basic region, helix 1, and helix 2 (Fig. 1) would be completely α-helical, as observed in the crystal structu"

Although potentially therapeutic, generating reproducible and sufficiently large grafts remains a challenge. To control myoblast proliferation in situ, we created a chimeric receptor composed of a modified FK506-binding protein (F36V) fused with the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 cytoplasmic domain. Mouse MM14 myoblasts were transfected with this construct and treated with AP20187, a dimeric F36V ligand, to induce receptor dimerization. Transfected myoblasts proliferated in response to dimerizer (comparable with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) treatment), whereas the dimerizer had no effect on non-transfected cells. Similar to bFGF treatment, dimerizer treatment blocked myotube formation and myosin heavy chain expression and stimulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation in transfected cells. Non-transfected cells differentiated normally and showed no MAP kinase phosphorylation with dimerizer treatment. Furthermore, myoblasts treated with dimerizer for 30 days in culture reduced MAP kinase phosphorylation, withdrew from the cell cycle, and differentiated normally upon drug withdrawal, demonstrating reversibility of the effect. Thus, forced dimerization of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 cytoplasmic domain reproduces critical aspects of bFGF signaling in myoblasts.

The success of such cell-based therapies is dependent on transplanting an appropriate number of myoblasts to elicit the desired therapeutic effect, which remains a significant challenge. One strategy for improving the outcome of myoblast grafting involves the implantation of a smaller number of cells initially, followed by in vivo expansion using mitogenic factors to increase graft size and improve integration with host tissue. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)1 induces proliferation of skeletal myoblasts and prevents differentiation and fusion into multinucleated myotubes (8Clegg C.H. Linkhart T.A. Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Thus its administration may be envisioned as a method for inducing grafted myoblast proliferation. However, bFGF can also stimulate proliferation of non-graft cells such as tissue fibroblasts, which may lead to fibrosis. A method for inducing proliferation selectively in the grafted cells would facilitate myoblast expansion without these undesired effects. The myoblast proliferative response to bFGF is mediated through dimerization of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1, Refs. 9Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholarand 10Templeton T.J. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling molecules. Although the exact mechanism by which this signal is transduced is not completely understood, it has been demonstrated that activation of the MAP kinase pathway is necessary for cell cycle progression (11Jones N.C. Fedorov Y.V. Rosenthal R.S. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) in MM14 cells. However, FGFR-1 dimerization leads to the activation of a number of other signaling molecules including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and Src, which may interact with proteins of the MAPK pathway to affect mitogenesis as well as chemotaxis and cell survival (12Klint P.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternative approach to activating receptor signaling has been developed in which the intracellular domain of a receptor is fused with a drug binding domain, followed by expression of the chimeric receptor in the target cell type (15Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Treatment of the transfected cells with a bivalent drug results in forced dimerization of the receptor signaling domains in the absence of growth factor. This technique has been applied successfully to induce expansion of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells expressing chimeric cytokine receptors in vitro (16Richard R.E. Wood B. Zeng H.

Chien S. Otto K.G. Richard R.E. Emery D.W. Blau C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) following bone marrow transplantation. To generate a cell line in which FGFR-1 signaling occurs independently of bFGF binding, we transfected mouse MM14 skeletal myoblasts with a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric receptor consisting of a modified FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domain, F36V (20Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), fused with the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR-1. The F36V domain contains a binding site for a bivalent synthetic ligand, AP20187 (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). In the present study, we demonstrate that addition of AP20187 to MM14 cells stably expressing the fusion receptor stimulates myoblast proliferation, blocks differentiation into myotubes, and mimics bFGF signaling by activating the MAP kinase pathway. bFGF was kindly donated by Scios Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). AP20187 was provided by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. The FGFR-1 cytoplasmic domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a rat FGFR-1β cDNA template (B. J. Ballermann and co-workers, Ref. 21Kim E.G. Kwon H.M. Burrow C.R. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F66-F73PubMed Google Scholar; S540048) using Taq polymerase (Promega) and primers flanking the cytoplasmic domain (sense: 5′-GGGGGGGTCGACAAGATGAAGAGCGGCACCAAGAAGA-3′ and antisense: 5′-GGGGGGGTCGACGCGCCGTTTGAGTCCACCATTTGCA-3′) to whichSalI restriction sites were added (underlined). Following amplification, the fragment was digested with SalI and ligated in-frame into the pBJF36V cloning vector (22Blau C.A. Peterson K.R. Drachman J.G. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3076-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) at the C-terminal end of the F36V domain. This created a fusion gene containing the c-Src myristylation domain, the modified FKBP domain (F36V), the FGFR-1 cytoplasmic domain, and a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the C terminus. The resulting F36Vfgfr-1 region was excised by aSacII/BamHI double digest and subsequently ligated into a bicistronic expression vector (23Cheng L. Du C. Murray D. Tong X. Zhang Y.A. Chen B.P. Hawley R.G. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) containing the murine stem cell virus long terminal repeat with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter upstream of an internal ribosomal entry sequence. The resulting F36Vfgfr-1 expression plasmid (Fig. 1) was sequenced in both directions and subsequently expressed in retroviral packaging cell lines. GP+E86 ecotropic packaging cells were transiently transfected with F36Vfgfr-1 plasmid DNA using Superfect (Qiagen) transfection reagent. After 24 h, supernatant was collected, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 8 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and transferred to a cell culture dish containing PA317 amphotropic packaging cells. After 24 h, the retroviral supernatant was removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). PA317 cells stably expressing the F36Vfgfr-1 construct were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACStar Plus cell sorter (BD Biosciences) based on GFP expression. Stably transfected cells were expanded in culture, and supernatants were collected at 24-h intervals and stored at −80 °C until subsequent transfections were performed. Murine skeletal myoblasts (MM14, Ref. 24Linkhart T.A. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were maintained at low density in growth medium (Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15% horse serum (ICN Flow), 6 ng/ml bFGF, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.)) on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes. MM14 cells were transfected by incubation with PA317 F36Vfgfr-1 retroviral supernatant supplemented with 15% horse serum, 8 µg/ml polybrene, and 6 ng/ml bFGF. Following a 24-h incubation, retroviral supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium. Stably transfected MM14 myoblasts were selected by FACS based on GFP expression as described above. The resulting non-clonal population of GFP-positive cells was expanded in growth medium. Transfected MM14 and wild type non-transfected MM14 cells were plated into gelatin-coated 24-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/well. Cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 6 ng/ml bFGF or 0, 10, or 100 nm AP20187. The medium was then replaced with 400 µl of fresh F10 growth medium, and 40 µl of 5 mg/ml MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma) was added. Following a 4-h incubation, the cells were lysed with 550 µl of lysis buffer (10% SDS, 0.1 m HCl). The relative level of MTT conversion in each sample was then measured by spectrophotometry (λ = 570 nm). The absorbance values were normalized to the mean absorbance of the bFGF-treated, non-transfected cells. A Student's t test was performed to determine statistical significance at p ≤ 0.05. Transfected and non-transfected MM14 myoblasts were plated into gelatin-coated 6-well plates at a density of 2.5–6.0 × 103 cells/cm2. Cells were incubated in differentiation medium/ (Ham's F-10 medium, 10% horse serum, 0.9 mm CaCl2 (final concentration 1.2 mm), 6 µg/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.)) with 6 ng/ml bFGF, 100 nm AP20187, or were left untreated. After 48 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and the extent of differentiation was assessed by myosin heavy chain immunocytochemistry. Fixed cultures were blocked with 1.5% normal rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories) in PBS, followed by incubation with MF-20 hybridoma supernatant (1:10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) to detect sarcomeric myosin heavy chain. Plates were washed with PBS, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20; Dako Corp.). Cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 dye (4 µg/ml; Molecular Probes) to visualize myoblast nuclei. Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Transfected and non-transfected MM14 myoblasts were plated into gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes at a density of 2–5 × 105 cells/cm2. Cells were incubated in growth medium with either 6 ng/ml bFGF, 100 nmAP20187, or were left untreated. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 240 µg/ml pefabloc, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and scraped and transferred to tubes on ice. Cell lysate protein concentrations were assessed by BCA assay (Pierce) to ensure equivalent loading. Samples were loaded onto precast 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% nonfat milk (Carnation) and probed with a polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000). The membranes were then washed with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:20,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Blots were developed by incubation with chemiluminescent reagent (SuperSignal West Dura; Pierce) followed by exposure to ECL film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected MM14 cells were cultured for 30 days in growth medium supplemented with 100 nm AP20187 with complete media exchange every 1–2 days. Following dimerizer treatment, naive and 30-day AP20187-treated cells were seeded into gelatin-coated 6-well dishes at 2–8 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured in differentiation medium supplemented with 6 ng/ml bFGF, 100 nm AP20187, or were left untreated. After 3 days in culture, 10 µm BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the culture medium for 1 h, followed by fixation with a 9:1 MeOH/acetic acid solution for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were treated with 1.5 n HCl for 15 min at 37 °C, neutralized by washing twice with 0.1 m borax, pH 8.5 and once with PBS, and then the samples were blocked with 1.5% normal rabbit serum in PBS and incubated overnight with a rat anti-BrdUrd primary antibody (1:100; Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc.). Cells were then incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (1:100; Vector Laboratories) and were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 dye. Total nuclei and BrdUrd-positive nuclei were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) and were manually counted (∼400 nuclei/well) from triplicate wells. A Student'st test was performed to determine statistical significance at p ≤ 0.05. Mouse MM14 myoblasts were stably transfected with a retrovirus encoding a chimeric receptor composed of a modified FK506-binding protein domain (F36V) fused with the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR-1 (Fig.1). The receptor construct also includes a hemagglutinin epitope tag as well as an N-terminal myristylation site to target the protein to the plasma membrane. Cells expressing this construct were selected by FACS based on expression of the reporter protein eGFP. Subsequent studies were performed using a polyclonal population of GFP-positive myoblasts with non-transfected wild type MM14 cells used as controls. In the absence of bFGF, wild type MM14 cells cease proliferating and differentiate into multinucleated myotubes expressing structural proteins such as myosin heavy chain. Wild type and F36Vfgfr-1-transfected MM14 cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 48 h in the presence of 6 ng/ml bFGF or a bivalent F36V ligand, AP20187. Following the treatment period, the relative number of cells/ well was assessed by MTT assay (Fig.2). Cell number was normalized to the bFGF-treated control wells. In the absence of bFGF, wild type cells ceased proliferating, resulting in a reduced cell number in comparison to bFGF-treated cells (24.2 ± 1.6 versus 100 ± 8.6%). Transfected MM14 samples also had significantly lower cell numbers in the absence of bFGF (44.8 ± 5.1 versus120.3 ± 13.8%). Treatment of transfected cells with 10 or 100 nm AP20187, however, resulted in myoblast proliferation rates comparable with bFGF-treated controls (108.6 ± 7.5% and 122.0 ± 11.6%, respectively). The mean number of cells/well in AP20187-treated transfected cells was not significantly different from bFGF-treated transfected cells (p > 0.05) at either concentration. Treatment with 10 or 100 nm AP20187 did not stimulate proliferation in non-transfected control cells (26.5 ± 0.9% and 31.9 ± 1.6%, respectively). Thus, dimerization of the FGFR-1 cytoplasmic domain by AP20187 stimulated myoblast proliferation to the same extent as direct addition of bFGF. Interestingly, transfected cells appeared to proliferate at somewhat higher levels than non-transfected cells regardless of treatment (see “Discussion”). This difference was not significant between wild type and transfected cells treated with bFGF (p > 0.05); however, the number of cells in untreated transfected wells was significantly higher than in untreated wild type cells (p < 0.005). Upon withdrawal or depletion of bFGF from the culture medium, wild type MM14 cells exit the cell cycle and begin to differentiate. Differentiation is characterized by expression of muscle-specific proteins (such as sarcomeric myosin heavy chains) followed by myoblast fusion to form multinucleated myotubes. To determine whether AP20187 treatment can prevent myoblast differentiation in the absence of bFGF, wild type and F36Vfgfr-1-transfected MM14 cells were cultured for 48 h in differentiation medium (low serum, high insulin, and high calcium compared with growth medium) containing either 6 ng/ml bFGF or 100 nm AP20187. Untreated samples were included as controls. Cells were subsequently fixed, and immunocytochemical staining was performed to detect sarcomeric myosin heavy chain expression (Fig.3). As expected, wild type cells treated with bFGF remained mononucleated and did not express myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3A), whereas bFGF withdrawal resulted in formation of myosin-positive multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 3B). Similarly, cells expressing the FGFR fusion protein remained mononucleated and myosin-negative after bFGF treatment (Fig.3D) and differentiated normally after growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 3E). In contrast, treatment of the transfected cells with AP20187 completely prevented formation of myotubes and also blocked myosin heavy chain expression (Fig.3F). AP20187 had no effect on control non-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, AP20187 appeared to block differentiation by inducing dimerization of the FGFR signaling domains in a manner similar to bFGF treatment. Signaling studies were performed with whole cell lysates from MM14 cells to determine whether the observed bFGF-like effects of dimerizer treatment were caused by the activation of similar pathways. Wild type and F36Vfgfr-1-transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 6 ng/ml bFGF, 100 nm AP20187, or were left untreated. Western blots from cell lysates were probed with an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated forms of ERK 1/2, MAP kinases that are phosphorylated in response to FGFR-1 activation. Neither wild type nor transfected cells showed significant phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in the absence of treatment (Fig.4). After bFGF treatment both populations showed significant ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. The transfected cells actually showed an exaggerated ERK 1/2 phosphorylation after bFGF treatment (see “Discussion”). AP20187 treatment did not induce ERK phosphorylation in wild type MM14s. Importantly, transfected cells treated with AP20187 exhibited extensive phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, demonstrating that AP20187-induced activation of the chimeric receptor F36Vfgfr-1 can stimulate MAPK activation in the absence of bFGF. Although for grafting purposes controlled proliferation of transplanted myoblasts may be beneficial, uncontrolled proliferation may lead to undesirable effects such as cardiac tumor generation. To determine whether the mitogenic effect of AP20187 on transfected myoblasts is reversible, cells were cultured in growth medium supplemented with 100 nm AP20187 for 30 days. After the culture period, cells were transferred to gelatin-coated 6-well plates and cultured in differentiation medium with or without AP20187 for an additional 2 days. As was observed previously, dimerizer-treated myoblasts fused to form multinucleated myotubes and expressed myosin heavy chain upon mitogen withdrawal (Fig. 5B), whereas cells treated with AP20187 continued to proliferate and failed to differentiate (Fig. 5A). To determine whether the observed differentiation was accompanied by a down-regulation in MAPK activity, cell lysates were collected from 30-day AP20187-treated cells cultured in differentiation medium in the presence or absence of dimerizer. Western blots probed with an antibody against the phosphorylated forms of ERK 1/2 demonstrated that ERK phosphorylation was reduced following dimerizer withdrawal in comparison with cells receiving continued AP20187 treatment (Fig. 5C). However, this reduced level of ERK phosphorylation was fairly high compared with that of untreated transfected or wild type cells (in which phosphorylated ERK was barely detectable), even though these cells differentiate normally. To further assess whether long term dimerizer treatment affects the differentiation capacity of transfected myoblasts, naive and 30-day dimerizer-treated cells were cultured in differentiation medium with or without bFGF or AP20187 for 3 days followed by a 1-h BrdUrd incubation. Cells were fixed, and immunocytochemistry was performed to identify BrdUrd-positive nuclei. The percentage of nuclei that incorporated BrdUrd in each sample was determined by a manual count to measure the fraction of cells undergoing cell division. The percentage of naive and dimerizer-treated cells incorporating BrdUrd was comparable in response to bFGF (27.3 ± 4.0% and 32.6 ± 2.1%; p> 0.05) and AP20187 (31.0 ± 3.9% and 34.1 ± 4.2%;p > 0.05). Importantly, the percentage of untreated naive and dimerizer-treated cells incorporating BrdUrd was substantially lower than bFGF- and AP20187-treated cells (6.2 ± 2.9% and 7.0 ± 1.3%; p > 0.05) and was not significantly different from each other. In summary, these results suggest that although long term dimerizer-treated cells may have higher MAPK activity levels than wild type or naive cells following mitogen withdrawal, they still differentiate normally and cease proliferating in the absence of AP20187. Thus extended dimerizer treatment does not appear to induce uncontrolled cell proliferation, although it is possible that prolonged signaling through the chimeric receptor may affect activity levels of downstream effector molecules. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that skeletal muscle stem cells, or satellite cells, can be isolated from adult tissue, expanded in culture, and reimplanted into the hearts of the donors to generate contractile muscle to replace scarring following myocardial infarction (2Atkins B.Z.

These successes have led to initiation of the first clinical trials of this technique (26Menasche P. Hagege A.A. Scorsin M. Pouzet B. Desnos M. Duboc D. Schwartz K. Vilquin J.T. Marolleau J.P. Lancet. 2001; 357: 279-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Despite its promise, myoblast grafting requires the harvesting and expansion of large numbers of cells, and graft size can vary enormously even when the injection procedure and cell number are kept consistent (27Reinecke H. Murry C.E. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 2000; 9: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These technical limitations may be overcome by developing a means of specifically and reversibly stimulating grafted skeletal muscle cell proliferation in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate that dimerization of the FGFR-1 cytoplasmic domain with a bivalent synthetic ligand, AP20187, can mimic critical aspects of bFGF-induced FGFR-1 signaling in myoblasts. Previous studies have demonstrated that bFGF is required for cell cycle progression and repression of differentiation in MM14 myoblasts (8Clegg C.H. Linkhart T.A. Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In the absence of bFGF, AP20187 stimulated proliferation and prevented differentiation in MM14 cells expressing the F36Vfgfr-1 chimera in a manner that was indistinguishable from bFGF treatment. Administration of AP20187 also activated the MAPK pathway in MM14 cells expressing the chimeric receptor, thereby reproducing key events involved in bFGF-mediated signal transduction. Importantly, cells treated with dimerizer for 30 days withdrew from the cell cycle and differentiated normally upon withdrawal of the dimerizer, demonstrating that the effect was reversible. Thus, the data presented offer proof of the concept that a genetically modified population of myoblasts can be expanded specifically and reversibly in response to a small synthetic molecule. It is interesting to compare our results with those recently published by Kudla et al. (28Kudla A.J. Jones N.C. Rosenthal R.S. Arthur K. Clase K.L. Olwin B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These investigators studied MM14 cells expressing a chimeric receptor composed of the PDGF-βR extracellular domain and the FGFR-1 intracellular domain. In response to PDGF-BB treatment, the MM14 cells (which express no intrinsic PDGF receptors) phosphorylated the chimeric cytoplasmic domains and activated the MAPK pathway. Similar to our results, activation of the chimeric receptor blocked myoblast differentiation. In contrast to our findings, however, activation of this chimeric receptor was insufficient to induce cell proliferation. It is not clear why we observed cell proliferation when they did not. Both systems employed forced dimerization of the FGFR-1 cytoplasmic domain in MM14 cells, and both resulted in MAPK activation, although our system used a small molecule to dimerize the receptors whereas the other system employed a relatively large dimeric protein ligand and included the extracellular domain of the PDGF receptor. It is possible that the extracellular domain of the PDGF receptor induced unfavorable allosteric changes in the FGFR-1 cytoplasmic domain. Alternatively, the spacing of the receptor dimers induced by PDGF binding may be different from that induced by AP20187 binding. Such differences may influence coupling of the receptor to additional downstream signaling pathways, e.g. PLCγ. We observed that treating transfected cells with dimerizer resulted in greater levels of MAPK phosphorylation than was seen when wild type cells were bFGF-treated. This result may be explained by differences in the level of endogenous FGFR-1 expression, as only ∼700 molecules are expressed on MM14 cells (29Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), compared with the chimeric receptor in which expression is driven by a retroviral promoter. We were surprised to note, however, that MM14 cells expressing the chimeric receptor demonstrated more robust MAPK activation than did wild type cells when both were treated with bFGF. Similarly, we observed that transfected myoblasts proliferated at a higher rate than non-transfected cells either basally or after bFGF treatment. Because the chimeric receptor cannot respond to bFGF, these data suggest that the modified receptor may have some constitutive activity. This hypothesis is in accordance with the work of Kudla et al. (30Kudla A.J. John M.L. Bowen-Pope D.F. Rainish B. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), who showed that overexpressing FGFR-1 in the absence of ligand could activate MAPK in MM14 cells. The level of activity in our cells was not sufficient, however, to interfere with myoblast differentiation, as the transfected cells differentiated normally upon withdrawal of AP20187 or bFGF, and MAPK phosphorylation was down-regulated in the absence of bFGF or AP20187 in both cell types. Another important distinction between bFGF and dimerizer treatment is that the dimerizer can only activate FGFR-1-mediated signal transduction, whereas bFGF can also bind to and activate isoforms of FGFR-2, -3, and -4 (31Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), thereby stimulating multiple receptor-induced signaling pathways within the same cell. Although FGFR-1 is the predominant FGFR subtype expressed in MM14 cells, this is an important consideration in comparing the effects of bFGF with dimerizer treatment (9Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Templeton T.J. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in cells that express multiple FGFR isoforms. Long term (30 days) treatment with dimerizer did not interfere with the ability of myoblasts to withdraw from the cell cycle or differentiate into myotubes. There were a few notable differences, however, between naive transfected cells and the long term-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 6, comparable fractions of naive and long term-treated cells were in S phase after bFGF or dimerizer treatment. On the other hand, when cell number was used to measure proliferation, the long term-treated cells showed increased cell accumulation compared with naive cells (data not shown). This suggests that the long term dimerizer treatment may select for a population of cells with shorter cell cycle times or greater survival rates. Additionally, we were surprised to note that bFGF treatment of the long term-treated cells actually resulted in reduced phosphorylation of ERK (n = 3 experiments; data not shown), despite the fact that the cells proliferated well in response to bFGF. Incubation with the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced proliferation of these cells when either bFGF or dimerizer was used to drive proliferation. Thus, it appears that the long term-treated cells require the MAP kinase pathway for proliferation, but steady-state levels of ERK phosphorylation do not reflect the pathway's activity following bFGF treatment. Taken together, the results presented support the hypothesis that dimerizer-mediated proliferation acts through induction of MAPK signaling, similar to bFGF treatment. The results also strongly suggest, however, that subtle differences in signaling dynamics exist between the two receptor pathways, which may be amplified following long term signaling through the chimeric receptor in the absence of bFGF. Importantly, transfected MM14 cells appeared phenotypically normal with respect to differentiation, and uncontrolled proliferation following dimerizer treatment was not observed. Using a small molecule to expand genetically modified myoblasts offers several advantages over conventional grafting approaches, including the possibility of using fewer cells for injection, better control over the graft size, and the potential for increasing cell-cell communication with host myocardium by reducing the intervening scar area. Use of a promoter active in myoblasts but not fibroblasts, e.g. the desmin promoter, may permit selective expansion of myoblasts from impure primary muscle cultures. Furthermore, the drug has proven non-toxic for in vivo applications (19Jin L. Zeng H. Chien S. Otto K.G. Richard R.E. Emery D.W. Blau C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The F36V modification of FKBP (20Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R.

https://openalex.org/W1533523398,"The inhibitory γ subunits of the retinal rod and cone photoreceptor type 6 retinal cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (PDEγ) are expressed in non-retinal tissues. Here, we show that PDEγ interacts with the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 signaling system to regulate the epidermal growth factor- and thrombin-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This is based upon several lines of evidence. First, the transfection of cells with an antisense rod PDEγ plasmid construct, which reduced endogenous rod PDEγ expression, ablated the epidermal growth factor- and thrombin-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Second, the transfection of cells with recombinant rod or cone PDEγ and/or G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 increased the stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase by epidermal growth factor or thrombin. In contrast, a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 phosphorylation-resistant rod PDEγ mutant failed to increase the epidermal growth factor- or thrombin-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and, in fact, functioned as a dominant negative. Thrombin also stimulated the association of endogenous rod PDEγ with dynamin II, which was increased in cells transfected with rod PDEγ or G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. Dynamin II plays a critical role in regulating endocytosis of receptor signal complexes required for activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Therefore, PDEγ may have an important role in promoting endocytosis of receptor signal complexes leading to the activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. We conclude that PDEγ is an entirely novel intermediate regulating mitogenic signaling from both receptor tyrosine kinase and G-protein-coupled receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048052435,"NOR is a rare inheritable polyagglutination phenomenon that has been described in two families. Our recent studies on these erythrocytes showed they contained at least two unique neutral glycosphingolipids, and based on their reactivity with Griffonia simplicifolia IB4 (GSL-IB4) isolectin (Kusnierz-Alejska, G., Duk, M., Storry, J. R., Reid, M. E., Wiecek, B., Seyfried, H., and Lisowska, E. (1999) Transfusion 39, 32–38), both oligosaccharide chains terminated with an α-galactose residue. The reactivity with GSL-IB4 suggested that these oligosaccharide chains terminated with a Galα1→3Gal- sequence and that anti-NOR agglutinins were common human anti-Galα1→3Gal xenoantibodies. In this report we describe the structure of one NOR component (NOR1) that migrated on thin-layer chromatographic plates in the region of pentaglycosylceramides. Treatment of this sample with α-galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase was followed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography with product detection by lectins and the anti-Gb4 monoclonal antibody. The results suggested that NOR1 was an α-galactosylated Gb4Cer with a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase-resistant GalNAc residue. Gas phase disassembly by ion trap mass spectrometry analysis showed the sequence to be Hex1→4HexN1→3Hex1→4Hex1→4Hex linked to a ceramide composed of C18 sphingosine and a C24 monounsaturated fatty acid. Together these data indicate NOR1 to be a novel Galα1→4GalNAcβ1→3Galα1→4Galβ1→4 Glc-Cer structure.

Additionally it has been shown that NOR glycolipids are recognized by human antibodies that were distinct from the known anti-Galα1→3Gal xenoantibodies. Human sera contain many “natural” anti-carbohydrate antibodies directed against structures absent on the cells of the host or present in a cryptic form. Polyagglutination of erythrocytes occurs when an unusual structure is exposed on the cell surface and is recognized by antibodies commonly present in human sera. Polyagglutination may be transiently acquired by the exposure of cryptic carbohydrate structures due to the action of microbial enzymes (TF, Tk, Th, and others) persistently acquired, e.g. by reversible repression of galactosyltransferase in the Tn syndrome, or may be related to inherited genetic alterations leading either to impaired biosynthesis of normal glycans (hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity associated with a positive acidified serum test) or to the appearance of a new structure on the erythrocyte surface (cold agglutinin disease) (1Beck M.L. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 37: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate antigens responsible for polyagglutination are also characterized by specific patterns of interaction with lectins (1Beck M.L. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 37: 186-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first case of an inheritable NOR polyagglutination was reported by Harris et al. in 1982 (2Harris P.A. Roman G.K. Moulds J.J. Bird G.W.G. Shah N.G. Vox Sang. 1982; 42: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using a panel of lectins, the authors identified a new type of polyagglutination that was enhanced after treatment of NOR erythrocytes with proteases and was inhibited by sheep hydatic cyst fluid or avian P1 substance. Recently a second case of NOR polyagglutination has been identified in a two-generation Polish family (3Kusnierz-Alejska G. Duk M. Storry J.R. Reid M.E. Wiecek B. Seyfried H. Lisowska E. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We found that polyagglutination of NOR erythrocytes, besides having the features described by Harris et al. (2Harris P.A. Roman G.K. Moulds J.J. Bird G.W.G. Shah N.G. Vox Sang. 1982; 42: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was enhanced by sialidase and abolished by α-galactosidase treatment. Several lines of evidence were obtained indicating that NOR erythrocytes possessed unique neutral glycosphingolipids. The agglutination of NOR erythrocytes was inhibited by a neutral glycosphingolipid fraction from NOR erythrocytes but not from control erythrocytes.

This lectin did not react with any glycolipid from blood group-compatible (A2) control erythrocytes. A faster migrating GSL-IB4-positive band was also detected with Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I) which also strongly stained paragloboside in control and NOR erythrocytes (3Kusnierz-Alejska G. Duk M. Storry J.R. Reid M.E. Wiecek B. Seyfried H. Lisowska E. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The strong reactivity of the NOR glycolipids with GSL-IB4, which reacts preferably with the Galα1→3Gal- sequence (4Wood C. Kabat E.A. Murphy A.L. Goldstein I.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggested the NOR erythrocytes contain glycolipid components that terminated with this structure. The Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc- structure is abundantly expressed in glycoproteins and glycolipids of nonprimate mammals and New World monkeys and is not present in Old World monkeys, apes, and humans (5Galili U. Masahiro T. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1999; 11: 317-327Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but xenoantibodies specific for this structure are present in all human sera and are one of major reasons for a hyperacute rejection of xenotransplants (5Galili U. Masahiro T. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1999; 11: 317-327Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NOR-positive individuals could synthesize the Galα1→3Gal-terminating oligosaccharide chain and that anti-NOR agglutinins are the common anti-Galα1→3Gal antibodies. The experiments described in this report were undertaken to find direct evidence for this hypothesis. The object of our study was to structurally identify the faster migrating NOR component separated by HPTLC that we have called NOR1. The results strongly suggest that NOR1 does not possess a Galα1→3Gal epitope but is a galactosylgloboside containing a linear pentaglycosidic chain terminated with a novel Galα1→4GalNAc- sequence. Moreover, it was shown that anti-NOR agglutinins are distinct from the known anti-Galα1→3Gal antibodies and may represent a new class of anti-carbohydrate antibodies present in human sera. The blood of a healthy NOR-positive person (T.S.) (100 ml) was donated, and the red blood cells were serologically typed as A2, MNss, P1. The blood group N antigen was located on the variant Sta glycophorin, which was accidentally found to be present in this family and not related to the NOR phenotype (3Kusnierz-Alejska G. Duk M. Storry J.R. Reid M.E. Wiecek B. Seyfried H. Lisowska E. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The control blood samples (and human sera) were obtained from the Regional Center of Blood Transfusion in Wroclaw. The blood was taken into an anticoagulant solution. Neutral glycosphingolipids were isolated from lyophilized membranes of human NOR and control erythrocytes and rabbit erythrocytes as described previously (3Kusnierz-Alejska G. Duk M. Storry J.R. Reid M.E. Wiecek B. Seyfried H. Lisowska E. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly the procedure included two chloroform/methanol (2:1 and 1:2, v/v) extractions, treatment of the extracted and evaporated material with 0.2 m KOH in methanol to remove phospholipids, desalting the neutralized samples on the Sephadex G-25 superfine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, and separation of neutral glycolipids from gangliosides on the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The neutral glycolipids used in the present work were additionally purified by acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine (2:1) and fractionated on the Florisil (Fischer Scientific) column. The glycolipid fractions were deacetylated with 0.2m KOH in methanol, neutralized, and desalted on the Sephadex G-25 superfine column (7Saito T. Hakomori S. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neutral glycolipids from NOR and rabbit erythrocytes were fractionated on the Kieselgel H type 60 (Merck) 25-ml column in chloroform. Glycolipids, dissolved in 200–300 µl of chloroform/methanol/water (55:45:10, v/v), were applied to the column and eluted with the same solvent. Fractions of ∼1 ml were collected, and 3–4-µl aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by HPTLC. The fractionated components were detected by orcinol staining and by means of GSL-IB4. This procedure was sufficient to purify rabbit pentaglycosylceramide (rGal-nLc4Cer) but did not separate the NOR1 glycolipid fraction from tetraglycosylceramides. The column fractions containing NOR1 were pooled, dried, and further purified by preparative TLC. The samples were applied to the HPTLC plates in 10-cm linear bands; the rGal-nLc4Cer (migrating similarly as NOR1) and Gb4Cer were applied on both sides. After development with chloroform/methanol/water (55:45:10, v/v), the middle part of the HPTLC band was covered with a glass plate, and both sides were sprayed lightly with the solution of 0.1% primuline in acetone/water (4:1, v/v). Gb4Cer and rGal-nLc4Cer were visualized with ultraviolet light. The glycolipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.1, v/v) from the unstained part of the plate corresponding to the position of rGal-nLc4Cer. For an improved separation of Gb4Cer and nLc4Cer, the preparative TLC was repeated. The samples eluted from the TLC plate were passed through the Sephadex G-25 superfine column in chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:4.5, v/v) and dried. The described procedures were also applied for the purification of Gb4Cer and nLc4Cer, which were used as reference compounds. The general procedures of Ostrander et al. (8Ostrander G.K. Levery S.B. Eaton H.L. Salyan M.E.K. Hakomori S. Holmes E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18716-18725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used with modifications. Green coffee bean α-galactosidase was purified as described previously (9Carchon H. De Bruyne C.K. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 41: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase was obtained from Sigma. This latter material had enzymatic activity toward GalNAc, and in this report we identify this preparation as β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. The glycolipid samples were solubilized in 50 µl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and mixed with 100 µl of 1% sodium deoxytaurocholate solution in 1:1 chloroform/methanol. The total volume was dried under nitrogen in a conical-bottom tube. For α-galactosidase treatment of NOR1 fractions, the samples were sonicated in 100 µl of 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 4.9) for 5 min at 37 °C and treated with 100 µl of 0.05m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.5 units of α-galactosidase. The samples were stirred for 62 h at 37 °C and supplemented with 100 and 50 µl of the enzyme solution after 20 and 45 h of incubation, respectively. Treatment with 50 µl (0.25 units) of the galactosidase solution for 22 h was sufficient for galactose release when using rGal-nLc4Cer as a substrate. Treatment with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase was performed in a similar way except using 0.2 m citrate buffer (pH 4.5) during sonication and incubation with 1.5 units of the enzyme for 46 h. The control samples were treated identically with respective buffers instead of enzyme solutions. Following incubation, the samples and controls were extracted with 5 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), vortexed, and centrifuged, and the lower phase was withdrawn and dried under a nitrogen stream. The samples were dissolved in a chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v) solution and applied to the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column prepared and packed using the same solvent. The eluted glycolipids were dried under a nitrogen stream. The murine monoclonal antibodies HJ6 anti-Gb4 (10Madassery J.V. Gillard B. Marcus D.M. Nahm M.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 823-829PubMed Google Scholar) and Gal-13 anti-Galα1→3Gal (11Galili U. Basbaum C.B. Shohet S.B. Buchler J. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4683-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. M. H. Nahm (Rochester, NY) and Dr. U. Galili (Chicago, IL), respectively. Lectins RCA-I and GSL-IB4 (both from Sigma) were biotinylated as described previously (12Duk M. Lisowska E. Wu J.H. Wu A.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Porcine erythrocyte glycophorin was prepared by the phenol extraction of membranes (13Lisowska E. Messeter L. Duk M. Czerwiñski M. Lundblad A. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The glycophorin was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the yield of 640 µg (of 1 mg applied)/1 ml of Sepharose. Human AB group serum (90 ml), inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C, was diluted 1:1 with 0.02m phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5 (PBS) and passed through the 10-ml affinity column (10 ml/h) at room temperature. The column was washed with PBS, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.5 m galactose in PBS. Fractions (1.6 ml) were dialyzed against PBS and monitored for their ability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes with the most active fractions pooled (10.5 ml). The protein concentration was ∼50 µg/ml. This solution agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes up to a 1:256 dilution and did not agglutinate NOR erythrocytes. The purified antibodies were stored in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide at 4 °C. The packed NOR erythrocytes (2 ml) were suspended in 12 ml of cold PBS. Six ml of cold PBS containing 40 µl of 25% glutaraldehyde (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was added dropwise with mixing, and the suspension was left at room temperature for 30 min. The erythrocytes were centrifuged, exhaustively washed with PBS, mixed with 2 ml of human serum (blood group AB), and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the erythrocytes were washed again and treated twice with 2 ml of 0.5 m galactose in PBS for 1 h. During all incubations the erythrocyte suspensions were occasionally vortexed. The erythrocytes were centrifuged, and the combined eluates were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C and concentrated by ultrafiltration to a volume of 1 ml. This solution agglutinated papain-treated NOR erythrocytes at the titer 32–64 and did not agglutinate untreated or papain-treated rabbit erythrocytes. The anti-NOR antibodies were stored in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide at 4 °C. The glutaraldehyde-fixed erythrocytes were washed several times with PBS and reused for antibody adsorption from the next serum samples. The glycolipid samples, solubilized in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), were applied to HPTLC plates (Kieselgel 60, Merck) and developed with chloroform/methanol/water (55:45:10, v/v). For the detection of glycolipids with lectins or antibodies (14Magnani J.L. Nilsson B. Brockhaus M. Zopf D. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14365-14369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the plates were dried, immersed in 0.05% polyisobutylmetacrylate (Aldrich) inn-hexane for 1 min, and dried. The plates were subsequently sprayed with TBS (0.05 m Tris buffer, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 7.4) and immersed in 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 1 h. To detect the glycolipids with lectins, the plates were overlaid successively with (i) biotinylated lectin, 5 µg/1 ml of TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h; (ii) ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) diluted 1:4000 with TBS-T for 1 h; and (iii) a substrate solution of nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma). The plates were washed with TBS after each incubation. The immunostaining with antibodies was done similarly, but instead of biotinylated lectins, the plates were overlaid with mouse or human antibody solutions and then with biotinylated goat antibodies against mouse Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or human Ig (Sigma) diluted with TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The plates were incubated with the primary antibody for 2.5 h at room temperature, except for mAb HJ6 there was an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Human antibodies, isolated as described above, were diluted 3× with TBS-T. Glycolipid methylation was achieved by dissolving samples in a suspension of NaOH/Me2SO prepared by vortex-mixing Me2SO and powdered sodium hydroxide (15Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3177) Google Scholar). After 1 h at room temperature, 50 µg of methyl iodide was added, and the suspension was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with occasional vortexing (16Reinhold V.N. Reinhold B.B. Chan S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 270: 377-402Crossref Google Scholar). The methylated product was back-extracted by adding 1 ml of chloroform, and the suspensions were washed four times with 2–3 ml of 30% acetic acid. Methylated samples were dried following chloroform extraction and were stored at −20 °C. The samples were redissolved to a concentration of 10 µm in a 1 mm solution of sodium acetate in 70:30 methanol/water just prior to analysis. Mass measurements were performed with an ion trap mass spectrometer (model LCQ, Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with electrospray ionization (17Reinhold V.N. Sheeley D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 3053-3059Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in methanol/water solutions (6:4, v/v) containing 0.25 mm NaOH and analyzed by syringe pump flow injection (1.5 µl/min) directly into the electrospray chamber. Ions were injected axially into the ion trap by a gate lens, and a trapping field was established with a 100–1100 kHz radio frequency applied to the ring electrode. The total neutral glycosphingolipid fraction isolated from NOR erythrocytes was fractionated on the silica gel column, and the fractions containing NOR1 were pooled and further purified by preparative HPTLC. For enzymatic experiments, the preparative HPTLC step was repeated to ensure complete elimination of tetraglycosylceramides, which were abundant in human erythrocytes. The obtained samples were still heterogeneous and contained several components migrating in the eluted area. However, the NOR1 glycolipid could be distinguished by specific reactions with lectins or antibodies, and ion trap analysis ensured it to be free of contaminating material by stepwise isolation and molecular disassembly (MSn). Our previous data (3Kusnierz-Alejska G. Duk M. Storry J.R. Reid M.E. Wiecek B. Seyfried H. Lisowska E. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggested that NOR glycolipids terminate with a Galα1→3Gal- sequence. Therefore, it seemed likely that NOR1 was formed by addition of α-galactose to nLc4Cer to give the structure Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer. A glycosphingolipid corresponding to this structure was known to be a major component of rabbit erythrocytes (18Stellner K. Saito H. Hakomori S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 133: 464-472Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar); thus, this material was purified from rabbit erythrocyte membranes to serve as a standard reference compound. NOR1 and the rabbit glycolipid rGal-nLc4Cer migrated similarly on HPTLC plates, and both reacted with the GSL-IB4 and RCA-I. However, treatment of NOR1 and rGal-nLc4Cer with the coffee bean α-galactosidase clearly indicated the glycolipids to be different. The rGal-nLc4Cer TLC band, detected with RCA-I, disappeared after α-galactosidase treatment, and as expected, the nLc4Cer band, also detectable with RCA-I, was identified as the reaction product (Fig. 1). The NOR1 was also degraded with α-galactosidase, but higher enzyme concentrations and longer incubation times were required. Moreover, no RCA-I-stained band was detected as a product (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the mAb Gal-13 (anti-Galα1→3Gal) reacted strongly with rGal-nLc4Cer on the TLC plate, while no detectable reaction was noted with NOR1 (not shown). To examine the possibility that NOR1 could be a galactosylated Gb4Cer, the anti-Gb4monoclonal antibody HJ6 was used. This antibody detected Gb4Cer in the NOR sample and also in control erythrocyte glycolipids. In addition, HJ6 reacted distinctly with NOR1 (Fig.2). In the partially purified NOR1 sample the mAb HJ6 detected the NOR1 component and showed weaker reactivity with an additional slower migrating component. Treatment of this preparation with α-galactosidase gave total transformation of the NOR1 component into Gb4Cer, while the additional HJ6-positive band remained unchanged (Fig. 2). These results strongly suggested that NOR1 was an α-galactosylated Gb4Cer. To examine how the α-galactose residue was attached to Gb4, the NOR1 sample was treated with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. After this treatment the NOR1 band was still detectable with the GSL-IB4 (Fig. 3) and mAb HJ6 (not shown), while the enzyme totally degraded Gb4Cer under identical conditions. The inability of β-hexosaminidase to release a GalNAc residue on NOR1 suggested that an α-galactose moiety may be linked to the terminal GalNAc residue of Gb4Cer.Figure 3The effect of β-hexosaminidase treatment of NOR1 examined with the GSL-IB4.

The samples provided the full scan spectra in the two left panels (Fig. 4). Higher resolution of the major ion in each spectrum (m/z 1776.3 and 1774.1) indicated they were singly charged and differed by 2 Da (Fig.4, right panels). Doubly charged ions were also observed at lower mass (m/z 899.42+ and 898.62+) (data not shown). Selection, activation, and fragmentation of the singly charged parents (MS2) provided a simple product ion spectrum dominated by an identical oligosaccharide fragment, m/z 1116.7 (Fig.5, NOR1; Fig. 6, rGal-nLc4Cer from rabbit RBCs). Thus, the common oligosaccharide mass indicated that the 2 Da difference in the parent ion was associated with unsaturation in the ceramide moiety. The rabbit sample did show a unique and facile loss of the nonreducing terminal trisaccharide,m/z 1106.9 (Fig.6). Enhanced rupture proximal to aminosugar residues has been long recognized, and in this case the products were observed as a neutral loss from the parent (tGal-Gal-GalN) and sodiated product ion,m/z 690.4. In contrast to the singly charged parent ion, resonance activation of the doubly charged species provided abundant ceramide ions (cf. Fig. 6). It is probable that the second sodium enhances the probability of ceramide adduction and thus detection. These ceramide product ions were selected and activated to ascertain the C24 monounsaturated fatty acid amide conjugated to a C18 sphingosine (Fig.7).Figure 5Isolation and MS2 of the singly charged NOR1 parent ion, m/z1775.7. Product ions represent an intact pentasaccharide (m/z 1116.7) and a series of minor glycosidic fragments (see structure). The released ceramide fragment was only detected at high amplification (m/z 658.6,inset) and with inadequate abundance to study further by MSn. In contrast, doubly charged parents provided abundant ceramide product ions, and this precursor ion was used to detail the ceramide structure (see Fig. 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6MS2 product ion comparison of doubly (A) and singly (B) charged parent ions (m/z 898.62+and 1774.11+) studied with the rabbit RBC glycolipid. Most significant was the abundant ceramide ion,m/z 658.6, from the doubly charged parent and not observed in the singly charged scan (B). The consequence of facile HexNAc glycosidic rupture was observed as two product ions: a trisaccharide neutral loss product from the parent,m/z 1106.9, and the corresponding sodiated product, the nonreducing terminal trisaccharide,m/z 690.4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7MS3 study of the ceramide structure, m/z 658.8, released in high abundance from the doubly charged parent,m/z 899.62+(Fig. 6A).

In the NOR1 product, with detection of a 2 Da higher mass, the fatty acid has been assumed to be a C24 saturated moiety.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The oligosaccharide related mass, m/z 1116.7, from each sample suggested a composition of four hexoses and a single aminosugar. To confirm this expectation each ion,m/z 1116.7 (NOR1 and rGal-nLc4Cer), was activated, and their product ion spectra were compared (Fig.8). Although the spectra share common fragments, it was clear that their linear sequence was different. Immediately obvious were the terminal disaccharide ions that identified different nonreducing termini, m/z 445.2 (tHex-Hex) and m/z 486.2 (tHex-HexN), from rGal-nLc4Cer and NOR1, respectively. However, a coincident fragment was observed at the next higher residue, m/z 690, strongly suggesting an inverted sequence in the nonreducing terminal trisaccharide. Numerous other fragments support this positional inversion as shown by the neutral losses of one, two, and three residues,m/z 880, 653, and 449 (Fig. 8). These fragments identified the penultimate residue in the NOR1 sample as a HexN (see Fig. 8, inset structures). This was further supported by the common sequence ions from the"

To study the role of the DH domain of BCR in the background of P210/WT, the region was replaced with homologous sequences derived from Dbl (P210/Dbl) or CDC24 (P210/CDC24) or with irrelevant sequences from LacZ (P210/LacZ) or luciferase (P210/Luci). Surprisingly, the abilities to transform Rat1 cells or mouse bone marrow cells and induce growth factor independence in interleukin 3-dependent mouse Ba/F3 cells were retained only in P210/Dbl. However, even P210/Dbl could not achieve the wild type level of surviving potential against genotoxins in Rat1 cells and in Ba/F3 cells. Activation of Akt correlated with the biological changes in Rat1 cells but did not correlate with the biological changes in Ba/F3 cells.

SH2, Src-homology class II transcription factor pleckstrin-homology The oncoprotein BCR-ABL is generated on the Philadelphia chromosome found in two types of human leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)1 and acute lymphocytic leukemia (1Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Clinical manifestation of CML is unique. Massive expansion of myeloid cells of every maturation stage, which is observed in chronic phase, is inevitably followed by an acute leukemic phase called blast crisis. P210BCR-ABL found in CML and P185BCR-ABL in acute lymphocytic leukemia differ in the BCR sequence that participates in the formation of BCR-ABL (1Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 2Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The BCR sequence that is missing in P185 but retained in P210 has a homology to the GDP-GTP exchanger domain of Dbl and CDC24 and is therefore called the Dbl homology (DH) domain (3Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar). P185BCR-ABL has a stronger tyrosine kinase activity than P210BCR-ABL, and this correlates well with biological phenotypes (2Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). P185BCR-ABL has stronger transforming potentials for Rat1 fibroblasts and mouse bone marrow cells than P210BCR-ABL. In a transgenic animal model, some P210BCR-ABL animals are even free of disease (4Voncken J.W. Kaartinen V. Pattengale P.K. Germeraad W.T.V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Blood. 1995; 86: 4603-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the sequence encoded by the BCR first exon plays a pivotal role in the activation of BCR-ABL by binding to the ABL SH2 domain, it has been suggested that the DH domain is simply an inhibitory spacer (5Muller A.J.

Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The difference in the transforming potential cannot explain the clinical phenotype of CML, and functions of the DH domain in P210BCR-ABL have been poorly understood.Actin cytoskeleton staining experiments suggested that disruption of F-actin was observed in a P185-equivalent form of BCR-ABL but not in P210-expressing Rat1 cells, which implies that the DH domain plays a role in stabilization of actin filaments (7McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We could never show GDP-GTP exchange activities associated with this region but a report claimed that it activates CDC42, RhoA, and Rac (8Chuang T. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J.

Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). If this is the case, P210 could elicit signals via Rho family proteins. Those small GTP-binding proteins are involved not only in the activation of cytoskeleton but also in cell growth and gene expression (10Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 11Olson M.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, cellular transformation by Dbl is mediated by the activation of its substrates, Rho-like GTPases including CDC42 (12Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Transformation by BCR-ABL has been reported to be blocked by dominant-negative Rac (13Skorski T. Wlodarski P. Daheron L. Salomoni P. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Wasik M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11858-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL has also been documented to preferentially activate Jun kinase to mitogen-activated protein kinase (14Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R. Hambuch T.M. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although Ras is activated by BCR-ABL via Grb-2 and Shc, there are Ras-dependent and -independent pathways leading to the activation of Jun kinase, and CDC42 was shown to mediate Jun kinase activation (15Bagrodia S.

Shibuya M. Maru Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because XPB is an essential component of the basal transcription factor TFIIH involved in DNA repair and transcription, we have hypothesized that the blast crisis observed in CML could be caused by a defect in DNA repair that potentially induces genomic instability. We have also shown that XPB does not bind to other DH domain-containing proteins such as CDC24 and Dbl (21Maru Y. Kobayashi T. Tanaka K. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).All of this information suggests that the DH domain of BCR may not be a simple spacing region in P210BCR-ABL but could be of structural as well as functional importance. To further address this issue, here we report biochemical and biological analyses of replacement mutants of this region.DISCUSSIONAbrogation of biochemical and biological functions by replacement of the DH domain of BCR in P210BCR-ABL with that of CDC24 or with irrelevant sequences such as LacZ or luciferase was surprising because a naturally occurring physical deletion of the DH domain in P210BCR-ABL is found in P185BCR-ABL, an alternative form of BCR-ABL that is more transforming than P210 (2Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). This seemingly contradictory evidence suggests that P185BCR-ABL and P210BCR-ABL are distinct from each other in terms of structure-based activation status and that the simple presence or absence of the DH domain sequence in BCR-ABL cannot explain the activation levels. In the context of P210BCR-ABL, this region plays an important role in activation. At least two aspects should be noted: structural significance and functional significance.The occurrence of the large deletion spanning the inserted sequence in the DH region in P210/Luci and P210/LacZ expressed in Ba/F3 cells strongly suggests that those molecules are structurally unstable and that P210BCR-ABL cannot maintain the structure of such irrelevant sequences (possibly at the level of mRNA) because reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of Ba/F3 cells that survived against IL-3 deprivation revealed that clones carrying an in-frame deletion of the inserted sequence gave rise to growth. P210/CDC24, which was stably expressed in those cells, could not exert full biochemical and biological activities. The dramatic reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR-ABL substrates such as Shc, Vav1, the p85 subunit of PI3K, Crkl, and Cbl correlated well with decreased potentials in antiapoptosis and migration in Ba/F3 cells expressing P210/CDC24.Protein-protein interactions are often mediated by modifications such as phosphorylation. It has been shown that P210BCR-ABL has different phosphorylation sites from those in P185, as judged by peptide mapping analysis (36Liu J. Campbell M. Guo J.Q. Lu D. Xian Y.M. Andersson B.S. Arlinghaus R.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). The exchanger activity of the Vav1 protein that contains the DH domain has been reported to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (37Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, the site of phosphorylation does not fall into the DH domain. Results from peptide mapping studies, yeast two-hybrid assays, and coexpression studies of P210BCR-ABL and BCR mutants of the DH domain suggest that the DH domain of BCR in P210BCR-ABL does not appear to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to bind to other molecules with the SH2 domain. The SH2 mutant in P210BCR-ABL has a similar biochemical and biological phenotype as the DH mutants, which suggests that those two domains might work in concert to elicit signals from the SH2 domain. However, no interaction was found between the DH and SH2 domains when tested by the yeast two-hybrid system.The second aspect is the biochemical activities belonging to the DH domain of BCR that are expected to be distinct from those in Dbl or CDC24. Although we have not succeeded in finding the exchanger activity when the purified BCR protein from baculovirus was subjected to exchange assays, one group has claimed that the DH domain of BCR functions as a GDP-GTP exchanger for CDC42, RhoA, and Rac when expressed in Escherichia coli (8Chuang T. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The fragment of Dbl we have utilized for replacement has been shown to function as an exchanger for CDC42 in vitro (38Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore a part of the biological function could be derived from the inserted Dbl sequence in P210/Dbl. However, possible activation of CDC42 in both P210/WT and P210/Dbl cannot explain the biological differences in survival against genotoxins and differences in morphology of transformed Rat1 cells. P210/CDC24 containing the exchanger domain of CDC24 from yeast may not function toward its substrate CDC42 of mammalian origin.Drug resistance in P210BCR-ABL-expressing cells was shown to be mediated by protein kinase C ι (39Jamienson L. Carpenter L. Binden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, we could observe no difference in the kinase activities of protein kinase C ι or protein kinase C δ between cells expressing P210/WT and cells expressing P210/Dbl (data not sown). We have reported previously that XPB binds to BCR, but not to CDC24 or Dbl (21Maru Y. Kobayashi T. Tanaka K. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This is an example of differential binding of the DH domain to other molecules. P210/WT and P210/Dbl could have a different antirepair activity and antiapoptotic activity because XPB has been shown to bind to p53 in the apoptotic pathway (40Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although additional experiments need to be performed, an altered interaction of P210BCR-ABL with XPB might explain the biological differences. The oncoprotein BCR-ABL is generated on the Philadelphia chromosome found in two types of human leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)1 and acute lymphocytic leukemia (1Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Clinical manifestation of CML is unique. Massive expansion of myeloid cells of every maturation stage, which is observed in chronic phase, is inevitably followed by an acute leukemic phase called blast crisis. P210BCR-ABL found in CML and P185BCR-ABL in acute lymphocytic leukemia differ in the BCR sequence that participates in the formation of BCR-ABL (1Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 2Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The BCR sequence that is missing in P185 but retained in P210 has a homology to the GDP-GTP exchanger domain of Dbl and CDC24 and is therefore called the Dbl homology (DH) domain (3Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar). P185BCR-ABL has a stronger tyrosine kinase activity than P210BCR-ABL, and this correlates well with biological phenotypes (2Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). P185BCR-ABL has stronger transforming potentials for Rat1 fibroblasts and mouse bone marrow cells than P210BCR-ABL. In a transgenic animal model, some P210BCR-ABL animals are even free of disease (4Voncken J.W. Kaartinen V. Pattengale P.K. Germeraad W.T.V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Blood. 1995; 86: 4603-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the sequence encoded by the BCR first exon plays a pivotal role in the activation of BCR-ABL by binding to the ABL SH2 domain, it has been suggested that the DH domain is simply an inhibitory spacer (5Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar,6Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The difference in the transforming potential cannot explain the clinical phenotype of CML, and functions of the DH domain in P210BCR-ABL have been poorly understood. Actin cytoskeleton staining experiments suggested that disruption of F-actin was observed in a P185-equivalent form of BCR-ABL but not in P210-expressing Rat1 cells, which implies that the DH domain plays a role in stabilization of actin filaments (7McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We could never show GDP-GTP exchange activities associated with this region but a report claimed that it activates CDC42, RhoA, and Rac (8Chuang T. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). If this is the case, P210 could elicit signals via Rho family proteins. Those small GTP-binding proteins are involved not only in the activation of cytoskeleton but also in cell growth and gene expression (10Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 11Olson M.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, cellular transformation by Dbl is mediated by the activation of its substrates, Rho-like GTPases including CDC42 (12Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Transformation by BCR-ABL has been reported to be blocked by dominant-negative Rac (13Skorski T. Wlodarski P. Daheron L. Salomoni P. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Wasik M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11858-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL has also been documented to preferentially activate Jun kinase to mitogen-activated protein kinase (14Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R. Hambuch T.M. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11746-11750Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although Ras is activated by BCR-ABL via Grb-2 and Shc, there are Ras-dependent and -independent pathways leading to the activation of Jun kinase, and CDC42 was shown to mediate Jun kinase activation (15Bagrodia S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that P210BCR-ABL but not P185BCR-ABL binds to the xeroderma pigmentosum group B protein (XPB) through the DH domain and inactivates its DNA unwinding activity, at least in vitro (20Takeda N. Shibuya M. Maru Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because XPB is an essential component of the basal transcription factor TFIIH involved in DNA repair and transcription, we have hypothesized that the blast crisis observed in CML could be caused by a defect in DNA repair that potentially induces genomic instability. We have also shown that XPB does not bind to other DH domain-containing proteins such as CDC24 and Dbl (21Maru Y. Kobayashi T. Tanaka K. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1979214984,"The interaction between urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cellular receptor (uPAR) is a key event in cell surface-associated plasminogen activation, relevant for cell migration and invasion. In order to define receptor recognition sites for uPA, we have expressed uPAR fragments as fusion products with the minor coat protein on the surface of M13 bacteriophages. Sequence analysis of cDNA fragments encoding uPA-binding peptides indicated the existence of a composite uPA-binding structure including all three uPAR domains. This finding was confirmed by experiments using an overlapping 15-mer peptide array covering the entire uPAR molecule. Four regions within the uPAR sequence were found to directly bind to uPA: two distinct regions containing amino acids 13–20 and amino acids 74–84 of the uPAR domain I, and regions in the putative loop 3 of the domains II and III. All the uPA-binding fragments from the three domains were shown to have an agonistic effect on uPA binding to immobilized uPAR. Furthermore, uPAR-(154–176) increased uPAR-transfected BAF3-cell adhesion on vitronectin in the presence of uPA, whereas uPAR-(247–276) stimulated the cell adhesion both in the absence or presence of uPA. The latter fragment was also able to augment the binding of vitronectin to uPAR in a purified system, thereby mimicking the effect of uPA on this interaction. These results indicate that uPA binding can take place to particular part(s) on several uPAR molecules and that direct uPAR-uPAR contacts may contribute to receptor activation and ligand binding.

Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and uPAR antagonists (4Crowley C.W. Cohen R.L. Lucas B.K. Liu G. Shuman M.A. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Several reviews have provided details on the molecular and functional properties of the uPA-uPAR system and its role in extracellular matrix degradation (5Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 6Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have indicated that uPAR also takes part in other protein interactions, relevant not only to proteolysis but also to cell adhesion and signal transduction, where uPAR serves as a pleiotropic interactive cell surface molecule (8Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Simon D.I. Waltz D.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Stockinger H. Binder B.R. Thromb.

Human uPAR is a glycolipid-anchored membrane glycoprotein encoded as a 335-residue non-processed polypeptide (11Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Dano K. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The entire sequence of the fully processed and completely extracellular uPAR (amino acids 1–283) is divided into three homologous domains primarily defined by a conserved pattern of cysteine residues and linked to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (12Ploug M. Ronne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Behrendt N. Ploug M. Ronne E. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Behrendt N. Stephens R.W. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1998; 12: 191-204Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal domain I of uPAR has the primary role in uPA binding (16Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the integrity of the multidomain structure of uPAR is required for the maintenance of high affinity binding (17Ploug M. Ellis V. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The specific, high affinity interaction between uPA and uPAR is governed by the growth factor-like region of uPA, which also contains a kringle module and a serine protease domain (19Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides uPA, uPAR is also able to interact with Vn, and uPA promotes uPAR-dependent cell adhesion on Vn. Multimeric Vn, rather than monomers, serves as predominant high affinity ligand for uPAR. In addition, uPAR has been reported to interact with several other soluble and membrane proteins, such as high molecular weight kininogen and integrins (10Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. May A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In an approach to uncover the uPA recognition regions on the uPAR molecule and to identify epitopes responsible for promotion of uPAR-dependent cell adhesion on Vn, we have employed two techniques in the current investigation, i.e. phage display and peptide array. The phage display technique was first reported in 1985 by Smith and co-workers (20Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar, 21Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) and relied on the ability to display a peptide of interest on the surface of a bacteriophage capsid. Goodson et al. (22Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported the identification and characterization of peptide antagonists with nanomolar affinity for the human uPAR by using a 15-mer phage display library. Utilizing the second method (23Frank R. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 41: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar), the uPAR peptides were directly synthesized as spots on the cellulose membrane and used in solid phase binding tests. Together, four uPA-binding regions with distinct sequences on the uPAR molecule were identified and partially characterized, two of which could promote uPAR-mediated cell adhesion on Vn reminiscent of uPA itself. These results indicate that ligation with uPA can induce conformational changes to uPAR allowing direct uPAR-uPAR contacts and, thereby, may influence its functional activity in cell adhesion. Vn was purified from human plasma and converted to the multimeric form as described previously (26Preissner K.T. Wassmuth R. Müller-Berghaus G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Stockmann A. Hess S. DeClerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pBSW87 containing the full-length uPAR cDNA was obtained from Dr. N. Behrendt and the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) R3 and R4 to uPAR (28List K. Hoyer-Hansen G. Ronne E. Dano K. Behrendt N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 222: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. G. Høyer-Hansen (both from the Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark). The phagemid vector pComb3B (29van Zonneveld A.J. van den Berg B.M. van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. H. Pannekoek (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The expression vector pGEX-6P-1 and the protease-deficient expression strain Escherichia coli BL 21 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). The VCSM13 interference resistance helper phage and the electroporation competent E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ were purchased from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The plasmid pCDNA3 andBstXI linker were from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Human high molecular weight uPA, antibody 3936 to uPAR, and polyclonal rabbit antibodies against uPAR were from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Recombinant human soluble uPAR (suPAR) from insect cells was a gift from Dr. D. Cines (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Recombinant bacterial uPA (Saruplase) was from Grünenthal (Stolberg, Germany). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. In previous studies, the growth factor domain of uPA was fused to the constant region of human IgG and this construct was used in in vivo models as a uPAR antagonist (30Tressler R.J. Pitot P.A. Stratton J.R. Forrest L.D. Zhuo S. Drummond R.J. Fong S. Doyle M.V. Doyle L.V. Min H.Y. Rosenberg S. APMIS. 1999; 107: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to obtain sufficient amounts of chromogenically detectable uPA, we have produced the uPA-Fc fusion protein for the present investigation. The plasmid pSVscuPA-Gly158 (31Nelles L. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Holmes W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5682-5689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the cDNA encoding full-length single chain uPA mutant (replacement of Lys158by Gly) was from Dr. R. Lijnen (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). The cDNA of the constant region of human IgG γ-heavy chain (CH2CH3) was obtained from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). The construct pCDNA3-Gly158scuPA(N)-CH2CH3(C) was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and stable clones were chosen for uPA-Fc production. Purification of uPA-Fc was performed with Immuno-Pure Fab kit from Pierce, and the purity was controlled by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid sequencing. To generate random fragments encoding epitopes of the uPAR molecule, a 1250-bp DNA fragment containing the full-length uPAR cDNA was obtained from plasmid pBSW87 and partially digested with DNase to produce random fragments of 50–100 bp. To facilitate the cloning and expression of random DNA fragments, we chose phagemid vector pComb3B, which contained two non-self-complementaryBstXI sites separated by a 350-bp replaceable segment that allowed the cloning of DNA fragments using BstXI adaptors. Once cloned in the correct orientation and translation reading frame, fragments were expressed as fusion proteins composed of a N-terminalpelB leader peptide, a fusion peptide FN, the epitope peptide, a second fusion peptide FC, a glycine-rich flexible GGGGS peptide linker, and the C-terminal half of the bacteriophage M13 gene III-encoded minor coat protein pIII. Upon superinfection with a helper phage VSCM13, the epitope peptides fused to a part of pIII were displayed on the surface of newly produced phagemid particles. Eighteen randomly picked phagemid particles from this library were subjected to plasmid extraction and subsequent digestion with XhoI. Released uPAR cDNA fragment inserts were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis. The inserts were also sequenced as described below. Dynalbeads M-280 (tosyl-activated) (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) have been designed as a solid phase for biomagnetic separation, which have been applied among others also for screening of phage display libraries (32Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 33Russell S.J. Hawkins R.E. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). High molecular weight human uPA was coated onto tosyl-activated Dynalbeads M-280 according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the uPA-coated beads (∼5 µg of uPA/108 beads in 1 ml) were stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS, 100 µl of uPA-coated magnetic beads were blocked with 1.5 ml of PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST-3% BSA) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The beads were then resuspended in 50 µl of PBST-3% BSA and mixed with 50 µl of the non-diluted or in PBST-3% BSA 1:10, 1:100 or 1:1000 diluted uPAR phage display library, containing 1.6 × 1011, 1.6 × 1010, 1.6 × 109, or 1.6 × 108 phagemid particles, respectively, at room temperature for 2 h with gentle agitation. After binding, the bead suspension was transferred into a new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube to avoid plastic-bound phagemid particles. With the help of a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal MPC-E-1), the beads carrying uPA-binding phages were separated from the supernatant containing uPA-non-binding phages, which, after proper dilution, were used to infect cells of E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ at 37 °C for 20 min. The paramagnetic beads were then washed 10 times with PBST-3% BSA and resuspended in 200 µl of 0.3 m NaAc buffer, pH 5.2. After a short vortex, the supernatant was removed and immediately neutralized by adding 12 µl of 2 m Tris buffer, pH 10.5. Eluted phagemid particles were used to infect 100 µl of freshly cultured cells of E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ at 37 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, the paramagnetic beads were then incubated in 200 µl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.2, and the eluted phagemid particles were used to infect cells of E. coli. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 100 µl of LB broth and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 100 µl of E. coli suspension, where the remaining, tightly bound phagemid particles were directly adsorbed by the bacteria. The phage-infectedE. coli cells from the above steps were plated onto LA plates containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin for overnight culture at 37 °C. Individual clones, harboring recombinant phagemids encoding uPA-binding or uPA-non-binding peptides, were picked and cultivated with gentle shaking at 37 °C overnight in a 5-ml LB broth containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin. Phagemids containing a uPAR cDNA fragment were purified using Miniprep kits from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), and the sequences of the inserts were determined (SEQLAB, Göttingen, Germany). The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used as primer: 5′-GCC CAG GTG AAA CTG CTC G-3′ and 5′-CAA ACG AAT GGA GAG CCA CC-3′. Overlapping 15-mer peptides with a three amino acid shift, covering the entire uPAR molecule, were directly synthesized as spots on cellulose membranes (Dr. R. Frank, Molecular Biology Section, GBF-National Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany). The chemical and technical performance of this type of simultaneous parallel solid phase synthesis has been optimized for the preparation of peptide sequences up to a length of ∼20 amino acid residues (23Frank R. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 41: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). The uPAR peptide array contained a total of 108 uPAR peptides. After extensive washing with PBS, the SPOT-membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST (with 0.1% sodium azide) overnight at room temperature, followed by incubation with uPA-Fc (4 µg/ml) in fresh blocking buffer for 3.5 h at room temperature and washing twice with PBST (10 min each). Under stringent conditions, the membrane was additionally washed (1 min each) with 0.3 m NaAc buffer, pH 5.2, and 0.1m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.2. After PBST washing, the membrane was incubated for another 1.5 h with peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (Fc) (0.8 µg/ml) in blocking buffer. Bound antibody was then visualized after ECL treatment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and overnight exposure to Kodak x-ray film. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. In addition, the peptide array membranes were designed for reuse up to 10 times after stripping, which was performed accordingly as described previously (24Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). The uPAR fragments selected from the phage library were cloned into expression vector pGEX-6P-1 and expressed as GST fusion proteins. The fusion proteins as well as GST were purified through a GSTrap prepacked column. Cloning, expression, and purification were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion proteins were recognized by polyclonal rabbit antibodies against uPAR (1.6 µg/ml) as well as antibodies against GST (1 µg/ml) in Western blots. The microtiter plate binding assay was performed as described previously elsewhere (34Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, high molecular weight human uPA at a concentration of 5 µg/ml in PBS was coated onto Maxisorb 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) overnight at 4 °C. After the wells were blocked with 3% BSA-PBST for 1.5 h at 37 °C, various concentrations of GST/GST-uPAR fragments (0–2 µm) and suPAR (90 nm) in blocking buffer were added and incubated for another 1 h. Bound suPAR was detected by the antibody R4 (10 µg/ml), which was further detected by 1:1000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). Bound peroxidase was quantified using 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) with a microplate reader at 405 nm (Molecular Devices, Munich, Germany). Similarly, suPAR was coated at a concentration of 2.5 µg/ml in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After BSA blocking, various concentrations of GST/GST-uPAR fragments (0–2 µm) and uPA-Fc (8 µg/ml) or Vn (2 µg/ml), in the absence or presence of uPA (50 nm), in blocking buffer were added and incubated for another 1 h. Bound uPA-Fc was detected by 1:5000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated antibody against human IgG (Fc), and bound Vn was detected by antibody Vn-7 (125 ng/ml) against Vn (35Kost C. Stüber W. Ehrlich H. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound peroxidase was quantified as above. Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as a blank and was subtracted to calculate specific binding. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. BAF-3 (interleukin-3-dependent mouse B-cell line) cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD), and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 ng/ml interleukin-3. BAF-3 cells were transfected by electroporation with uPAR cDNA in the sense and antisense orientation using the expression vector pCDNA3. Cells were selected in the presence of G418 (1.2 mg/ml) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and determined to express uPAR by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, Northern blotting, and uPAR-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Cell adhesion of uPAR sense-transfected BAF-3 cells to Vn-coated plates was performed according to a previously described protocol (34Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chavakis T. May A.E. Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2976-2983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, multiwell plates were coated with 2 µg/ml Vn and blocked with 3% BSA. Cells were washed in serum-free RPMI and plated onto the precoated wells for 60 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of competitors in serum-free RPMI. After the incubation period, the wells were washed and the number of adherent cells was quantified by crystal violet staining at 590 nm. The phagemid library contained a total of 1.67 × 104 clones with a phagemid titer of 3.2 × 1012 phagemids/ml. Eighteen randomly picked phagemid clones from this library contained a uPAR cDNA fragment with a size of 30–120 bp from either strand, which were distributed over the entire uPAR cDNA sequence (data not shown). Affinity selection of uPA-binding phagemid particles was performed as described, and the results are summarized in TableI. From the eluted phagemid particles, 30 clones from the pH 5.2 elution, 30 clones from the pH 2.2 elution, and 120 clones from the E. coli adsorption were subjected to plasmid extraction and DNA insert sequencing. All clones were found to contain a DNA insert. Only one of the clones eluting at pH5.2, uPAR-(26–38), had a partial uPAR peptide sequence (Figs.1 and 3 A), presumably due to a recombination of the cDNA fragments during the construction of the phage library. None of the 30 clones eluted at pH 2.2 expressed a uPAR peptide, whereas 9 of the 120 clones eluted by E. coliadsorption, designated as, e.g., uPAR-(5–20), had a correct insert orientation and a correct open reading frame expressing a uPAR peptide. Results of the analysis and alignment of uPA-binding uPAR fragments is presented in Fig. 1, with details of the sequences in Fig.3. In control experiments, a phage display library containing only vector pComb3B and BstXI adaptor was mixed with uPA-coated beads. After washing 10 times with PBST-3% BSA, no phagemid particles were obtained using the elution steps described above (Table I). In addition, by analyzing uPA-non-binding clones, a uPA-non-binding uPAR peptide was also identified, which is located at the beginning of the domain III entailing amino acids 198–213.Table IAffinity selection of uPA-binding phagemid particlesDilution of library in 3% BSAPhagemid particles addedElution at pH 5.2Elution at pH 2.2Elution by E. coliE. coli only (control)CFU1-aColony-forming unit(s).CFUCFUCFUCFU1:10001.6 × 10811001:1001.6 × 109092701:101.6 × 10101441467501:101.6 × 10101212321001:11.6 × 10112217118101:11.6 × 10114248853201:1 (control library)0.72 × 101000001-a Colony-forming unit(s).

Overlapping regions from these two independent selections are framed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding of uPA-Fc to uPAR peptide array was performed as described, and a total of 13 uPAR peptides were found to bind uPA-Fc under non-stringent conditions (Figs.2 A and3). Peptides 11 and 12 (SPOT-11 and -12), NGDCRVEECALGQDL and CRVEECALGQDLCRT, contained the overlapping sequence from uPAR-(5–20) and uPAR-(13–33), which were selected from the phage display library as uPA-binding uPAR fragments. SPOT-17 and -18, TIVRLWEEGEELELV and RLWEEGEELELVEKS, overlapped with uPAR-(26–38). Although the region covering SPOT-23 and -24, CTHSEKTNRTLSYRT and SEKTNRTLSYRTGLK, was not found by phage display selection, it has been described by Gårdvoll et al. (37Gårdsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a uPA-binding determinant (Arg53, Leu55, and Tyr57). It is possible that we have not sequenced a large enough number of uPA-binding phagemid particles to cover this region. SPOT-34, QGNSGRAVTYSRSRY, contained the overlapping sequence from uPAR-(64–84) and uPAR-(74–122). Interestingly, SPOT-47, -48, -49, and -51, but not SPOT-50, bound uPA-Fc under non-stringent conditions. However, including additional washing steps of 1 min each with 0.3m NaAc buffer, pH 5.2, and 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.2, resulted in the complete disappearance of the signals from SPOT-47 and -51, and the signals from SPOT-48 and -49 were markedly reduced (Fig. 2 B). This observation was in accordance with the results from the phage display affinity selection, since nearly all of the uPA-binding uPAR peptides were obtained after completion of the pH 5.2 and pH 2.2 elutions. Furthermore, SPOT-59, CPGSNGFHNNDTFHF, which overlapped largely with uPAR-(154–176), remained bound to uPA-Fc to a much lesser extent in the presence of a 10-fold excess of Saruplase uPA (40 µg/ml) (Fig. 2 C). Finally, SPOT-92, LGDAFSMNHIDVSCC, contained the overlapping sequence from uPAR-(236–283), uPA-(247–291), uPAR-(241–262), and uPAR-(247–276). Since the stringent washing condition was applied after uPA-Fc binding, enhanced intensity at SPOT-23, -24, and -34 might be due to increased accessibility of bound molecules by anti-Fc antibodies. Similar results were obtained from several repetitions using different uPAR SPOT-membranes. In control experiments, human IgG (4 µg/ml) was used instead of uPA-Fc to bind uPAR peptides, and no signal was obtained (Fig. 2 D). In summary, the two independent screening procedures for uPA-binding uPAR peptides have produced largely congruent results. When uPA binding to immobilized uPAR was performed, all the uPA-binding uPAR fragments from its three domains, and especially the two fragments from the domains II and III were shown to have an agonistic effect, whereas the uPA-non-binding uPAR fragment uPAR-(198–213) and GST had no effect (Fig.4). The influence of uPAR fragments was also studied in a reverse system utilizing binding of suPAR to immobilized uPA. Interestingly, whereas the fragments uPAR-(5–20) and uPAR-(13–33) as well as uPAR-(64–84) and uPAR-(74–122) from the domain I could partially inhibit suPAR binding to immobilized uPA, the fragments uPAR-(154–176) and uPAR-(247–276) from the domains II and III again increased the association between suPAR and uPA (data not shown). Additionally, in the converse experiment, the fragment uPAR-(198–213) and GST had no effect on suPAR binding to immobilized uPA. As established previously, the adhesion of leukocytes to immobilized Vn is predominantly mediated by uPAR, and uPA augments this adhesion by increasing the affinity of the Vn-uPAR interaction (38Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only if BAF-3 cells were transfected with full-length uPAR-cDNA did they adhere to Vn and display uPA-augmented adhesion (36Chavakis T. May A.E. Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2976-2983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the influence of various uPAR fragments at different concentrations on uPAR-transfected BAF-3 cell adhesion to Vn in the absence or presence of uPA (50 nm) was tested. Fragment uPAR-(247–276) from the domain III increased Vn adhesion both in the absence or presence of uPA, whereas uPAR-(154–176) from the domain II stimulated adhesion only in the presence of uPA (Fig.5, A and B). Neither peptide stimulated adhesion of non-transfected BAF-3 cells to Vn. The uPAR-(247–276)-induced cell adhesio"
