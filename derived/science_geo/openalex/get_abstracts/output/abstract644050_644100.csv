https://openalex.org/W2994160326,"Aging is a predominant risk factor for several chronic diseases that limit healthspan1. Mechanisms of aging are thus increasingly recognized as potential therapeutic targets. Blood from young mice reverses aspects of aging and disease across multiple tissues2-10, which supports a hypothesis that age-related molecular changes in blood could provide new insights into age-related disease biology. We measured 2,925 plasma proteins from 4,263 young adults to nonagenarians (18-95 years old) and developed a new bioinformatics approach that uncovered marked non-linear alterations in the human plasma proteome with age. Waves of changes in the proteome in the fourth, seventh and eighth decades of life reflected distinct biological pathways and revealed differential associations with the genome and proteome of age-related diseases and phenotypic traits. This new approach to the study of aging led to the identification of unexpected signatures and pathways that might offer potential targets for age-related diseases."

However, the major driving force for clearance remains largely unknown. Here we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in awake head-fixed mice to assess the role of spontaneous vasomotion in paravascular clearance. Vasomotion correlated with paravascular clearance of fluorescent dextran from the interstitial fluid. Increasing the amplitude of vasomotion by means of visually evoked vascular responses resulted in increased clearance rates in the visual cortex of awake mice. Evoked vascular reactivity was impaired in mice with CAA, which corresponded to slower clearance rates. Our findings suggest that low-frequency arteriolar oscillations drive drainage of solutes. Targeting naturally occurring vasomotion in patients with CAA or AD may be a promising early therapeutic option for prevention of Aβ accumulation in the brain."

Here, we find that nociceptor neurons critically mediate host defense against the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm). Dorsal root ganglia nociceptors protect against STm colonization, invasion, and dissemination from the gut. Nociceptors regulate the density of microfold (M) cells in ileum Peyer's patch (PP) follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) to limit entry points for STm invasion. Downstream of M cells, nociceptors maintain levels of segmentous filamentous bacteria (SFB), a gut microbe residing on ileum villi and PP FAE that mediates resistance to STm infection. TRPV1+ nociceptors directly respond to STm by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide that modulates M cells and SFB levels to protect against Salmonella infection. These findings reveal a major role for nociceptor neurons in sensing and defending against enteric pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2992810674,"Many adult tissues contain resident stem cells, such as the Pax7+ satellite cells within skeletal muscle, that regenerate parenchymal elements following damage. Tissue-resident mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) also participate in regeneration, although their function and fate in this process are unclear. Here, we identify Hypermethylated in cancer 1 (Hic1) as a marker of MPs in skeletal muscle and further show that Hic1 deletion leads to MP hyperplasia. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis of Hic1+ MPs in skeletal muscle shows multiple subpopulations, which we further show have distinct functions and lineage potential. Hic1+ MPs orchestrate multiple aspects of skeletal muscle regeneration by providing stage-specific immunomodulation and trophic and mechanical support. During muscle regeneration, Hic1+ derivatives directly contribute to several mesenchymal compartments including Col22a1-expressing cells within the myotendinous junction. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that HIC1 regulates MP quiescence and identifies MP subpopulations with transient and enduring roles in muscle regeneration."

Here, we report animal models that selectively and durably label postnatal Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal stem cells (P-SSCs) and establish that P-SSCs are a long-term repopulating, functionally distinct SSC subset responsible for lifelong generation of periosteal osteoblasts. P-SSCs rapidly migrate toward an injury site, supply osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and recover new periosteum. Notably, P-SSCs specifically express CCL5 receptors, CCR3 and CCR5. Real-time intravital imaging revealed that the treatment with CCL5 induces P-SSC migration in vivo and bone healing, while CCL5/CCR5 deletion, CCR5 inhibition, or local P-SSC ablation reduces osteoblast number and delays bone healing. Human periosteal cells express CCR5 and undergo CCL5-mediated migration. Thus, the adult periosteum maintains genetically distinct SSC subsets with a CCL5-dependent migratory mechanism required for bone maintenance and injury repair.

Thus, the adult periosteum maintains genetically distinct SSC subsets with a CCL5-dependent migratory mechanism required for bone maintenance and injury repair. Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) are known to exist within the bone marrow (BM) and are required for skeletal development, homeostasis, and repair (Bianco and Robey, 2015Bianco P. Robey P.G.

More recently, SSC populations have been identified within skeletal tissues other than BM (e.g., calvarial sutures and the periosteum), indicating that endogenous SSCs may have multiple tissue locations within adult bones (Roberts et al., 2015Roberts S.J. van Gastel N.

However, due to the lack of specific markers to distinguish rare periosteal SSCs (P-SSCs) from BM-SSCs in vivo, which SSCs recognize tissue injury and how they initiate the repair process remain fundamental questions. Tissue-resident SSCs are a heterogeneous population with different locations. In the BM, long-term repopulating SSCs have been prospectively identified by their expression of CD140a (PDGFRα), V-cam1, and CD200 in mice (Chan et al., 2015Chan C.K. Seo E.Y. Chen J.Y. Lo D.

They are a subset of BM perivascular cells expressing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche factors (Morrison and Scadden, 2014Morrison S.J. Scadden D.T. The bone marrow niche for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2014; 505: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a non-perivascular SSC population with in vivo osteogenic and chondrogenic potential that is distinctly different from perivascular SSCs is labeled by Gremlin 1 (Grem1) (Worthley et al., 2015Worthley D.L. Churchill M. Compton J.T. Tailor Y. Rao M. Si Y. Levin D. Schwartz M.G. Uygur A.

Similar to BM, osteo/chondrogenic progenitors have also been found in the periosteum (Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018Duchamp de Lageneste O. Julien A. Abou-Khalil R. Frangi G. Carvalho C. Cagnard N. Cordier C. Conway S.J. Colnot C. Periosteum contains skeletal stem cells with high bone regenerative potential controlled by Periostin.Nat.

These periosteal progenitors can contribute to outer bone shaping, cortical thickness, and fracture repair (Debnath et al., 2018Debnath S. Yallowitz A.R. McCormick J. Lalani S. Zhang T. Xu R. Li N. Liu Y. Yang Y.S.

Rep. 2016; 6: 36524Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, periosteal cells are particularly important in the lifelong regeneration of bones with limited or no BM, suggesting that SSC subsets reside in the adult periosteum. However, a significant drawback of these single-genetic lineage-tracing models is that there is a substantial heterogeneity within labeled cell populations and that they cannot distinguish labeled SSCs from their progeny. Therefore, the in vivo stem cell properties and physiological function of P-SSCs in adult bones remain elusive. Furthermore, the differential regulatory mechanisms influencing the activation and recruitment of specific SSC subtypes in the early repair process are essentially unknown. To answer this fundamental question, we sought to develop a new method to label postnatal P-SSCs selectively, define their long-term repopulation and contribution to fracture repair in vivo, and identify specific factors that regulate P-SSC migration and proliferation under physiological conditions. By using genetic mouse models, recent studies revealed that a subset of periosteal cells has skeletal progenitor function and plays an important role in intramembraneous bone formation and bone repair (Debnath et al., 2018Debnath S. Yallowitz A.R. McCormick J. Lalani S. Zhang T. Xu R. Li N. Liu Y. Yang Y.S.

Commun. 2018; 9: 773Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We also found that Mx1-labeled (hereafter Mx1+) progenitor cells are present in the periosteum (Park et al., 2012Park D. Spencer J.A. Koh B.I. Kobayashi T. Fujisaki J. Clemens T.L. Lin C.P. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Endogenous bone marrow MSCs are dynamic, fate-restricted participants in bone maintenance and regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, one limitation of these models is the absence of specificity to distinguish P-SSCs from BM-SSCs and to track their long-term repopulation in vivo. Therefore, to further define a model enabling selective labeling of P-SSCs in adult bones, we crossed Mx1-Cre+Rosa26-Tomato+ mice with other skeletal stem/progenitor cell (SSPC) reporter mouse lines, including αSMA-GFP (Grcevic et al., 2012Grcevic D. Pejda S. Matthews B.G. Repic D. Wang L. Li H. Kronenberg M.S. Jiang X. Maye P. Adams D.J. et al.In vivo fate mapping identifies mesenchymal progenitor cells.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), Nestin-GFP (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D. Lira S.A. Scadden D.T. Ma’ayan A. Enikolopov G.N. Frenette P.S. Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), and CXCL12-GFP (Omatsu et al., 2010Omatsu Y. Sugiyama T. Kohara H. Kondoh G. Fujii N. Kohno K. Nagasawa T. The essential functions of adipo-osteogenic progenitors as the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell niche.Immunity. 2010; 33: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). When these trigenic mice were 4–6 weeks old, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIpC: 25 mg/kg) was administered every other day for 10 days to activate the Mx1-Cre, leading to the tomato labeling of SSCs. Two weeks later, mice were irradiated (IR, 9.5 Gy) and transplanted with wild-type (WT) BM (106 cells/mouse, WT-BMT) to eliminate Mx1+ hematopoietic cells. Among the tested combinations, immunohistochemistry and in vivo imaging analysis of 3-month-old trigenic Mx1-Cre+Rosa26-Tomato+αSMA-GFP+ (Mx1/Tomato/αSMA-GFP, pIpC at 4 weeks of age and IR+WT-BMT at 6 weeks of age) mice showed that the Mx1 and αSMA-GFP combination selectively labeled a subset of periosteal cells (Figures 1A, dashed box, and 1B, top), but double labeling was nearly undetectable in the BM (Figures 1A and 1B, bottom). Next, histological and in vivo image analysis of 7-month-old Mx1/Tomato/αSMA-GFP (6 months after pIpC and IR+WT-BMT) mouse tibia and calvaria confirmed that most Mx1+αSMA+ (Tomato+GFP+) cells reside in the tibial periosteum (Figure S1A) and calvarial sutures (a known niche for craniofacial SSCs; Figures S1C and S1D) (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao H. Feng J. Ho T.V. Grimes W. Urata M. Chai Y. The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), while nearly all αSMA+ cells in the BM do not overlap with Mx1+ cells (Figures 1A, BM, and S1B), suggesting that the selective Mx1/αSMA-GFP double labeling (Mx1+αSMA+) of periosteal cells is durable in adult mice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the periosteum of 3-month-old Mx1/Tomato/αSMA-GFP mice showed that periosteal cells formed a heterogeneous population and that ∼1.7% (1.5 ± 0.4, n = 5) of CD45−CD31−Ter119− periosteal cells were Mx1 and αSMA-GFP positive (Figure 1C, red box). Subsequent SSC marker analysis revealed that most (∼80%) of the Mx1+αSMA+ cells expressed SSC immunophenotypic markers (CD105+CD140a+) with higher expression of SSC transcripts, including Runx2, Cxcl12, LepR, and Grem1 (Figure 1C). By contrast, only ∼10% of Mx1−αSMA+ cells and ∼27% of Mx1+αSMA− cells from the CD45−CD31−Ter119− fraction were CD105+CD140a+, with an ∼5-fold lower expression of SSC transcripts (Figures S1E and 1C, respectively). When cultured at the single-cell level, Mx1+αSMA+ cells, but neither Mx1 nor αSMA-GFP single positive cells, formed colonies with osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation potential in vitro (Figure 1D), demonstrating that the Mx1 and αSMA-GFP combination further specifies endogenous P-SSCs with ex vivo SSC characteristics. Next, to examine whether Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells contribute to injury repair in vivo, we generated drill-hole defects (∼1 mm diameter) in tibia of 3-month-old Mx1/Tomato/αSMA-GFP mice (2 months after pIpC and WT-BMT). We reasoned that a drill-hole defect can be a model of bone healing without compromising tissue architecture (endosteum versus periosteum) and achieve better quantification of stem cell responses compared to other fracture methods (He et al., 2011He Y.X. Zhang G. Pan X.H. Liu Z. Zheng L.Z. Chan C.W. Lee K.M. Cao Y.P. Li G. Wei L. et al.Impaired bone healing pattern in mice with ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis: A drill-hole defect model.Bone. 2011; 48: 1388-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Histological analysis of tibial injury at day 14 revealed that Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells repopulated the outer layer of the callus (Figure 1E, New PO) and supplied the majority of callus-forming cells (Figure 1E, Callus). We previously reported that Mx1+ BM-SSCs exhibit mainly osteogenic potential, with little adipogenic and no chondrogenic potential in postnatal bone maintenance (Park et al., 2012Park D. Spencer J.A. Koh B.I. Kobayashi T. Fujisaki J. Clemens T.L. Lin C.P. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Endogenous bone marrow MSCs are dynamic, fate-restricted participants in bone maintenance and regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, these Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells contributed to 21% ± 3% of aggrecan+ chondrocytes in the cartilage intermediate (Figure 1E, bottom right) and more than 80% of new osteoblasts within the callus (Figure 1E, bottom left), implying that they differ from Mx1+ BM-SSCs. We next tested whether there is a divergence in the contribution of Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells in a fracture model. We consistently found that Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells mainly contributed to callus formation at 14 days after a transverse tibial fracture (Figure S1F). When Mx1+αSMA+ cells were tracked during bone repair of injured calvaria in vivo, these cells newly appeared at the injury site and repopulated on days 7 and 15 (Figures 1F and S1G, white arrows). In addition, 21 days after calvarial injury, undifferentiated Mx1+αSMA+ cells exclusively resided in the center space of the injury, while differentiated Mx1+αSMA− cells covered the outer space of the injury region with new bone formation (blue) (Figures 1F and S1G). Consistent with Figure 1E, three-dimensional reconstitution of z stack images and optical sections of the periosteum (a) and underneath injury callus (b) at 21 days post injury showed that Mx1+αSMA+ cells at the top surface of injury remained undifferentiated (Figure 1G, a, yellow) and formed new periosteum, while Mx1+αSMA+ cells in the middle callus of injury differentiated and became Mx1+αSMA− osteoblasts and osteocytes (Figure 1G, b, white arrows) imbedded in newly formed bones (Figure 1G, b, blue). Of note, Mx1+ BM cells near the injury site showed no observable activation, further demonstrating that Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells in adult bones include endogenous P-SSCs with a multi-lineage differentiation potential and supply the osteoblasts participating in bone healing. It is possible that the periosteum contains Mx1− P-SSCs that can contribute to new osteoblasts at injury sites. Therefore, to distinguish between P-SSCs and mature osteoblasts and to improve specific cell quantitation during bone healing, we generated trigenic Mx1-Cre+Rosa26-Tomato+osteocalcin-GFP+ (Mx1/Tomato/Ocn-GFP) mice. In this model, when Mx1+Ocn-GFP− (Mx1+Ocn−) P-SSCs differentiate into mature Mx1+Ocn-GFP+ osteoblasts, they express Tomato and GFP (Park et al., 2014Park D. Spencer J.A. Lin C.P. Scadden D.T. Sequential in vivo imaging of osteogenic stem/progenitor cells during fracture repair.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; 87: e51289Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). Anti-GFP immunofluorescence staining and in vivo imaging of Mx1/Tomato/Ocn-GFP mouse tibias at 2 weeks after pIpC treatment revealed that the induction of Mx1-Cre activity labeled distinct periosteal cells without detectable Ocn-GFP expression in the metaphysis and diaphysis (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2B, white arrows). In contrast to a widely mixed distribution of Mx1+Ocn− progenitors and Mx1+Ocn+ osteoblasts (Tomato+GFP+; ∼50%–60% of endosteal osteoblasts) in trabecular bones (Figures S2B and S2C), these Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells exclusively existed in the cambial layer, a known location of skeletal progenitors (Bragdon and Bahney, 2018Bragdon B.C. Bahney C.S. Origin of Reparative Stem Cells in Fracture Healing.Curr. Osteoporos. Rep. 2018; 16: 490-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B, CL). To determine that Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells contribute to normal periosteal bone growth, we analyzed the percentage of Mx1+Ocn+ periosteal osteoblasts and osteocytes in the tibia of Mx1/Tomato/Ocn-GFP mice at 2, 8, and 16 weeks after pIpC treatment. We noted that the number of Mx1+Ocn+ periosteal osteoblasts and osteocytes (Figure S2C, Mx1+ Ocy) in cortical bone was markedly increased in 7-month-old mice (from ∼18% at 2 weeks to ∼80% at 16 weeks post pIpC) (Figures 2A, 2C, S2A, and S2C), supporting that Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells are the major source of newly generated periosteal osteoblasts and osteocytes in postnatal bones. Consistent with Figure 1C, FACS analysis of collagenase-digested periosteal cells revealed that Mx1+Ocn− cells accounted for 48% of the SSPC (CD105+CD140a+) population and formed clonogenic colonies with in vitro osteogenic differentiation potential (Figure S2D, right). Gene expression analysis with sorted Mx1−Ocn−, Mx1+Ocn−, and control cells from the periosteum revealed that the Mx1+Ocn−CD105+CD140a+ population expressed significantly higher levels of SSC markers, including Grem1, Cxcl12, and Runx2, but no detectable levels of Ocn (a mature osteoblastic marker) compared with other populations (Figures S2E and S2F). To test whether Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells supply new osteoblasts but remain undifferentiated in new periosteum during bone repair in vivo, we generated drill-hole defects in the tibial diaphysis of Mx1/Tomato/Ocn-GFP mice. Immunofluorescence analysis of the bone defect revealed that Mx1+Ocn− cells reconstituted the majority (∼80%) of outer callus-forming cells (Tomato) within new periosteum (New PO) and >70% of the bone-forming osteoblasts (Tomato+GFP+) surrounding new bone bridges (Figures 2E and S2G). Next, we generated a bone defect in the periosteum and the outer surface of cortical bone, without BM damage, in the tibia of Mx1/Tomato/Ocn-GFP mice. Two weeks post injury, we consistently observed robust callus formation with over 90% contribution of Mx1+ cells to new osteoblasts (Mx1+Ocn+) in the injury callus (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data show that Mx1 can label stem/progenitor cells in the periosteum and that the activation of Mx1+ periosteal cells upon cortical bone injury is sufficient to induce the osteogenesis and periosteal reconstitution. To test the long-term repopulation ability of Mx1+αSMA+ cells, we examined their contribution to bone repair after multiple rounds of injuries. Consecutive intravital imaging of the primary calvarial injury sites of Mx1/Tomato/αSMA-GFP mice at ∼4 months of age (Figure 3A, First injury) and again at ∼12 months of age revealed complete bone and periosteum recovery with exclusive periosteum localization of Mx1+αSMA+ cells resembling pre-injury homeostatic condition (Figure 3A, bottom, Pre-injury). When Mx1+αSMA+ cells were further traced at the secondary injury sites, they rapidly repopulated and contributed to over 80% of osteoblasts, similar to their response to the primary injury (Figure 3A, bottom, day 14). Compared to basal conditions (Figure 1C), the Mx1+αSMA+ population expanded ∼3-fold (from 1.7% to 5.4% of CD45−CD31−Ter119− fraction) in response to multiple calvarial injuries (Figure 3B, red box). More importantly, Mx1+αSMA+ cells maintained a high expression of previously defined SSC markers such as CD200, CD140a, and Vcam-1 even after a second injury. To better define the long-term repopulation characteristics and to exclude the possibility that Mx1+αSMA− periosteal cells include P-SSCs and become Mx1+αSMA+ cells in bone injury, we performed serial transplantations of these cells (Figure 3C). A total of 5,000 Mx1+αSMA+CD140a+CD105+, Mx1+αSMA−, and Mx1−αSMA+ cells from the periosteal CD45−CD31−Ter119− fraction were sorted and transplanted with Matrigel onto the calvaria injury site of a WT mouse. We reasoned that this P-SSC transplantation onto a periosteal injury site is more physiologically relevant compared to the previously described SSC transplantation into kidney capsules (Chan et al., 2015Chan C.K. Seo E.Y. Chen J.Y. Lo D. McArdle A. Sinha R. Tevlin R. Seita J. Vincent-Tompkins J. Wearda T. et al.Identification and specification of the mouse skeletal stem cell.Cell. 2015; 160: 285-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) or mammary fat pads (Debnath et al., 2018Debnath S. Yallowitz A.R. McCormick J. Lalani S. Zhang T. Xu R. Li N. Liu Y. Yang Y.S. Eiseman M. et al.Discovery of a periosteal stem cell mediating intramembranous bone formation.Nature. 2018; 562: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In vivo imaging and FACS analysis at 4 weeks after the first round of transplantation showed that the transplanted Mx1+αSMA+ cells proliferated and differentiated into Mx1+ osteoblasts and osteocytes that were imbedded within the newly formed bone tissue (Figure 3C, top arrow, New bone). A subset of the engrafted cells repopulated and maintained the Mx1+αSMA+ population in the periosteum (12%–15% of all transplanted Mx1+ cells). The majority of the Mx1+αSMA+ cells (∼72%) preserved the expression of SSPC surface markers (CD140a+CD105+) (Figure 3C, top). When these Mx1+αSMA+CD140a+CD105+ cells (∼500 cells/mouse) were re-transplanted and analyzed at 4 weeks after the second transplantation, they displayed both intact repopulation of double positive cells (Figure 3C, bottom PO, ∼15% of transplanted cells) with high CD140a+CD105+ expression (∼74%) and their osteoblast and osteocyte differentiation (Figure 3C, bottom arrow, New bone). However, transplanted Mx1+αSMA− or Mx1−αSMA+ cells did not show such repopulation, and there was no detectable stem cell marker expression (Figures S3A and S3B), demonstrating that the key characteristics of SSCs—in vivo long-term repopulation and differentiation—are highly enriched in the Mx1+αSMA+ periosteal cells. SSCs are known to be present in the BM and may contribute to bone healing if the periosteum is defective or removed. Therefore, we developed an inducible deletion model (Mx1-Cre+Rosa26-Tomato+Rosa26-DTR+) and tested the requirement for Mx1+ periosteal cells in bone healing. To restrict the conditional deletion of Mx1+ cells to the periosteum, we used local surface administration of the diphtheria toxin (DT) (20 μL, 1 μg/mL) to cover an area with ∼1 cm of diameter at the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures (Figure S4A). Periosteal DT treatment for 7 days prior to injury reduced the number of Mx1+ periosteal cells in more than 90%, while Mx1+ cells in the BM and in the distal periosteum remained unchanged (Figure S4B). Under these conditions, sequential imaging of injury repair revealed that the DT-mediated local deletion of Mx1+ cells completely inhibited the recruitment and proliferation of Mx1+ osteogenic cells at the injury site (Figure 3D). Micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis showed that local DT treatment significantly delayed calvarial bone healing (Figure 3E). We observed a similar delay in tibial bone healing with local DT treatment (data not shown). Because Mx1+ osteoblasts and progenitors in the BM near the injury site remained intact and no detectable changes in their population or position occurred during injury healing (data not shown), the new Mx1+ cells within the bone injury were highly likely to be derived from the periosteum. These data are consistent with Mx1+ periosteal cells being necessary for osteogenesis and bone healing. BM-SSCs were reported to localize in perivascular regions with Nestin-GFP expression (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D. Lira S.A. Scadden D.T. Ma’ayan A. Enikolopov G.N. Frenette P.S. Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed the trigenic Mx1-Cre+Rosa26-Tomato+Nestin-GFP+ (Mx1/Tomato/Nestin-GFP) mouse and tested whether Mx1 and Nestin double labeling can distinguish BM-SSCs from P-SSCs and their contributions to bone injury. In vivo imaging and FACS analysis of these mice revealed that there are two distinct cell populations (Mx1+Nestin+; ∼27% and Mx1−Nestin+; ∼73%) within Nestin+ perivascular cells in the BM, whereas Mx1+ periosteal cells are exclusively Nestin negative (Figures S5A and S5B). To determine whether marker expression was different between P-SSCs and BM-SSCs, we conducted Affymetrix-based global gene expression analysis with FACS-isolated cells: (1) Mx1+ PCs (CD105+CD140a+Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells) (Figure S2E, Mx1+), (2) Mx1+Nestin+, and (3) Mx1−Nestin+ cells from Mx1/Tomato/Nestin-GFP mouse BM (Figure S5B) and control cells, including (4) CD45+, (5) Osteocalcin+ (Ocn+), and (6) Osterix+ (Osx+) cells. Interestingly, the expression levels of SSC markers, including Grem1, LepR, and Cxcl12, were much higher in Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells compared to Nestin+ BM perivascular cells and control cells (Figure S5C) (Deveza et al., 2018Deveza L. Ortinau L. Lei K. Park D. Comparative analysis of gene expression identifies distinct molecular signatures of bone marrow- and periosteal-skeletal stem/progenitor cells.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13: e0190909Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We confirmed the highest expression level of Runx2 and Cxcl12 in Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells by RT-PCR (Figure S5D). We next tracked Mx1+ (Tomato+) and Nestin+ (GFP+) cells at the bone injury site using intravital imaging and found that Mx1+Nestin− periosteal cells predominantly appeared at the injury site at 2–5 days (>95%) and subsequently increased in number. In marked contrast, few Mx1+Nestin+ (2%–3%) or Mx1−Nestin+ (∼1%) BM cells were observed at the injury site throughout the repair process (Figure S5E). Taken together, these results further support the idea that Mx1-labeled periosteal SSCs with αSMA-GFP expression (hereafter Mx1+αSMA+ P-SSCs) mainly respond to cortical bone injury and supply new osteoblasts. Skeletal progenitors have been proposed to have migratory or circulatory potential (Nitzsche et al., 2017Nitzsche F. Müller C. Lukomska B. Jolkkonen J. Deten A. Boltze J. Concise Review: MSC Adhesion Cascade-Insights into Homing and Transendothelial Migration.Stem Cells. 2017; 35: 1446-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, there is no in vivo evidence for the endogenous migratory mechanism of P-SSCs. To test whether P-SSCs migrate toward the injury site in vivo, we performed sequential z stack imaging of individual Mx1+αSMA+ P-SSCs and the detailed structures of the periosteum, bone matrix, and BM near the injury sites immediately (0), 24, and 48 h after injury (Figure 4A). We noted that multiple Mx1+αSMA+ P-SSCs appeared to move toward the injury site (Figure 4A, arrows) and confirmed these results by z stack imaging. However, in agreement with Figure S5E, the endosteal and vessel-associated Mx1+ BM cells were not observed to shift their position (Figure 4A, BM), indicating the presence of a migratory mechanism of Mx1+αSMA+ P-SSCs and suture cells. We next examined molecules involved in P-SSC migration by Affymetrix-based global gene expression analysis of Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells (Figures 4B and S5C). Interestingly, the expression of two specific CC chemokine receptors, CCR3 and CCR5, was ∼4-fold higher in Mx1+Ocn− periosteal cells co"
https://openalex.org/W2992355457,"Summary Metabolism has been shown to control peripheral immunity, but little is known about its role in central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Through a combination of proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, and perturbation studies, we found that sphingolipid metabolism in astrocytes triggers the interaction of the C2 domain in cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) with the CARD domain in mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), boosting NF-κB-driven transcriptional programs that promote CNS inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. cPLA2 recruitment to MAVS also disrupts MAVS-hexokinase 2 (HK2) interactions, decreasing HK enzymatic activity and the production of lactate involved in the metabolic support of neurons. Miglustat, a drug used to treat Gaucher and Niemann-Pick disease, suppresses astrocyte pathogenic activities and ameliorates EAE. Collectively, these findings define a novel immunometabolic mechanism that drives pro-inflammatory astrocyte activities, outlines a new role for MAVS in CNS inflammation, and identifies candidate targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2991860444,"The mammalian striatum is involved in many complex behaviors and yet is composed largely of a single neuron class: the spiny projection neuron (SPN). It is unclear to what extent the functional specialization of the striatum is due to the molecular specialization of SPN subtypes. We sought to define the molecular and anatomical diversity of adult SPNs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and quantitative RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). We computationally distinguished discrete versus continuous heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data and found that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four major discrete types with no implied spatial relationship between them. Within these discrete types, we find continuous heterogeneity encoding spatial gradients of gene expression and defining anatomical location in a combinatorial mechanism. Our results suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated, which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron."

The results support the proposal that alpha synchrony plays a causal role in modulating attention and visual processing, and alpha training could be used for testing hypotheses about synchrony. A major function of attention is to filter out distracting information. Some of the proposed mechanisms for this filtering include modulation of firing rates and synchronization of activity both within and across brain structures involved in control of attention as well as sensory processing areas. Increases in alpha synchrony in particular are associated with a decrease in neuronal excitability (Lange et al., 2013Lange J. Oostenveld R. Fries P. Reduced occipital alpha power indexes enhanced excitability rather than improved visual perception.J.

Alpha synchrony appears to influence sensory processing both during stimulus presentation as well as during the pre-stimulus interval (Herrmann and Knight, 2001Herrmann C.S. Knight R.T. Mechanisms of human attention: event-related potentials and oscillations.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2001; 25: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). It has been proposed as a mechanism for inhibiting processing of irrelevant sensory and task information, possibly by gating the flow of information across different brain structures (Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010Jensen O.

In human electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies, a correlation between covert attention and lateralized parietal alpha oscillations (8–12 Hz) has long been established (Foxe et al., 1998Foxe J.J.

Increased alpha synchrony in one hemisphere is associated with reduced attention in the contralateral visual field, whereas decreased alpha is correlated with perceptual alertness and attention in the contralateral field. Similarly, when monkeys attend to a stimulus in the receptive field of cells in the visual cortex, these cells give enhanced responses to visual stimuli, and there is an increase in gamma synchrony accompanied by a reduction in alpha synchrony, as measured with the local field potentials (LFP) or with spike-field synchrony at the cellular level (Bollimunta et al., 2011Bollimunta A.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, Fries et al., 2001Fries P. Reynolds J.H. Rorie A.E. Desimone R. Modulation of oscillatory neuronal synchronization by selective visual attention.Science. 2001; 291: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Alpha synchrony has been reported to be especially strong in the deep layers of the cortex (Buffalo et al., 2011Buffalo E.A. Fries P. Landman R. Buschman T.J. Desimone R. Laminar differences in gamma and alpha coherence in the ventral stream.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), but it has been reported in the superficial layers as well (Bollimunta et al., 2011Bollimunta A. Mo J. Schroeder C.E. Ding M. Neuronal mechanisms and attentional modulation of corticothalamic α oscillations.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Modeling shows that alpha synchrony derived from specific synaptic mechanisms may play a role in blocking unwanted information from the cortex (Vijayan and Kopell, 2012Vijayan S. Kopell N.J. Thalamic model of awake alpha oscillations and implications for stimulus processing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 18553-18558Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, correlation does not prove causality, and it is very possible that alpha synchrony plays no causal role in attention or preferential processing of attended targets versus distracters. If the association between alpha laterality and spatial attention is mechanistically relevant, then it should be possible to experimentally manipulate spatial attention by modulating alpha laterality. In animal studies, one might attempt to test a causal role of alpha using optogenetic or electrical stimulation at alpha frequencies in animals, but direct stimulation is artificial and may synchronize population activity at far greater levels than found under normal physiological conditions. Depending on the type of genetic targeting, populations of heterogeneous types of cells will fire with short latency and little variability in response to a light pulse in optogenetic studies using CHR2, for example (Cardin et al., 2010Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.-H. Moore C.I. Targeted optogenetic stimulation and recording of neurons in vivo using cell-type-specific expression of Channelrhodopsin-2.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and it is also difficult to induce synchrony with stimulation without affecting other relevant circuit properties, including firing rates (Cardin et al., 2010Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.-H. Moore C.I. Targeted optogenetic stimulation and recording of neurons in vivo using cell-type-specific expression of Channelrhodopsin-2.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, there has been some progress in reducing these effects using low (theta) frequencies and low-power stimulation (Nandy et al., 2019Nandy A. Nassi J.J. Jadi M.P. Reynolds J. Optogenetically induced low-frequency correlations impair perception.Elife. 2019; 8: e35123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In humans, the most direct evidence of causality of alpha in attention has been obtained from non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Romei et al., 2010Romei V. Gross J. Thut G. On the role of prestimulus alpha rhythms over occipito-parietal areas in visual input regulation: correlation or causation?.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8692-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, Thut et al., 2011Thut G. Veniero D. Romei V. Miniussi C. Schyns P. Gross J. Rhythmic TMS causes local entrainment of natural oscillatory signatures.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1176-1185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) or transcranial alternating current stimulation (Neuling et al., 2013Neuling T. Rach S. Herrmann C.S. Orchestrating neuronal networks: sustained after-effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation depend upon brain states.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 161Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The results from these studies support the proposed suppressive role of alpha. However, these methods have some of the same limitations as stimulation studies in animals, including widespread effects or nonspecific synchronization in neural populations. Although all methods for testing causality suffer from limitations, neurofeedback might potentially influence neural activity in a way that is closer to the normal state. In monkeys, neurofeedback of activity in frontal eye fields has been used to control the animal’s attention in a way that resembles the normal state (Schafer and Moore, 2011Schafer R.J. Moore T. Selective attention from voluntary control of neurons in prefrontal cortex.Science. 2011; 332: 1568-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In humans, neurofeedback can be based on a measure of neural activity acquired from EEG, MEG, or fMRI, which is presented to a participant in real time through sensory feedback (for a review, see Sitaram et al., 2017Sitaram R.

Neurofeedback provides a unique opportunity to endogenously modulate neural activity as an independent variable and to search for variations in cognitive processes as a dependent variable (Sitaram et al., 2017Sitaram R.

A large number of physiological phenomena have been reported that can come under voluntary control by neurofeedback, including single-neuron firing rates recorded by intracranial electrodes in epilepsy patients (Cerf et al., 2010Cerf M.

EEG and MEG neurofeedback with high temporal resolution has been used to modify the power of brain oscillations in the frequency range of alpha (Hanslmayr et al., 2005Hanslmayr S. Sauseng P.

In this study, we used MEG neurofeedback to elucidate the causal relationship between alpha synchrony and spatial attention. Alpha was recorded predominantly from the parietal cortex, which is known to play an important role in the control of attention. The parietal cortex is also a major source of alpha synchrony in EEG studies. The most relevant study to our work is by Okazaki et al., 2015Okazaki Y.O. Horschig J.M. Luther L. Oostenveld R. Murakami I. Jensen O. Real-time MEG neurofeedback training of posterior alpha activity modulates subsequent visual detection performance.Neuroimage. 2015; 107: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, which also used MEG neurofeedback to train participants to modulate alpha hemispheric asymmetry. However, the subjects in that study were explicitly instructed to attend to the extrafoveal stimuli presented in the left or right visual field during training, whereas alpha power was used to modulate the visibility of the attended stimuli. Given that participants practiced spatial attention during neurofeedback, it is not clear whether a bias in attention was the cause or effect of the alpha modulations during training. In the present study, we used a task without any component of spatial attention in either the task or explicit instructions so that alpha could be manipulated independently. We developed a paradigm to train subjects to modify the relative alpha power recorded from the left versus right parietal cortex while performing a task at fixation. The task did not involve directing attention to either hemifield, and there were no explicit instructions given to the subjects regarding spatial attention. During the neurofeedback training, we tested for effects on visual processing of irrelevant probes. Finally, we asked whether there were persistent behavioral effects on attention even after training. For this, we compared performance in a classic Posner paradigm (Posner, 1980Posner M.I. Orienting of attention.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 1980; 32: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7041) Google Scholar) and a free-viewing task before and after neurofeedback training. Subjects (N = 20) were trained using MEG neurofeedback to manipulate relative alpha power over the parietal cortex in the left versus right hemisphere. The asymmetry in alpha power over the left versus right parietal cortex was used to modulate the contrast of stimuli used in a “match-to-sample” task presented at the center of gaze. To perform the task, the subjects learned to modulate their alpha asymmetry so that the stimuli were visible. The subjects were divided into two groups, the left neurofeedback training (LNT) group and right neurofeedback training (RNT) group, consisting of 10 participants each. The LNT group was trained to increase alpha power in the left relative to the right parietal cortex and vice versa for the RNT. Because increased alpha is associated with inattention, the increased alpha power in the left parietal cortex compared with the right parietal cortex was hypothesized to suppress visual processing and reduce spatial attention specifically in the right (contralateral) hemifield compared with the left hemifield. Consequently, the LNT was expected to enhance visual processing and attention to the left hemifield compared with the right hemifield. The RNT group was hypothesized to have the opposite effect after training. Because the task was presented at the center of gaze, any processing bias to the right versus left hemifield was not expected to influence task performance. Any left versus right processing biases were assessed separately with probe stimuli, as described later. The neurofeedback phase lasted 25–30 min and comprised 100 neurofeedback trials. On each trial, subjects performed an orientation match-to-sample task with foveally presented gratings. Neurofeedback was given during the sample grating presentation on each trial. Subjects were instructed to fixate on the center of the screen and use “mental effort” to increase the contrast and, hence, the visibility of the sample grating pattern after the color of the fixation cross turned to black. Therefore, the visibility of the sample grating was actually determined by alpha asymmetry (for details, see STAR Methods). Importantly, subjects were not given any instructions for covertly directing spatial attention but, rather, had to keep their focus of attention on the central stimulus. At the end of the neurofeedback period, the sample grating was removed from the screen, and after a 3-s delay period, the second test grating appeared in full contrast in an orientation that was either same or ±5° tilted away from the first grating. Participants reported whether the orientation of the test grating matched the one of the sample grating (Figure 1B). The neurofeedback was based on MEG signals recorded on each trial, which were stored in an online buffer and divided in real time into 500-ms data segments. Each data segment was used to compute alpha power from parietal sensors and estimate an alpha asymmetry index (AAI). The AAI was calculated as the alpha power of ipsilateral minus contralateral sensors to the training direction, normalized by their sum. This AAI value determined the contrast (i.e., the visibility) of the sample grating shown to the subject. This feedback cycle was updated every 500 ms (Figure 1A). Each neurofeedback trial included a 5-s baseline followed by a 5-s neurofeedback period during which the real-time AAI controlled the visibility of a grating pattern presented at the center of the screen. Negative AAI was set to 0% visibility, and positive AAI values linearly determined visibility from 0% to 100%. Despite the difficulty of the neurofeedback task, requiring concentration for a prolonged time, participants performed the discrimination task consistently above chance (percent correct ± SEM = 73.92% ± 4% and sensitivity index d’ ± SEM = 1.7 ± 0.3). We first assessed whether subjects were able to control parietal alpha lateralization during the neurofeedback trials. MEG data from the training session were mapped onto subject-specific cortical reconstructions using a dynamic statistical parametric mapping (dSPM) approach (Dale et al., 2000Dale A.M. Liu A.K. Fischl B.R. Buckner R.L. Belliveau J.W. Lewine J.D. Halgren E.

Ilmoniemi R.J. Interpreting magnetic fields of the brain: minimum norm estimates.Med. Biol. Eng. Comput. 1994; 32: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The cortical activation maps were then transformed to time-frequency power maps in the alpha range (8–12 Hz) using complex Morlet wavelets (Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999Tallon-Baudry C. Bertrand O. Oscillatory gamma activity in humans and its role in object representation.Trends Cogn. Sci. 1999; 3: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), and the resulting power maps were averaged over trials separately for the LNT and the RNT group. The time course of alpha power from the left and the right parietal cortex confirmed that participants could successfully modulate the laterality of alpha power in the desired direction (Figures 2A and 2B , left panels). We focused on the asymmetry of alpha power rather than the absolute magnitude because alpha power might be modulated by nonspecific influences, such as arousal. However, an examination of the individual data suggested that 45% of the participants modulated alpha by increasing their alpha in the ipsilateral hemisphere, 30% by reducing alpha in the contralateral hemisphere, and 25% with a combination of both increases and decreases. Overall, alpha power over the ipsilateral parietal cortex was stronger than contralateral alpha power, consistent with training during the neurofeedback period (two-sided permutation test, n = 10 for the LNT group and n = 10 for the RNT group, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected across time, FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). To test for effects of training on the power at other frequencies, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) during the neurofeedback period (0.5–4.8 s). The PSD of the parietal cortex (Figures 2A and 2B, right panels) revealed not only alpha asymmetry but also significant gamma asymmetry (two-sided permutation test, FDR-adjusted p < 0.05, FDR corrected across frequencies, n = 10 for the LNT group and n = 10 for the RNT group). This gamma asymmetry was in the opposite direction as the alpha asymmetry; that is, contralateral gamma power was stronger than ipsilateral gamma power. A reciprocal relationship between alpha and gamma has also been found in animal studies of attention (Zhou et al., 2016Zhou H. Schafer R.J. Desimone R. Pulvinar-Cortex Interactions in Vision and Attention.Neuron. 2016; 89: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although gamma asymmetry was indirectly affected by training, there was no significant correlation between gamma and alpha asymmetry across subjects (r = −0.37, p = 0.1, n = 20). The PSD of other cortical regions in the occipital, frontal, and temporal cortex (Figure S1) confirmed that significant alpha asymmetry and gamma asymmetry were also found in the lateral occipital cortex (two-sided permutation test, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons, FDR-adjusted p < 0.05, n = 10 for the LNT group and n = 10 for the RNT group), consistent with the idea that synchronous feedback from the parietal cortex may have modulated synchrony in the visual system. However, there was no significant frequency asymmetry in the frontal and temporal cortices (two-sided permutation test, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons, n = 10 for the LNT group and n = 10 for the RNT group). To probe the time course of the training effects, we tested whether alpha asymmetry was higher toward the end than the beginning of the training session. For this, we created cortical maps of alpha power separately for the first block (first 25 trials) and last block (last 25 trials) and their difference for each group separately (Figures 2C and 2D). We found no significant alpha asymmetry for the first block of trials for both the LNT group (two-sided permutation test, p = 0.066, Cohen’s d = 0.7, n = 10) and the RNT group (two-sided permutation test, p = 0.59, Cohen’s d = 0.19, n = 10) (Figures 2C and 2D, left panels). In contrast, alpha power asymmetry of the last block of trials increased in both groups toward the desired direction (two-sided permutation test, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 1.45, for the LNT group, n = 10; p = 0.008, Cohen’s d = 1.44, for the RNT group, n = 10) (Figures 2C and 2D, center panels). The difference between the last and the first blocks showed that alpha asymmetry was enhanced toward the end of the neurofeedback session (two-sided permutation test, p = 0.003, Cohen’s d = 1.2 for the LNT group, n = 10; p = 0.007, Cohen’s d = 0.88, for the RNT group, n = 10). Interestingly, in both groups, the left parietal cortex was the primary drive for these modulations. In the LNT group, the left parietal alpha increased (p = 0.01, n = 10, two-sided permutation test), but the right parietal alpha did not change (p = 0.16, n = 10, two-sided permutation test). In the RNT group, the left parietal alpha decreased (p = 0.04, n = 10, two-sided permutation test), but the right parietal alpha did not change (p = 0.8, n = 10, two-sided permutation test). Overall, neurofeedback training successfully modulated hemispheric alpha asymmetry over the parietal cortex in both the LNT and RNT groups in the desired direction, with the effect being stronger at the end of the training session (see Figure S2A for the distribution of AAI across all participants). In both groups, alpha asymmetry was primarily driven by modulations in the left parietal cortex, whose alpha activity increased in the LNT group and decreased in the RNT group, whereas alpha power in right parietal cortex did not change.

Inborn errors of TLR3- and DBR1-mediated central nervous system cell-intrinsic immunity can account for forebrain and brainstem HSE, respectively. We report five unrelated patients with forebrain HSE, each heterozygous for one of four rare variants of SNORA31, encoding a small nucleolar RNA of the H/ACA class that are predicted to direct the isomerization of uridine residues to pseudouridine in small nuclear RNA and ribosomal RNA. We show that CRISPR/Cas9-introduced bi- and monoallelic SNORA31 deletions render human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cortical neurons susceptible to HSV-1. Accordingly, SNORA31-mutated patient hPSC-derived cortical neurons are susceptible to HSV-1, like those from TLR3- or STAT1-deficient patients. Exogenous interferon (IFN)-β renders SNORA31- and TLR3- but not STAT1-mutated neurons resistant to HSV-1. Finally, transcriptome analysis of SNORA31-mutated neurons revealed normal responses to TLR3 and IFN-α/β stimulation but abnormal responses to HSV-1. Human SNORA31 thus controls central nervous system neuron-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 by a distinctive mechanism. Herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis is linked to variants in a small nucleolar RNA, suggesting a new mechanism for antiviral immunity in cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2993467370,"In the mammalian visual system, information from the retina streams into parallel bottom-up pathways. It remains unclear how these pathways interact to contribute to contextual modulation of visual cortical processing. By optogenetic inactivation and activation of mouse lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of thalamus, a homolog of pulvinar, or its projection to primary visual cortex (V1), we found that LP contributes to surround suppression of layer (L) 2/3 responses in V1 by driving L1 inhibitory neurons. This results in subtractive suppression of visual responses and an overall enhancement of orientation, direction, spatial, and size selectivity. Neurons in V1-projecting LP regions receive bottom-up input from the superior colliculus (SC) and respond preferably to non-patterned visual noise. The noise-dependent LP activity allows V1 to “cancel” noise effects and maintain its orientation selectivity under varying noise background. Thus, the retina-SC-LP-V1 pathway forms a differential circuit with the canonical retino-geniculate pathway to achieve context-dependent sharpening of visual representations."
https://openalex.org/W2981615366,"The medial frontal cortex has been linked to voluntary action, but an explanation of why decisions to act emerge at particular points in time has been lacking. We show that, in macaques, decisions about whether and when to act are predicted by a set of features defining the animal's current and past context; for example, respectively, cues indicating the current average rate of reward and recent previous voluntary action decisions. We show that activity in two brain areas-the anterior cingulate cortex and basal forebrain-tracks these contextual factors and mediates their effects on behavior in distinct ways. We use focused transcranial ultrasound to selectively and effectively stimulate deep in the brain, even as deep as the basal forebrain, and demonstrate that alteration of activity in the two areas changes decisions about when to act."
https://openalex.org/W2991975161,"Innate behaviors involve both reflexive motor programs and enduring internal states, but how these responses are coordinated by the brain is not clear. In Drosophila, male-specific P1 interneurons promote courtship song, as well as a persistent internal state that prolongs courtship and enhances aggressiveness. However, P1 neurons themselves are not persistently active. Here, we identify pCd neurons as persistently active, indirect P1 targets that are required for P1-evoked persistent courtship and aggression. Acute activation of pCd neurons alone is inefficacious but enhances and prolongs courtship or aggression promoted by female cues. Brief female exposure induces a persistent increase in male aggressiveness, an effect abrogated by interruption of pCd activity. pCd activity is not sufficient but necessary for persistent physiological activity, implying an essential role in a persistence network. Thus, P1 neurons coordinate both command-like control of courtship song and a persistent internal state of social arousal mediated by pCd neurons."

These studies establish the oral mucosa as an important model system to study epithelial stem cell populations and how they respond to tissue stresses. Epithelial stem cells must balance differentiation and self-renewal to build new tissues during development, maintain homeostasis, and repair after injury, and disequilibrium might result in stem cell depletion or cancer (Arwert et al., 2012Arwert E.N.

Oral epithelia comprise highly proliferative, stratified squamous mucosa specialized for the varied functions of feeding, speech, barrier function, breathing, and early digestion. Oral epithelial stem cells (OESCs) reside within the proliferative basal layer, while differentiating cells populate suprabasal (SB) layers (Papagerakis et al., 2014Papagerakis S. Pannone G. Zheng L.

Cell Res. 2014; 325: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although a recent study revealed a differentiation gradient among basal layer cells (Jones et al., 2018). Understanding how this spectrum of stem-like to transit-amplifying states is regulated might shed light on why oral mucosa heal rapidly and with minimal scarring, even in the face of constant challenges from mastication and pathogen exposure (Iglesias-Bartolome et al., 2018Iglesias-Bartolome R.

In adult epidermis, differentiation occurs primarily via delamination, or detachment, of basal cells from the underlying basement membrane (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal homeostasis: A balancing act of stem cells in the skin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). However, particularly during development, both oral epithelial and epidermal basal cells can position their mitotic spindles perpendicular to the basement membrane to execute asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs), whereby the suprabasal daughter differentiates while the basal daughter continues to proliferate. Alternatively, basal cells can execute self-renewing symmetric cell divisions (SCDs) when they divide within the epithelial plane (Byrd et al., 2016Byrd K.M. Lough K.J. Patel J.H. Descovich C.P.

The epidermis was originally proposed to consist of homogeneous clones—each containing a single, asymmetrically dividing stem cell surrounded by transit-amplifying cells—forming ordered columns called epidermal proliferative units (Potten, 1974Potten C.S. The epidermal proliferative unit: The possible role of the central basal cell.Cell Tissue Kinet. 1974; 7: 77-88PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, this “invariant asymmetry” model has been opposed by a “population asymmetry” model. Genetic lineage tracing and quantitative modeling have suggested that a single population of committed progenitors makes stochastic decisions to either self-renew or to differentiate (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E.

This leads to a phenomenon known as “neutral drift,” which makes several predictions of how clones evolve over time: (1) the number of stem cells per clone increases linearly, (2) clone sizes demonstrate “scaling” behavior, and (3) surviving clone fractions decrease in inverse proportion to the stem cell replacement rate (Klein and Simons, 2011Klein A.M.

Thus, whether regional OESC subpopulations exist, which markers define them, and whether they adhere to a single progenitor model remain largely unknown. The leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains (Lrig) family of transmembrane proteins has emerged as key regulators of stem cell behavior due to their function in growth factor receptor regulation (Gur et al., 2004Gur G.

Here, using lineage tracing, genetic label retention, and functional assays, we report striking OESC proliferative heterogeneity and provide evidence for the existence of a candidate niche within the junctional zone (JZ) of the hard palate (HP). We show that JZ OESCs display characteristics of stemness, including quiescence, self-renewal through planar oriented cell divisions, and Lrig1 enrichment. We demonstrate that OESCs are sensitive to both masticatory and wounding stresses, which impact tissue cycling/proliferation as well as Lrig1 expression. Finally, using RNA-seq and confirmatory lineage tracing, we identify two markers of HP heterogeneity. Lrig1 marks small, basal-rich JZ clones, whereas Igfbp5 labels large, suprabasal-rich clones located outside the JZ. Collectively, these data support the existence of regional OESC heterogeneity and provide early clues of niche-specific regulatory mechanisms. During stratified epithelial development, basal progenitors execute a bimodal pattern of planar SCDs and perpendicular ACDs to balance self-renewal and differentiation (Byrd et al., 2016Byrd K.M.

Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 758-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, because virtually all divisions are reported to be planar in adult stratified epithelia, differentiation might be driven by delamination rather than ACDs. To explore whether patterns of division orientation vary across oral epithelia, we investigated three different tissues: (1) ventral tongue (VT), an ectodermal-derived mucosal epithelium; (2) hard palate (HP), an ectodermal-derived masticatory epithelium, and (3) oropharynx, an endodermal-derived mucosal epithelium (Figure 1A). Despite their differences in location and morphology, proliferation rates were similar among these tissues (Figures S1A and S1B). To characterize division orientation, we used Survivin (Figure 1B), which localizes to the cleavage furrow during telophase, when division axis commitment occurs (Williams et al., 2011Williams S.E. Beronja S. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote Notch-dependent epidermal differentiation.Nature. 2011; 470: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although all oral epithelia display a mix of planar and perpendicular divisions during development (Byrd et al., 2016Byrd K.M. Lough K.J. Patel J.H. Descovich C.P. Curtis T.A. Williams S.E. LGN plays distinct roles in oral epithelial stratification, filiform papilla morphogenesis and hair follicle development.Development. 2016; 143: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the majority of divisions in adult VT and oropharynx were planar. However, in HP, a bimodal distribution of perpendicular and planar divisions was observed (Figures 1C and 1D), making it the only adult stratified epithelium described where the majority of cell divisions (53%, n = 137) remain perpendicular. To determine the relative contributions of ACDs, SCDs, and delamination to differentiation during OE homeostasis, we performed short-term (24 h, 36 h, and 48 h) lineage tracing by using a tamoxifen-inducible, basal-layer-specific Krt14CreER transgenic crossed to a multi-fluorophore reporter (LSL-Confetti). We assumed that: (1) two-cell clones consisting of one basal and one SB cell divided by perpendicular ACD, (2) two-basal cell clones divided by planar SCD, (3) single-basal cell clones had not divided, and (4) single-SB clones differentiated by delamination (Figure 1E). Confirming that they have similar overall proliferation rates, the fraction of clones that divided during a 24 h labeling period was similar for all tissues (35% for HP; 34.6% for oropharynx; and 38% for VT), although the HP showed a lower incidence of larger clones, particularly at 48 h (Figures 1F and S1C). Because ∼1/3 of all clones across tissues were single SB cells (Figure 1F), delamination is a significant driver of differentiation in oral epithelia. In agreement with the high proportion of planar divisions observed in VT and oropharynx, SCD clones outnumbered ACD clones in these tissues, whereas ACDs were more numerous than SCDs in HP, a result independently confirmed with a second K5CreER reporter line (Figure 1F). The strong correlation between division angles and clone types in each tissue strongly suggests that division orientation dictates cell fate, at least within this labeling period. Genetic lineage tracing represents a powerful means to determine how stem cell populations contribute to tissue growth and maintenance (Blanpain and Simons, 2013Blanpain C. Simons B.D. Unravelling stem cell dynamics by lineage tracing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To study regional growth dynamics in oral epithelia, we induced clones with a single dose of tamoxifen in Krt14CreER; LSL-Confetti mice, and we harvested one month later. To display clone size distributions, we created clonal density arrays (CDAs, Figure 1G), where basal and SB cells per clone are plotted on x and y axes, respectively, and darker colors represent higher frequencies. We used CDAs to define four clone subtypes (Figure S1D): (1) latent (≤2 B and SB cells/clone), (2) basal-rich (B:SB ratio ≥ 3), (3) suprabasal-rich (SB:B ratio ≥ 3), and (4) balanced (all others). Both VT and oropharynx favored balanced basal-layer expansion and SB differentiation, similar to what was recently reported in buccal OE (Jones et al., 2019Jones K.B. Furukawa S. Marangoni P. Ma H. Pinkard H. D’Urso R. Zilionis R. Klein A.M. Klein O.D.

Simons B.D. Universal patterns of stem cell fate in cycling adult tissues.Development. 2011; 138: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, HP frequently displayed perpendicularly oriented columns of cells with one or few basal cells (Figure 1G, HP1); this was found in 50% of clones in the SB-rich subtype, compared to 10% and 6% in VT and oropharynx, respectively. In addition, latent clones (Figure 1G, HP2) were more numerous in HP (38%) compared to VT or oropharynx (10% and 8%, respectively), and 49% of HP clones consisted of a single basal cell, compared to 11% for VT and 23% for oropharynx (Figure 1H). Similar results were independently confirmed with the Krt5CreER reporter (Figures S1E and S1F). Collectively, these data suggest that a high percentage of HP clones utilize a unique renewal pattern of invariant ACDs during homeostasis. To follow clonal growth dynamics and turnover, we extended our lineage-tracing experiments out to 6 months. Consistent with neutral drift kinetics, all regions demonstrated a linear increase in basal cells/clone over time and a progressive decrease in surviving clone density (Figures 1I and 1J). Of note, however: HP displayed the slowest rate of increase in clone size over time and the highest proportion of surviving clones at late time points (Figure S1G). Thus, despite having similar proliferation rates, HP clones grow slower and have an increased probability of survival compared to VT and oropharynx clones. Together, these findings suggest that the HP harbors unusual proliferative heterogeneity. The mammalian HP contains numerous rugae, which are mediolaterally-oriented, corrugated ridges thought to function together with the dorsal tongue in tactile sensation, bolus formation, and speech articulation (Moayedi et al., 2018Moayedi Y. Duenas-Bianchi L.F. Lumpkin E.A. Somatosensory innervation of the oral mucosa of adult and aging mice.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 9975Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Peterková et al., 1987Peterková R. Klepácek I. Peterka M. Prenatal development of rugae palatinae in mice: Scanning electron microscopic and histologic studies.J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. 1987; 7: 169-189PubMed Google Scholar). Mice have between 8–9 rugae (R), subclassified into antemolar (R1–R3) and intermolar (R4–R8) on the basis of their positions relative to the three maxillary teeth (Figures 2A and 2B ). Ruga peaks are separated by valleys, termed inter-rugae (IR), of flattened epithelium. Interestingly, most long-lived HP clones localized to the slopes of palatal rugae, at R/IR junctions (Figure S1G). Although the R and IR are delimited by molecularly distinct developmental programs (Welsh and O’Brien, 2009Welsh I.C. O’Brien T.P. Signaling integration in the rugae growth zone directs sequential SHH signaling center formation during the rostral outgrowth of the palate.Dev. Biol. 2009; 336: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), no markers have been described to distinguish these regions in the adult. Therefore, we used morphological criteria (Figure 2C) to define the R region as the upper 50% of the ruga peaks; the IR region as the area between the inflection points of ruga slopes; and the junctional zone (JZ) as the lower 50% of the ruga slope, between the R and IR domains. We employed CDAs to display clone distributions by location at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months (Figures 2D and 2E). R clones appeared to expand most rapidly and tended to be SB-rich, with ∼1/3 of clones consisting of >10 basal cells and >12 SB cells at 3 months. Although less expansive than R clones, IR clones were mostly of the SB-rich and balanced types. Conversely, JZ clones displayed an unusual bifurcation of clonal behavior by 3 months (basal-rich and SB-rich both represented ∼17%). While many clones consisted of 1–2 basal cells with multiple SB cells, consistent with invariant asymmetric expansion. A sizable minority of clones also expanded through SCDs with little differentiation (basal-rich + latent clone fraction = 41%). This behavior was uncommon in the R and IR (basal-rich + latent fraction = 0% for R and 26% for IR). While basal cell numbers increased linearly with time in each region, the JZ also showed the lowest average number of basal cells/clone at all time points (Figure 2F). Moreover, the number of SB cells/clone was lowest in the JZ (Figure 2G), suggesting that they undergo comparatively less differentiation. Finally, in examining the location of surviving clones (Figure 2H), we noted that JZ clones persist, while R and IR clones are lost over time, demonstrating that JZ clones are long-lived. These data show that the JZ demonstrates unique growth behaviors and might be a stem cell niche for slow-dividing OESCs. Label-dilution assays represent another means to assess proliferation kinetics and identify populations of relative quiescence. Genetically, this can be accomplished by using doxycycline (dox)-regulable bipartite “tet-off” transgenics (Krt5tTA; tetOH2B-GFP or K5-GFP; Figure 3A). During the pulse period, stable histone H2B-GFP expression is initiated in all K5+ stratified epithelia, beginning during embryogenesis. Subsequent dox administration initiates the chase period, where existing label is diluted with each cell division (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Because of subtle differences in K5/K14 expression seen across OE (Figure S2A), we also took a parallel approach with Krt14Cre; LSLtTA; tetOH2B-GFP mice (K14-GFP), which we compared to the K5-GFP line (Figures 3B, 3C, S2B, and S2C). We first confirmed near-complete initial labeling (>95% of basal cells) of oral epithelia before chasing for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (Figures 3B and 3C). In lingual epithelia (tongue and oropharynx), GFP was rapidly diluted by 1 week and virtually absent by 2 weeks, whereas in the HP, discrete pockets of GFP+ label-retaining cells (LRCs) remained (Figures 3C, S2B, and S2C).

Different whole blood RNA collection and processing methods are highly variable and might confound comparisons of results across studies. The main aim of the current study is to compare how blood storage, extraction methodologies, and the blood components themselves may influence gene expression profiling. Whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected in triplicate from five healthy donors. Whole blood was collected in RNAgard® and PAXgene® Blood RNA Tubes, as well as in collection tubes with anticoagulants such as dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) and Acid Citrate Dextrose Solution A (ACD-A). PBMCs were separated using sodium citrate Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT™), FICOLL™, magnetic separation, and the LeukoLOCK™ methods. After blood collection, the LeukoLOCK™, K2EDTA and ACD-A blood tubes were shipped overnight using cold conditions and samples from the rest of the collection were immediately frozen with or without pre-processing. The RNA was isolated from whole blood and PBMCs using a total of 10 different experimental conditions employing several widely utilized RNA isolation methods. The RNA quality was assessed by RNA Integrity Number (RIN), which showed that all PBMC procedures had the highest RIN values when blood was stabilized in TRIzol® Reagent before RNA extraction. Initial data analysis showed that human blood stored and shipped at 4°C overnight performed equally well when checked for quality using RNA integrity number when compared to frozen stabilized blood. Comparisons within and across donor/method replicates showed signal-to-noise patterns which were not captured by RIN value alone. Pathway analysis using the top 1000 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed frozen vs. cold shipping conditions greatly impacted gene expression patterns in whole blood. However, the top 1000 FDR corrected DEGs from PBMCs preserved after frozen vs. cold shipping conditions (LeukoLOCK™ preserved in RNAlater®) revealed no significantly affected pathways. Our results provide novel insight into how RNA isolation, various storage, handling, and processing methodologies can influence RNA quality and apparent gene expression using blood samples. Careful consideration is necessary to avoid bias resulting from downstream processing. Better characterization of the effects of collection method idiosyncrasies will facilitate further research in understanding the effect of gene expression variability in human sample types."

A detailed understanding of the prevalence, contamination levels and molecular characteristics of Campylobacter spp. in cattle and chicken, which are likely the most important sources of human contamination, is imperative. A collection of 1243 poultry meat samples (665 chicken breasts and 578 chicken thighs) and 1203 bovine meat samples (689 hamburgers and 514 knife-cut meat preparations) were collected at retail outlets, in randomly selected supermarkets located in different Italian regions during one year. Of these samples, 17.38% of the poultry meat and 0.58% of the bovine meat samples tested positive for Campylobacter, of which 131 were Campylobacter jejuni (57.96%) and 95 were Campylobacter coli (42.03%). Campylobacter isolates were genotyped with the aim of assessing the genetic diversity, population structure, source distribution and Campylobacter transmission route to humans. All isolates were molecularly characterized by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and further genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and fla-SVR sequencing to gain better insight into the population structure. Antibiotic resistance was also investigate. The highest levels of resistance among chicken strains were observed for ciprofloxacin (88.25%), nalidixic acid (81.45%) and tetracycline (75.6%). PFGE analysis revealed 73 pulsotypes for C. jejuni and 54 pulsotypes for C. coli, demonstrating the existance of different and specific clones circulating in Italy. MLST of C.jejuni isolates mainly clustered in the CC353, CC354, CC21, CC206 and CC443; while C.coli isolates clustered only in CC828. The most common flaA alleles were 287 for C. jejuni and 66 for C. coli. Our study confirms that poultry meat is the main source of Campylobacteriosis, whereas red meat had a low level of contamination suggesting a minor role in transmission. The high presence of Campylobacter in retail chicken meat, paired with its increased resistance to antimicrobials with several multidrug resistance profiles detected, is alarming and represents a persistent threat to public health."

However, few upstream regulators of ankyrin-G at synapses are known. Ankyrin-G contains 24 ankyrin-repeat domains (ANKRDs). The ANKRD has an important role in protein-protein interactions through variations in adaptive surface residues (Mosavi et al., 2004Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. The ankyrin repeat as molecular architecture for protein recognition.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Remarkably, ANKRDs are among the most common protein-protein interaction domains, present in 270 human proteins with diverse functions (Bork, 1993Bork P.

Moreover, genomic studies support a key role for postsynaptic proteins in the pathogenesis of these disorders (Gilman et al., 2011Gilman S.R. Iossifov I. Levy D. Ronemus M. Wigler M. Vitkup D.

Despite their importance, little is known about how the levels of ankyrin-G and other ANKRD proteins, in particular, at synapses, are maintained in their normal physiological range. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a mechanism whereby cells maintain physiological levels of proteins, and abnormal neuronal proteostasis leads to disorders associated with abnormal protein levels and to excessive protein aggregation (Galves et al., 2019Galves M.

Sci. 2019; 44: 872-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One major mechanism for proteostasis is through protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (van Roessel et al., 2004van Roessel P. Elliott D.A. Robinson I.M. Prokop A. Brand A.H. Independent regulation of synaptic size and activity by the anaphase-promoting complex.Cell. 2004; 119: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which is also crucial for synaptic remodeling (Ehlers, 2003Ehlers M.D. Activity level controls postsynaptic composition and signaling via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat.

Bradfield J.P. et al.Autism genome-wide copy number variation reveals ubiquitin and neuronal genes.Nature. 2009; 459: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Proteins are targeted for degradation by the UPS through the addition of polyubiquitin chains to their lysine residues. Ubiquitination is performed in a three-tiered enzymatic cascade by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3), respectively. Of these, the E3 ubiquitin ligase cell division cycle 20/anaphase-promoting complex (Cdc20/APC) controls dendrite morphogenesis and synapse size in the developing brain (Kim et al., 2009Kim A.H. Puram S.V. Bilimoria P.M. Ikeuchi Y. Keough S. Wong M. Rowitch D. Bonni A. A centrosomal Cdc20-APC pathway controls dendrite morphogenesis in postmitotic neurons.Cell. 2009; 136: 322-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Deubiquitinases (DUBs) oppose this process by removing ubiquitin from proteins, and deubiquitylation is crucial for proteostasis regulation (Bett, 2016Bett J.S. Proteostasis regulation by the ubiquitin system.Essays Biochem. 2016; 60: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activation or inhibition of DUBs has been shown to induce synaptic plasticity (Cartier et al., 2009Cartier A.E. Djakovic S.N. Salehi A. Wilson S.M. Masliah E. Patrick G.N. Regulation of synaptic structure by ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recent studies support a role for dysregulation of the UPS pathway in SZ, BD (Ehlers, 2003Ehlers M.D. Activity level controls postsynaptic composition and signaling via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), ID (Hollstein et al., 2015Hollstein R. Parry D.A. Nalbach L. Logan C.V. Strom T.M. Hartill V.L. Carr I.M. Korenke G.C. Uppal S.

Genet. 2015; 52: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and ASD (Glessner et al., 2009Glessner J.T. Wang K. Cai G. Korvatska O. Kim C.E. Wood S. Zhang H. Estes A. Brune C.W. Bradfield J.P. et al.Autism genome-wide copy number variation reveals ubiquitin and neuronal genes.Nature. 2009; 459: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein turnover may play an important role in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as compared to ubiquitylation, little is known about the synaptic targets of DUBs and about how deubiquitination of PSD proteins impacts spine plasticity and contributes to disease pathogenesis. To identify novel upstream regulators of ankyrin-G at synapses, here we used an unbiased yeast-2-hybrid screen and found that it interacts with Usp9X, a DUB mutated in patients with neurodevelopmental disability. Phosphorylation enhances Usp9X/ankyrin-G interaction, decreases ankyrin-G poly-ubiquitination, and stabilizes ankyrin-G, to maintain dendritic spines. In situ proximity ligation combined with structured-illumination super-resolution microscopy reveals the postsynaptic spatial organization of this pathway. In forebrain-specific Usp9X conditional knockout (Usp9X–/Y) mice, levels of multiple ANKRD proteins, including key autism risk factors, are transiently reduced at 2 but recover at 12 weeks postnatally. However, Usp9X–/Y mice show reduced cortical spine density, which surprisingly persists into adulthood, when it co-occurs with elevated ankyrin-G ubiquitination and aggregation. Consistent with this mechanism, mutations in the USP9X gene in patients with ID and ASD ablate either its catalytic activity or its interaction with ankyrin-G. Our data provide insight into the regulation of homeostasis of ANKRD-containing proteins at synapses as well as the biology of synaptic DUBs. Impairment of this process, while it only transiently affects ANKRD protein levels, leads to persistent neuronal and clinical abnormalities. To identify regulators of ankyrin-G, we performed a yeast-2-hybrid screen using its ankyrin repeats 1–12 (aa35–423) as bait. We identified the peptidase domain (aa1719–1842) of the Usp9X DUB, encoded by USP9X, a gene mutated in ID and epilepsy (Reijnders et al., 2016Reijnders M.R. Zachariadis V. Latour B. Jolly L. Mancini G.M. Pfundt R. Wu K.M. van Ravenswaaij-Arts C.M. Veenstra-Knol H.E. Anderlid B.M. et al.DDD StudyDe Novo Loss-of-Function Mutations in USP9X Cause a Female-Specific Recognizable Syndrome with Developmental Delay and Congenital Malformations.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 98: 373-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We confirmed their interaction in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation from mouse cortex (Figure 1B) and mapped ankyrin-G’s ANKRD and regulatory domains as interaction sites with Usp9X’s peptidase domain (Figure 1C). Proteins are targeted for degradation by UPS through the addition of polyubiquitin chains to their lysines, by a cascade including ubiquitin ligases (E3). Ankyrin-G contains seven “destruction box” (D box), E3 ligase recognition motifs—two within the ANKRD (aa140–143, 282–285), which are highly conserved, and two lysine-glutamate-lysine (KEN) boxes, APC recognition motifs (Figure 1D; Table S1). In addition, three lysines are located within the ANKRD (K39; K260; K268) (Figure S1B). All seven D boxes were previously shown to be ubiquitinated (Hornbeck et al., 2015Hornbeck P.V. Zhang B. Murray B. Kornhauser J.M. Latham V. Skrzypek E. PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D512-D520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Threading of ankyrin-G’s ANKRD onto the ankyrin-B structure (Figure 1E) revealed that these conserved lysines are solvent exposed, further supporting their availability for ubiquitination. Indeed, treatment of cultured cortical neurons with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to increased ankyrin-G levels, demonstrating that ankyrin-G is degraded by the proteasome (Figure 1F). Because the ANKRD was highly polyubiquitinated, we focused further on this domain (Figure 1G). The D box is a recognition motif for the major neuronal E3 ligase Cdc20/APC, which regulates dendrite morphogenesis (Kim et al., 2009Kim A.H. Puram S.V. Bilimoria P.M. Ikeuchi Y. Keough S. Wong M. Rowitch D. Bonni A. A centrosomal Cdc20-APC pathway controls dendrite morphogenesis in postmitotic neurons.Cell. 2009; 136: 322-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mutation of one or both D boxes (Figure 1H) or of the lysines (Figure S1C) within ANKRD attenuated the effect of MG132 on ANKRD polyubiquitination in HEK293T cells. We compared the degradation kinetics in neurons of wild-type (WT) GFP-ankyrin-G1–807 with its D box-mutated version by time-lapse imaging in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The D box mutant exhibited slower degradation than WT GFP-ankyrin-G1–807 (Figure 1I), suggesting that ankyrin-G stability is regulated by Cdc20/APC-dependent ubiquitination of its ANKRD. Usp9X was most highly colocalized with ankyrin-G in the somatodendritic compartment (Figure S2C). Because of the limited resolution of confocal microscopy, we employed structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to analyze the precise spatial organization of ankyrin-G and Usp9X (Figure 2A). Frequently, multiple ankyrin-G nanodomains were adjacent to or overlapping with Usp9X puncta in perisynaptic areas (Figure 2B). Their relative localization was substantiated using ratiometric images, colocalization highlighter, line scans, and 3D reconstructions (Figures 2B and 2C). Most spines exhibited two or more ankyrin-G nanodomains surrounding Usp9X (Figure 2D). To understand how the localization of ankyrin-G and Usp9X nanodomains correlates with spine morphology, we analyzed their subcellular distribution by SIM images. Interestingly, Usp9X was observed in only 9.1% of spine necks, despite the presence of Usp9X within 46.0% of the spine heads (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the presence of Usp9X in spine heads was significantly correlated with larger spine head sizes, but no correlation was observed between its presence in the spine neck and head size (Figure 2F). Ankyrin-G nanodomains were present in 89.4% of spine heads and 52.0% of spine necks (Figure 2G), and the spine head size correlated to the presence of ankyrin-G in the spine head and neck (Figure 2H). The number of Usp9X nanodomains per spine correlated to the spine head area (Figure 2I), while the total Usp9X nanodomain area per spine correlated to spine head size and to the number and size of ankyrin-G nanodomains within the spine head (Figure 2J–2L). Recent studies have suggested that Usp9X plays a role in neuronal development (Oishi et al., 2016Oishi S. Premarathne S. Harvey T.J. Iyer S. Dixon C. Alexander S. Burne T.H. Wood S.A. Piper M. Usp9x-deficiency disrupts the morphological development of the postnatal hippocampal dentate gyrus.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 25783Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Stegeman et al., 2013Stegeman S. Jolly L.A. Premarathne S. Gecz J. Richards L.J. Mackay-Sim A. Wood S.A. Loss of Usp9x disrupts cortical architecture, hippocampal development and TGFβ-mediated axonogenesis.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e68287Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the impact of manipulating Usp9X levels on dendritic spine morphology in mature cultured cortical neurons. Usp9X knockdown caused a significant reduction of spine head size and density (Figures 3A–3C). Conversely, overexpression of its peptidase domain resulted in spine head enlargement and rescued the effect of Usp9X knockdown on spine density (Figures 3E and 3F). Moreover, overexpression of the peptidase domain of Usp9X attenuated the increase in ubiquitinated ankyrin-G induced by MG132 (Figure 3G). Furthermore, expression of ankyrin-G with two mutated D boxes increased spine size in control neurons and rescued spine density in shUsp9X-expressing neurons (Figures 3H–3J). Taken together, these data suggest that Usp9X-mediated deubiquitination stabilizes ankyrin-G levels and maintains spine architecture. Among post-translational modifications (PTMs), phosphorylation of binding hotspots in hydrolases tends to modulate the strength of interaction to target substrates directly (Nishi et al., 2011Nishi H. Hashimoto K. Panchenko A.R. Phosphorylation in protein-protein binding: effect on stability and function.Structure. 2011; 19: 1807-1815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Three S/T phosphorylation consensus sites were identified in Usp9X’s peptidase domain (Ser1593/1600/1609) (Hornbeck et al., 2015Hornbeck P.V. Zhang B. Murray B. Kornhauser J.M. Latham V. Skrzypek E. PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D512-D520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Usp9X may alter protein-protein interaction. To investigate the role of phosphorylation in regulating the Usp9X and ankyrin-G interaction, we predicted possible models based on the crystal structure of Usp9X. Structural reports have identified the inner groove of the ANKRD as a promiscuous protein-protein interaction site (Al-Khodor et al., 2010Al-Khodor S. Price C.T. Kalia A. Abu Kwaik Y. Functional diversity of ankyrin repeats in microbial proteins.Trends Microbiol. 2010; 18: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of ankyrin-G and the peptidase domain of Usp9X suggests that lysine deubiquitination would result in extensive contacts between the ankyrin-G scaffolding site and Usp9X (Figure 4A; Figure S4). Multiple alignments of Usp9X with related DUBs, including USP7, reveals that these phosphorylation sites lie within a disordered region of low homology that may form an ankyrin-G interaction site-specific to Usp9X within the DUB family (Figure 4B). Phosphorylation on S1593 and S1609 may alter the Usp9X-ankyrin-G interaction through charge-charge interactions with exposed basic residues present on the inner groove of the ankyrin-G ANKRD. In order to assess whether these sites are subject to PTM, mutagenesis of the peptidase domain of Usp9X (Usp9X1555–1958-S1593A-S1600A-S1609A; Usp9XS3A) was carried out. Usp9X1555–1958 (Usp9XWt) was immunoprecipitated by phosphoserine antibody, but not by Usp9XS3A, suggesting that those serine sites in Usp9X might have critical role for phosphorylation (Figure S5A). To confirm the prediction of our homology modeling, we used in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), which labels protein-protein interactions within a 16 nm distance (Trifilieff et al., 2011Trifilieff P. Rives M.L. Urizar E. Piskorowski R.A. Vishwasrao H.D. Castrillon J. Schmauss C. Slättman M. Gullberg M. Javitch J.A. Detection of antigen interactions ex vivo by proximity ligation assay: endogenous dopamine D2-adenosine A2A receptor complexes in the striatum.Biotechniques. 2011; 51: 111-118PubMed Google Scholar). In basal conditions, PLA signals indicate the interaction of ankyrin-G1–807 and Usp9X1555–1958, but it was absent upon co-expression of phospho-null Usp9XS3A (Figure 4C) without different expression level of each construct in HEK293T cells (Figure S5C). Conversely, individual phosphomimetic mutations of each serine (S1598D, S1600D, S1608D) were tested, and S1608D showed significant increase in interaction with ankyrin-G. Moreover, mutagenesis of all three serine sites (Usp9XS3D) showed the most robust enhancement (Figure 4D; Figure S5B). To test whether mutation on these residues alters the activity of Usp9X, we developed an in vitro DUB assay using recombinantly expressed mouse Usp9X1547–1962 alongside Usp9XS3A and a catalytically null construct, Usp9XH1878A. Despite the robust alterations in interaction observed (Figures 4C and 4D), no difference in Usp9X activity was observed between WT and phospho-null proteins, indicating that mutagenesis does not alter the DUB activity of Usp9X, nor the structural stability of the domain (Figure 4E). Also, although each Usp9X phosphomimetic mutant showed enhanced interaction with ankyrin-G, their catalytic activity was unaltered in vitro (Figure 4F). To investigate the role of phosphorylation of Usp9X in spines, Usp9XWt or Usp9XS3A was co-transfected into cortical cultured neurons with control RNAi or shUsp9X construct. Overexpression of GFP-Usp9XS3A significantly decreased spine size and density, while overexpression of WT Usp9X1555–1958 rescued the effect of shUsp9X on spines (Figures 4H–4J). These data suggest that phosphorylation of Usp9X’s peptidase domain regulates spine head size and density. The PLA method allows interacting proteins to be spatially and quantitatively visualized. To observe interaction patterns of endogenous ankyrin-G and mutated Usp9X in neurons, we overexpressed FLAG-Usp9X with either WT or S3D or S3A. Confocal images showed PLA signals increased in the dendrites and spines with Usp9XS3D (Figure 4K). To overcome limited access of in situ PLA analysis because of a small number of puncta, HA-ankyrin-G and Flag-Usp9XS3D were co-transfected in primary cultured cortical neurons to investigate the effect of phosphorylated-three serine sites in the peptidase domain of Usp9X (Usp9XS3D) on ankyrin-G and spines. Likewise, overexpression in HEK293T cells, PLA signals increased in Usp9XS3D (Figure 4L). Because in situ PLA allows interacting proteins to be spatially and quantitatively visualized, we developed an approach combining PLA with SIM (PLA-SIM) to investigate the spatial organization of Usp9X-ankyrin-G interaction within spines and its relationship to spine size. Interestingly, Usp9XS3D increased the ratio of ankyrin-G-expressing spines co-incident with an increase in PLA positive spines (Figure 4N), and it prompted increase of spine density (Figure 4O). Spine heads expressing ankyrin-G are significantly larger than spine heads without ankyrin-G (Figures 4P–4Q), as previously reported (Smith et al., 2014Smith K.R. Kopeikina K.J. Fawcett-Patel J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2994187337,"Many neuronal types occur as pairs that are similar in most respects but differ in a key feature. In some pairs of retinal neurons, called paramorphic, one member responds to increases and the other to decreases in luminance (ON and OFF responses). Here, we focused on one such pair, starburst amacrine cells (SACs), to explore how closely related neuronal types diversify. We find that ON and OFF SACs are transcriptionally distinct prior to their segregation, dendritic outgrowth, and synapse formation. The transcriptional repressor Fezf1 is selectively expressed by postmitotic ON SACs and promotes the ON fate and gene expression program while repressing the OFF fate and program. The atypical Rho GTPase Rnd3 is selectively expressed by OFF SACs and regulates their migration but is repressed by Fezf1 in ON SACs, enabling differential positioning of the two types. These results define a transcriptional program that controls diversification of a paramorphic pair."

Using this platform, we quantified the bone marrow (BM) distribution of individual CXCL12 chemokine proteins, both before and after their depletion by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. We found ubiquitous CXCL12 distributions with local enrichments but no long-range gradients, in contrast to current assumptions about how CXCL12 controls migration of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within BM.

Furthermore, it verifies the usefulness of such research using an original test stand. Materials and methods The article presents the effects of three operational parameters of a wheelchair on the position of the centre of gravity of the human body. The study included 27 wheelchair propulsion tests of a wheelchair with pushrim propulsion using the following variable parameters: gear ratio of the propulsion system, propulsion frequency and wheelchair tilt angle. The position of the centre of gravity of the human body was measured in dynamic conditions at 100 Hz. The results were represented with ellipses defining the region of variability of the position of the centre of gravity of the human body. The coordinates of the centre of gravity were measured in relation to the reference system, with the start point at the centre of the axis of rotation of the rear wheelchair wheels. The measurements were taken in a horizontal plane in relation to the base on which the test stand was positioned. Results The research carried out shows that the inclination angle of the wheelchair has the greatest influence on position of the ellipse describing the position of the centre of gravity of the human body. By controlling the change in the inclination angle value in the range from 0° to 5.4°, the standard deviation of the length of the horizontal half-axis of the ellipse (SD a) equal to 31.2 mm was obtained. For comparison, by changing the frequency of pushes (40 to 50 pushes per minute) of the wheelchair at a constant inclination angle, the standard deviation of the horizontal half-axis length (SD a) equal to 8 mm was recorded. The results of the study show a change in the position of the centre of gravity of the human body in dynamic conditions. They are relative to the contact points of the wheelchair wheels with the ground. Using the dimensions of the plotted ellipses, one can determine the values of pressure that affect the wheelchair’s individual wheels. Conclusions–Increasing the value of each aforementioned parameter resulted in the increase of strength required by the operator to propel the wheelchair. It directly influenced the position of the centre of gravity during the test."
https://openalex.org/W2993168479,"Undernutrition in children remains a major global health issue and the prevalence of undernutrition in children under age five in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is among the highest in the world. Both biological and socioeconomic factors contribute to undernutrition, and the literature reports an association between women's empowerment and lower rates of child undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the relationship between women's decision-making power and child undernutrition is less understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between women's decision-making power and stunting/wasting in their children under age five in the DRC. This study used cross-sectional data from the 2013-2014 DRC Demographic and Health Survey, from which a sample of 3,721 woman-child pairs were identified. Women were classified as having decision-making power in five decision-making dimensions if they participated in the decision either alone or jointly with their husband or partner or someone else. Child height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores were used to determine stunting and wasting, respectively, according to the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that none of the five dimensions of decision-making power were associated with stunting or wasting in children. Further research that evaluates women's decision-making power with more detailed, relevant and context-specific measures is warranted to more accurately investigate women's decision-making power and undernutrition in children."
https://openalex.org/W2993694260,"Aim The current study aimed to investigate the effects of Debaryomyces hansenii on the diversity of bacterial lactase gene in the intestinal mucosa of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) mice. Methods Eighteen mice were randomly divided into three groups (6 mice per group): healthy control group, diarrhea model group and D. hansenii treatment group. The antibiotic-associated diarrhea model was established by intragastric administration with a mixture of cephradine and gentamicin sulfate (23.33 mL·kg-1·d-1) twice a day for 5 days continuously. After establishing the AAD model, the mice in the D. hansenii treatment group were gavaged with D. hansenii for three days, while other groups were gavaged with distilled water. Then, the intestinal mucosa of all three groups was collected and DNA was extracted in an aseptic environment for the following analysis. Results The difference in the richness and homogeneity of the bacterial lactase gene among all samples were inapparent, as the difference in the Chao1, ACE, Simpson and Shannon indices among the three groups were insignificant (P>0.05). NMDS analysis also showed that the distance of the samples among the three groups was unobvious. Furthermore, the bacterial lactase gene in the mucosa mainly originated from Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Compared with the healthy control group, the abundance of lactase genes originating from Cupriavidus, Lysobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas was increased in the D. hansenii treatment group, while the lactase gene from Acidovorax and Stenotrophomonas decreased (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) in the diarrhea model group and the D. hansenii treatment group. Conclusion D. hansenii was capable of improving the growth of some key lactase-producing bacteria like Deinococcus, Cupriavidus and Lysobacter for treating AAD."

EE measured using metabolic chambers increased transiently by what was considered a relatively small extent after the switch to the KD, whereas EE measured using doubly labeled water (EEDLW) increased to a greater degree after the response in the chambers had waned. Using a publicly available dataset, we examined the effect of housing conditions on the magnitude of the increase in EEDLW after the switch to the KD and the role of physical activity in that response.The 14-day EEDLW measurement period included 4 days when subjects were confined to chambers instead of living in wards. To determine the effect on EEDLW only for the days subjects were living in the wards, we calculated non-chamber EE (EEnonchamber). To assess the role of physical activity in the response to the KD, we analyzed chamber and non-chamber accelerometer data for the BD and KD EEDLW measurement periods.In comparison with the increase in average 14-day EEDLW of 151 kcal/d ± 63 (P = 0.03) after the switch to the KD, EEnonchamber increased by 203 ± 89 kcal/d (P = 0.04) or 283 ± 116 kcal/d (P = 0.03) depending on the analytical approach. Hip accelerometer counts decreased significantly (P = 0.01) after the switch to the KD, whereas wrist and ankle accelerometer counts did not change.Switching from the BD to the KD substantially increased EEDLW, but apparently only on days subjects were living in the ward outside the metabolic chamber. Increased physical activity as measured by accelerometry did not appear to account for this effect."

During a screen for genes involved in presynaptic homeostatic synaptic plasticity, we identified an essential role for the histone acetyltransferase and deubiquitinase SAGA complex in peripheral glia. We present evidence that the SAGA complex is necessary for homeostatic plasticity, demonstrating involvement of four new genes in homeostatic plasticity.

In this paper we show how the sensitivity of MALDI profiling of intact proteins in unfractionated human serum can be substantially increased by exposing a sample to many more laser shots than are commonly used. Analytical reproducibility is also improved. Methods To assess what is theoretically achievable we utilized spectra from the same samples obtained over many years and combined them to generate MALDI spectral averages of up to 100,000,000 shots for a single sample, and up to 8,000,000 shots for a set of 40 different serum samples. Spectral attributes, such as number of peaks and spectral noise of such averaged spectra were investigated together with analytical reproducibility as a function of the number of shots. We confirmed that results were similar on MALDI instruments from different manufacturers. Results We observed an expected decrease of noise, roughly proportional to the square root of the number of shots, over the whole investigated range of the number of shots (5 orders of magnitude), resulting in an increase in the number of reliably detected peaks. The reproducibility of the amplitude of these peaks, measured by CV and concordance analysis also improves with very similar dependence on shot number, reaching median CVs below 2% for shot numbers > 4 million. Measures of analytical information content and association with biological processes increase with increasing number of shots. Conclusions We demonstrate that substantially increasing the number of laser shots in a MALDI-TOF analysis leads to more informative and reliable data on the protein content of unfractionated serum. This approach has already been used in the development of clinical tests in oncology."

https://openalex.org/W2993024586,"The question of how Zika virus (ZIKV) changed from a seemingly mild virus to a human pathogen capable of microcephaly and sexual transmission remains unanswered. The unexpected emergence of ZIKV's pathogenicity and capacity for sexual transmission may be due to genetic changes, and future changes in phenotype may continue to occur as the virus expands its geographic range. Alternatively, the sheer size of the 2015-16 epidemic may have brought attention to a pre-existing virulent ZIKV phenotype in a highly susceptible population. Thus, it is important to identify patterns of genetic change that may yield a better understanding of ZIKV emergence and evolution. However, because ZIKV has an RNA genome and a polymerase incapable of proofreading, it undergoes rapid mutation which makes it difficult to identify combinations of mutations associated with viral emergence. As next generation sequencing technology has allowed whole genome consensus and variant sequence data to be generated for numerous virus samples, the task of analyzing these genomes for patterns of mutation has become more complex. However, understanding which combinations of mutations spread widely and become established in new geographic regions versus those that disappear relatively quickly is essential for defining the trajectory of an ongoing epidemic. In this study, multiscale analysis of the wealth of genomic data generated over the course of the epidemic combined with in vivo laboratory data allowed trends in mutations and outbreak trajectory to be assessed. Mutations were detected throughout the genome via deep sequencing, and many variants appeared in multiple samples and in some cases become consensus. Similarly, amino acids that were previously consensus in pre-outbreak samples were detected as low frequency variants in epidemic strains. Protein structural models indicate that most of the mutations associated with the epidemic transmission occur on the exposed surface of viral proteins. At the macroscale level, consensus data was organized into large and interactive databases to allow the spread of individual mutations and combinations of mutations to be visualized and assessed for temporal and geographical patterns. Thus, the use of multiscale modeling for identifying mutations or combinations of mutations that impact epidemic transmission and phenotypic impact can aid the formation of hypotheses which can then be tested using reverse genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2993887937,"Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a neuroactive metabolite of tryptophan. KYNA naturally occurs in breast milk and its content increases with lactation, indicating the role of neonatal nutrition in general growth with long-term health effects. KYNA is also an antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors expressed in bone cells. The aim of this study was to establish the effects of chronic KYNA supplementation on bone homeostasis in young rats, using mandible as a model bone. Female and male newborn Wistar rats were divided into control and KYNA-administered groups until 60 days of age (25x101 mg/L or 25x102 mg/L in drinking water). Hemimandibles were subjected to densitometry, computed tomography analysis and mechanical testing. Rats supplemented with KYNA at both doses showed a decrease in body weight. There were no effects of KYNA administration and mandible histomorphometry. In males, a significant quadratic effect (P < 0.001) was observed in the densitometry of the hemimandible, where BMD increased in the group supplemented with 2.5x101 mg/L of KYNA. Analysis of mechanical tests data showed that when fracture forces were corrected for bone geometry and rats body weight the improvement of bone material properties was observed in male and female rats supplemented with lower dose of KYNA. This study showed that chronic supplementation with KYNA may limit weight gain in the young, without adversely affecting the development of the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2800088363,"Learned Categorical Perception (CP) occurs when the members of different categories come to look more dissimilar (between-category separation) and/or members of the same category come to look more similar (within-category compression) after a new category has been learned. To measure learned CP and its physiological correlates we compared dissimilarity judgments and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) before and after learning to sort multi-featured visual textures into two categories by trial and error with corrective feedback. With the same number of trials and feedback, about half the participants succeeded in learning the categories (learners: criterion 80% accuracy) and the rest did not (non-learners). At both lower and higher levels of difficulty, successful learners showed significant between-category separation in pairwise dissimilarity judgments after learning compared to before; their late parietal ERP positivity (LPC, usually interpreted as decisional) also increased and their occipital negativity (N1) (usually interpreted as perceptual) decreased. LPC increased with response accuracy and N1 amplitude decreased with between-category separation for the Learners. Non-learners showed no significant changes in dissimilarity judgments, LPC or N1, within or between categories. This is behavioral and physiological evidence that category learning can alter perception. We sketch a neural net model for this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2993828093,"Patients lacking the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter MCT8 present abnormal serum levels of TH: low thyroxine and high triiodothyronine. They also have severe neurodevelopmental defects resulting from cerebral hypothyroidism, most likely due to impaired TH transport across the brain barriers. The use of TH analogs, such as triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC), that can potentially access the brain in the absence of MCT8 and restore at least a subset of cerebral TH actions could improve the neurological defects in these patients. We hypothesized that direct administration of TRIAC into the brain by intracerebroventricular delivery to mice lacking MCT8 could bypass the restriction at the brain barriers and mediate TH action without causing hypermetabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular administration of therapeutic doses of TRIAC does not increase further plasma triiodothyronine or further decrease plasma thyroxine levels and does not alter TH content in the cerebral cortex. Although TRIAC content increased in the brain, it did not induce TH-mediated actions on selected target genes. Our data suggest that intracerebroventricular delivery of TRIAC has the ability to target the brain in the absence of MCT8 and should be further investigated to address its potential therapeutic use in MCT8 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2993061963,"According to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) the deposition of prefibrillar and fibrillar Aβ peptide sets off the pathogenic cascades of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that lead to synaptic and neuronal loss resulting in cognitive decline. Various approaches to reduce amyloid load by reducing production of the Aβ peptide or enhancing amyloid clearance by primary or secondary immunization have not proven successful in clinical trials. Interfering with the normal function of secretases and suboptimal timing of Aβ peptide removal have been put forward as possible explanations. Complement, an innate component of the immune system, has been found to modulate disease pathology and in particular neuronal loss in the AD mouse model but its mechanism of action is complex. C1Q has been shown to facilitate phagocytosis of Aβ peptide but its Ablation attenuates neuroinflammation. Experiments in AD mouse models show that inhibition of complement component C5a reduces amyloid deposition and alleviates neuroinflammation. Phagocytes including microglia, monocytes and neutrophils carry C5a receptors. Here, a widely used mouse model of AD, 5XFAD, was intermittently treated with the oral C5a receptor agonist EP67 and several neuronal and neuroinflammatory markers as well as memory function were assessed. EP67 treatment enhanced phagocytosis, resulting in a significant reduction of both fibrillar and non-fibrillar Aβ, reduced astrocytosis and preserved synaptic and neuronal markers as well as memory function. Timely and phasic recruitment of the innate immune system offers a new therapeutic avenue of treating pre-symptomatic Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2991803055,"Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting in systemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide resulting in multi-organ dysfunction e.g. cerebral, cardiac, renal and audiologic complications. The audiologic involvement in FD has often been neglected; while not a lethal aspect of the disease, hearing loss can have a significantly negative impact on quality of life.To investigate baseline hearing status of the Danish Fabry cohort prior to treatment, compared to sex- and age-expected hearing levels and correlating hearing to renal and cerebral findings.Retrospective study of baseline hearing status of the Danish Fabry cohort (n = 83, 9-72 years). Air conduction and speech discrimination scores were assessed at 6 frequencies between 0.25-8 kHz bilaterally. Data were collected between 2001-2014 and compiled in STATA using multilinear mixed modelling for statistical evaluation.Hearing thresholds at all frequencies deviated from the expected thresholds of an otologically normal cohort (p<0.001) and ranged 0.5 to 1.5 standard deviations below expected values. In total 29 males and 54 females were included. Hearing loss was more pronounced in the higher frequencies. There was a trend of association between hearing loss and measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) (p = 0.084). No association was present between hearing loss and albuminuria (p = 0.90), Fabry related cerebral abnormalities (p = 0.84) and cardiac left ventricular mass index, (LVMi) (p = 0.67) independent of sex. Hearing thresholds were poorer for men compared to women (p = 0.001). Sex differences were present at 0.25, 4 and 8 kHz.Our findings demonstrated significant hearing loss in Danish FD patients before treatment initiation, being more profound than in otologically healthy individuals at all frequencies. Additionally, we observed no association between hearing loss and LVMi, albuminuria or FD cerebral abnormalities, with a trend of association to mGFR.Patients with Fabrys disease have hearing loss of all frequencies and most prominently at high frequencies (4-8 kHz), with no association between the hearing loss and cerebral abnormalities, and cardiac mass but with a trend of association to measured glomerular filtration rate."
https://openalex.org/W2992130238,"Introduction Decisions to quit smoking are thought to be influenced by social factors such as friends, family and social groups, but there have been few attempts to examine comprehensively the influence of a range of social factors on smoking cessation. In the largest study to date, we examined whether smoking cessation was associated with marital status and the smoking habits of a partner, socio-economic status and social participation. Methods In the prospective Million Women Study, 53,650 current smokers in 2001 (mean age 58.3, SD 4.4) reported their smoking status 4 years later; and reported on social factors on both occasions. Logistic regression yielded odds ratios (ORs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for stopping smoking in the next 4 years by marital status, whether their partner smoked, deprivation, education, and participation in social activities. Results 31% (16,692) of the current smokers at baseline had stopped after 4 years. Smokers who were partnered at baseline were more likely to quit than those who were not partnered (OR 1.13, 99% CI 1.06–1.19). Compared to having a partner who smoked throughout, those who had a non-smoking partner throughout were more likely to quit (OR 2.01, 99% CI 1.86–2.17), and those who had a partner who smoked at baseline but stopped smoking in the next 4 years were even more likely to quit (OR 6.00, 5.41–6.67). There was no association with cessation for education or deprivation. The association with social participation varied by type of activity but was null overall. Conclusion Women who were partnered were most likely to stop smoking if their partner also stopped smoking. There was little evidence of a strong influence of either socio-economic status or social participation on smoking cessation. These results emphasise the importance of a spouse’s smoking habits on the likelihood of a smoker successfully quitting smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2992760020,"Low pathogenic A(H9N2) subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were originally detected in Cambodian poultry in 2013, and now circulate endemically. We sequenced and characterised 64 A(H9N2) AIVs detected in Cambodian poultry (chickens and ducks) from January 2015 to May 2016. All A(H9) viruses collected in 2015 and 2016 belonged to a new BJ/94-like h9-4.2.5 sub-lineage that emerged in the region during or after 2013, and was distinct to previously detected Cambodian viruses. Overall, there was a reduction of genetic diversity of H9N2 since 2013, however two genotypes were detected in circulation, P and V, with extensive reassortment between the viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between A(H9N2) AIVs detected in Cambodian and Vietnamese poultry, highlighting cross-border trade/movement of live, domestic poultry between the countries. Wild birds may also play a role in A(H9N2) transmission in the region. Some genes of the Cambodian isolates frequently clustered with zoonotic A(H7N9), A(H9N2) and A(H10N8) viruses, suggesting a common ecology. Molecular analysis showed 100% of viruses contained the hemagglutinin (HA) Q226L substitution, which favours mammalian receptor type binding. All viruses were susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals; however, 41% contained the matrix (M2) S31N substitution associated with resistance to adamantanes. Overall, Cambodian A(H9N2) viruses possessed factors known to increase zoonotic potential, and therefore their evolution should be continually monitored."

The secondary aim of the study was to compare our findings with singleton reference charts. Methods A retrospective evaluation was made of all consecutive uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies referred to our Unit from 2010 to 2018. Fortnightly serial examinations were performed of UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI, according with the clinical protocol, from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation. We included cases with at least four ultrasound examinations, delivery at our hospital and complete neonatal follow up. A two-step method was used to trace the estimated centile curves: estimation of the median was performed with appropriate fractional polynomials by a multilevel model and estimation of the external centiles through the residuals (quantile regression). The comparison with singletons was made by plotting the references derived from the present study on the referred charts commonly used for singletons. Results The study group comprised 150 uncomplicated MC twin pairs. Estimated centiles (3rd, 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th, 97th) of UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI in function of the gestational age are presented. The comparison with singletons showed substantial differences, with higher UA-PI and lower MCA-PI and PSV median values in MC twins. Median DV PI values were similar to the values for singletons, while the upper centiles were higher in MC twins. Conclusions This study sets out MC twin-specific longitudinal references for UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI derived from the largest series of uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies presently available. The comparison with singleton reference values underscores the deviation from physiology that is intrinsic to these unique pregnancies and supports the need for MC twin-specific charts."

There are few published epidemiological data regarding dyslipidemia in Africa. We determined full lipid and apolipoprotein profiles and investigated factors associated with lipid levels in urban and rural populations of north-western Tanzania and southern Uganda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly-selected, community-dwelling adults (≥18yrs) including five strata per country: one municipality, two district towns and two rural areas. Participants were interviewed and examined using the World Health Organization STEPwise survey questionnaire. Serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins were measured. Factors associated with mean lipid levels were assessed by multivariable linear regression. Framingham 10-year cardiovascular risk scores were calculated with and without lipids. Results One-third of adults in the study population had dyslipidemia. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol affected 32–45% of rural adults. High total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were found in <15% of adult population in all strata, but were more common in urban adults. Factors independently associated with higher mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were female gender, older age, higher education, higher income, obesity, and hypertension. Framingham cardiovascular risk scores with and without lipids yielded similar results and 90% of study subjects in all strata were classified as “low risk”. Among older adults (>55 years), 30% were classified as “high” or “very high” risk. Conclusions Dyslipidemias are common among adults in north-western Tanzania and southern Uganda affecting one third of adult population. Overall, cardiovascular risk scores are low but high risk scores are common with older adults. Health services designed and equipped to diagnose and treat dyslipidemia are urgently needed."

In two experiments we examined how 'download time'-a potential barrier to information access-influences search behaviour. In both experiments, participants completed a video-watching task in which they were presented with a screen containing six clickable icons, each of which represented a unique video. When participants clicked an icon, a video would begin to load and then play. The participants' task was to gain as much information from the videos as possible for a later memory test. Critically, however, the 'download time' (i.e., the time between the click on the icon and the video beginning to play) of the available videos in a given search session varied. In Experiment 1, these download times were 0 (instant), 2, or 30 seconds, and in Experiment 2, they were 5, 15, or 30 seconds. In general, we found that participants terminated and avoided videos with longer download times than videos with shorter download times. Interestingly, this effect was attenuated when the experienced download times were more similar to each other (Experiment 2) than when they were more different from each other (Experiment 1)."

This research uses Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance and water vapor imagery to investigate spatial patterns of water vapor in California’s Central Valley on a June date in 2013, and 2015, and relates these patterns to surface characteristics and atmospheric properties. We analyze water vapor imagery at two scales: regional and agricultural field, to examine how the slope, intercept, and trajectory of water vapor interact with the landscape in a highly diverse and complex agricultural setting. At the field scale, we found significant quadratic relationships between water vapor slope and wind magnitude in both years (p<0.001). Results showed a positive correlation between crop water use and the frequency with which crops showed directional agreement between wind and water vapor (r = 0.23). At the regional scale, we found patterns of water vapor that indicate advection of moisture across the scene. Water vapor slope was inversely correlated to field size with correlations of -0.37, and -0.28 for 2013 and 2015. No correlation was found between green vegetation fraction and vapor slope (r = 0.001 in 2013, r = 0.02 in 2015), but a weak correlation was found for the intercept (r = 0.11 in 2013, r = 0.26 in 2015). These results lead us to conclude that accumulation of water vapor above fields in these scenes is observable with AVIRIS-derived water vapor imagery whereas advection at the field level was inconsistent. Based on these results, we identify new opportunities to use and apply water vapor imagery to advance our understanding of hydro-climatic patterns and applied agricultural water use."

Seasonal mortality patterns concerning age and causes were examined using the X-12 ARIMA pseudo-additive decomposition method.Of the total deceased, 59.6% were males. The proportion of deceased males was significantly higher than the female (40.4%, p< 0.001). The average age at death was 57.7 years (SD = 28.7). On average, approximately 43 deaths occurred each month. More than 10% of the deaths occurred in children less than 5-years-of-age. Among all the causes of death, the most frequent was cardiovascular disease (n = 666, 25.8%) followed by respiratory disease (n = 482, 18.7%). Significant seasonality in the overall deaths was evident, with a peak in winter. Deaths in people ≥ 55-years-of-age were significantly seasonal and peaked in winter. Deaths due to cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney related diseases were also significantly seasonal with winter peaks. Further, deaths due to external causes were significantly seasonal with summer peak.In the winter season, all-cause, except external, and age-specific mortality peaks in Chitral District, Pakistan.

https://openalex.org/W2993087884,"Myosin-IC (Myo1c) has been proposed to function in delivery of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)–containing vesicles to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation. Current evidence suggests that, upon insulin stimulation, Myo1c is phosphorylated at Ser701, leading to binding of the signaling protein 14-3-3β. Biochemical and functional details of the Myo1c–14-3-3β interaction have yet to be described. Using recombinantly expressed proteins and mass spectrometry–based analyses to monitor Myo1c phosphorylation, along with pulldown, fluorescence binding, and additional biochemical assays, we show here that 14-3-3β is a dimer and, consistent with previous work, that it binds to Myo1c in the presence of calcium. This interaction was associated with dissociation of calmodulin (CaM) from the IQ motif in Myo1c. Surprisingly, we found that 14-3-3β binds to Myo1c independent of Ser701 phosphorylation in vitro. Additionally, in contrast to previous reports, we did not observe Myo1c Ser701 phosphorylation by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), although CaMKII phosphorylated four other Myo1c sites. The presence of 14-3-3β had little effect on the actin-activated ATPase or motile activities of Myo1c. Given these results, it is unlikely that 14-3-3β acts as a cargo adaptor for Myo1c-powered transport; rather, we propose that 14-3-3β binds Myo1c in the presence of calcium and stabilizes the calmodulin-dissociated, nonmotile myosin."
https://openalex.org/W2992026677,"The objective of this study was to investigate whether a soluble polymer and aldehyde-scavenger, polyvinylalcohol-carbazate (PVAC), can inhibit hemolysis in the storage of red blood cells (RBC).The effect of PVAC was assessed over a wide range of concentrations, using absorption spectroscopy to evaluate the level of hemolysis. Moreover, osmotic stability and aldehyde-scavenging potential of RBC were assessed after storage in PVAC.After test tube storage for two weeks, red blood cell hemolysis was lower with PVAC compared to controls (mean difference 23%, 95% CI 16-29%, p < 0.001). A higher level of hemolysis led to a pronounced effect with PVAC. RBC stored in PVAC improved both the binding of free aldehydes (p <0.001) and the osmotic stability (p = 0.0036).Erythrocytes stored with PVAC showed less hemolysis, which might be explained by the ability of PVACs to stabilize the cell membrane and decrease oxidative injury."

The ERAPs remove N-terminal residues from antigenic precursor peptides and generate optimal-length peptides (i.e. 8–10-mers) to fit into the MHC class I groove. It is therefore intriguing that MHC class I molecules can present N-terminally extended peptides on the cell surface that can elicit CD8+ T-cell responses. This observation likely reflects gaps in our understanding of how antigens are processed by the ERAP enzymes. Full-Text PDF Open Access The adaptive immune system of higher vertebrates is distinguished by its ability to respond specifically and rapidly to an almost limitless number of antigens. A key requirement for generating such immune responses is the intracellular proteolysis of antigens and the subsequent display of peptides at the cell surface by membrane glycoproteins encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). 2The abbreviations used are: MHCmajor histocompatibility complexpMHCpeptide/MHC complex moleculeERendoplasmic reticulumTAPtransporter associated with antigen processingERAP (or ERAAP)ER aminopeptidase or ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processingHLAhuman leukocyte antigenNKnatural killerPLCpeptide-loading complexPDBProtein Data Bank. Such peptide/MHC (pMHC) complexes function as ligands that initiate the activation, expansion, and differentiation of T cells into various effector and memory subpopulations.

The MHC-I antigen-processing pathway, which operates in all nucleated cells of the body, recruits peptides from an endogenous pool of cytoplasmic proteins and aberrant translation products that are targeted for degradation by the proteasome as part of normal protein turnover in the cell. Peptides generated by the proteasome are transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)1/TAP2. In the ER, the peptides are further trimmed to the preferred 8–10-amino acid length by ER aminopeptidase (ERAP)1 and ERAP2 in humans and ERAAP in mice. Such trimmed peptides are then loaded onto MHC-I molecules, and chaperones of the peptide-loading complex (PLC) catalyze an exchange process that favors high-affinity peptides for subsequent stable display at the cell surface. (Precursor peptides may be trimmed prior to or following initial binding by MHC-I.) In the absence of ERAAP, the MHC-I immunopeptidome (i.e. the spectrum of bound peptides) is altered. This leads to modest (∼20%) impairment of cell surface expression of pMHC-I, decreased pMHC-I thermal stability, differences in the functional repertoire of pMHC-I complexes, and qualitative and quantitative differences in T cell selection and recognition (1Hammer G.E.

Recent observations based on sensitive MS analysis of the immunopeptidome indicate that peptides longer than the canonical 8–10 amino acids at either the N or C termini may be recovered from MHC-I. These results have suggested that prior models for trimming of peptides destined for MHC-I loading are incomplete. Some of these longer peptides bind with canonically fixed N and C termini with a central bulge. Several pMHC-I structures reveal examples in which the C terminus extends beyond the classical binding groove. These results lead to conflicting hypotheses regarding whether longer peptides may extend beyond the groove at the N terminus as stable pMHC-I complexes and whether trimming by ERAP1 acts only on MHC-I–free or also on MHC-I–bound peptides as substrates.

Chem. 2019; 294 (31601650): 18534-1854410.1074/jbc.RA119.010102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) report a study of a set of five different N-terminally extended 10–20-mer peptides covalently bound via a disulfide trap (at peptide residue 7) to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*08:01, bearing a thoughtfully engineered cysteine at position 76 of the α1-helix. This set of molecules was studied by X-ray crystallography, thermostability, and for susceptibility to trimming by purified ERAP1. In addition, free peptides were subjected to ERAP1 enzymatic digestion, and the products were assessed by MS. The structures of the five N-terminally extended peptide complexes (ranging from a 2-amino acid extended 10-mer to a 12-amino acid extended 20-mer) show little variation in the conformation of the core 8 residues bound in the peptide-binding groove as compared with that of a canonical octamer/HLA-B*08:01 complex. However, to accommodate the N-terminal extension, the side chain of Arg-62, which normally acts as a lid on the A pocket of octamer-loaded MHC-I, is shown to swing out to open up the pocket and thus avoid clashes with the N-terminal extension (see Fig. 1). Little difference was noted between the thermal stabilities of complexes with the canonical or extended peptides or whether they were disulfide-linked to the peptide-binding groove. In digestion assays using free peptides, the 14-mer peptide was “overtrimmed” to fragments as short as 4-mers, whereas the 20-mer peptide was digested to an 11-mer. In contrast, when offered as a covalently linked MHC-I–bound form, the 14-mer peptide was protected from ERAP1 and was not trimmed further even after prolonged incubation. The 20-mer in the MHC-I–bound state was primarily digested to a 14-mer form, although longer fragments were also detected. These results support a model in which peptides of 16–20 amino acids, which is the optimal length range for TAP transport into the ER, may be bound via their C-terminal residues by MHC-I molecules and can be concomitantly trimmed by ERAP to the requisite length for high-affinity binding to the MHC-I peptide-binding groove. However, data on ERAP susceptibility of free peptides in this paper as well as those from other laboratories (5Saric T. Chang S.C. Hattori A. York I.A. Markant S. Rock K.L. Tsujimoto M. Goldberg A.L. An IFN-γ-induced aminopeptidase in the ER, ERAP1, trims precursors to MHC class I-presented peptides.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3 (12436109): 1169-117610.1038/ni859Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) indicate that non-MHC-I–bound peptides may also be trimmed by ERAP, generating peptides suitable for MHC-I binding and presentation. Additional questions remain to be addressed in future studies. In view of the recent determination by cryo-EM of the three-dimensional spatial organization of the full PLC (6Blees A. Januliene D. Hofmann T. Koller N. Schmidt C. Trowitzsch S. Moeller A. Tampé R. Structure of the human MHC-I peptide-loading complex.Nature. 2017; 551 (29107940): 525-52810.1038/nature24627Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), is there sufficient access for ERAP1 or even ERAP1/2 heterodimers to effectively approach an MHC-I–bound peptide with a dangling N-terminal extension? Is the concentration and/or availability of free 16–20-amino acid-long peptides sufficient to permit ERAP digestion? Might the dynamic flexibility of components of the PLC permit limited access to ERAP for peptides of some length and composition preferable to others (7Sieker F. Straatsma T.P. Springer S. Zacharias M. Differential tapasin dependence of MHC class I molecules correlates with conformational changes upon peptide dissociation: a molecular dynamics simulation study.Mol.

By solving the structures and analyzing the stability and ERAP susceptibility of HLA-B*08:01 with extended, covalently bound peptides, Li et al. (4Li L. Batliwala M. Bouvier M. ERAP1 enzyme-mediated trimming and structural analyses of MHC I–bound precursor peptides yield novel insights into antigen processing and presentation.J. Biol.

A deeper appreciation of the mechanisms of N-terminal trimming and the contributions of particular ERAP polymorphisms to enzymatic activity and specificity may explain the associations with the autoimmune diseases mentioned above. As with all science, the new results assist in the formulation of more precise questions and offer a conceptual template for designing more definitive experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2994115081,"The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been characterized as a key immunomodulator and mediator of various diseases. Small molecule inhibitors based on the conserved enzymatic pocket of MIF have been valuable in elucidating MIF mechanisms and developing translational strategies. In contrast, our mechanistic understanding of the MIF homolog MIF-2/d-dopachrome tautomerase (d-DT) and its clinical translation has been hampered, partly because MIF-2-selective inhibitors have been elusive. Here, Tilstam et al. characterize a small-molecule inhibitor selective for MIF-2 that interferes with receptor binding and cell signaling. That could be a promising therapeutic lead and a valuable research tool."
https://openalex.org/W2994571317,"Human macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) is an evolutionarily-conserved protein that has both extracellular immune-modulating and intracellular cell-regulatory functions. MIF plays a role in various diseases, including inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, autoimmunity, and cancer. It serves as an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine, but also exhibits enzymatic activity. Secreted MIF binds to cell-surface immune receptors such as CD74 and CXCR4. Plants possess MIF orthologs but lack the associated receptors, suggesting functional diversification across kingdoms. Here, we characterized three MIF orthologs (termed MIF/ d -dopachrome tautomerase–like proteins or MDLs) of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Recombinant Arabidopsis MDLs ( At MDLs) share similar secondary structure characteristics with human MIF, yet only have minimal residual tautomerase activity using either p -hydroxyphenylpyruvate or dopachrome methyl ester as substrate. Site-specific mutagenesis suggests that this is due to a distinct amino acid difference at the catalytic cavity-defining residue Asn-98. Surprisingly, At MDLs bind to the human MIF receptors CD74 and CXCR4. Moreover, they activate CXCR4-dependent signaling in a receptor-specific yeast reporter system and in CXCR4-expressing human HEK293 transfectants. Notably, plant MDLs exert dose-dependent chemotactic activity toward human monocytes and T cells. A small molecule MIF inhibitor and an allosteric CXCR4 inhibitor counteract this function, revealing its specificity. Our results indicate cross-kingdom conservation of the receptor signaling and leukocyte recruitment capacities of human MIF by its plant orthologs. This may point toward a previously unrecognized interplay between plant proteins and the human innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2992884984,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling can contribute to the pathogenesis of arthritis. Disruption of TLR signaling at early stages of arthritis might thereby provide an opportunity to halt the disease progression and ameliorate outcomes. We previously found that Gö6976 inhibits TLR-mediated cytokine production in human and mouse macrophages by inhibiting TLR-dependent activation of protein kinase D1 (PKD1), and that PKD1 is essential for proinflammatory responses mediated by MyD88-dependent TLRs. In this study, we investigated whether PKD1 contributes to TLR-mediated proinflammatory responses in human synovial cells, and whether Gö6976 treatment can suppress the development and progression of type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in mouse. We found that TLR/IL-1R ligands induced activation of PKD1 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS). TLR/IL-1R-induced expression of cytokines/chemokines was substantially inhibited in Gö6976-treated HFLS and PKD1-knockdown HFLS. In addition, serum levels of anti-CII IgG antibodies, and the incidence and severity of arthritis after CII immunization were significantly reduced in mice treated daily with Gö6976. Synergistic effects of T-cell receptor and TLR, as well as TLR alone, on spleen cell proliferation and cytokine production were significantly inhibited in the presence of Gö6976. Our results suggest a possibility that ameliorating effects of Gö6976 on CIA may be due to its ability to inhibit TLR/IL-1R-activated PKD1, which might play an important role in proinflammatory responses in arthritis, and that PKD1 could be a therapeutic target for inflammatory arthritis."
