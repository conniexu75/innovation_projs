https://openalex.org/W2132741159,"A mechanical fractionator was developed to produce electrophorograms by extrusion of polyacrylamide gels through a narrow orifice in a continuous, sequential stream. The system permits separation of uniform fractions free of zone distortion. An electrophorogram of radioactive type-2 adenovirus proteins so fractionated gave a pattern in excellent agreement with the pattern obtained by laborious manual sectioning and in agreement with the pattern obtained on a replicate gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250. The adenovirus particle yielded about ten resolvable protein components in unequal amounts. Like picornaviruses, these icosahedral animal viruses have multiple protein components in the viral coat."

https://openalex.org/W1562982017,"1. By means of a gas-liquid chromatographic technique the effect of exogenous cholesterol on the incorporation of acetate-2-14C into β-hydroxy-β-methylglutarate and mevalonate has been measured both in cell-free systems of liver and in intact liver cells. 2. It has been shown that mevalonate synthesis is markedly suppressed by cholesterol feeding while the synthesis of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutarate is unaffected by this regimen. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the major site of the cholesterol feedback system is located at the reaction responsible for the conversion of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutarate to mevalonate; namely β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl reductase. 3. The intracellular localization of mevalonate synthesis and its feedback control have been likewise examined. Mevalonate was found to be synthesized in both microsomal and soluble fractions of the liver cell; however, the major site of mevalonate synthesis, and hence of feedback control of cholesterol synthesis, is localized to the membranous fraction of the microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1900310992,"The concentrations of 28 metabolites, including glycogen, trehalose, components of the glycolytic pathway and the Krebs cycle, and amino acids in flight muscle of the blowfly, Phormia regina, were measured concurrently after periods of flight ranging from 5 sec to 1 hour. At the onset of contraction, there was a rapid utilization of trehalose followed by catabolism of thoracic glycogen and then of the polysaccharide stored in the abdomen. Coincident with the decrease in the concentration of trehalose within the muscle was a rapid and transient increase in that of glucose. The concentrations of the hexose monophosphates were constant or declined. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate rose with the initiation of flight and then fell. The concentrations of triose phosphates, including α-glycerophosphate, increased slightly, but transiently, or were steady during continuous flight. The concentration of pyruvate increased strikingly at the start of exercise. Initially, pyruvate was largely converted to alanine. There were no accumulations of lactate or citrate. The amino group made available for the enormous increase in the concentration of alanine within the muscle after commencement of flight seems to have been derived largely from proline. The concentration of glutamate was lowered slightly during flight; no significant changes in the concentrations of ammonia, aspartate, glutamine, and asparagine within the muscle were found after initiation of flight. The concentration of malate increased sharply at the onset of active contraction, declined slightly for 2 min, and then remained high throughout the entire flight. The concentrations of α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate were apparently not altered. Measurements of coincident changes in metabolites concomitant with the 100-fold increase in glycolytic flux attained on initiation of flight provided an unique system to determine the steps that control glycolysis in vivo, in the transition from a tissue at rest to one performing strenuous work. Three sites of regulation—the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate, the cleavage of trehalose, and the phosphorolysis of glycogen—were established in this system in vivo. Possible additional controls at the oxidations of α-glycerophosphate and of proline are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1491441284,"The mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by adenosine triphosphate: creatine phosphotransferase has been studied by measuring the initial velocities of the exchange with isotopically labeled substrates. The rates of the creatine-phosphocreatine, ATP-ADP, and ADP-ATP exchanges at equilibrium are approximately equal and dependent on the concentrations of Mg2+ and ADP3-. The ADP-ATP exchange rate increases hyperbolically to a maximum value as the concentration of the creatine-phosphocreatine pair is raised while the creatine-phosphocreatine exchange rate increases initially and then decreases with increasing concentrations of the MgATP-MgADP pair. The decrease in the exchange rate was shown to be due to the inhibitory effect of NaCl which is introduced when the reactants are formed from MgCl2 and the sodium salts of the nucleotides. The formation of a dead end enzyme-MgADP-creatine complex has been confirmed, but the experimental data were not in accord with the formation of a dead end enzyme-MgATP-phosphocreatine complex. These data confirm the results from initial velocity and product inhibition studies which indicate that the mechanism of the reaction is rapid equilibrium, random."
https://openalex.org/W2051286811,"Yeast DNA, in a cesium chloride density gradient, shows a minor or satellite band with a density lower than that of the main nuclear component. The DNA isolated from purified mitochondria of yeasts corresponds in density to this satellite band. In solution, this DNA more easily undergoes renaturation as compared to DNA from cell nuclei. The ease of this renaturation is presumably due to a homogeneity greater than that of nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA isolated from several mammalian species has the same or higher density than nuclear DNA, but differs in its ready renaturability."

https://openalex.org/W1523035161,"The peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocytochrome c catalyzed by yeast cytochrome c peroxidase was studied kinetically in the following combinations of substrates: H2O2-horse heart cytochrome c, C2H5OOH-horse heart cytochome c, H2O2-bakers' yeast cytochrome c, and C2H5OOH-bakers' yeast cytochrome c. Initial steady state rates of the overall reaction were analyzed according to the method of Dalziel in order to determine whether or not a ternary complex was involved in the reaction and in order to determine several rate constants of each step of the reaction. The cytochrome c peroxidase reaction appeared to follow the general form of a compulsory order mechanism for two substrate enzyme (Equations 1, 2, and 3). Kinetic evidence for the formation of a ternary complex of the enzyme, peroxide, and ferrocytochrome c was presented. A maximal turnover rate of the enzyme was determined to be extremely rapid; 2,600 sec-1 and 14,000 sec-1 at 23° for the substrate couples H2O2-horse heart ferrocytochrome c and H2O2-bakers' yeast ferrocytochrome c, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1527830041,"Previous studies have indicated that, in rat liver, gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and lactate involves carboxylation of pyruvate in mitochondria but the oxalacetate formed does not diffuse to the cytosol. Instead it is reduced to malate or transaminated to aspartate. The present study indicates that aspartate and malate may be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by enzymes in rat liver cytosol almost as rapidly as is oxalacetate. The rates of conversion are sufficient to account for the formation of carbohydrate in livers of normal rats and are greatly elevated in preparations from livers of diabetic rats. The synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate from pyruvate via the malic enzyme or pyruvate carboxylase in the cytosol was found to be insignificant. Quantitative measurements of enzymes in the cytosol indicate that fumarase is elevated in diabetes and fasting but is not altered by adrenalectomy or administration of hydrocortisone. Malate dehydrogenase is elevated in diabetes and after hydrocortisone. Both glutamate-oxalacetate and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase are elevated in diabetes, in fasting, and after hydrocortisone. In agreement with other workers, citrate cleavage enzyme was depressed in diabetes and fasting, and elevated after insulin administration and refeeding of fasted animals. The enzyme adaptations and the rates of metabolite conversion in rat liver cytosol are thus in keeping with the proposed pathway of carbon in gluconeogenesis."

Amplitudes of waves in the first 250 milliseconds of the response changed markedly with age. In responses recorded from the occiput, there was a rapid increase in amplitude reaching a maximum in the 5- to 6-year-old group, with means of amplitudes at this age being about twice as large as means of some older age groups. With children 7 years and older there was a rapid decline in amplitude until ages 13 to 14, when an abrupt increase in amplitude appeared. Amplitude appeared to stabilize at about age 16. In older subjects, mean age 60 and beyond, significant changes were noted in the earlier components of the response."
https://openalex.org/W1641053924,"Abstract Some of the kinetic properties of carnitine acetyltransferase in brain homogenates have been reported with the use of a new, sensitive radiometric method for the determination of acetylcarnitine. Those properties and the distribution pattern of carnitine acetyltransferase in various rat tissues, subcellular fractions, and discrete areas of the brain have been compared with those obtained for choline acetyltransferase and found to be markedly different. In subcellular fractions of brain, the carnitine enzyme remained associated with the mitochondrial fragments after hypoosmotic shock, whereas the choline enzyme showed enrichment in the nerve ending particle fraction. In developing brain cortex, the choline enzyme reaches adult levels of activity earlier than the carnitine enzyme. Thus, we have concluded that the two enzymes appear to be associated with different morphological structures. Further, the uniform distribution of carnitine acetyltransferase within the nervous system, as well as its association with the mitochondrial fraction, argues against the hypothesis that acetylcarnitine functions in brain as a neurohumoral agent. These data support the concept that carnitine acetyltransferase is involved in the transport of acyl groups across mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1621884619,"Abstract Cell extracts, prepared from Nocardia restrictus, rapidly oxidize 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione with the consumption of 1 mole of oxygen per mole of substrate; no carbon dioxide is evolved. The reaction is stimulated by the presence of ferrous ions. The first product of ring fission has been identified as 4(5),9(10)-diseco-3-hydroxyandrosta-1(10),2-diene-5,9,17-trion-4-oic acid. The enzyme catalyzing the formation of this compound has been tentatively termed 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione 4,5-dioxygenase. The possible role of a quinone intermediate in the formation of the ring fission compound has been eliminated. Further metabolism of the ring fission compound results in the formation of 2-oxo-4-hydroxycaproic acid (isolated as its γ-lactone) and 3aα-H-4α-[3'-propionic acid]-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione. Whole cells in the presence of 0.001 m arsenite cleave 2-oxo-4-hydroxycaproic acid to pyruvate and propionaldehyde.

https://openalex.org/W1581538392,"Abstract The testicular biosynthesis of fatty acids was studied by intratesticular injection of 14C-labeled substrates and radioactivity determinations of the isolated individual fatty acids. After acetate-1-14C administration the highest specific activity was observed in palmitic acid, but stearic, oleic, arachidonic, and Δ4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acids were also labeled. The former three were apparently formed predominantly by synthesis de novo. After 14C-linoleate injection the specific activities of polyenes peaked chronologically in the order eicosatrienoic, eicosatetraenoic, docosatetraenoic, and docosapentaenoic, suggesting that order for appearance of intermediates. Chemical degradation of docosapentaenoate synthesized after arachidonate-1-14C injection revealed essentially all the radioactivity in C-3, indicating direct elongation of arachidonate to docosapentaenoate by the testis."
https://openalex.org/W1601782018,"A model for the estimation of pathway contributions has been extended to include the effect of the transaldolase reactions on the randomization of 14C of specifically labeled glucoses. With glucose-2-14C as substrate, the contribution of the pentose cycle to glucose metabolism and the extent of isomerization of fructose 6-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate in a tissue represented by the model can be estimated solely from the distribution of 14C in the 6 carbon atoms of glucose 6-phosphate or a derivative. Data for adipose, adrenal, and thyroid tissue support the adequacy of this approach. In these tissues, the transaldolase exchange reaction, as well as the reaction of the pentose cycle catalyzed by transaldolase, appears to introduce 14C from glucose-2-14C into carbon atoms 4, 5, and 6 of hexose-6-P. The maximum rate of the transaldolase exchange reaction can be estimated. The transaldolase reactions do not affect estimates of pentose cycle contributions with glucose-1-14C and -6-14C when triose-P derivatives are employed, but do alter the relative specific activities in carbon atoms 1 to 6 of hexose-6-P derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1484931887,"Abstract Teichoic acids have been prepared from Staphylococcus aureus strains H, Duncan, and 3528, in addition to strain Copenhagen studied previously. The teichoic acids of strains H and Duncan contain virtually all β-acetylglucosaminyl residues while that from strain 3528 contains virtually all α-acetylglucosaminyl residues and strain Copenhagen contains both. This structural feature of the teichoic acids is mirrored in the specificity of two uridine diphosphate acetylglucosamine polyribitol phosphate acetylglucosamine transferases found in these strains, although enzymes from all four strains have some capacity to catalyze the synthesis of both types of linkages. By hapten inhibition studies, it has been shown that these α- and β-acetylglucosaminyl residues are the determinants of an immunological specificity responsible for cell wall agglutination."

https://openalex.org/W1575876609,"Acetyl phosphate or p-nitrophenyl acetate acetylates a specific cysteine residue in 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase to give an active acetyl-enzyme compound. By raising the pH above 7.0, the acetyl group migrates to the e-amino group of a lysine residue to form an enzymatically inactive compound. This S-N acetyl transfer is the principal route for N-acetylation of the lysine residue on the dehydrogenase. A number of considerations suggest that the cysteine and lysine residues are in close proximity although they are not near neighbors in a single peptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1512952941,"Abstract The accumulation of β-carboxy-β-hydroxyadipic acid (homocitric acid) in the culture medium of the lysine-requiring yeast mutant, Ly4, grown on limiting amounts of lysine, has been demonstrated. Identity of the biologically formed acid with synthetic homocitric acid was established by comparison of infrared spectra, Rf values from paper chromatograms, optical rotations, and melting points. Radioactively labeled homocitric acid was obtained from the mutant grown on uniformly labeled 14C-glucose, as well as by incubation of a cell-free extract of the organism with 1-14C-acetate and α-ketoglutarate. Radioactive lysine was obtained from the hydrolysate of wild-type yeast grown in the presence of 14C-labeled homocitrate. The excretion of homocitric acid by a lysine-requiring yeast mutant and its conversion into lysine convincingly establish the biosynthesis of lysine in yeast via the previously proposed scheme involving homologues of the citric acid cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1489449864,"Abstract A soluble Δ4-5β-dehydrogenase has been isolated from extracts of Pseudomonas testosteroni grown on a steroid-containing medium. This enzyme introduces the Δ4-double bond into C19 and C21 steroids in which the A:B ring fusion has the cis configuration. The enzyme has been purified about 100-fold from acetone powders of the microorganism by a procedure involving precipitation of nucleic acids with protamine; fractionation with ammonium sulfate; chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose; and calcium phosphate gel adsorption. The purified enzyme oxidized about 6.5 µmoles of 5β-androstane-3,17-dione per min per mg of protein. Phenazine methosulfate is an efficient artificial acceptor in the Δ4-5β-dehydrogenase reaction. Various quinones, notably 1,2- and 1,4-naphthoquinone, 1,4-benzoquinone, menadione, and coenzyme Q10, were able to replace phenazine methosulfate in the reaction, but other quinones and acceptors of other chemical types were inactive. A simple aerobic assay for steroid Δ-dehydrogenase activity is described. It depends upon measurement of the nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c (at 550 mµ) by the reduced phenazine methosulfate formed in the enzymatic oxidation. An interesting blank reaction occurs between phenazine methosulfate and cytochrome c in the absence of enzyme or steroid. The rate of this reaction is markedly accelerated by light and at high pH. The reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of phenazine methosulfate, but independent of that of cytochrome c. These findings suggest that a product of the light-catalyzed dismutative decomposition of the dye is the reductant of cytochrome c. Treatment with acid ammonium sulfate inactivated the enzyme almost completely, and a substantial portion of the original activity could be restored by addition of a low concentration (Km = 0.33 µm) of flavin mononucleotide but not by flavin adenine dinucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1589300270,"Abstract A procedure is described for the isolation of Neurospora adenylosuccinase. Under the conditions employed in the isolation of this protein, it exists in at least three forms that can be easily separated by ultracentrifugation or by moving boundary electrophoresis. The 10S form and the 4.0S form are readily interconvertible by changes in the hydrogen ion concentration. Only one form of the enzyme appears to catalyze the adenylosuccinate → AMP + fumarate reaction, and the same form catalyzes the S-AICAR → AICAR + fumarate reaction. (Here, the symbol S denotes a succinyl group and AICAR denotes 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide.) The active form of the enzyme has a molecular weight of about 200,000, optimal activity at pH 8.3, and a 0° stability optimum at pH 8.0. The Km for adenylosuccinate is 1.2 x 10-6 m. The inactive forms of the enzyme have molecular weights of about 27,000 and 55,000 and appear to be subunits of the 200,000 molecular weight form on the basis of identical peptide maps, amino acid composition, and the fact that the relative amounts of the three peaks in the ultracentrifuge can be modified by changing the pH. The results of the amino acid composition studies and the peptide maps of trypsin digests of adenylosuccinase indicate that the smallest molecular form of the enzyme is 25,000 to 30,000 molecular weight. This molecular weight value was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium analyses, which gave a value of 27,600. On the basis of these data, the active form of adenylosuccinase consists of 6 to 8 identical subunits."

The reaction is thus strictly analogous to the reactions of cytidine nucleotides in phospholipid synthesis. In the presence of uridine diphosphate acetylglucosamine, the transferase also present in these particles catalyzes a glycosylation of the growing ribitol phosphate polymer which is highly efficient when compared to the transfer which occurs when polyribitol phosphate is added exogenously as acceptor.

https://openalex.org/W1601290858,"Abstract 1. Beef kidney 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase was purified in the inactive form, free of bound ferrous ion. Its properties are very similar to those of the liver enzyme. 2. The enzyme in the early stages of purification could be activated by acidification to about pH 4 in the presence of ferrous salts. For the most purified preparations, a sulfhydryl compound, as well as acid and iron, was required for activation. In contrast to the reports on the liver enzyme, cysteine was more effective than reduced glutathione. 3. The oxygenase was immediately activated in the presence of 6.8 m urea, Fe++, and cysteine. High concentrations of urea appeared to replace the acid in the activation process. However, the activation in 6.8 m urea was followed quickly by irreversible inactivation. Lower concentrations of urea required a few hours for activation and the resulting enzyme was stable to these concentrations of urea. 4. Metal-binding agents, including 1,10-phenanthroline, inhibited the enzyme and, at low pH or over an extended period, removed the bound iron to inactivate the oxygenase. The substrate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, prevented the removal of iron from the active enzyme by 1,10-phenanthroline and also blocked the complete reconstitution of the active enzyme from iron-free enzyme. 5. The Michaelis constants for oxygen and 3-hydroxy-anthranilate were 3.1 x 10-4 m and 4 x 10-5 m, respectively. Kinetic treatment, varying 3-hydroxyanthranilate and oxygen concentrations, suggested that the two substrates are bound independently. 6. Picolinic and quinolinic acids, but not the other pyridine compounds tested, inhibited the reaction competitively with respect to 3-hydroxyanthranilate, but uncompetitively with respect to oxygen, suggesting that the two substrates are bound independently of one another."

Cholest-4-en-3-one 5α-reductase required reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as electron donor and differed from the known Δ4-3-ketosteroid 5α-reductases by being inactive in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. 3.

The arginase has a pH optimum of 9.5 to 10.0 and is activated and protected from inactivation by manganous ions, and the Km (l-arginine) for the purified preparation is 2.17 mm."

The ostiniophilic lamellar bodies are apparently reduced in size and decreased in number. The fatty change of the granular pneumocyte may represent a metabolic alteration and interfere with the production of surfactant. This hypoxic lesion of the pneumocyte may be a significant factor in high-altitude pulmonary insufficiency.

https://openalex.org/W1558512693,Abstract A crystalline preparation of an esteroproteolytic zymogen was obtained from porcine pancreas. The physical and catalytic properties of the zymogen indicate that it is the precursor of an esteroproteolytic enzyme previously isolated and characterized in this laboratory. Activation of the zymogen by trypsin appears to involve only slight proteolysis to produce an enzyme having the same specific activity as the esteroproteolytic enzyme. The isolation procedure for the esteroproteolytic zymogen included an elution of proteins from a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column by means of a decreasing pH gradient. Under these conditions an anionic precursor of a new proteolytic enzyme with potential tryptic activity was revealed. The chromatographic behavior of the precursor closely parallels that of the esteroproteolytic zymogen. The precursor is both a potential activator and a tenacious contaminant of the esteroproteolytic zymogen. The isolation procedure for the esteroproteolytic zymogen was designed to effect maximum separation and inhibition of the precursor and its active enzyme.
