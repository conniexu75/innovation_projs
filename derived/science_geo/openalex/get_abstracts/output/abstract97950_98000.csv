https://openalex.org/W2042306717,"We confirm that the latency of the P300 component of the human event-related potential is determined by processes involved in stimulus evaluation and categorization and is relatively independent of response selection and execution. Stimulus discriminability and stimulus-response compatibility were manipulated independently in an ""additive-factors"" design. Choice reaction time and P300 latency were obtained simultaneously for each trial. Although reaction time was affected by both discriminability and stimulus-response compatibility, P300 latency was affected only by stimulus discriminability."
https://openalex.org/W2036183167,"Flow cytometry of heated sperm nuclei revealed a significant decrease in resistance to in situ denaturation of spermatozoal DNA in samples from bulls, mice, and humans of low or questionable fertility when compared with others of high fertility. Since thermal denaturation of DNA in situ depends on chromatin structure, it is assumed that changes in sperm chromatin conformation may be related to the diminished fertility. Flow cytometry of heated sperm nuclei may provide a new and independent determinant of male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2063766415,"Microorganisms in soils and waters convert many synthetic organic chemicals to inorganic products. Other compounds are transformed only by cometabolism. These microbial processes may lead to environmental detoxication, the formation of new toxicants, or the biosynthesis of persistent products. Type reactions are proposed for major categories of enzymatic transformation of synthetic chemicals in soils, natural waters, and sewage. Some organic molecules are resistant to microbial attack, and explanations for the persistence of such compounds are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2030223140,"Four different crystals of d(CpGpCpGpCpG) have been solved by x-ray diffraction analysis and all form similar left-handed double helical Z-DNA molecules in the crystal lattice. Two different conformations are observed for the phosphates in the GpC sequences, as the phosphates are found either facing the helical groove or rotated away from it. The latter conformation is often found when hydrated magnesium ions are complexed to a phosphate oxygen atom. These different conformations may be used when right-handed B-DNA joins left-handed Z-DNA. Atomic coordinates and torsion angles are presented for both types of Z-DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2036686141,"Synaptic excitation of hippocampal cells during blockade of synaptic inhibition results in an epileptiform ""burst"" potential followed by a prolonged afterhyperpolarization. This afterhyperpolarization resembles the one that is seen after the epileptic interictal spike and that is considered of critical importance in preventing seizure development. The afterhyperpolarization produced in the presence of γ-aminobutyric acid antagonists is associated with a conductance increase and is inhibitory. It can occur in an all-or-none fashion after a burst, is independent of chloride, and is depressed by barium. The afterhyperpolarization has a reversal potential of -86 millivolts, and the reversal potential is strongly dependent on the extracellular concentration of potassium. The afterhyperpolarization appears to be an intrinsic, inhibitory potassium potential mediated by calcium. This finding has implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms of epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W1574747042,"1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a phospholipid with platelet activating and hypotensive properties, has an extremely labile acetate grouping. The acetate group is obviously important in the expression of the biological properties of this unique derivative of plasmanic acid since once it is hydrolyzed from the parent compound to form the lyso product, all biological activity is lost. Our studies show that the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the acetate moiety, 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine: acetylhydrolase, occurs in the cytosolic fraction of a variety of tissues and has a pH optimum of 7.5 to 8.5. Effects of calcium, magnesium, EDTA, dithiothreitol, deoxycholate, and diisopropylfluorophosphate on the enzyme activity and the fact that egg phosphatidylcholine was not inhibitory indicate that acetylhydrolase activity has different properties from those normally associated with the phospholipase A2 that utilizes phospholipids with two long chain acyl groups. The highest specific activity of the acetylhydrolase occurred in kidney; lung and brain were also good sources of the enzyme. The soluble fraction from the kidney cortex had an apparent Km and Vmax of 3.1 microM and 17.8 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Our results indicate that acetylhydrolase plays a significant role in the catabolism of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine."
https://openalex.org/W2063087523,"Inhibition of the binding of [3H]imipramine and inhibition of the uptake of [3H]serotonin and [3H]norepinephrine by a series of antidepressants and other drugs were studied in the rat hypothalamus. No correlation was found between the potencies of these drugs for the inhibition of [3H]imipramine binding and the inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake. There was, however, a highly significant correlation between the potencies of these drugs for the inhibition of [3H]imipramine binding and the inhibition of [3H]serotonin uptake. These results suggest that high-affinity [3H]imipramine binding might be associated with the mechanism of serotonin uptake in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2044081426,"Spermatozoa that are quiescent in electrolyte and nonelectrolyte solutions isotonic to seminal plasma show motility when the semen is diluted with hypotonic solution in freshwater teleosts (four species tested) and with hypertonic solution in marine teleosts (five species tested). Decrease or increase, respectively, in osmolality of the environment may be the factor initiating sperm motility in these species. The motility of chum salmon spermatozoa in a sodium chloride solution isotonic to seminal plasma is completely suppressed by approximately 10 millimoles of potassium per kilogram; topminnow spermatozoa, however, were immotile in a nonelectrolyte solution, and motility was induced by electrolytes, especially potassium. Thus ions, rather than osmolality, may be an essential determinant of sperm motility in salmonid and viviparous teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W1973050784,"According to one hypothesis, the paroxysmal depolarizing shift observed in the penicillin model of epilepsy results from a giant excitatory postsynaptic potential. This hypothesis has recently been questioned, primarily because it has never been subjected to rigorous experimental examination. Four quantitative predictions were derived from this hypothesis and tested in CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. The four critical predictions concern the behavior of the paroxysmal depolarizing shift under current- and voltage-clamp conditions as a function of membrane potential. The experiments confirmed all four predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2030117043,"By constructing deletion mutations in cloned adenovirus types 2 and 5 VAI genes and measuring the ability of altered templates to direct transcription of VAI RNA in HeLa cell extracts, we have located two transcriptional control regions. The first is an intragenic region located between positions +9 and +72 relative to the 5′ end of the VAI(A) RNA. Those deletions examined within these sequences abolished the transcription of mutant templates in HeLa cell extracts. The second control region includes 5′ flanking sequences which abut the VAI coding region. Mutations here can reduce the efficiency with which the VAI gene is transcribed. Nucleotide sequence similarities were noted on comparison of the VAI intragenic control region to tRNA sequences, which lead us to speculate that the transcriptional regulation of these two types of genes may be quite similar; the adenovirus VA genes may even have evolved from a tRNA gene(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1980360743,"A detailed transcription map of HeLa cell mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been constructed by using the S1 protection technique to localize precisely the sequences coding for the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and poly(A)-containing species on the physical map of the DNA. This transcription map has been correlated with the positions of the tRNA genes derived from the mtDNA sequence. It has been shown that, with the exception of the D loop and another small segment near the origin of replication, the mtDNA sequences are completely saturated by the rRNAs, poly(A)-containing RNAs and tRNA coded for by the two strands. No evidence for intervening sequences has been found. The sequences coding for the individual poly(A)-containing RNA and rRNA species appear to be immediately contiguous on one side, and most frequently on both sides, to tRNA coding sequences. Furthermore, the H strand sequences coding for the two rRNAs, the poly(A)-containing RNAs and the tRNAs appear to be adjacent to each other, extending from coordinate 2/100 to coordinate 95/100 of the genome relative to the origin taken as 0/100. The results are consistent with a model of transcription of the H strand in the form of a single molecule which is processed into mature RNA species by precise endonucleolytic cleavages, occurring in almost all cases immediately before and after a tRNA sequence. The tRNA sequences may play an important role as recognition signals in the processing of the primary transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2075816835,"We have examined in detail the RNA coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in methotrexate-resistant mouse cells. We find four distinct DHFR messengers, ranging in size from 750 to 1600 nucleotides. All four are polyadenylated and polysomal and can be translated in vitro to produce a 21,000 dalton protein co-migrating with purified dihydrofolate reductase on SDS polyacrylamide gels. The major difference in these RNAs is the length of 3′ untranslated regions, varying from about 80 nucleotides in the smallest mRNA to about 930 nucleotides in the largest. The RNAs are also present in methotrexate-sensitive murine cells and mouse liver. Multiple DHFR RNAs are found in the poly(A)+ RNA of methotrexate-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells but are of different molecular weights than the mouse messengers. We discuss these results in terms of the function of 3′ untranslated regions of eucaryotic mRNAs and the possible origin and significance of multiple messenger RNAs for a single protein."
https://openalex.org/W1964290387,"Expression of the late genes of adenovirus is only detectable after virus DNA synthesis has occurred. Using a superinfection protocol, we show that replication of the template per se is required for expression of late regions L2--L5 (mapping to the right of position 39) and that the accumulation of early gene products does not suffice. This regulation is probably exerted at the level of transcription rather than by control of processing or selective stabilization of late mRNA or its precursors. The promoter-proximal late gene block L1, however, appears to be subject to processing control. At early times a single member of this gene family (tripartite leader plus coordinates 29--39, encoding the 52,55K polypeptide pair) is expressed, whereas at late times an additional, differently spliced mRNA species is generated from this region (tripartite leader plus coordinates 34--39, encoding polypeptide IIIa)."
https://openalex.org/W1995798120,"We have examined the kinetics of binding and uptake of iodinated glycoproteins and glycopeptides bearing terminal Gal or GalNAc moieties in an isolated rat hepatocyte system. Asparagine-linked, triantennary complex oligosaccharides with three terminal Gal residues are endocytosed with the same kinetics as asialo-orosomucoid, whereas biantennary, complex oligosaccharides with one or two terminal Gal residues are not endocytosed Glycopeptides bearing as few as four O-glycosidically-linked Gal beta 1, 3GalNAc or GalNAc moieties are also rapidly endocytosed, while glycopeptides with one or two more closely spaced moieties are not endocytosed. All the endocytosable glycoproteins and glycopeptides have similar apparent dissociation constants and a similar number of binding sites on the surface of the intact hepatocyte. The ligand-binding properties of the receptor in the plasma membrane of intact cells differ from those of the solubilized receptor, suggesting that interaction with other as yet undefined cellular components confers the ability to discriminate among closely related oligosaccharide structures. This is consistent with a model in which only glycopeptides bearing terminal Gal or GalNAc residues that fall within a restricted spatial relationship can induce a conformational alteration in the receptor which is required for uptake to occur. The endocytosis of a number of glycoproteins such as human asialo-ceruloplasmin can be accounted for by the presence of a single, complex oligosaccharide with the appropriate structure."
https://openalex.org/W2014962164,"Iontophoretic injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow CH into single neurons of guinea pig neocortical slices resulted in the staining of more than one cell. Dye-coupled neuronal aggregates were found only in the superficial cortical layers and were often organized in vertical columns. Antidromic stimuli evoked all-or-none, subthreshold depolarizations in some superficial cells. These potentials were not eliminated by manganese and did not collide with spikes originating in the soma, suggesting that they arose from electrotonic interaction between superficial cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2005172972,"Two assays have been devised to demonstrate ATP-dependent migration of 40S ribosomal subunits on messenger RNA. The first is a two-step runoff assay. Reovirus mRNA was initially loaded with 40S subunits by incubation with wheat germ ribosomes in the presence of the antibiotic edeine. During the second phase of the incubation, in which further attachment of ribosomes was inhibited, the preformed complexes were shown to dissociate (presumably by runoff) only if ATP was included in the reaction. A more direct demonstration of ATP-dependent migration of 40S subunits was carried out using 3′ end-labeled brome mosaic virus mRNA. In the presence of edeine and ATP, 40S ribosomal subunits were shown to advance all the way to the 3′ end of the message, as shown by protection of the labeled 3′-proximal segment against nuclease digestion. Depletion of ATP by the addition of hexokinase prevented this migration. A variety of observations has raised the possibility that attachment of eucaryotic ribosomes to messenger RNA proceeds via a “scanning mechanism.” The hypothesis is that a 40S subunit binds initially at or near the 5′ terminus of the message and subsequently migrates toward the interior, stopping when it encounters the first AUG triplet. If migration of 40S subunits requires ATP, as the present studies suggest, the scanning mechanism predicts that in a system depleted of ATP a single 40S ribosome should be trapped near the 5′ terminus of the message—upstream of the AUG initiator codon. This prediction was confirmed by analyzing binding of wheat germ ribosomes to a synthetic ribopolymer in which the 5′-proximal region (lacking AUG codons) and the AUG-containing segment near the 3′ end of the molecule were differentially labeled."

https://openalex.org/W2076572621,"We have found that approximately one third of the total cell-associated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is located on the plasma membrane of cultured chick embryo muscle, the remaining two thirds being found within the cells. This cell surface AChE appears to be an integral membrane protein. The surface enzyme is synthesized by the muscle cells in culture and is transported over a 2-3 hr period to the plasma membrane, where it accumulates at the rate of 2-3% of total surface AChE per hour. Once on the plasma membrane the AChE molecules are degraded by a process that exhibits first-order decay kinetics with a half-life of about 50 hr. Under the same experimental conditions, the acetylcholine receptor, a well described muscle cell integral membrane protein, has a half-life of approximately 19 hr. These studies provide the first direct evidence that the numbers of different muscle plasma membrane glycoprotein molecules are determined not only by differential rates of biosynthesis but also by differential rates of degradation. The intracellular AChE constitutes a rapidly turning-over pool of molecules. The rate of synthesis of AChE in culture is approximately 20% of the total cell-associated enzyme per hour, most of which is destined for secretion into the medium. Only a small portion of the newly synthesized AChE is retained on the plasma membrane. The time from synthesis to release of the enzyme is 2-3 hr. Using 3H-DFP to label the newly synthesized AChE, we can also show a quantitative transfer of AChE molecules from the intracellular to the extracellular compartments without any detectable residence time on the plasma membrane. By studying the synthesis transport and externalization of AChE we have defined the intracellular transport pathway and metabolic requirements for secretion in cultured muscle cells. These studies form the basis for a comparison of the metabolism of membrane-bound and secreted glycoproteins from this cell type."

https://openalex.org/W1991283020,"The short chain aliphatic acid salts, butyrate and propionate, are effective inhibitors of histone deacetylation in chick oviduct at 2–5 mM; they also prevent the hormonal induction of the ovalbumin and transferrin genes. The less potent deacetylase inhibitor isobutyrate is correspondingly less effective in blocking egg white mRNA induction; acetate has little effect at concentrations up to 15 mM. Butyrate does not appear to alter estrogen receptor binding in the nucleus, total RNA synthesis, or protein synthesis during the early hours of treatment when its specific effects on deacetylation and egg white gene transcription are observed. In addition to preventing the induction, butyrate also causes a rapid deinduction when added to preinduced cultures; ovalbumin and transferrin gene transcription decline with a half-life of 15–30 min. The effects of butyrate on egg white mRNA induction and deacetylation are completely reversible, and mRNA induction resumes within 1 hr after removal of butyrate from the medium. These results suggest that the modification of either histones or other unidentified regulatory proteins by acetylation may play a role in the mechanism of estrogen-mediated gene induction."
https://openalex.org/W2083145012,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and acetylcholine receptors (AChR) are muscle-specific glycoproteins present in cultured chick embryo muscle cells. The first is found as both a secreted and a membrane-bound enzyme whereas the ACh receptor is strictly an integral membrane protein. We have studied the transport and externalization of these two proteins in the same cells using several compounds known to affect secretory processes: colchicine, tunicamycin and the ionophores X-537A, Nigericin and Monensin. Under all experimental conditions, any change in the rate of AChE secretion was accompanied by an identical change in the rate of ACh receptor incorporation into the plasma membrane. These studies were designed to test directly the hypothesis that secreted and integral membrane proteins are transported together to the plasma membrane. Our results are consistent with a single transport pathway in muscle cells for the externalization of membrane and secreted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089032128,Acute electrophysiological effects of ethanol were studied in two lines of mice that differ markedly in their response to the soporific effects of systemic alcohol administration. Cerebellar Purkinje neurons from the genetic line that had long sleep times were one to two orders of magnitude more sensitive to the depressant effects of locally administered ethanol than those from the line that had short sleep times. The data suggest that there are genetically determined specificities in the acute effects of ethanol on central neurons and that such specificities might be used to determine which regions of the cerebellum participate in differences in behavioral responses to this substance.
https://openalex.org/W2021426643,"DNA sequence analysis of a cloned partially deleted human α-thalassemia globin gene revealed a novel 3′ untranslated region displaying at least nineteen differences when compared with previously published α mRNA sequences. Restriction enzyme mapping established the origin of the α-thalassemia gene as the more 3′ of the normal, duplicated α genes (α1). DNA sequencing of a previously isolated α1 gene revealed a 3′ untranslated region identical to that of the α-thalassemia gene. The sequence of the corresponding region of the more 5′ α gene (α2) was consistent with published mRNA sequences except in three probably polymorphic positions. Therefore the 3′ untranslated regions of the highly homologous α-globin genes differ significantly. The recognition that the duplicate α genes differ in a region expressed in mature mRNA should now permit direct assessment of relative gene output in various normal and pathologic states. The divergence of the α gene 3′ untranslated regions in the face of minimal coding sequence differences must be reconciled with current models for matching homologous gene sequences by recombination events."
https://openalex.org/W1508983572,"Rat liver dihydrothymine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of thymidine and uridine degradation, was purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, and Ultrogel ACA-34 elution profile. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 220,000 +/- 5,000 as determined by Ultrogel ACA-34 and sedimentation equilibrium The s20,w value of the enzyme was 9.2 S. The isoelectric point was at pH 5.25. The enzyme is composed of two identical subunits of an approximate molecular weight of 110,000 +/- 3,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme contains 4 mol of FAD and 3 mol of iron per mol of enzyme. Flavin released from the enzyme by boiling was identified as FAD by absorption spectra and thin layer chromatography, indicating that the enzyme is a flavometal protein. During dialysis, the enzyme was stabilized by 2-mercaptoethanol, but neither NADPH nor thymine was effective. The relative rates of reduction of pyrimidine analogues substituted at position 5 were 5-fluorouracil > 5-bromouracil > 5-diazouracil > 5-iodouracil > 5-nitrouracil, with 5-fluorouracil and 5-diazouracil 70% faster than thymine. Uracil was reduced 25% faster than thymine. The pH optimum for the forward and reverse reactions was 7.4. In the presence of NADPH, the apparent Km was 2.6 microM for thymine and 1.8 microM for uracil. Apparent Km for NADPH was 15 microM with thymine as substrate and 11 microM with uracil. In the reverse reaction, apparent Km values were 43 microM for dihydrothymine and 193 microM for dihydrouracil; apparent Km for NADP+ was 3.8 microM with dihydrothymine as substrate and 2.9 microM with dihydrouracil."

The tests, performed on rats, included production of changes in locomotor activity (involving both presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors), inhibition of dopa accumulation (quantifying presynaptic receptor activity), and the rotation model (quantifying postsynaptic receptor activation). Apomorphine was efficacious at both presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, whereas TL-99 was much more efficacious at the presynaptic receptor. This result indicates not only that differences exist between presynaptic and postsynaptic dopamine receptors, but also that these differences may be exploited in the design of selective dopamine agonists."

These phagocytic cells with receptors were identified as retinal pigment cells by characteristic ultrastructural features.

https://openalex.org/W1497346725,"A novel monosialoganglioside was isolated from Tay-Sachs brains. It represented about 0.1% of the total ganglioside mixture. Compositional analysis by gas-liquid chromatography indicated that it contained glucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and long chain base in the molar ratio of 1:2:2:1:1. The ganglioside was found to be resistant to neuraminidase (Clostridium perfringens), beta-hexosaminidase (jack bean), and beta-galactosidase. However, it could be degraded by a human liver beta-hexosaminidase preparation in the presence of an activator to produce a glycolipid chromatographically identical with authentic IV3NeuAc-GgOse4-ceramide. This glycolipid product was resistant to beta-galactosidase (jack bean), but could be readily degraded to GgOse4-ceramide by neuraminidase. Mild formic acid hydrolysis degraded the intact ganglioside to an asialo derivative chromatographically identical with the pentahexosyl ceramide (GalNAc-Gal-GalNAc-Gal-Glc-ceramide) derived from GD1a-GalNAc. The asialo derivative could then be degraded to GgOse4-ceramide and GgOse3-ceramide by sequential treatment with jack bean beta-hexosaminidase and beta-galactosidase. These data suggest that the novel ganglioside is a monosialosylpentahexosyl ceramide with the sialosyl group attached to the penultimate galactose moiety of the pentahexosyl ceramide backbone, and it has the following structure: GalNAc(beta 1-4)Gal(beta 1-3)GalNAc(beta 1-4)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc-ceramide (formula see text)."

Its physiological role as the major carbohydrate source for suckling mammals is thus complemented by its ability to facilitate the absorption of necessary minerals. The studies reported here show that the intestinal absorption of lead and its uptake into blood, liver, kidney, and bone are also increased by lactose in young weanling rats. These data extend the known range of lactose facilitation of mineral absorption to a nonessential, toxic element, confirming the nonspecificity of its action on the gut. In addition, they suggest an explanation for some of the conflicting evidence regarding the prophylactic efficacy of milk in lead poisoning."

These analyses showed that IP mRNA from both uterus and brain is faithfully translated in the cell-free system. Comparison of translation products derived from uterine mRNA of untreated and 1-h estrogen-treated rats revealed a specific increase in the ability of mRNA from treated animals to direct the synthesis of IP.

https://openalex.org/W1509135024,"We have investigated the effect of erythrocyte membrane preparations on the rate of polymerization and the solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S. The kinetics of polymerization was monitored by measuring changes in turbidity of hemoglobin S solutions as a function of time in a temperature-controlled cuvette. The solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S, an equilibrium measurement, was determined by measuring the hemoglobin concentration of the supernatant following centrifugation of the polymerized hemoglobin S solution. The solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S was unaffected by the presence of red cell membrane ghosts, inside-out red cell vesicles, or inside-out vesicles enriched in erythrocyte spectrin and actin (Bands 1, 2, and 5) in the hemoglobin solution. Furthermore, inside-out vesicles had no significant effect on kinetics of polymerization. The addition of erythrocyte membrane ghosts to the hemoglobin solution, in ratios approximating that of the intact red cell, increased the rate of polymerization up to 8-fold. However, when corrections were made for the excluded volume contributed by the membrane ghosts, the enhancement of the rate of polymerization was reduced to less than 3-fold. These results fail to show significant facilitation of intracellular sickling by nucleation sites on the red cell membrane."

Eight dag populations and eight clones are characterized as being different from Faof1 cells by the production of serum albumin, aldolase B and in some cases activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase. No dag cells are recovered after 18 or 24 hours of aggregation, but after 48 or 96 hrs 1--5% of the cells give rise to clones of dag cells. During aggregation cells are committed to become dag cells but their new phenotype is expressed only after 5--12 days. The fraction of dag cells in colonies that grow out from aggregates suggests that dag transformation is not a clonal event. These experiments demonstrate that a transitory change in the culture conditions of Faof1 cells can lead to a heritable modification in phenotypic expression. Since dag cells fail to express the liver-specific gluconeogenic enzymes that permit cells to grow in glucose-free medium, it is possible to select from dag populations revertants in which expression of these activities is restored. The frequency of appearance of such dag revertants is not increased by the action of EMS."

https://openalex.org/W1530436437,"6 S tubulin from which the exchangeably bound guanine nucleotide had been removed was examined for its ability to bind two fluorescent analogs of GTP. One analog, (y-AmNS)GTP, contains the fluorophore l-aminonaphthalene 5-sulfonate attached to the y phosphate of GTP via a phosphoamidate bond. The second analog contains the same fluorophore attached to the sulfur atom of GTP-y-S via a 5-atom linker (GTP-y-SF). Both analogs bind to tubulin lacking nucleotide bound to the exchangeable site, as evidenced by significant increases in the anisotropy of nucleotide fluorescence in solutions containing tubulin. The Kd for the tubulinGTP-y-SF complex is 2.3 X M in buffers without glycerol. In solutions containing 25% glycerol both analogs bind about an order of magnitude more tightly (& for GTP-y-SF = 3.2 X M, Kd for (y-AmNS)GTP = 3.9 X M). Analysis of steady state and dynamic fluorescence anisotropies shows that the fluorophore of (y-AmNS)GTP bound to tubulin exhibits little rotational freedom and that the observed depolarization of fluorescence results largely from rotation of the tubulin-nucleotide complex. In contrast, GTP-y-SF bound to tubulin undergoes rapid rotational movement independent of the rotation of the tubulin-nucleotide complex. A number of GTP analogs were examined for their ability to displace tubulin-bound (y-AmNS)GTP, as measured by fluorescence anisotropy. These experiments show that some alterations of the phosphoryl side chain (GTP-y-S and guanosine-5’-(cu,P-methylene) triphosphate) have little effect on binding affinity, whereas others drastically weaken binding (guanosine5’-(P,y-methylene) triphosphate). The &y-methylene analog binds very weakly but is known to be able to promote assembly at concentrations sufficient to saturate the tubulin-exchangeable nucleotide-binding site. In contrast, the GTP analog containing a blocked phosphoryl terminus binds much more avidly than the plymethylene analog but fails to promote assembly. Thus, binding of a guanine nucleoside triphosphate is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for promotion of tubulin assembly."
