https://openalex.org/W2545650606,The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda is a prime noctuid pest of maize on the American continents where it has remained confined despite occasional interceptions by European quarantine services in recent years. The pest has currently become a new invasive species in West and Central Africa where outbreaks were recorded for the first time in early 2016. The presence of at least two distinct haplotypes within samples collected on maize in Nigeria and São Tomé suggests multiple introductions into the African continent. Implications of this new threat to the maize crop in tropical Africa are briefly discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2541068854,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an expansive, membrane-enclosed organelle that plays crucial roles in numerous cellular functions. We used emerging superresolution imaging technologies to clarify the morphology and dynamics of the peripheral ER, which contacts and modulates most other intracellular organelles. Peripheral components of the ER have classically been described as comprising both tubules and flat sheets. We show that this system consists almost exclusively of tubules at varying densities, including structures that we term ER matrices. Conventional optical imaging technologies had led to misidentification of these structures as sheets because of the dense clustering of tubular junctions and a previously uncharacterized rapid form of ER motion. The existence of ER matrices explains previous confounding evidence that had indicated the occurrence of ER ""sheet"" proliferation after overexpression of tubular junction-forming proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2539530515,"Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2546246724,"Natural flavonoids such as quercetin, (+)catechin and rutin as well as four methoxylated derivatives of quercetin used as models were investigated to elucidate their impact on the oxidant and antioxidant status of human red blood cells (RBCs). The impact of these compounds against metal toxicity was studied as well as their antiradical activities with DPPH assay. Antihemolytic experiments were conducted on quercetin, (+)catechin and rutin with excess of Fe, Cu and Zn (400 μM), and the oxidant (malondialdehyde, carbonyl proteins) and antioxidant (reduced glutathione, catalase activity) markers were evaluated. The results showed that Fe and Zn have the highest prooxidant effect (37 and 33% of hemolysis, respectively). Quercetin, rutin and (+)catechin exhibited strong antioxidant properties toward Fe, but this effect was decreased with respect to Zn ions. However, the Cu showed a weak antioxidant effect at the highest flavonoid concentration (200 μM), while a prooxidant effect was observed at the lowest flavonoid concentration (100 μM). These results are in agreement with the physico-chemical and antiradical data which demonstrated that binding of the metal ions (for FeNTA: (+)Catechin, KLFeNTA = 1.6(1) × 106 M-1 > Rutin, KLFeNTA = 2.0(9) × 105 M-1 > Quercetin, KLFeNTA = 1.0(7) × 105 M-1 > Q35OH, KLFeNTA = 6.3(8.7) × 104 M-1 > Quercetin3'4'OH and Quercetin 3OH, KLFeNTA ~ 2 × 104 M-1) reflects the (anti)oxidant status of the RBCs. This study reveals that flavonoids have both prooxidant and antioxidant activity depending on the nature and concentration of the flavonoids and metal ions."

We present a basin-scale distribution of solid-phase extractable DOS in the East Atlantic Ocean and the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Although molar DOS versus dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ratios of 0.11 ± 0.024 in Atlantic surface water resembled phytoplankton stoichiometry (sulfur/nitrogen ~ 0.08), increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) versus DOS ratios and decreasing methionine-S yield demonstrated selective DOS removal and active involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles. Based on stoichiometric estimates, the minimum global inventory of marine DOS is 6.7 petagrams of sulfur, exceeding all other marine organic sulfur reservoirs by an order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2543294033,"Experience shapes the development and connectivity of adult-born granule cells (GCs) through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We examined the remodeling of dentate gyrus microcircuits in mice in an enriched environment (EE). Short exposure to EE during early development of new GCs accelerated their functional integration. This effect was mimicked by in vivo chemogenetic activation of a limited population of mature GCs. Slice recordings showed that mature GCs recruit parvalbumin γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing interneurons (PV-INs) that feed back onto developing GCs. Accordingly, chemogenetic stimulation of PV-INs or direct depolarization of developing GCs accelerated GC integration, whereas inactivation of PV-INs prevented the effects of EE. Our results reveal a mechanism for dynamic remodeling in which experience activates dentate networks that “prime” young GCs through a disynaptic feedback loop mediated by PV-INs."
https://openalex.org/W2515205986,"The kinetics of the OH + CO reaction, fundamental to both atmospheric and combustion chemistry, are complex due to the formation of the HOCO intermediate. Despite extensive studies on this reaction, HOCO has not been observed at thermal reaction conditions. Exploiting the sensitive, broadband, and high-resolution capabilities of time-resolved cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy, we observe OD + CO reaction kinetics with the detection of stabilized trans-DOCO, the deuterated analogue of trans-HOCO, and its yield. By simultaneously measuring the time-dependent concentrations of both trans-DOCO and OD species, we observe unambiguous low-pressure termolecular dependence on the reaction rate coefficients for both N2 and CO bath gases. These results confirm the HOCO formation mechanism and quantify its yield."
https://openalex.org/W2529201238,"Impairment of amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance leads to Aβ accumulation in the brain during the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strategies that can restore or improve the clearance function hold great promise in delaying or preventing the onset of AD. Here, we show that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), by use of fat-1 transgenic mice and oral administration of fish oil, significantly promote interstitial Aβ clearance from the brain and resist Aβ injury. Such beneficial effects were abolished in Aqp4-knockout mice, suggesting that the AQP4-dependent glymphatic system is actively involved in the promoting the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the clearance of extracellular Aβ. Imaging on clarified brain tissues clearly displayed that n-3 PUFAs markedly inhibit the activation of astrocytes and protect the AQP4 polarization in the affected brain region after Aβ injection. The results of the present study prove a novel mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs exert protective roles in reducing Aβ accumulation via mediating the glymphatic system function.-Ren, H., Luo, C., Feng, Y., Yao, X., Shi, Z., Liang, F., Kang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2544537904,"Multiring basins, large impact craters characterized by multiple concentric topographic rings, dominate the stratigraphy, tectonics, and crustal structure of the Moon. Using a hydrocode, we simulated the formation of the Orientale multiring basin, producing a subsurface structure consistent with high-resolution gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft. The simulated impact produced a transient crater, ~390 kilometers in diameter, that was not maintained because of subsequent gravitational collapse. Our simulations indicate that the flow of warm weak material at depth was crucial to the formation of the basin’s outer rings, which are large normal faults that formed at different times during the collapse stage. The key parameters controlling ring location and spacing are impactor diameter and lunar thermal gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2540860426,"Real-time on-site histopathology review of biopsy tissues at the point-of-procedure has great potential for significant clinical value and improved patient care. For instance, on-site review can aid in rapid screening of diagnostic biopsies to reduce false-negative results, or in quantitative assessment of biospecimen quality to increase the efficacy of downstream laboratory and histopathology analysis. However, the only currently available rapid pathology method, frozen section analysis (FSA), is too time- and labor-intensive for use in screening large quantities of biopsy tissues and is too destructive for maximum tissue conservation in multiple small needle core biopsies. In this work we demonstrate the spectrally-compatible combination of the nuclear stain DRAQ5 and the anionic counterstain eosin as a dual-component fluorescent staining analog to hematoxylin and eosin intended for use on fresh, unsectioned tissues. Combined with optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy and pseudo-coloring algorithms, DRAQ5 and eosin (""D&E"") enables very fast, non-destructive psuedohistological imaging of tissues at the point-of-acquisition with minimal tissue handling and processing. D&E was validated against H&E on a one-to-one basis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and frozen section tissues of various human organs using standard epi-fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating high fidelity of the staining mechanism as an H&E analog. The method was then applied to fresh, whole 18G renal needle core biopsies and large needle core prostate biospecimen biopsies using fluorescence structured illumination optical sectioning microscopy. We demonstrate the ability to obtain high-resolution histology-like images of unsectioned, fresh tissues similar to subsequent H&E staining of the tissue. The application of D&E does not interfere with subsequent standard-of-care H&E staining and imaging, preserving the integrity of the tissue for thorough downstream analysis. These results indicate that this dual-stain pseudocoloring method could provide a real-time histology-like image at the time of acquisition and valuable objective tissue analysis for the clinician at the time of service."
https://openalex.org/W2539685726,"Submicroscopic Plasmodium infections are an important parasite reservoir, but their clinical relevance is poorly defined. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in southern Papua, Indonesia, using cluster random sampling. Data were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for haemoglobin measurement. Plasmodium parasitaemia was determined by blood film microscopy and PCR. Between April and July 2013, 800 households and 2,830 individuals were surveyed. Peripheral parasitaemia was detected in 37.7% (968/2,567) of individuals, 36.8% (357) of whom were identified by blood film examination. Overall the prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia was 15.4% (396/2567) and that of P. vivax 18.3% (471/2567). In parasitaemic individuals, submicroscopic infection was significantly more likely in adults (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.82 [95%CI: 2.49–5.86], p<0.001) compared to children, females (AOR = 1.41 [1.07–1.86], p = 0.013), individuals not sleeping under a bednet (AOR = 1.4 [1.0–1.8], p = 0.035), and being afebrile (AOR = 3.2 [1.49–6.93], p = 0.003). The risk of anaemia (according to WHO guidelines) was 32.8% and significantly increased in those with asymptomatic parasitaemia (AOR 2.9 [95% 2.1–4.0], p = 0.007), and submicroscopic P. falciparum infections (AOR 2.5 [95% 1.7–3.6], p = 0.002). Asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections in this area co-endemic for P. falciparum and P. vivax constitute two thirds of detectable parasitaemia and are associated with a high risk of anaemia. Novel public health strategies are needed to detect and eliminate these parasite reservoirs, for the benefit both of the patient and the community."
https://openalex.org/W2528757174,"Observational estimates of the climate system are essential to monitoring and understanding ongoing climate change and to assessing the quality of climate models used to produce near- and long-term climate information. This study poses the dual and unconventional question: Can climate models be used to assess the quality of observational references? We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four observational products of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel climate forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product. These results call for generalized procedures of model-observation comparison and provide guidance for a more objective observational data set selection."
https://openalex.org/W2541910349,"The Orientale basin is the youngest and best-preserved major impact structure on the Moon. We used the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft to investigate the gravitational field of Orientale at 3- to 5-kilometer (km) horizontal resolution. A volume of at least (3.4 ± 0.2) × 106 km3 of crustal material was removed and redistributed during basin formation. There is no preserved evidence of the transient crater that would reveal the basin’s maximum volume, but its diameter may now be inferred to be between 320 and 460 km. The gravity field resolves distinctive structures of Orientale’s three rings and suggests the presence of faults associated with the outer two that penetrate to the mantle. The crustal structure of Orientale provides constraints on the formation of multiring basins."
https://openalex.org/W2540990606,"Background Systemic hypertension is a risk factor of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a chronic inflammatory disease. Acute hypertension is caused by increased extracellular osmolarity after intake of dietary salt (NaCl). We determined in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells whether high extracellular NaCl alters the gene expression of inflammasome-associated proteins, and whether autocrine/paracrine purinergic (P2) receptor signaling contributes to the NaCl-induced NLRP3 gene expression. Methodology/Principal Findings Hyperosmolarity was induced by the addition of 100 mM NaCl or sucrose to the culture medium. Gene and protein expression levels were determined with real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. IL-1β and IL-18 levels were evaluated with ELISA. Nuclear factor of activated T cell 5 (NFAT5) expression was knocked down with siRNA. High extracellular NaCl induced NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β gene expression, while the gene expression of further inflammasome-associated proteins (NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, ASC, procaspase-1, pro-IL-18) was not altered or below the detection threshold. The NaCl-induced NLRP3 gene expression was partially dependent on the activities of phospholipase C, IP3 receptors, protein kinase C, the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, PI3K, and the transcription factors HIF-1 and NFAT5. Pannexin-dependent ATP release and P2Y1 receptor activation is required for the full induction of NLRP3 gene expression. High NaCl induced a transient increase of the NLRP3 protein level and a moderate NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as indicated by the transient increase of the cytosolic level of mature IL-1β. High NaCl also induced secretion of IL-18. Conclusion High extracellular NaCl induces priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells, in part via P2Y1 receptor signaling. The inflammasome priming effect of NaCl suggests that high intake of dietary salt may promote local retinal inflammation implicated in the development of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2540011782,"Many bacterial pathogens secrete virulence (effector) proteins that interfere with immune signaling in their host. SpvD is a Salmonella enterica effector protein that we previously demonstrated to negatively regulate the NF-κB signaling pathway and promote virulence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in mice. To shed light on the mechanistic basis for these observations, we determined the crystal structure of SpvD and show that it adopts a papain-like fold with a characteristic cysteine-histidine-aspartate catalytic triad comprising Cys-73, His-162, and Asp-182. SpvD possessed an in vitro deconjugative activity on aminoluciferin-linked peptide and protein substrates in vitro A C73A mutation abolished SpvD activity, demonstrating that an intact catalytic triad is required for its function. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SpvD is a cysteine protease. The amino acid sequence of SpvD is highly conserved across different S. enterica serovars, but residue 161, located close to the catalytic triad, is variable, with serovar Typhimurium SpvD having an arginine and serovar Enteritidis a glycine at this position. This variation affected hydrolytic activity of the enzyme on artificial substrates and can be explained by substrate accessibility to the active site. Interestingly, the SpvDG161 variant more potently inhibited NF-κB-mediated immune responses in cells in vitro and increased virulence of serovar Typhimurium in mice. In summary, our results explain the biochemical basis for the effect of virulence protein SpvD and demonstrate that a single amino acid polymorphism can affect the overall virulence of a bacterial pathogen in its host."
https://openalex.org/W2539634711,"Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is a neurohormone that suppresses reproduction by acting at both the brain and pituitary levels. In addition to the brain, GnIH may also be produced in gonads and can regulate steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. However, the function of GnIH in gonadal physiology has received little attention in fish. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of peripheral sbGnih-1 and sbGnih-2 implants on gonadal development and steroidogenesis during the reproductive cycle of male sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Both Gnihs decreased testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) plasma levels in November and December (early- and mid-spermatogenesis) but did not affect plasma levels of the progestin 17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP). In February (spermiation), fish treated with sbGnih-1 and sbGnih-2 exhibited testicles with abundant type A spermatogonia and partial spermatogenesis. In addition, we determined the effects of peripheral Gnih implants on plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) and luteinizing hormone (Lh) levels, as well as on brain and pituitary expression of the main reproductive hormone genes and their receptors during the spermiation period (February). Treatment with sbGnih-2 increased brain gnrh2, gnih, kiss1r and gnihr transcript levels. Whereas, both Gnihs decreased lhbeta expression and plasma Lh levels, and sbGnih-1 reduced plasmatic Fsh. Finally, through behavioral recording we showed that Gnih implanted animals exhibited a significant increase in diurnal activity from late spermatogenic to early spermiogenic stages. Our results indicate that Gnih may regulate the reproductive axis of sea bass acting not only on brain and pituitary hormones but also on gonadal physiology and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2542159297,"The Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase (FASTK) family of proteins has recently emerged as a central regulator of mitochondrial gene expression through the function of an unusual RNA-binding domain named RAP (for RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexans), shared by all six members of the family. Here we describe the role of one of the less characterized members, FASTKD3, in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. First, we show that, in contrast to FASTK, FASTKD2, and FASTKD5, FASTKD3 does not localize in mitochondrial RNA granules, which are sites of processing and maturation of mtRNAs and ribosome biogenesis. Second, we generated FASTKD3 homozygous knock-out cell lines by homologous recombination and observed that the absence of FASTKD3 resulted in increased steady-state levels and half-lives of a subset of mature mitochondrial mRNAs: ND2, ND3, CYTB, COX2, and ATP8/6. No aberrant processing of RNA precursors was observed. Rescue experiments demonstrated that RAP domain is required for FASTKD3 function in mRNA stability. Besides, we describe that FASTKD3 is required for efficient COX1 mRNA translation without altering mRNA levels, which results in a decrease in the steady-state levels of COX1 protein. This finding is associated with reduced mitochondrial complex IV assembly and activity. Our observations suggest that the function of this family of proteins goes beyond RNA processing and ribosome assembly and includes RNA stability and translation regulation within mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2545039089,"Female pubertal development is tightly controlled by complex mechanisms, including neuroendocrine and epigenetic regulatory pathways. Specific gene expression patterns can be influenced by DNA methylation changes in the hypothalamus, which can in turn regulate timing of puberty onset. In order to understand the relationship between DNA methylation changes and gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus of pubertal goats, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-sequencing analyses were carried out. There was a decline in DNA methylation levels in the hypothalamus during puberty and 268 differentially methylated regions (DMR) in the genome, with differential patterns in different gene regions. There were 1049 genes identified with distinct expression patterns. High levels of DNA methylation were detected in promoters, introns and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). Levels of methylation decreased gradually from promoters to 5′-UTRs and increased from 5′-UTRs to introns. Methylation density analysis demonstrated that methylation level variation was consistent with the density in the promoter, exon, intron, 5′-UTRs and 3′-UTRs. Analyses of CpG island (CGI) sites showed that the enriched gene contents were gene bodies, intergenic regions and introns, and these CGI sites were hypermethylated. Our study demonstrated that DNA methylation changes may influence gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus of goats during the onset of puberty, which may provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in pubertal onset."
https://openalex.org/W2545512171,"Triticum aestivum L. cv ‘Chogokuwase’ is an extra-early flowering common wheat cultivar that is insensitive to photoperiod conferred by the photoperiod insensitive alleles at the Photoperiod-B1 (Ppd-B1) and Ppd-D1loci, and does not require vernalization for flowering. This reduced vernalization requirement is likely due to the spring habitat allele Vrn-D1 at the VERNALIZATION-D1 locus. Genotypes of the Ppd-1 loci that determine photoperiod sensitivity do not fully explain the insensitivity to photoperiod seen in ‘Chogokuwase’. We detected altered expression patterns of clock and clock-output genes including Ppd-1 in ‘Chogokuwase’ that were similar to those in an einkorn wheat mutant that lacks the clock-gene homologue, wheat PHYTOCLOCK 1 (WPCL1). Presumptive loss-of-function mutations in all WPCL1 homoeologous genes were found in ‘Chogokuwase’ and ‘Geurumil’, one of the parental cultivars. Segregation analysis of the two intervarietal F2 populations revealed that all the examined F2 plants that headed as early as ‘Chogokuwase’ had the loss-of-function wpcl1 alleles at all three homoeoloci. Some F2 plants carrying the wpcl1 alleles at three homoeoloci headed later than ‘Chogokuwase’, suggesting the presence of other loci influencing heading date. Flowering repressor Vrn-2 was up-regulated in ‘Chogokuwase’ and ‘Geurumil’ that had the triple recessive wpcl1 alleles. An elevated transcript abundance of Vrn-2 could explain the observation that ‘Geurumil’ and some F2 plants carrying the three recessive wpcl1 homeoealleles headed later than ‘Chogokuwase’. In spite of the up-regulation of Vrn-2, ‘Chogokuwase’ may have headed earlier due to unidentified earliness genes. Our observations indicated that loss-of-function mutations in the clock gene wpcl1 are necessary but are not sufficient to explain the extra-early heading of ‘Chogokuwase’."
https://openalex.org/W2543619090,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its chemokine ligand CXCL12 mediate directed cell migration during organogenesis, immune responses, and metastatic disease. However, the mechanisms governing CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the β-arrestin1·signal-transducing adaptor molecule 1 (STAM1) complex, initially identified to govern lysosomal trafficking of CXCR4, also mediates CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis. Expression of minigene fragments from β-arrestin1 or STAM1, known to disrupt the β-arrestin1·STAM1 complex, and RNAi against β-arrestin1 or STAM1, attenuates CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. The β-arrestin1·STAM1 complex is necessary for promoting autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK is necessary for CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and associates with and localizes with β-arrestin1 and STAM1 in a CXCL12-dependent manner. Our data reveal previously unknown roles in CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis for β-arrestin1 and STAM1, which we propose act in concert to regulate FAK signaling. The β-arrestin1·STAM1 complex is a promising target for blocking CXCR4-promoted FAK autophosphorylation and chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2540787413,"PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC) has a dual function in growth-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis and as a sensor of metabolic stress. PRC induction by mitochondrial inhibitors, intracellular ROS, or topoisomerase I inhibition orchestrates an inflammatory program associated with the adaptation to cellular stress. Activation of this program is accompanied by the coordinate expression of c-MYC, which is linked kinetically to that of PRC in response to multiple stress inducers. Here, we show that the c-MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 blocks the induction of c-MYC, PRC, and representative PRC-dependent stress genes by the respiratory chain uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP). This result, confirmed by the suppression of PRC induction by c-MYC siRNA silencing, demonstrates a requirement for c-MYC in orchestrating the stress program. PRC steady-state expression was markedly increased upon mutation of two GSK-3 serine phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl-terminal domain. The negative control of PRC expression by GSK-3 was consistent with the phosphor-inactivation of GSK-3β by CCCP and by the induction of PRC by the GSK-3 inhibitor AZD2858. Unlike PRC, which was induced post-translationally through increased protein half-life, c-MYC was induced predominantly at the mRNA level. Moreover, suppression of Akt activation by the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 blocked the CCCP induction of PRC, c-MYC, and representative PRC stress genes, demonstrating a requirement for Akt signaling. MK-2206 also inhibited the phosphor-inactivation of GSK-3β by CCCP, a result consistent with the ability of Akt to phosphorylate, and thereby suppress GSK-3 activity. Thus, PRC and c-MYC can act in concert through Akt-GSK-3 signaling to reprogram gene expression in response to mitochondrial stress."
https://openalex.org/W2546107328,"For nearly three decades, the central goal in international climate policy had been to set the political agenda—to engage all countries on the need for action. So long as that was the goal, it was sufficient for policy-makers to focus on simple indicators of climate change, such as global average surface temperature With the 2015 Paris Agreement, governments launched a process that can move beyond setting agendas to coordinating national policies to manage the climate. Next month in Marrakesh, diplomats will convene to flesh out the Agreement. They need to focus on the infrastructure of data and analysis that will be needed as the Agreement becomes operational. The scientific community can help by identifying better lagging indicators to describe what has changed as policy efforts progress, and leading indicators to focus policy on the right risks as the planet warms."
https://openalex.org/W2545113820,"Temperature sensation by the nervous system is essential for life and proliferation of animals. The molecular-physiological mechanisms underlying temperature signaling have not been fully elucidated. We show here that diverse regulatory machinery underlies temperature sensation through trimeric G-protein signaling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Molecular-genetic studies demonstrated that cold tolerance is regulated by additive functions of three Gα proteins in a temperature-sensing neuron, ASJ, which is also known to be a light-sensing neuron. Optical recording of calcium concentration in ASJ upon temperature-changes demonstrated that three Gα proteins act in different aspects of temperature signaling. Calcium concentration changes in ASJ upon temperature change were unexpectedly decreased in a mutant defective in phosphodiesterase, which is well known as a negative regulator of calcium increase. Together, these data demonstrate commonalities and differences in the molecular components concerned with light and temperature signaling in a single sensory neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2544822529,"Interleukin 16 (IL-16) has been described as a significant cytokine involved in the recruitment of CD4+ cells during inflammation; however, its potential role in psoriasis has not been defined. Our aim was to investigate the IL-16 serum levels and IL-16 mRNA skin expression in psoriasis patients in correlation with disease severity and mRNA skin expression for CD4. Moreover, the IL-16 skin localization was assessed and the -295 T/C IL-16 polymorphism was analyzed. For this exploratory, observational, and cross-sectional study, 97 unrelated patients with chronic plaque type psoriasis and 104 healthy controls were enrolled. IL-16 serum levels were significantly increased in patients compared with controls (P = 0.000022) and positively correlated with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (r = 0.34, P = 0.0007), Body Surface Area (r = 0.34, P = 0.01) and were significantly higher in individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis (P = 0.0029). There was no significant correlation between IL-16 serum levels and Dermatology Quality of Life Index and no differences in genotype and allele frequencies for -295 T/C IL-16 polymorphism. The expression of IL-16 (mRNA and protein) was elevated in the margin of psoriatic skin while statistically significant increase in IL-16 immunoreactivity, but not in mRNA level, was observed within plaques. Furthermore, the IL-16 mRNA levels within psoriatic lesions positively correlated with the levels of CD4 mRNA, but not with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. In conclusion, our data revealed an association between circulating IL-16 and severity of psoriasis which indicates that this cytokine could serve as a potential marker of disease activity. However, further investigations are required."
https://openalex.org/W2546215519,"The survival of insect larvae often depends on the mother’s choice of oviposition substrate, and thus, this choice is an essential part of an insect species’ ecology. Especially species with narrow substrate preferences may suffer from changes in substrate availability triggered by, for example, climate change. Recent climate warming is affecting species directly (e.g., physiology) but also indirectly (e.g., biological interactions) leading to mismatching phenologies and distributions. However, the preferred oviposition substrate is still unknown for many drosophilid species, especially for those at higher elevations. In this study, we investigated the oviposition-substrate preference of the montane-alpine fly Drosophila nigrosparsa in rearing and multiple-choice experiments using natural substrates in the laboratory. Insect emergence from field-collected substrates was tested. More than 650 insects were reared from natural substrates, among them 152 drosophilids but no individual of D. nigrosparsa. In the multiple-choice experiments, D. nigrosparsa preferred ovipositing on mushrooms (> 93% of eggs); additionally, a few eggs were laid on berries but none on other substrates such as cow faeces, rotten plant material, and soil. The flies laid 24 times more eggs per day when mushrooms were included in the substrates than when they were excluded. We infer that D. nigrosparsa is a mushroom breeder with some variation in oviposition choice. The flies favoured some mushrooms over others, but they were not specialised on a single fungal taxon. Although it is unclear if and how climate change will affect D. nigrosparsa, our results indicate that this species will not be threatened by oviposition-substrate limitations in the near future because of the broad altitudinal distribution of the mushrooms considered here, even if the flies will have to shift upwards to withstand increasing temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2544837819,"Postural control deficits have been suggested to be a major component of gait disorders in children with cerebral palsy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between postural stability and treadmill walking, in children with unilateral cerebral palsy, by defining dependence between the posturographic weight-bearing distribution and center of pressure (CoP) sway during quiet standing with Gillette Gait Index and the 16 distinct gait parameters that composed the Gillette Gait Index. Forty-five children with unilateral cerebral palsy from 7–12 years of age were included in this study. A posturographic procedure and 3-dimensional instrumented gait analysis was developed. In general, across the entire tested group, the significant correlations concerned only the asymmetry of the weight bearing and a few of the distinct gait parameters that compose the Gillette Gait Index; moreover, correlation coefficients were low. The division of subjects into two clinical subgroups: children that exhibited a tendency to overload (1) and to underload (2) the affected body side, modified the results of the explored relationships. Our findings revealed that the difficulties experienced by children with hemiplegia while controlled in a standing position result from tendency to excessively or insufficiently load the affected lower limbs, and thus establishes a direct relationship with inadequate affected peak ankle DF in both stance and swing gait phases. Given the presented relationship between postural instability and deviation of the particular gait parameters in children with unilateral cerebral palsy, a follow-up study will be needed to determine the therapeutic approaches that will be most effective in promoting increased improvement in gait pattern, as well as the static and dynamic balance in standing."
https://openalex.org/W2540771181,"Natural anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs) recently discovered in cryptophyte algae are the most active rhodopsin channels known. They are of interest both because of their unique natural function of light-gated chloride conductance and because of their unprecedented efficiency of membrane hyperpolarization for optogenetic neuron silencing. Light-induced currents of ACRs have been studied in HEK cells and neurons, but light-gated channel conductance of ACRs in vitro has not been demonstrated. Here we report light-induced chloride channel activity of a purified ACR protein reconstituted in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). EPR measurements establish that the channels are inserted uniformly inside-out with their cytoplasmic surface facing the medium of the LUV suspension. We show by time-resolved flash spectroscopy that the photochemical reaction cycle of a functional purified ACR from Guillardia theta (GtACR1) in LUVs exhibits similar spectral shifts, indicating similar photocycle intermediates as GtACR1 in detergent micelles. Furthermore, the photocycle rate is dependent on electric potential generated by chloride gradients in the LUVs in the same manner as in voltage-clamped animal cells. We confirm with this system that, in contrast to cation-conducting channelrhodopsins, opening of the channel occurs prior to deprotonation of the Schiff base. However, the photointermediate transitions in the LUVs exhibit faster kinetics. The ACR-incorporated LUVs provide a purified defined system amenable to EPR, optical and vibrational spectroscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements of structural changes of ACRs with the molecules in a demonstrably functional state."
https://openalex.org/W2545865519,"Climate models render as much as they can by applying the laws of physics to imaginary boxes tens of kilometers a side. But some processes, like cloud formation, are too fine-grained for that, and so modelers use parameterizations: equations meant to approximate their effects. For years, climate scientists have tuned their parameterizations so that the model overall matches climate records. But fearing criticism by climate skeptics, they have largely kept quiet about how they tune their models, and by how much. That is now changing. By writing up tuning strategies and making them publicly available for the first time, groups hope to learn how to make their predictions more reliable—and more transparent."
https://openalex.org/W2540670596,"Older and even new antidepressants cause adverse effects, such as orthostatic hypotension, hyper- or hypoglycemia, liver injury or lipid disorders. In our previous experiments we showed significant antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities of dual 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 antagonists with α1-adrenolitic properties i.e. 1-[(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)ethoxyethyl]-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine hydrochloride (HBK-14) and 1-[(2-chloro-6-methylphenoxy)ethoxyethyl]-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine hydrochloride (HBK-15). Here, we evaluated the influence of chronic administration of HBK-14 and HBK-15 on blood pressure (non-invasive blood pressure measurement system for rodents), lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins-LDL, high density lipoproteins-HDL, triglycerides), glucose level, and liver enzymes activity (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase). We determined potential antihistaminic (isolated guinea pig ileum) and antioxidant properties (ferric reducing ability of plasma-FRAP, non-protein thiols-NPSH, stable free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl-DPPH) cytotoxicity. Our experiments revealed that HBK-14 and HBK-15 did not influence blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose level or liver enzymes activity in rats after 2-week treatment. We also showed that none of the compounds possessed antioxidant or cytotoxic properties at antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like doses. HBK-14 and HBK-15 very weakly blocked H1 receptors in guinea pig ileum. Positive results of our preliminary experiments on the safety of HBK-14 and HBK-15 encourage further studies concerning their effectiveness in the treatment of depression and/or anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2540981470,"Background Although acute bronchitis is quite common, there is relatively limited information regarding the microorganisms that are involved in this illness. Methods We performed a prospective study of acute bronchitis at 31 hospitals and clinics in Korea from July 2011 to June 2012. Sputum specimens were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of microorganisms. Results Of the 811 enrolled patients, 291 had acceptable sputum specimens that were included for analysis of the etiologic distribution. With multiplex PCR testing, viruses were identified in 36.1% (105/291), most commonly rhinovirus (25.8%) and coronavirus (3.8%). Typical bacteria were isolated in 126/291 (43.3%) patients. Among these patients Haemophilus influenzae (n = 39) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 30) were isolated most commonly; atypical bacteria were identified in 44 (15.1%) patients. Bacteria-only, virus-only, and mixed infections (bacteria plus virus) accounted for 36.7% (98/291), 17.2% (50/291), and 18.9% (55/291) of infections, respectively. In particular, 52.4% of patients with viral infection had a concurrent bacterial infection, and rhinovirus was the most common virus in mixed infections (40/55). Additionally, infections with typical bacteria were more common in patients with chronic lung disease (p = 0.029), and typical bacterial infections showed a trend towards a higher prevalence with older age (p = 0.001). Conclusions Bacteria were associated with almost half of community-acquired acute bronchitis cases. Additional studies are required to further illuminate the role of bacteria and to identify patient groups most likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2542480196,"Directed transport delivers proteins to specific cellular locations and is one mechanism by which cells establish and maintain polarized cellular architectures. The atypical cadherin Fat3 directs the polarized extension of dendrites in retinal amacrine cells by influencing the distribution of cytoskeletal regulators during retinal development, however the mechanisms regulating the distribution of Fat3 remain unclear. We report a novel Kinesin/Kif5 Interaction domain (Kif5-ID) in Fat3 that facilitates Kif5B binding, and determines the distribution of Fat3 cytosolic domain constructs in neurons and MDCK cells. The Kif5-ID sequence is conserved in the neurotrophin receptor P75NTR, which also binds Kif5B, and Kif5-ID mutations similarly result in P75NTR mislocalization. Despite these similarities, Kif5B-mediated protein transport is differentially regulated by these two cargos. For Fat3, the Kif5-ID is regulated by alternative splicing, and the timecourse of splicing suggests that the distribution of Fat3 may switch between early and later stages of retinal development. In contrast, P75NTR binding to Kif5B is enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation and thus has the potential to be dynamically regulated on a more rapid time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2543602335,"The facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis, a rare but life-threatening disease. Host cell entry begins with activation of the human receptor tyrosine kinase MET through the bacterial invasion protein InlB, which contains an internalin domain, a B-repeat, and three GW domains. The internalin domain is known to bind MET, but no interaction partner is known for the B-repeat. Adding the B-repeat to the internalin domain potentiates MET activation and is required to stimulate Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell scatter. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the B-repeat may bind a co-receptor on host cells. To test this hypothesis, we mutated residues that might be important for binding an interaction partner. We identified two adjacent residues in strand β2 of the β-grasp fold whose mutation abrogated induction of MDCK cell scatter. Biophysical analysis indicated that these mutations do not alter protein structure. We then tested these mutants in human HT-29 cells that, in contrast to the MDCK cells, were responsive to the internalin domain alone. These assays revealed a dominant negative effect, reducing the activity of a construct of the internalin domain and mutated B-repeat below that of the individual internalin domain. Phosphorylation assays of MET and its downstream targets AKT and ERK confirmed the dominant negative effect. Attempts to identify a host cell receptor for the B-repeat were not successful. We conclude that there is limited support for a co-receptor hypothesis and instead suggest that the B-repeat contributes to MET activation through low affinity homodimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2542767161,"Two research projects exploring the risks and benefits of sequencing every newborn baby's genome are now delivering early results, and both are giving pause to newborn-sequencing advocates. One suggests that exome sequencing, which reads the protein-coding regions of a genome, is not comprehensive enough to replace standard newborn blood screening for rare diseases. And the other finds that parents are surprisingly uninterested in having their newborns sequenced. A variety of reasons appear to account for the tepid response, including concerns about privacy and insurance discrimination. Together, the findings suggest newborn sequencing it not yet ready to replace existing screening programs, which rely on biochemical analysis of newborn blood spots to test for dozens of disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2543996717,"We previously reported that ethanol-containing liquid diet feeding induces osteonecrosis of the femoral head in male rats. Also, it was reported that a large amount of consumed ethanol and a long-term history of drinking were risk factors for osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and that the frequency of alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head in males was much greater than in females. The higher incidence of alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head could be due to either higher prevalence of alcohol drinking in males or due to their potential higher sensitivity to alcohol. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of alcohol consumption and drinking period on the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head in rats of both sex.All the experimental male rats were allocated to the male one-month ethanol drinking group (M1). Female rats were randomly divided into the female one- to five-months ethanol drinking groups (F1-5). All rats were fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing 5% ethanol for one to five months.One-month feeding with the ethanol-containing liquid diet resulted in the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head in seven of twenty in the M1 group, but none in the F1 group, although the mean intake of ethanol per body weight in the M1 group was significantly lower than that in the F1 group. Furthermore, long drinking periods with a large amount of ethanol intake in the F2-5 groups did not induce osteonecrosis of the femoral head.The present study shows that lower alcohol consumption over short periods of time that were sufficient to induce osteonecrosis of the femoral head in males had no effect on females. Even with greater alcohol consumption and longer duration, females did not develop osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Therefore, unknown factors related to sex must be responsible for the development of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2545885255,"Although the vermiform appendix is commonly considered a vestigial organ, adverse health consequences after an appendectomy have garnered increasing attention. In this study, we investigated the risks of gallstone occurrence during a 5-year follow-up period after an appendectomy, using a population-based dataset. We used data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. The exposed cohort included 4916 patients who underwent an appendectomy. The unexposed cohort was retrieved by randomly selecting 4916 patients matched with the exposed cohort in terms of sex, age, and year. We individually tracked each patient for a 5-year period to identify those who received a diagnosis of gallstones during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed for the analysis. During the 5-year follow-up period, the incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 4.71 for patients who had undergone an appendectomy, compared to a rate of 2.59 for patients in the unexposed cohort (p<0.001). Patients who had undergone an appendectomy were independently associated with a 1.79 (95% CI = 1.29~2.48)-fold increased risk of being diagnosed with gallstones during the 5-year follow-up period. We found that among female patients, the adjusted hazard ratio of gallstones was 2.25 (95% CI = 1.41~3.59) for patients who underwent an appendectomy compared to unexposed patients. However, for male patients, we failed to observe an increased hazard for gallstones among patients who underwent an appendectomy compared to unexposed patients. We found an increased risk of a subsequent gallstone diagnosis within 5 years after an appendectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2542536891,"The ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel pore is formed by four S6 inner helices, with its intracellular gate located at the S6 helix bundle crossing region. The cytoplasmic region of the extended S6 helix is held by the U motif of the central domain and is thought to control the opening and closing of the S6 helix bundle. However, the functional significance of the S6 cytoplasmic region in channel gating is unknown. Here we assessed the role of the S6 cytoplasmic region in the function of cardiac RyR (RyR2) via structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis. We mutated each residue in the S6 cytoplasmic region of the mouse RyR2 (4876QQEQVKEDM4884) and characterized their functional impact. We found that mutations Q4876A, V4880A, K4881A, and M4884A, located mainly on one side of the S6 helix that faces the U motif, enhanced basal channel activity and the sensitivity to Ca2+ or caffeine activation, whereas mutations Q4877A, E4878A, Q4879A, and D4883A, located largely on the opposite side of S6, suppressed channel activity. Furthermore, V4880A, a cardiac arrhythmia-associated mutation, markedly enhanced the frequency of spontaneous openings and the sensitivity to cytosolic and luminal Ca2+ activation of single RyR2 channels. V4880A also increased the propensity and reduced the threshold for arrhythmogenic spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. Collectively, our data suggest that interactions between the cytoplasmic region of S6 and the U motif of RyR2 are important for stabilizing the closed state of the channel. Mutations in the S6/U motif domain interface likely destabilize the closed state of RyR2, resulting in enhanced basal channel activity and sensitivity to activation and increased propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release and cardiac arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2542346841,"System calibration is fundamental to the overall accuracy of the ultrasonic temperature measurement, and it is basically involved in accurately measuring the path length and the system latency of the ultrasonic system. This paper proposes a method of high accuracy system calibration. By estimating the time delay between the transmitted signal and the received signal at several different temperatures, the calibration equations are constructed, and the calibrated results are determined with the use of the least squares algorithm. The formulas are deduced for calculating the calibration uncertainties, and the possible influential factors are analyzed. The experimental results in distilled water show that the calibrated path length and system latency can achieve uncertainties of 0.058 mm and 0.038 μs, respectively, and the temperature accuracy is significantly improved by using the calibrated results. The temperature error remains within ±0.04°C consistently, and the percentage error is less than 0.15%."

That is a big number, given that the Paris climate agreement commits nations to keeping the total global temperature increase to less than 2°C. If the HFC number is correct, it will make the Paris goal easier to achieve. But there's a bit more scientific uncertainty surrounding that half-degree claim than the politicians let on. And although scientists routinely acknowledge such uncertainty, that's not what politicians do, says Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in Washington, D.C. Here's a look at how the half-degree figure was born, and what it might mean for the planet."

https://openalex.org/W2542563292,"In 2006, Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz was pregnant, unexpectedly, at age 42. A genetic test of the fetal portion of the placenta showed that roughly a third of the cells carried a serious abnormality: an extra copy of chromosome 2. The University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom professor9s specialty, developmental biology, was suddenly personal. Nature could hardly have come up with a more vivid irony. Zernicka-Goetz is not only a developmental biologist; she has spent more than a decade working in mice to pinpoint when and how cells in an early embryo start to differentiate. Her child9s health depended in part on a question that had already captivated her as a scientist, she recalls: How much flexibility does the developing embryo retain? While still pregnant and uncertain about her baby9s fate, Zernicka-Goetz started mouse work that led to a paper this March revealing new details about embryos9 remarkable ability to cope with faulty cells. In May, she caught the attention of other embryologists and the wider world with another demonstration of embryos9 resilience. This time her lab showed—in concert with researchers in New York City—that human embryos created by in vitro fertilization could be kept developing in the lab for nearly 2 weeks, well past the point at which they would normally implant in the wall of the uterus. That9s almost twice as long as previously achieved, and it opens the way to studying a key phase of human development that had been inaccessible. The feat has already sparked new ethical debates about limits to embryo research. Widely accepted international guidelines dictate that human embryos should not be allowed to develop longer than 14 days in culture, but some researchers are now pushing for that limit to be reconsidered."
